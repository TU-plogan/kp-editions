                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> mathematical theory of the structure of bridges has
                    been a favourite subject with mechanical philosophers. It gives scope to some of
                    the most refined and elegant applications of science to practical utility; and,
                    at the same time that its progressive improvement exhibits an example of the
                    very slow steps by which speculation has sometimes followed execution, it
                    enables us to look forward with perfect confidence to that more desirable state
                    of human knowledge in which the calculations of the mathematician shall direct
                    the operations of the artificer with security, instead of following with
                    servility the progress of his labours.</p>
                <p>Of the origin of the art of building bridges something will be found in other
                    parts of the work (see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Arch).</hi> The subject
                    has been much discussed during the last half century, by some of the most
                    learned antiquaries and most elegant scholars; but additions still more
                    important have been made to the scientific and practical principles on which
                    that art depends; and the principal information that may here be expected will
                    be comprehended under the two heads of physicomathematical principles,
                    subservient to the theory of this department of architecture, and an historical
                    account of the works which appear to be the most deserving of notice. The first
                    head will contain three sections, relating respectively (1) to the resistance of
                    the materials employed, (2) to the equilibrium of arches, and (3) to the effects
                    of friction; the second will comprehend (4) some details of earlier history and
                    literature, (5) an account of the discussions which have taken place respecting
                    the improvement of the port of London, and (6) a description of some of the most
                    remarkable bridges which have been erected in modem times.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Resistance of
                    Materials.</hi></p>
                <p>A. <hi rend="italic">In all homogeneous solid bodies, the resistances to
                    extension and compression must be initially equal, and proportional to the
                    change of dimensions.</hi></p>
                <p>The equilibrium of the particles of any body remaining at rest depends on the
                    equality of opposite forces, varying according to certain laws; and that these
                    laws are continued without any abrupt change, when any minute alteration takes
                    place in the distance, is demonstrated by their continuing little altered by any
                    variation of dimensions, in consequence of an increase or diminution of
                    temperature, and might indeed be at once inferred as highly probable, from the
                    general principle of continuity observed in the laws of nature. We may therefore
                    always assume a change of dimensions so small, that, as in all other
                    differential calculations, the elements of the curves, of which the ordinates
                    express the forces, as functions of, or as depending on, the distances as
                    abscisses, maybe considered as not sensibly differing from right lines crossing
                    each other, if the curves be drawn on the same side of the absciss, in a point
                    corresponding to the point of rest, or to the distance affording an equilibrium;
                    so that the ele mentary finite differences of the respective pairs of ordinates,
                    which must form, with the portions of the two curves, rectilinear triangles,
                    always similar to each other, will always vary as the lengths of the elements of
                    the curves, or as the elements of the absciss, beginning at the point of rest;
                    and it is obvious that these differences will represent the actual magnitude of
                    the resistances exhibited by the substance to extension or compression. (Plate
                    CXXXII. fig. 1.) (See Explanation of Plates at the conclusion of the
                    article.)</p>
                <p>It was on the same principle that Bernoulli long ago observed, that the minute
                    oscillations of any system of bodies, whatever the laws of the forces governing
                    them might be, must ultimately be isochronous, notwithstanding any imaginable
                    variation of their comparative extent, the forces tending to bring them back to
                    the quiescent position being always proportional to the displacements; and so
                    far as the doctrine has been investigated by experiments, its general truth has
                    been amply confirmed; the slight deviations from the exact proportion which have
                    been discovered in some substances being far too unimportant to constitute an
                    exception, and merely tending to show that these substances cannot have been
                    perfectly homogeneous, in the sense here attributed to the word. When the
                    compression or extension is considerable, there may indeed be a sensible
                    deviation, especially in fibrous or stratified substances; but this irregularity
                    by no means affects the admissibility of any of the conclusions which will be
                    derived from this proposition.</p>
                <p>B. <hi rend="italic">The strength of a block or beam must be reduced to one half
                    before its cohesive and repulsive forces can both be called into
                    action.</hi></p>
                <p>We must suppose the transverse sections of the body to remain plane and
                    perpendicular to the axis, whatever the point may be to which the force is
                    applied; a supposition which will be correctly true if the pressure be made by
                    the intervention of a firm plate attached to each end, and which is perfectly
                    admissible in every other case. Now, if the terminal plates remain parallel, it
                    is obvious that the compression or extension must be uniformly distributed
                    throughout the substance, which must happen when the original force is applied
                    in the middle of the block; the centre of pressure or resistance collected by
                    the plate acting like a lever, being then coincident with the axis. But when the
                    plates are inclined, the resistance depending on the compression or extension
                    will be various in different parts, and will always be proportional to the
                    distance from the neutral point where the compression ends and the extension
                    begins, if the depth of the substance is sufficient to extend to this point;
                    consequently the forces may always be represented, like the pressure of a fluid,
                    at different depths, by the ordinates of a triangle; and their result may be
                    considered as concentrated in the centre of gravity of the triangle, or of such
                    of its portions as are contained within the depth of the substance<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193736495" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6495-0264"/>; and when both extension and
                    compression are concerned, the smaller force may be considered as a negative
                    pressure, to be subtracted from the greater, as is usual when any other compound
                    forces are supposed to act on a lever of any kind. Now when the neutral point is
                    situated in one of the surfaces of the block, the sum of all the forces is
                    represented by the area of the triangle, as it is by that of the parallelogram
                    when the plates remain parallel; and these areas being in either case equivalent
                    to the same external force, it is obvious that the perpendicular of the triangle
                    must be equal to twice the height of the parallelogram, indicating that the
                    compression or extension of the surface in the one case is twice as great as the
                    equable compression or extension in the other; and since there is always a
                    certain degree of compression or extension, which must be precisely sufficient
                    to crush or tear that part of the substance which is immediately exposed to it,
                    and since the whole substance must in general give way when any of its parts
                    fail, it follows that the strength is only half as great in the former case as
                    in the latter. And the centre of gravity of every triangle being at the distance
                    of one third of its heiglit from the base, the external force must be applied,
                    in order to produce such a compression or extension, at the distance of one
                    sixth of the depth from the axis; and when its distance is greater than this,
                    both the repulsive and cohesive forces of the substance must be called into
                    action, and the strength must be still further impaired. (Plate CXXXII. fig.
                    2.)</p>
                <p>C. <hi rend="italic">The compression or extension o f the axis of a block or beam
                    is always proportional to the force, reduced to the direction of the axis, at
                    whatever distance it may be applied.</hi></p>
                <p>We may suppose one of the inflexible plates attached to the extremities of the
                    block to be continued to the given distance, and to act as a lever held in
                    equilibrium by three forces, that is, by the cohesive and repulsive resistances
                    of the block, and the external force; and it is obvious that, as in all other
                    levers, the external force will always be equal to the difference of the other
                    two forces depending on the compression and extension, or to the mean
                    compression or extension of the whole, which must also be the immediate
                    compression or extension of the middle, since the figure representing the forces
                    is rectilinear. And the effect will be the same, whatever may be the
                    intermediate substances by which the force is impressed on the block, whether
                    continued in a straight line or otherwise. When the force is oblique, the
                    portion perpendicular to the axis will be resisted by the lateral adhesion of
                    the different strata of the block, the compression or extension being only
                    determined by the portion parallel to the axis; and when it is transverse, the
                    length of the axis will remain unaltered. But the line of direction of the
                    original force must always be continued till it meets the transverse section at
                    any point of the length, in order to determine the nature of the strain at that
                    point.</p>
                <p>D. <hi rend="italic">The distance of the neutral point from the axis of a block
                    or beam is to the depth, as the depth to twelve times the distance of the force,
                    measured in the transverse section.</hi></p>

                <p>E. <hi rend="italic">The power of a given force to crush a block is increased by

                    the distance of the point of application of the force, measured in the
                    transverse section.</hi></p>
                <p>Since the compression or extension of the axis is invariable, whatever the
                    distance of the force may be, that of the nearest surface must be as much
                    greater, by the properties of similar triangles, as the half depth, increased by
                    the distance of the neutral point, is greater than that distance itself, that

                    reduced in the same proportion as the partial compression or extension, by the

                <p>F∙ <hi rend="italic">The curvature of the neutral line of a beam at any point,

                    may be.</hi></p>
                <p>Since the distance <hi rend="italic">z</hi> of the neutral point from the axis is

                    of curvature, or the distance of the intersection of the planes of the terminal
                    plates from the neutral point, must be to the distance <hi rend="italic">z</hi>
                    as the whole length of the axis is to the alteration of that length produced by
                    the compression or extension, it follows that the radius of curvature must be
                    inversely as the distance <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> and inversely also as the
                    compression, and the curvature itself must be conjointly as the force and as the
                    distance of its application. If the direction of the force be changed, and the
                    perpendicular falling from the given point of the axis on the line of the force
                    be now called <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> the distance of the force from the axis
                    measured in the transverse section will be increased by the obliquity exactly in
                    the same ratio as its efficacy is diminished, and the curvature of the neutral
                    line will remain unaltered; although the place of that line will be a little
                    varied, until at last it coincides with the axis, when the force becomes
                    completely transverse: and the radius of curvature of the axis will always be to
                    that of the neutral line as the acquired to the original length of the axis.

                    the other, which is of a more complicated nature, keeping the angular direction
                    unaltered; and we must first calculate the variation of the angular situation of
                    the ends, in consequence of the bending of the bar by the first portion, and
                    then the strain required to obviate that change, by means of a force acting in
                    the direction of the middle of the bar, while the ends are supposed to be fixed.
                    If each half of the bar were rectilinear, these two strains would obviously be
                    equal, and would neutralize each other in the middle of the halves, which might
                    be considered as the meeting of the ends of two shorter pieces, acting
                    transversely or obliquely on each other, without any strain; the curvature
                    produced by the whole strain being elsewhere as the distance from the line
                    joining these points. But since the bar is supposed to be curved, it becomes
                    necessary to determine the place of these neutral points, by calculating the
                    change of its angular position throughout its extent.</p>

                    10,000,000 feet; and such would be the addition to the pressure at one extremity
                    of the abutment, and its diminution at the other, amounting to about five tons

                    Arches.</hi></p>
                <p>We may now proceed to inquire into the mode of determining the situation and
                    properties of the curve of equilibrium, which represents, for every part of a
                    system of bodies supporting each other, the general direction of their mutual
                    pressure; remembering always that this curve is as much an imaginary line as the
                    centre of gravity is an imaginary point, the forces being no more actually
                    collected into such a line than the whole weight or inertia of a body is
                    collected in its centre of gravity. Indeed the situation of the curve is even
                    less definite than that of the centre of gravity, since in many cases it may
                    differ a little according to the nature of the co-operation of the forces which
                    it is supposed to represent. In reality, every gravitating atom entering the
                    structure must be supported by some forces continued in some line, whether
                    regular or irregular, to the fixed points or abutments, and every resisting atom
                    partakes, in a mathematical sense, either positively or negatively in
                    transmitting a lateral pressure where it is required for supporting any part of
                    the weight; and when we attempt to represent the result of all these collateral
                    pressures by a simple curve, its situation is liable to a slight variation,
                    according to the direction in which we suppose the co-operating forces to be
                    collected. If, for instance, we wished to determine the stability of a joint
                    formed in a given direction, it would be necessary to consider the magnitude of
                    the forces acting throughout the extent of the joint in a direction
                    perpendicular to its plane, and to collect them into a single result; and it is
                    obvious that the forces represented by the various elementary curves may vary
                    very sensibly in their proportion, when we consider their joint operation on a
                    vertical or on an oblique plane; although, if the depth of the substance be
                    inconsiderable, this difference wili be wholly imperceptible, and in practice it
                    may generally be neglected without inconvenience; calculating the curve upon the
                    supposition of a series of joints in a vertical direction. If, however, we wish
                    to be very minutely accurate, we must attend to the actual direction of the
                    joints in the determination of the curve, and must consider, in the case of a
                    bridge, the whole weight of the structure terminated by a given arch-stone, with
                    the materials which it supports, as determining the direction of the curve of
                    equilibrium where it meets the given joint, instead of the weight of the
                    materials terminated by a vertical plane passing through the point of the curve
                    in question, which may sometimes be very sensibly less; this consideration being
                    as necessary for determining the circumstances under which the joints will open,
                    as for the more imaginary possibility of the arch-stones sliding upwards or
                    downwards. But we may commonly make a sufficiently accurate compensation for
                    this difference, by supposing the specific gravity of the materials producing
                    the pressure, and the curvature of the line which terminates them, to be a

                    of equilibrium, representing the general effect of the presszire transmitted
                    through them, will be of α parabolic form.</hi></p>
                <p>The pressure of the blocks where they meet will obviously be horizontal, but at
                    the other ends it will be oblique, being the result of this horizontal pressure
                    and of the whole weight of each block. And if we imagine the blocks to be
                    divided into any number of parts, by sections parallel to the ends, which is the
                    only way in which we can easily obtain a regular result, it is evident that the
                    force exerted at any of these sections by the external portions must be
                    sufficient to support the lateral thrust and the weight of the internal
                    portions; and its inclinatiori must be such that the horizontal base of the
                    triangle of forces must be to the vertical perpendicular as the lateral thrust
                    to the weight of the internal portion; or, in other words, the lateral
                    thrust-remaining constant, the weight supported will be as the tangent of the
                    inclination. But calling the horizontal absciss <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> and
                    the vertical ordinatey, d 17</p>
                <p>the tangent of the inclination will be which, in the case of a parallelopiped,
                    must be proportional to the distance <hi rend="italic">X</hi> from the

                    equation of a parabola. It is usual in such cases to consider the thrusts as
                    rectilinear throughout, and as meeting in the vertical line passing through the
                    centre of gravity of each block; but this mode of representation is evidently
                    only a convenient compendium.</p>
                <p>If the blocks were united together, in the middle, so as to form a single bar or
                    lever, the forces would be somewhat differently arranged; the upper half of the
                    bar would contain a series of elementary arches, abutting on a series of similar
                    elementary chains in the lower half, so as to take off all lateral thrust from
                    the supports at the ends.</p>
                <p>With respect to the transverse strains of levers in general, it may be observed,
                    that the most convenient way of representing them is to consider the axis of the
                    lever as composed of a series of elementary bars, bisected, and crossed at right
                    angles, by as many others extending across the lever, or rather as far as two
                    thirds of the half depth on each side, where the centre of resistance is
                    situated. The transverse force must then be transmitted unaltered throughout the
                    whole system, acting in contrary directions at the opposite ends of each of the
                    elementary bars constituting the axis; and it must be held in equilibrium, with
                    respect to each of the centres, considered as a fulcrum, by the general result
                    of all the corpuscular forces acting on the longer cross arms; that is, by the
                    difference of the compression or extension on the different sides of the arms.
                    This difference must therefore be <pb break="no" facs="nls:193736534"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-6534-0267"/>constant; and in all such cases the strain or
                    curvature must increase uniformly, and its fluxion must be constant; but if the
                    transverse force be variable, as when the lever supports its own weight, or any
                    further external pressure, the fluxion of the curvature must be proportional to
                    it. Now the transverse force, thus estimated, being the sum of the weights or
                    other forces acting on either side of the given point, the additional weight at
                    the point will be represented by the fluxion of the weight, or by the second
                    fluxion of the strain or curvature, which is ultimately as the fourth fluxion of
                    the ordinate. Also the fluxion of the strain being as the whole weight on each
                    side, it follows, that when the strain is a maximum, and its fluxion vanishes,
                    the whole weight, or the sum of the positive and negative forces on either side,
                    must also vanish; as Mr Dupin has lately demonstrated in ä different manner.</p>
                <p>Μ. <hi rend="italic">In every structure supported by abutments, the tangent of
                    the inclination of the curve of equilibrium to the horizon is proportional to
                    the weight of the parts interposed between the given point and the middle of the
                    structure.</hi></p>
                <p>The truth of this proposition depends on the equality of the horizontal thrust
                    throughout the structure, from which it may be immediately inferred, as in the
                    last proposition. The materials employed for making bridges are not uncommonly
                    such as to create a certain degree of lateral pressure on the outside of the
                    arch; but as there must be a similar and equal pressure in a contrary direction
                    against the abutment, its effects will be comprehended in the determination of
                    the point at which the curve springs from the abutment, as well as in the
                    direction of the curve itself; so that the circumstance does not afford any
                    exception to the general truth of the law. It is, however, seldom necessary to
                    include the operation of such materials in our calculations, since their lateral
                    pressure has little or no effect at the upper part of the arch, which has the
                    greatest influence on the direction of the curve; and it is also desirable to
                    avoid the unnecessary employment of these soft materials, because they tend to
                    increase the horizontal thrust, and to raise it to a greater height above the
                    foundation of the abutment.</p>

                    the elementary arc, and the effect of the obliquity of the pressure; the one
                    varying as the square of the secant, the other as the secant simply.</p>
                <p>O. <hi rend="italic">Consequently, if the curve be circular, the load must be
                    everywhere as the cube of the secant.</hi></p>
                <p>P. <hi rend="italic">If the curve of equilibrium be parabolic, the load must be
                    uniform throughout the span.</hi></p>
                <p>(Prop. L.) The uniformity of the load implies that the superior and inferior
                    terminations of the arch, commonly ’ called the extrados and intrados, should be
                    parallel; but it is not necessary that either of them should be parabolic,
                    unless we wish to keep the curve exactly in the middle of the whole structure.
                    When the height of the load is very, great in proportion to that of the arch,
                    the curve must always be ι⅛arly parabolic, because the form of the extrados has
                    but little comparative effect on the load at each point.</p>
                <p>A parabola will therefore express the general form of the curve of equilibrium in
                    die flat bands of brick or stone, commonly placed over windows and doors, which,
                    notwithstanding their external form, may very properly be denominated flat
                    arches. But if we consider the direction of the joints as perpendicular to the
                    curve, it may easily be shown, from the properties of the wedge, that they must
                    tend to a common axis, in order that the thrust may be equal throughout; and the
                    curve must be perpendicular to them, and consequently circular; but the
                    difference from the parabola will be wholly inconsiderable.</p>

                <p>If the extrados and intrados are concentric, the calculation requires us to take
                    the difference between the results determining the weight for each curve; but it
                    will commonly be equally accurate, in such a case, to consider the depth of the
                    load as uniform, at least when the joints are in the direction of the radii.</p>
                <p>X. <hi rend="italic">The abutment must be higher without than within, by a
                    distance which is to its breadth as the horizontal distance of the centre of
                    gravity of the half arch from the middle of the abutment is to the height of the
                    middle of the key-stone above the same point.</hi></p>
                <p>This proposition follows immediately from the proportion of the horizontal thrust
                    to the weight, determined by the property of the lever; the one acting at the
                    distance of the height of the arch from the fulcrum, and the other at the
                    distance of the centre of gravity from the abutment, so as to balance each
                    other; and the oblique direction of the face of the abutment being perpendicular
                    to the thrust compounded of these two forces. The same rule also serves for
                    determining the proper position of the abutment of a beam or rafter of any kind,
                    in order that it may stand securely, without the assistance of friction. But for
                    a bridge, if we calculate the situation of the curve of equilibrium, we obtain
                    the direction of the thrust at its extremity more conveniently, without
                    immediately determining the place of the centre of gravity.</p>
                <p>Y. <hi rend="italic">In order that an arch may stand without friction or
                    cohesion, a curve of equilibrium, perpendicular to all the surfaces of the
                    joints, must be capable of being draινn witldn the substance of the
                    blocks.</hi></p>
                <p>If the pressure on each joint be not exactly perpendicular to the surfaces, it
                    cannot be resisted without friction, and the parts must slide on each other;
                    this, however, is an event that can never be likely to occur in practice. But if
                    the curve, representing the general pressure on any joint, be directed to a
                    point in its plane beyond the limits of the substance, the joint will open at
                    its remoter end, unless it be secured by the cohesion of the cements, and the
                    structure will either wholly fall, or continue to stand in a new form. (Plate
                    CXXXII. fig. 5.)</p>
                <p>From this condition, together with the determination of the direction of the
                    joints already mentioned (Prop. P.), we may easily find the best arrangement of
                    the joints in a flat arch: the object, in such cases, being to diminish the
                    lateral thrust as much as possible, it is obvious that the common centre of the
                    joints must be brought as near to the arch as is compatible with the condition
                    of the circle remaining within its limits; and it may even happen that the
                    superincumbent materials would prevent the opening of the joints even if the
                    centre were still nearer than this; but if, on the other hand, the arch depended
                    only on its own resistance, and the materials were in any danger of being
                    crushed, it would be necessary to keep the circle at some little distance from
                    its surfaces, even at the expense of somewhat increasing the lateral
                    pressure.</p>
                <p>When the curve of equilibrium touches the intrados of an arch of any kind, the
                    compression at the surface must be at least four times as great as if it
                    remained in the middle of the arch-stones (Prop. E.), and still greater than
                    this if the cohesion of the cements is called into action. In this estimate we
                    suppose the transverse sections of the blocks inflexible, so as to co-operate
                    throughout the depth in resisting the pressure on any point; but in reality this
                    co-operation will be confined within much narrower limits, and the diminution of
                    strength will probably be considerably greater than is here supposed, whenever
                    the curve approaches to the intrados of the arch.</p>
                <p>The passage of the curve of equilibrium through the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193736560" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6560-0269"/>middle of each block is all
                    that is necessary to insure the stability of a bridge of modern dimensions and
                    of sound materials. Its strength is by no means increased, like that of a frame
                    of carpentry, or of a beam resisting a transverse force, by an increase of its
                    depth in preference to any other of its dimensions: a greater depth does,
                    indeed, give it a power of effectually resisting a greater force of external
                    pressure derived from the presence of any occasional load on any part of the
                    structure; but the magnitude of such a load is seldom very considerable, in
                    proportion to the weight of the bridge.</p>
                <p>It is of some importance, in these investigations, to endeavour to trace the
                    successive steps by which the fabric of a bridge may commonly be expected to
                    fail. Supposing the materials to be too soft, or the abutments insecure, or any
                    part of the work to be defective, and to afford too little resistance, the
                    length of the curve of the arch being diminished, or its chord extended, it will
                    become flatter, and consequently sink; the alteration being by far the greatest,
                    if other things are equal, where the depth is the least, that is, near the crown
                    or key-stone; so that if the curvature was at first nearly equal throughout, the
                    crown will sink so much as to cause a rapid increase of curvature on each side
                    in its immediate neighbourhood, which will bring the intrados up to the curve of
                    equilibrium, or even above it, the form of this curve being little altered by
                    the change of that of the arch. The middle remains firm, because the pressure is
                    pretty equally divided throughout the blocks; but the parts newly bent give way
                    to the unequal force, and chip a little at their internal surface; but being
                    reduced in their dimensions by the pressure, they suffer the middle to descend
                    still lower, and are consequently carried down with it, so as to be relieved
                    from the inequality of pressure depending on their curvature, and to transfer
                    the effect to the parts immediately beyond them, till these in their turn
                    crumble, and by degrees the whole structure fafls. (Plate CXXXII. fig. 6.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Effect of
                    Friction.</hi></p>
                <p>The friction or adhesion of the substances employed in architecture is of the
                    most material consequence for insuring the stability of the works constructed
                    with them, and it is right that we should know the extent of its operation. It
                    is not, however, often practically necessary to calculate its exact magnitude,
                    because it would seldom be prudent to rely materially on it, the accidental
                    circumstances of agitation or moisture tending very much to diminish its effect.
                    Nor is the cohesion of the cements employed of much farther consequence than as
                    enabling them to form a firm connection, by means of which the blocks may rest
                    more completely on each other than they could do without it; for we must always
                    remember that we must lose at least half of the strength, before the cohesion of
                    the solid blocks themselves, in the direction of the arch, can be called into
                    action, and at least three fourths before the joints will have any tendency to
                    open throughout their extent.</p>
                <p>Z. <hi rend="italic">The joints of an arch, composed of materials subject to
                    friction, may be situated in auy direction lying within the limits of the angle
                    of repose, on either side of the perpendicular to the curve of equilibrium; the
                    angle of repose being equal to the inclination to the horizon at which the
                    materials begin to slide on each other; and the direct friction being to the
                    pressure as the tangent of this angle is to the radius.</hi></p>
                <p>Ļ It is obvious, that any other force as well as that of gravity will be resisted
                    by the friction or adhesion of the surfaces when its direction is within the
                    limits of the angle at which the substances begin to slide; and it may be
                    inferred from the experiments of Mr Coulomb and Professor Vinee, that this angle
                    is constant, whatever the magnitude of the force may be, since the friction is
                    very nearly proportional to the mutual pressure of the substances. The tendency
                    of a body to descend along any plane being as much less than its weight as the
                    height of the plane is less than its length, and the pressure on the plane being
                    as much less than the weight as the length is greater than the horizontal
                    extent, it follows, that, when the weight begins to overcome the friction, the
                    friction must be to the pressure as the height of the plane to its horizontal
                    extent, or as the tangent of the inclination to the radius.</p>
                <p>This property of the angle of repose affords a very easy method of ascertaining,
                    by a simple experiment, the friction of the materials employed. Taking, for
                    example, a common brick, and placing it, with the shorter side of its end
                    downwards, on another which is gradually raised, we shall find that it will fall
                    over without beginning to slide; and when this happens, the height must be half
                    of the horizontal extent, a brick being twice as long as it is broad. In this
                    case, therefore, the friction must be at least half of the pressure, and the
                    angle of repose at least 30°; and an equilateral wedge of brick could not be
                    forced up by any steady pressure of bricks acting against its sides, in a
                    direction parallel to its base. But the effects of agitation would -make such a
                    wedge totally insecure in any practical ease; and the determination only serves
                    to assure us, that a very considerable latitude may be allowed to the joints of
                    our materials, when there is any reason for deviating from the proper direction,
                    provided that we be assured of a steady pressure; and much more in brick or
                    stone than in wood, and more in wood than in iron, unless the joints of the iron
                    be secured by some cohesive connection. It may also be inferred from these
                    considerations, that the direction of the joints can never determine the
                    direction of the curve of equilibrium crossing them, since the friction will
                    always enable them to transmit the thrust in a direction varying very
                    considerably from the perpendicular; although, with respect to any particular
                    joint, of· which we wish to ascertain the stability independent of the friction,
                    it would be desirable to collect the result of the elements of which that curve
                    is the representative, with a proper regard to its direction.</p>

                    Details.</hi></p>
                <p>The original invention of arches, and the date of their general adoption in
                    architecture, have been discussed with great animation by Mr King, Mr Dutens,
                    and several other learned antiquaries. Mr King insisted that the use of the arch
                    was not more ancient than the Christian era, and considered its introduction as
                    one of the most remarkable events accompanying that memorable period. Mr Dutens
                    appealed to the structure of the cloaeae, built by the Tarquins, and to the
                    authority of Seneca, who observes that the arch was generally considered as the
                    invention of Democritus, a philosopher who lived some centurics before the birth
                    of Christ, but that, in his opinion, the simplicity of the principle could not
                    have escaped the rudest architect; and that, long before Democritus, there must,
                    have been both bridges and doors, in both of which structures the arch was
                    commonly employed. There do indeed appear to be solitary instances of arches
                    more ancient than the epoch assigned by Mr King to their invention. We find
                    arches concealed in the walls of some of the oldest temples extant at Athens.
                    The cloacae are said to be arched, not at the opening into the Tiber only, but
                    to a greater distance within it than is likely to have been rebuilt at a later
                    period for ornament; and the fragments of a bridge, still remaining at Rome,

                    But it seems highly probable that almost all the covered ways constructed in the
                    earlier times of Greece and Rome, were either formed by lintels, like doorways,
                    or by stones overhanging each other in horizontal strata, and leaving a
                    triangular aperture, or by both of these arrangements combined, as is
                    exemplified in the entrance to the treasury of Atreus at Mycenae, where the
                    lintel has a triangular aperture over it, by which it is relieved from the
                    pressure of the wall above; and this instance serves to show how different the
                    distribution of the pressure on any part of a structure may be, from the simple
                    proportions of the height of the materials above it. Some other old buildings,
                    which have been supposed to be arched, have been found, on further examination,
                    rather to resemble domes, which may be built without centres, and may be left
                    open at the summit, the horizontal curvature producing a transverse pressure,
                    which supports the structure without an ordinary kcy-stone. And this has been
                    suspected to be the form of the roofs and ceilings of ancient Babylon, were
                    Strabo tells us that the buildings were arched over, or “camcrated,” for the
                    purpose of saving timber; and the bridge of Babylon, which must have been of
                    considerable antiquity, is expressly said, by Herodotus, to have consisted of
                    piers of stone, with a road formed of beams of wood only. ' It may however be
                    rejoined, that though a dome is not simply an arch, yet it exceeds it in
                    contrivance and mechanical complication; it generally exerts a thrust, and
                    requires either an abutment or a circular tie; and it is scarcely possible that
                    the inventor of a dome should not have been previously acquainted with the
                    construction of a common arch. Besides the term <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >camara,</hi> the Greeks had also psALis, <hi rend="smallcaps">apsis,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">tholus,</hi> the last of which was particularly appropriate
                    to circular domes; but the variety of appellations seems to prove that the thing
                    must have been perfectly familiar; and the term <hi rend="smallcaps">psalis</hi>
                    is supposed to have been applied from the appearance of the wedged arch-stones,
                    viewed in their elevation, which could not have been observable in a dome of any
                    kind.</p>
                <p>From these outlines of the origin of the art of building bridges, we may pass on
                    rapidly to the latest improvements which have been made in Great Britain and on
                    the Continent in the practice of this department of architecture. A very ample
                    detail of the most important operations that are generally required to be
                    performed in it, may be found in the numerous Reports of the ingenious Mr
                    Smeaton, published since his death by the Society of Civil Engineers in London.
                    They contain a body of information comprehending almost every case that can
                    occur to a workman in the execution of such structures; and even where they have
                    to record an accidental failure, the instruction they afford is not less
                    valuable than where the success has been more complete.</p>
                <p>Respecting the general arrangement of a bridge, and the number of arches to be
                    employed, in the case of a wide river, Mr Smeaton has expressed his approbation
                    of a few wide and flat arches, supported by good abutments, in preference to
                    more numerous piers, which unnecessarily interrupt the water-way. In a case
                    where a long series of small arches was required, he has made them so flat, and
                    the piers so slight, that a single pier would be incapable of withstanding the
                    thrust of its arch; but in order to avoid the destruction of the whole fabric in
                    case of an accident, he has intermixed a number of stronger piers, at certain
                    intervals, among the weaker ones. Where several arches of different heights were
                    required, he commonly recommended different portions of the same circle for all
                    of them; a mode which rendered the lateral thrust nearly equal throughout the
                    fabric, and had the advantage of allowing the same centre to be employed for
                    all, with some little addition at the ends to adapt it to the larger arches. He
                    records the case of Old Walton Bridge, in which the wooden superstructure had
                    sunk two feet, so as to become part of a circle 700 feet in diameter, and the
                    thrust, thus increased, had forced the piers considerably out of their original
                    situation; a striking proof that the principles of the pressure of arches must
                    not be neglected, even when frames of carpentry arc concerned.</p>
                <p>Mr Smeaton particularly describes the inconveniences arising from the old method
                    of laying the foundations of piers, which was introduced soon after the
                    Conquest, and which was particularly exemplified in the old London Bridge. The
                    masonry commenced above low-water mark, being supported on piles, which would
                    have been exposed to the destructive alternation of moisture*and dryness, with
                    the access ofair, if they had notbeen defended by other piles, forming
                    projections partly filled with stone, and denominated sterlings, which, in their
                    turn, occasionally required the support and defence of new piles surrounding
                    them, since they were not easily removed when they decayed; so that by degrees a
                    great interruption was occasioned by the breadth of the piers, thus augmented,
                    requiring, for the transmission of the water, an increase of velocity, which was
                    not only inconvenient to the navigation, but also carried away the bed of the
                    river under the arches, and immediately below the bridge, making deep pools or
                    excavations, which required from time to time to be filled up with rubble
                    stones; while the materials which had been carried away by the stream were
                    deposited a little lower down in shoals, and very much interfered with the
                    navigation of the river. From these circumstances, as well as from the effects
                    of time and decay, it happened that the repairs of the old London Bridge often
                    amounted, for many years together, to L.4000 a year, while those of Westminster
                    and Blackfriars Bridges did not cost so many hundreds. It is true, that the fall
                    produced a trifling advantage in enabling the London water-works to employ more
                    of the force of the tide in raising water for the use of the city; and this
                    right, being established as a legal privilege, long delayed the improvements
                    which might otherwise have been attempted for the benefit of the navigation of
                    the river. The interest of the proprietors of the water-works bad been valued at
                    L.125,000, and it had been estimated that L.50,000 would be required for the
                    erection of steam-engines to supply their place; while, on the other hand, from
                    thirty to forty persons, on an average, perished annually from the dangers of
                    the fall under the bridge. (Plate CXXXIII. fig. 6.)</p>
                <p>But Mr Smeaton, as well as his predecessor Mr La-belye, appears sometimes to have
                    gone into a contrary extreme, and to have been somewhat too sparing in the use
                    of piles. It is well known that the opening of Westminster Bridge was delayed
                    for two years on account of the failure of a pier, the foundation of which had
                    been partly undermined by the incautious removal of gravel from the bed of the
                    river in its immediate neighbourhood; a circumstance which would scarcely have
                    occurred if piles had been more freely employed in securing the foundation. The
                    omission, however, did not arise from want of a just estimate of the importance
                    of piles in a loose bottom, but from a confidence, founded on examination as the
                    work advanced, that the bed of the river was already sufficiently firm. Mr
                    Smeaton directed the foundations of Hexham Bridge to be laid, as those of
                    Westminster Bridge had been, by means of caissons, or boxes, made watertight,
                    and containing the bottom of the pier, completedin masonry well connected
                    together, and ready to be deposited in its proper place by lowering the
                    caissons, and then detaching the sides, which are raised for further use from
                    the bottoms, which remain fixed as a part of the foundations immediately resting
                    on the bed of the river, previous-Iy<pb break="no" facs="nls:193736586"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-6586-0271"/> made smooth for their reception, and sometimes
                    also rendered more firm by piles and a grating of timber. By a careful
                    examination of the bottom of the river at Hexham, Mr Smeaton thought he had
                    ascertained that the stratum of gravel, of which it consisted, was extremely
                    thin, and supported by a quicksand, much too loose to give a firm hold to piles,
                    while he supposed the gravel strong enough to bear the weight of the pier if
                    built in a caisson. The bridge was a handsome edifice, with elliptical arches,
                    and stood well for a few years; but an extraordinary flood occurred, which
                    caused the water to rise five feet higher above than below the bridge, and to
                    flow through it with so great a velocity as to undermine the piers, and cause
                    the bridge to divide longitudinally, and fall in against the stream; a
                    circumstance so much the more mortifying to the eminent engineer who had
                    constructed it, as it was the only one of his works that, “in a period of thirty
                    years,” had been known to fail. It was’ observed that some of the piers which
                    had been built in coffer-dams, with the assistance of some piles, withstood the
                    violence of the flood; and it is remarkable that the whole bridge has been
                    rebuilt by a provincial architect with perfect success, having stood without any
                    accident for many years.</p>
                <p>It seems, therefore, scarcely prudent to trust any very heavy bridge to a
                    foundation not secured by piles, unless the ground on which it stands is an
                    absolute rock; and in this case, as well as when piles are to be driven and
                    sawed off, it is generally necessary to have recourse to a coffer-dam. In the
                    instance of the bridge at Harraton, for example, where the rock is nine feet
                    below the bed of the river, Mr. Smeaton directs that the piles forming the
                    cotter-dam be rebated into each other, driven down to the rock, and secured by
                    internal stretchers, before the water contained within them is pumped out. In
                    some cases a double row of piles, with clay between them, has been employed for
                    forming a coffer-dam; but in others it has been found more convenient to drive
                    and cut off the piles under water, by means of proper machinery, without the
                    assistance of a coffer-dam.</p>
                <p>Piles arc employed of various lengths, from seven to sixteen feet or more, and
                    from eight to ten inches in thickness; and they are commonly shod with iron.
                    Smeaton directs them to be driven till it requires from twenty to forty strokes
                    of the pile driver to sink them an inch, according to the magnitude of the
                    weight, and the firmness required in the work. He was in the habit of frequently
                    recommending the piles surrounding the piers to be secured by throwing in rubble
                    stone, so as to form an inclined surface, sloping gradually from the bridge
                    upwards and downwards. In the case of Coldstream Bridge, it was also found
                    necessary to have a partial dam, or artificial shoal, thrown across the river a
                    little below the bridge, in order to lessen the velocity of the water, which was
                    cutting up the gravel from the base of the piles. But all these expedients are
                    attended with considerable inconvenience, and it is better to avoid them in the
                    first instance, by leaving the water-way as wide and as deep as possible, and by
                    making the foundations as firm and extensive as the circumstances may
                    require.</p>
                <p>The angles of the piers, both above and under water, are commonly rounded off, in
                    order to facilitate the passage of the stream, and to be less liable to
                    accidental injury. Mr Smeaton recommends a cylindrical surface of 60° as a
                    proper termination; and two such surfaces, meeting each other in an angle, will
                    approach to the outline of the head of a ship, which is calculated to afford the
                    least resistance to the water gliding by it.</p>
                <p>We find that, in the year 1769, the earth employed for filling up the space
                    between the walls of the North Bridge in Edinburgh had forced them out, so as to
                    require the assistance of transverse bars and buttresses for their support. In
                    the more modern bridges, these accidents are prevented by the employment of
                    longitudinal walls for filling up the haunches, with flat stones covering the
                    intervals between them, instead of the earth, or the more solid materials which
                    were formerly used, and which produced a greater pressure both on the arch and
                    on the abutments, as well as a transverse thrust against the side walls. For the
                    inclination of the road passing over this bridge, Mr Smeaton thought a slope of
                    one in twelve not too great; observing that horses cannot trot even when the
                    ascent is much more gradual than this, and that if they walk, they can draw a
                    carriage up such a road as this without difficulty; and, indeed, the bridge at
                    Newcastle appears, for a short distance, to have been much steeper. But it has
                    been more lately argued, on another occasion, that it is a great inconvenience
                    in a crowded city to have to lock the wheel of a loaded waggon; that this is
                    necessary at all times on Holborn Hill, where the slope is only one in eighteen;
                    while in frosty weather this street is absolutely impassable for such carriages;
                    and the descent of Ludgate Hill, which is only one in thirty-six, is considered
                    as much more desirable, when it is possible to construct a bridge with an
                    acclivity so gentle.</p>

                    London.</hi></p>
                <p>From the study of Mr Smeaton’s diversified labours, we proceed to take a cursory
                    view of the parliamentary inquiry respecting the improvement of the port of
                    London, which has brought forward a variety of important information, and
                    suggested a multiplicity of ingenious designs. The principal part of that which
                    relates to our present subject is contained in the Second and Third Reports from
                    the Select Committee of the House of Commons, on the improvement of the Port of
                    London; ordered to be printed 11 th July 1799, and 28th July 1800.</p>
                <p>We find in these Reports some interesting details respecting the history of the
                    old London Bridge, which appears to have been begun, not, as Hume tells us, by
                    William Rufus, who was killed in 1100, but in 1176, under Henry II., and to have
                    been completed in eighty-three years. The piles were principally of elm, and
                    remained for six centuries without material decay; although a part of the bridge
                    fell, and was rebuilt about 100 yearè after it was begun. Rochester, York, and
                    Newcastle Bridges were also built in the twelfth century, as well as the Bridge
                    of St Esprit at Avignon. About the middle of the last century the centre pier of
                    the old London Bridge was removed; the piles were drawn by a very powerful
                    screw, commonly used for lifting the wheels of the water-works; and a single
                    arch was made to occupy the place of two. In consequence of this, the fall was
                    somewhat diminished, and it was necessary partially to obstruct the channel
                    again, in order that the stream should have force enough for the water-works;
                    but it was very difficult to secure the bottom from the effects of the increased
                    velocity under the arch. Several strong beams were firmly fixed across the bed
                    of the river, but only two of them retained their situations for any length of
                    time; and the materials carried away had been deposited below the middle arch,
                    so as to form a shoal, which was only sixteen inches below the surface at low
                    water. The reports contain also much particular information respecting
                    Blackfriars Bridge, the piles for which were driven under water, and cut off
                    level with the bed of the foundations, by a machine of Mr Mylne’s invention. The
                    expense of Blackfriars Bridge, including the purchase of premises, was about
                    L.260,000; that of the building only was L.170,000. Westminster Bridge, built in
                    the beginning of the century, cost about L.400,000.</p>

                <p>The committee received an immense variety of plans and proposals for docks,
                    wharfs, and bridges; and many of these were published in the Reports, together
                    with engraved details on a very ample scale. They finally adopted three
                    resolutions respecting the rebuilding of London Bridge.</p>

                    improvement and accommodation of the port of London, that London Bridge should
                    be rebuilt upon such a construction as to permit a free passage, at all times of
                    the tide, for ships of such a tonnage, at least, as the depth of the river would
                    admit of at present between London Bridge and Blackfriars Bridge.</p>
                <p>“2. That it is the opinion of this committee that an iron bridge, having its
                    centre arch not less than sixty-five feet high in the clear, above high-water
                    mark, will answer the intended purpose, and at the least expense.</p>
                <p>“3. That it is the opinion of this committee that the most convenient situation
                    for the new bridge will be immediately above St Saviour’s Church, and upon a
                    line from thence to the Royal Exchange.”</p>
                <p>In a subsequent Report, ordered to be printed 3d June 1801, we find a plan for a
                    magnificent iron bridge of 600 feet span, which had been submitted to the
                    committee by Messrs Telford and Douglas. Mr Telford’s reputation in his
                    profession as an engineer deservedly attracted the attention of the committee;
                    but many practical difficulties having been suggested to them, they circulated a
                    number of queries relating to the proposal, among such persons of science, and
                    professional architects, as were the most likely to have afforded them
                    satisfactory information. But the results of these inquiries are not a little
                    humiliating to the admirers of abstract reasoning and of geometrical evidence;
                    and it would be difficult to find a greater discordance in the most heterodox
                    professions of faith, or in the most capricious variations of taste, than is
                    exhibited in the responses of our most celebrated professors, on almost every
                    point submitted to their consideration. It would be useless to dwell on the
                    numerous errors with which many of the answers abound; but the questions will
                    afford us a very convenient clue for directing our attention to such subjects of
                    deliberation as are really likely to occur in a multiplicity of cases; and it
                    will perhaps be possible to find such answers for all of them as will tend to
                    remove the greater number of the difficulties which have hitherto embarrassed
                    the subject.</p>
                <p>QUESTION’S RESPECTING THE CONSTRUCTION OF A CAST-IRON BRIDGE, OF A SINGLE ARC11,

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Question</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">What parts of the bridge
                    should be considered as wedges, which act on each other by gravity and pressure,
                    and what parts as weight, acting by gravity only, similar to the walls and other
                    loading, usually erected upon the arches of stone bridges? Or does the whole act
                    as one frame of iron, which can only be destroyed by crushing its
                    parts?</hi></p>
                <p>The distribution of the resistance of a bridge may be considered as in some
                    measure optional, since it may be transferred from one part of the structure to
                    another, by wedging together most firmly those parts which we wish to be most
                    materially concerned in it. But there is also a natural principle of adjustment,
                    by which the resistance has a tendency to be thrown where it can best be
                    supported; for the materials being always more or less coir pressible, a very
                    small change of form, supposed to be equal throughout the structure, will
                    relieve those parts most which are the most strained, and the accommodation will
                    be still more effectual when the parts most strained undergo the greatest change
                    of form. Thus, if the flatter ribs, seen at the upper part of the proposed
                    structure, supported any material part of its weight, they would undergo a
                    considerable longitudinal compression, and being shortened a little, would
                    naturally descend very rapidly upon the more curved, and consequently stronger
                    parts below, which would soon relieve them from the load improperly allotted to
                    them: the abutment would also give way a little, and be forced out by the
                    greater pressure at its upper part, while the lower part remained almost
                    entirely unchanged.</p>
                <p>It is, however, highly important that the work should, in the first instance, be
                    so arranged as best to fulfil the intended purposes, and especially that such
                    parts should have to support the weight as are able to do it with the least
                    expense of lateral thrust, which is the great evil to be dreaded in a work of
                    these gigantic dimensions, the materials themselves being scarcely ever crushed
                    when the arch is of a proper form, and the failure of an iron bridge, by the
                    want of ultimate resistance of its parts to a compressing force, being a thing
                    altogether out of our contemplation; and it is obvious that the greater the
                    curvature of the resting parts, the smaller will be the lateral thrust on the
                    abutments.</p>
                <p>We may therefore sufficiently answer this question, by saying that the whole
                    frame of the proposed bridge, so far as it lies in or near the longitudinal
                    direction of the arch, may occasionally co-operate in affording a partial
                    resistance if required; but that the principal part of the force ought to be
                    concentrated in the lower ribs, not far remote from the intrados.</p>
                <p>But it is by no means allowable to calculate upon a curve of equilibrium exactly
                    coinciding with the intrados; since, if this supposition were realized, we
                    should lose more than three fourths of the strength of our materials, and all
                    the stability of the joints independent of cohesion, so that the slightest
                    external force might throw the curve beyond the limits of the joint, and cause
                    it to open. Nor can we always consider the curve of equilibrium as parallel to
                    the intrados: taking, for example, the case of a bridge like Blackfriars, the
                    curve of equilibrium, passing near the middle of the arch-stones, is, and ought
                    to be, nine or ten feet above the intrados at the abutment, and only two or
                    three feet at the crown; so that the ordinates of this curve are altogether
                    different from the ordinates which have hitherto been considered by theoretical
                    writers. It may be imagined that this difference is of no great importance in
                    practice; but its amount is much greater than the difference between the
                    theoretical curves of equilibrium, determined by calculation, and the commonest
                    circular or elliptical arches.</p>
                <p>With respect to the alternative of comparing the bridge with masonry or with
                    carpentry, we may say, that the principles on which the equilibrium of bridges
                    is calculated are altogether elementary, and independent of any figurative
                    expressions of strains and mechanical purchase, which are employed in
                    considering many of the arrangements of carpentry, and which may indeed, when
                    they are accurately analysed, be resolved into forces opposed and combined in
                    the same manner as the thrusts of a bridge. It is, therefore, wholly
                    unnecessary, when we inquire into the strength of such a fabric, to distinguish
                    the thrusts of masonry from the strains of carpentry, the laws which govern them
                    being not only similar, but identical, except that a strain is commonly
                    understood as implying an exertion of cohesive force; and we have seen that a
                    cohesive force ought never to be called into action in a bridge, since it
                    implies a great and unnecessary sacrifice of the strength of the materials
                    employed. If, indeed, we wanted to cross a mere ditch, without depending<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193736612" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6612-0273"/> on the firmness
                    of the bank, we might easily find a beam of wood or a bar of iron strong enough
                    to afford a passage over it, unsupported by any abutment, because, in a
                    substance of inconsiderable length, we are sure of having more strength than we
                    require. But to assert that an iron bridge of 600 feet span “is a lever exerting
                    a vertical pressure only on the abutments,” is to pronounce a sentence from the
                    lofty tribunal of refined science, which the simplest workman must feel to be
                    erroneous. But in this instance the error is not so much in the comparison with
                    the lever, as in the inattention to the mode of fixing it; for a lever or beam
                    of the dimensions of the proposed bridge, lying loosely on its abutments, would
                    probably be at least a hundred times weaker than if it were firmly connected
                    with the abutments, as a bridge is, so as to be fixed in a determinate
                    direction. And the true reason of the utility of cast iron for building bridges
                    consists not, as has often been supposed, in its capability of being united so
                    as to act like a frame of carpentry, but in the great resistance which it seems
                    to afford to any force tending to crush it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Question</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Whether the strength of
                    the arch is affected, and in what manner, by the proposed increase of its width
                    towards the two extremities or abutments, when considered vertically and
                    horizontally. And if so, τvhat form, should the bridge gradually
                    acquire?</hi></p>
                <p>The only material advantage derived from widening the bridge at the ends,
                    consists in the firmness of the abutments; and this advantage is greatly
                    diminished by the increase of horizontal thrust which is occasioned by the
                    increase of breadth, while the curve of equilibrium is caused to deviate greatly
                    from a circular or parabolic arc, in consequence of the great inequality of the
                    load on the different parts; and there seems to be no great difficulty in
                    forming a firm connection between a narrow bridge and a wider abutment, without
                    this inconvenience. The lateral strength of the fabric, in resisting any
                    horizontal force, would be amply sufficient, without the dilatation at the ends.
                    Perhaps the form was suggested to the inventor by the recollection of the
                    partial failure of an earlier work of the same kind, which has been found to
                    deviate considerably from the vertical plane in which it was originally
                    situated; but in this instance there seems, if we judge from the engravings
                    which have been published, to have been a total deficiency of oblique braces;
                    and the abutments appear to have been somewhat less firm than could have been
                    desired, since one of them contains an arch and some warehouses, instead of
                    being composed of more solid masonry. (Plate CXXXII. fig. 9.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Question</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">In what proportions
                    should the weight be distributed from the centre to the abutments, to mahe the
                    arch uniformly strong?</hi></p>
                <p>This question is so comprehensive, that a complete answer to it would involve the
                    whole theory of bridges; and it will be necessary to limit our investigations to
                    an inquiry whether the structure, represented in the plan, is actually such as
                    to afford a uniform strength, or whether any alterations can be made in it
                    compatible with the general outlines of the proposal, to remedy any
                    imperfections which may be discoverable in the arrangement of the pressure.</p>
                <p>There is an oversight in some of the official answers to this question, from
                    quarters of the very first respectability, which requires our particular
                    attention. The weight of the different parts of the bridge has been supposed to
                    differ so materially from that which is required for producing an equilibrium in
                    a circular arch of equable curvature, that it has been thought impossible to
                    apply the principles of the theory in any manner to an arch so constituted, at
                    the same time that the structure is admitted to be tolerably well calculated to
                    stand when considered as a frame of carpentry. The truth is, that it is by no
                    means absolutely necessary, nor often perfectly practicable, that the mean curve
                    of equilibrium should agree precisely in its form with the curves limiting the
                    external surfaces of the parts bearing the pressure, especially when they are
                    sufficiently extensive to admit of considerable latitude within the limits of
                    their substance. It may happen in many cases that the curve of equilibrium is
                    much flatter in one part, and more convex in another, than the circle which
                    approaches nearest to it; and yet the distance of the two curves may be
                    inconsiderable, in comparison with the thickness of the parts capable of
                    cooperating in the resistance. The great problem, therefore, in all such cases,
                    is to determine the precise situation of the curve of equilibrium in the actual
                    state of the bridge; and when this has been done, the directions of the ribs in
                    the case of an iron bridge, and of the joints of the arch-stones in a stone
                    bridge, may be so regulated as to afford the greatest possible security; and if
                    this security <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> is not deemed sufficient, the whole
                    arrangement must be altered.</p>
                <p>Considering the effect of the dilatation at the ends in increasing the load, we
                    may estimate the depth of the materials causing the pressure at the abutments as
                    about three times as great as at the crown; the plan not being sufficiently <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> minute to afford us a more precise determination; and

                <p>Hence it appears that, at the distance of 200 feet from the middle, the curve of
                    equilibrium will rise more than three feet above its proper place, requiring a

                    considerable loss of strength, for want of a communication approaching more
                    nearly to the direction of the curve. If we chose to form the lower part of the

                    fabric; although, when the form of the curve of equilibrium has been found, its
                    radius of curvature at the summit must give at once the length of a similar load
                    equivalent to the lateral thrust; and by combining this thrust with the weight,
                    or with the direction of the curve, the oblique thrust at any part of the arch
                    may be readily found. Thus, since at the abutment <hi rend="italic">w — a + bx?

                    the weight of the half arch as fifteen to eight, and to that of the whole arch
                    as fifteen to sixteen. Now the arch is supposed to contain 6500 tons of cast
                    iron, and together with the road will amount, according to Professor Robison’s
                    estimate, to 10,100 tons; so that the lateral thrust on each abutment is 9470
                    tons; and since this is equal to the weight of 937 ’ 5 feet in length, of the
                    thickness of the crown, the load there must be about ten tons for each foot of
                    the length. Hence it appears, that although the thrust thus calculated is
                    greater than the weight of a portion of equal length with the apparent radius at
                    the crown, it is less than would be inferred from the angular direction of the
                    intrados at the abutment; the inclination of the termination of the arch being
                    24° 27', while that of the true curve of equilibrium is 28° 4'; that is, about
                    one tenth greater.</p>
                <p>As a further illustration of the utility of this mode of computation, we may take
                    the example of an arch of Blackſriars Bridge. The radius of curvature, as far as
                    four fifths of the breadth, is here fifty-six feet; and we may suppose, without
                    sensible error, the whole load to be that which would be determined by the
                    continuation of the same curve throughout the breadth. Now, the middle of the
                    arch-stones at the distance of fifty feet from the middle of the bridge, that
                    is, immediately over the termination of the abutment, is about twelve feet above
                    that termination, and at the crown about three feet above the intrados, so that
                    we have only thirty-one feet for the extreme value of <hi rend="italic">y,</hi>
                    while the whole height of the arch is forty; and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> being

                <p>Hence it appears that the greatest deviation is about thirty feet from the
                    middle, where it amounts to a little more than a foot. But if we suppose this
                    deviation divided by a partial displacement of the curve at its extremities, as
                    it would probably be in reality, even if the resistance were confined to the
                    arch-stones, it would be only about half as great in all three places; and even
                    this deviation will reduce the strength of the stones to two thirds, leaving
                    them, however, still many times stronger than can ever be necessary. The
                    participation of the whole fabric, in supporting a share of the oblique thrust,
                    might make the pressure on the arch-stones somewhat less unequal, and the
                    diminution of their strength less considerable; but it would be better that the
                    pressure should be confined almost entirely to the arch-stones, as tending less
                    to increase the horizontal thrust, which is here compressed by <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> = 436, implying the weight of so many square feet of the longitudinal
                    section of the bridge: while, if we determined it from the curvature of the
                    intrados, it would appear to be only 56α = 368.</p>
                <p>In this calculation, the oblique direction of the joints, as affecting the. load,
                    has not been considered; but its effect may be estimated by merely supposing the
                    specific gravity of the materials to be somewhat increased. Thus, since the back
                    of each arch-stone is about one eighth wider than its lower end, the weight of
                    the materials pressing on it will be about one sixteenth greater than would
                    press on it if it were of uniform thickness; and this increase will be very
                    nearly proportional to <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> the whole load at each part; so
                    that it will only affect the total magnitude of the thrust, which, instead of
                    436, must be supposed to amount to about 463. If also great accuracy were
                    required, it would be necessary to appreciate the different specific gravities
                    of the various materials constituting the load, since they are not altogether
                    homogeneous; but so minute a calculation is not necessary in order to show the
                    general distribution of the forces concerned, and the sufficiency of the
                    arrangement for answering all the purposes intended.</p>

                    will the bridge sustain, and what will be the effect of a given weight placed
                    upon any of the before-mentioned sections?</hi></p>
                <p>When a weight is placed on any part of a bridge, the curve of equilibrium must
                    change its situation more or less according to the magnitude of the weight; and
                    the tangent of its inclination must now be increased by a quantity proportional
                    to the additional pressure to be supported, which, if the weight were placed in
                    the middle of the arch, would always be equal to half of it; but when the weight
                    is placed at any other part of the arch, if we find the point where the whole
                    thrust is horizontal, the vertical pressure to be supported at each point of the
                    curve must obviously be equal to the weight of the materials interposed between
                    it and this new summit of the curve. Now, in order to find where the thrust is
                    horizontal, we must divide the arch into two such portions, that their
                    difference, acting at the end of a lever of the length of half the span, that
                    is, of the distance from the abutment, may be equivalent to the given weight,
                    acting on a lever equal to its distance from the other abutment, to which it is
                    nearest: consequently this difference must be to the weight as the distance of
                    the weight from the end to half the span; and the distance of the new summit of
                    the curve from the middle must be such, that the weight of materials intercepted
                    between it and the middle shall be to the weight as the distance of the weight
                    from the end to the whole span; and the tangent of the inclination must
                    everywhere be increased or diminished by the tangent of the angle at which the
                    lateral thrust would support the weight of this portion of the materials, except
                    immediately under the weight, where the two portions of the curve <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193736638" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6638-0275"/>will meet in a finite angle,
                    at least if we suppose the weight to be collected in a single point.</p>
                <p>If, for example, a weight of 100 tons, equal to that of about ten feet of the

                    the vertex of the curve, where the thrust is horizontal, will be removed 2∣ feet
                    towards the weight; but the radius being 937∙5 feet, the tangent of the

                    still supposed to be terminated by the abutments, and to pass through the middle
                    of the key-stone; and we have only to reduce all the ordinates in the proportion

                <p>will be 24∙72, so that the curve will be brought 2⅜ inches nearer to the
                    intrados, which, in the proposed fabric, would by no means diminish its
                    strength; while, on the opposite side, immediately under the weight, the
                    ordinate 13 — 150</p>
                <p>—- = 12∙6 will be reduced to 12∙45, and the curve rais- 375</p>
                <p>ed between six and seven inches, which is a change by no means to be neglected in
                    considering the resistances required from each part of the structure. We ought
                    also, if great accuracy were required, to determine the effect of such a weight
                    in increasing the lateral thrust, which would affect in a slight degree the
                    result of the calculation; but it would not amount, in the case proposed, to
                    more than one eightieth of the whole thrust.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that the tendency of any additional weight, placed near the middle
                    of a bridge, is to straighten the two branches of the curve of equilibrium, and
                    that, if it were supposed infinite, it would convert them into right lines;
                    provided, therefore, that such right lines could be drawn without coming too
                    near the intrados at the haunches, the bridge would be in no danger of giving
                    way, unless either the materials were crushed, or the abutments were forced out.
                    In fact, any bridge well constructed might support a load at least equal to its
                    own weight, with less loss of strength than would arise from some such errors as
                    have not very uncommonly been committed, even in works which have on the whole
                    succeeded tolerably well.</p>

                    plane?</hi></p>
                <p>If the bridge be well tied together, it maybe considered as a single mass,
                    standing on its abutments; its mean breadth being about 80 feet, and its weight
                    10,100 tons; and such a mass would require a lateral pressure at the crown of
                    the arch of about 7000 tons to overset it. Any strength of attachment to the
                    abutments would, of course, make it still firmer, and any want of connection
                    between the parts weaker; and since the actual resistance to such a force must
                    depend entirely on the strength of the oblique connection between the ribs, it
                    is not easy to define its magnitude with accuracy: but, as Professor Robison has
                    justly remarked, the strength would be increased by causing the. braces to
                    extend across the whole breadth of the half arch. The single ribs, if wholly
                    unconnected, might be overset by an inconsiderable force, since they stand in a
                    kind of tottering equilibrium; and something like this appears to have happened
                    to the bridge at Wearmouth. Dr Hutton, indeed, mentions some “diagonal iron
                    bars” in this bridge; but these were perhaps added after its first erection, to
                    obviate the “twisting,” which had become apparent, since they are neither
                    exhibited in the large plates of the bridge, nor mentioned in the specification

                    the arch to remain the same, and to spring ten feet lower, what additional
                    strength would it give the bridge? Or, making the strength the same, what saving
                    may be made in the materials? Or if, instead of a circular arch, as in the
                    plates and drawings, the bridge should be made in the form of an elliptical
                    arch, what would be the difference in effect, as to strength, duration,
                    convenience, and expenses?</hi></p>
                <p>The question seems to suppose the weight of the materials to remain unaltered,
                    and the parts of the structure that would be expanded to be made proportionally
                    lighter; which could not be exactly true, though there might be a compensation
                    in some other parts. Granting, however, the weight to be the same under both
                    circumstances, if the ordinate <hi rend="italic">y</hi> at the end be increased
                    in the proportion of sixty-four to about seventy-three, the curvature at the
                    vertex will be increased, and the lateral thrust diminished in the same ratio,
                    the 9470 tons being reduced to 8300. The additional thrust occasioned by any
                    foreign weight would also be lessened, but not the vertical displacement of the
                    curve derived from its pressure; and since the whole fabric might safely be made
                    somewhat lighter, the lightness would again diminish the strain. The very least
                    resistance that can be attributed to a square inch of the section of a block of
                    cast iron is about fifty tons, or somewhat more than 100,000 pounds. It is said,
                    indeed, that Mr William Reynolds found, by accurate experiments, that 400 tons
                    were required to crush a cube of a quarter of an inch of the kind of cast iron
                    called gunmetal, which is equivalent to 6400 tons for a square inch of the
                    section. But this result so far exceeds any thing that could be expected, either
                    from experiment or from analogy, that it would be imprudent to place much
                    reliance on it in practice; the strength attributed to the metal being
                    equivalent to the pressure of a column 2,280,000 feet in height, which would
                    compress it to about four fifths of its length, since the height of the modulus
                    of elasticity (Prop G.) is about 10,000,000 feet. The greatest cohesive force
                    that has ever been observed in iron or steel does not exceed seventy tons for a
                    square inch of the section, and the repulsive force of a homogeneous substance
                    has not been found in any other instance to be many times greater or less than
                    the cohesive. There cannot, however, be any doubt that the oblique thrust, which
                    amounts to 10,730 tons, would be sufficiently resisted by a section of 215
                    square inches, or, if we allowed a load amounting to about one third only of the
                    whole strength, by a section of 600 square inches; and since each foot of an
                    iron bar an inch square weighs three pounds, and the whole length of the arch
                    nearly a ton, the 600 square inches would require nearly as many tons to be
                    employed in the ribs affording the resistance, upon this very low estimate <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193736651" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6651-0276"/> of the strength
                    of cast iron. The doubts here expressed respecting Mr Reynolds’s results have
                    been fully justified by some hasty experiments, which have been obligingly made
                    by the son of a distinguished architect: he found that two parallelopipeds of
                    cast iron, one eighth of an inch square, and a quarter of an inch long, were
                    crushed by a force of little more than a ton. The experiments were made in <hi
                    rend="italic">a vice,</hi> and required considerable reductions for the
                    friction. The mode of calculation may deserve to be explained, on account of its
                    utility on other similar occasions. Supposing the friction to be to the pressure
                    on the screw as 1 to <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> and the pressure on the screw to
                    the actual pressure on the substance as <hi rend="italic">n</hi> to 1, calling
                    this pressure ae, the pressure on the screw will be <hi rend="italic">nx,</hi>
                    and the friction —; but this resistance will take from the gross <hi
                    rend="italic">nι</hi> ultimate pressure <hi rend="italic">f</hi> a force, which
                    is to the friction itself as the velocity of the parts sliding on each other is
                    to the velocity of the part producing the ultimate pressure, a proportion which
                    we may call <hi rend="italic">p</hi> to 1; and the force remaining will be the
                    actual pressure; that is,/ —— <hi rend="italic">= x,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    as supposed to be exerted on the iron, was four tons; the friction —, was
                    probably about '⅜, the screw not having been lately oiled; the distance of the

                <p>care, and with an improved apparatus of levers, the mean force required to crush
                    a cube of a quarter of an inch was not quite 4į tons, instead of 400.</p>
                <p>Calcareous freestone supports about a ton on a square inch, which is equal to the
                    weight of a column not quite 2000 feet in height: consequently an arch of such
                    freestone, of 2000 feet radius, would be crushed by its own weight only, without
                    any further load; and for an arch like that of a bridge, which has other
                    materials to support, 200 feet is the utmost radius that it has been thought
                    prudent to attempt; although a part of the bridge of Neuilly stands, cracked as
                    it is, with a curvature of 250 feet radius; and there is no doubt that a firm
                    structure, well arranged in the beginning, might safely be made much flatter
                    than this, if there were any necessity for it.</p>
                <p>An elliptical arch would certainly approach nearer to the form of the curve of
                    equilibrium, which would remain little altered by the change of that of the
                    arch; and the pressure might be more equably and advantageously transmitted
                    through the blocks of such an arch, than in the proposed form of the structure.
                    The duration would probably be proportional to the increased firmness of the
                    fabric, and the greater flatness at the crown might allow a wider space for the
                    passage of the masts of large ships on each side of the middle. There might be
                    some additional trouble and expense in the formation of portions of an
                    elliptical curve; but even this might be in a great measure avoided by employing
                    portions of three circles of different radii, which would scarcely be
                    distinguishable from the ellipsis itself.</p>
                <p>Those who have imagined that a circular arch must in general be “stronger than an
                    elliptical arch of the same height and span,” have not adverted to the
                    distinction between the apparent curvature of the arch, and the situation of the
                    true curve of equilibrium, which depends on the distribution of the weight of
                    the different parts of the bridge, and by no means on the form of the archstones
                    only; this form being totally insufficient to determine the true radius of
                    curvature, which is immediately connected with the lateral thrust, and with the
                    strength of the fabric.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Question</hi> VIII. <hi rend="italic">Is it necessary or
                    advisable to have a model made of the proposed bridge, or any part of it, in
                    east iron. If so, what are the objects to which the experiments should be
                    directed; to the eqιιilibration only, or to the cohesion of the several parts,
                    or to both united, as they will occur in the intended bridge?</hi></p>
                <p>Experiments on the equilibration of the arch would be easy and conclusive; on the
                    cohesion or connection of the parts, extremely uncertain. The form and
                    proportion of the joints could scarcely be imitated with sufficient accuracy;
                    and since the strength of some of .the parts concerned would vary as the
                    thickness simply, and that of others as the square or cube of the thickness, it
                    would be more difficult to argue from the strength of the model upon that of the
                    bridge, than to calculate the whole from still more elementary experiments. Some
                    such experiments ought, however, to be made on the force required to crush a
                    block of the substance employed; and the form calculated to afford the proper
                    equilibrium might be very precisely and elegantly determined, by means of the
                    method first suggested by Dr Hooke, that of substituting for the blocks, resting
                    on each other and on the abutments, as many similar pieces forming a chain, and
                    suspended at the extremities. It would, however, be important to make one
                    alteration in the common mode of performing this experiment, without which it
                    would be of little or no value; the parts corresponding to the blocks of the
                    arch should be formed of their proper thickness and length, and connected with
                    each other and with the abutments by a short joint or hinge in the middle of
                    each, allowing room for a slight degree of angular motion only; and every other
                    part of the structure should be represented in its proper form and proportion
                    and connection, that form being previously determined as nearly as possible by
                    calculation; and then, if the curve underwent no material alteration by the
                    suspension, we should be sure that the calculation was sufficiently correct; or,
                    if otherwise, the arrangement of the materials might be altered, until the
                    required curve should be obtained; and the investigation might be facilitated by
                    allowing the joints or hinges connecting the block to slide a little along their
                    surfaces, within such limits as would be allowable, without too great a
                    reduction of the powers of resistance of the blocks.</p>

                <p>The size is of little importance, and it would be unsafe to calculate the
                    strength of the bridge from any general comparison with that of the model. There

                    elementary calculation, applicable to ropes and simple levers, and by no means

                    be best directed in the middle stream, or prevented from driving to the side,
                    and striking the arch? and what would be the consequence of such a
                    stroke?</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193736664" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6664-0277"/>
                    For the direction of ships, Professor Robison’s suggestion seems the simplest
                    and best, that they might be guided by means of a small anchor, dragged along
                    the bottom of the river. The stroke of a ship might fracture the outer ribs if
                    they were too weak, but could scarcely affect the whole fabric in any material
                    degree, supposing it to be firmly secured by oblique bars, crossing from one
                    side of the abutment to the other side of the middle; and if still greater
                    firmness were wanted, the braces might cross still more obliquely, and be
                    repeated from space to space.</p>
                <p>A ship moving with a velocity of three miles in an hour, or about four feet in a
                    second, would be stopped by a force equal to her weight when she had advanced
                    three inches with a retarded motion; and the bridge could not very easily
                    withstand, at any one point, a force much greater than such a shock of a large
                    ship, if it were direct, without being dangerously strained. But we must
                    consider that a large ship could never strike the bridge with its full force,
                    and that the mast would be much more easily broken than the bridge. The inertia
                    of the parts of the bridge, and of the heavy materials laid on it, would enable
                    it to resist the'stroke of a small mass with great mechanical advantage. Thus
                    the inertia of an anvil laid on a man’s chest enables him to support a blow on
                    the anvil, which would be fatal without such an interposition, the momentum
                    communicated to the greater weight being always less than twice the momentum of
                    the smaller, and this small increase of momentum being attended by a much
                    greater decrease of energy or impetus, which is expressed by the product of the
                    mass into the square of the velocity, and which is sometimes called the
                    ascending or penetrating force, since the height of ascent or depth of
                    penetration is proportional to it when the resistance is given. And the same
                    mode of reasoning is applicable to any weight falling on the bridge, or to any
                    other cause of vibration, which is not likely to call forth in such a fabric any
                    violent exertion of the strength of the parts, or of their connections. We must
                    also remember, in appreciating the effect of a stroke of any kind on an arched
                    structure, that something of strength is always lost by too great stiffness; the
                    property of resisting velocity, which has sometimes been called resilience,
                    being generally diminished by any increase of stiffness, if the strength, with
                    respect to pressure, remains the same.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Question</hi> XI. <hi rend="italic">The weight and lateral
                    pressure of the bridge being given, can abutments be made in the proposed
                    situation for London Bridge, to resist that pressure?</hi></p>
                <p>Since this question relates entirely to the local circumstances of the banks of
                    the Thames, the persons to whom it has been referred have generally appealed to
                    the stability of St Saviour’s Church, in a neighbouring situation, as a proof of
                    the affirmative; and it does not appear that there have been any instances of a
                    failure of piles well driven, in a moderately favourable soil. Professor
                    Robison, indeed, asserts that the firmest piling will yield in time to a
                    pressure continued without interruption; but a consideration of the general
                    nature of friction and lateral adhesion, as well as the experience of ages in a
                    multitude of structures actually erected, will not allow us to adopt the
                    assertion as universally true. When, indeed, the earth is extremely soft, it
                    would be advisable to unite it into one mass for a large extent, perhaps as far
                    as 100 yards in every direction, for such a bridge as that under discussion, by
                    beams radiating from the abutments, and resting on short piles, with cross
                    pieces interspersed; since we might combine, in this manner, the effect of a
                    weight of 100,000 tons, which could scarcely ever produce a lateral adhesion of
                    less than 20,000, even if the materials were semifluid; for they would afford
                    this resistance if they were capable of standing in the form of a bank, rising
                    only one foot in five of horizontal extent, which anything short of an absolute
                    quicksand or a bog would certainly do in perfect security. The proper direction
                    of the joints of the masonry may be determined for the abutment exactly as for
                    the bridge, the tangent of the inclination being always increased in proportion
                    to the weights of the successive wedges added to the load; and the ultimate
                    inclination of the curve is that in which the piles ought to be driven, being
                    the direction of the result, composed of the lateral thrust, together with the
                    joint weight of the half bridge and the abutment.</p>

                    at present navigate that part?</hi></p>
                <p>There seems to be no great difficulty in the construction of such a centre. When
                    the bridge at Wearmouth was erected, the centre was supported by piles and

                    iron only? And if of the latter, whether of the hard white metal, or of the soft
                    gray metal, or of gun metal?</hi></p>
                <p>A bridge well built ought to require no cohesive strength of ties, as Mr Southern
                    has justly observed in his answer to the eighth question; and for repulsive
                    resistance, in the capacity of a shore, cast iron is probably much stronger than
                    wrought iron; and it has also the advantage of being less liable to rust, and of
                    expanding somewhat less by heat. But wherever any transverse strain is
                    unavoidable, wrought iron possesses some advantages, and it is generally most
                    convenient for bolts and other fastenings. The kind of iron called gun metal is
                    decidedly preferred by the most experienced judges, as combining in the greatest
                    degree the properties of hardness and toughness; the white being considered as
                    too brittle, and the gray as too soft. Dr Hutton, however, and Mr Jessop, prefer
                    the gray; and if we allow the strength of the gun metal to be at all comparable
                    to that which Mr Reynolds attributes to it, we must also acknowledge that a much
                    weaker substance would be amply sufficient for every practical purpose, and
                    might deserve to be preferred, if it were found to possess a greater degree of
                    tenacity.</p>

                    parts being connected by diagonal braces, and joined by an iron cement, or other
                    substance 7</hi></p>
                <p>Professor Robison considers it as indispensable that the frames of cast iron
                    should be ground to fit each other; and a very accurate adjustment of the
                    surface would certainly be necessary for the perfect co-operation of every part
                    of so hard a substance. Probably, indeed, any very small interstices that might
                    be left would in some measure be filled up by degrees, in consequence of the
                    oxidation of the metal, but scarcely soon enough to assist in bearing the
                    general thrust upon the first completion of the bridge. The plan of mortising
                    the frames together is by no means to be advised, as rendering it very difficult
                    to adapt the surfaces to each other throughout any considerable part of their
                    extent. They might be connected either, as in the bridge at Wearmouth, by bars
                    of wrought iron let into the slides, which might be of extremely moderate
                    dimensions, or, as in some still more modern fabrics, by <pb break="no"

                    employing cast iron only.</p>

                    connecting them together by diagonal braces, both horizontally and
                    vertically?</hi></p>
                <p>No joint can possibly be so strong as a single sound piece of the same metal; and
                    it is highly desirable that the curve of pressure should pass through very
                    substantial frames or blocks, abutting fully on each other, without any reliance
                    on lateral joints; but for the upper parts of the works, single ribs, much
                    lighter than those which form the true arch, would be sufficiently firm.</p>

                <p>Mr Reynolds has observed that a cement composed of iron borings and saline
                    substances will become extremely hard; and it is probable that this property
                    depends on the solidity which is produced by the gradual oxidation of the iron.
                    It would certainly be injurious to the strength of the fabric to interpose this
                    cement between perfectly smooth and solid surfaces, but it might be of advantage
                    to fill up with it any small interstices unavoidably left between the parts. To
                    pour melted iron into the joints would be utterly impracticable.</p>

                <p>Lead is by far too soft to be of the least use, and a saline cement would be
                    decidedly preferable.</p>

                    expensive? And if so, what are these improvements?</hi></p>
                <p>The most necessary alterations appear to be the omission of the upper and flatter
                    ribs; the greater strength and solidity of the lower, made either in the form of
                    blocks or of frames with diagonals; a curvature more nearly approaching to that
                    of the curve of equilibrium; and a greater obliquity of the cross braces.</p>
                <p>It would be necessary to wedge the whole structure very firmly together before
                    the removal of the centres; a precaution which is still more necessary for stone
                    bridges, in which a certain portion of soft mortar must inevitably be employed,
                    in order to enable the stones to bear fully on each other, and which has been
                    very properly adopted in the best modern works. In this manner we may avoid the
                    inconvenience pointed out by Professor Robison, who has remarked, that the
                    compressibility of the materials, hard as they appear, would occasion a
                    reduction of three inches in the length of the bridge,, from the effect of the
                    lateral thrust, and a consequent fall at the crown of fifteen; a result which
                    will not be found materially erroneous if the calculation be repeated from more
                    correct elements, derived from later experiments and comparisons. For obviating
                    the disadvantageous effects of such a depression, which he seems to have
                    supposed unavoidable, as well as those of a change of temperature, which must in
                    reality occur, though to a less considerable extent, Professor Robison suggested
                    the expedient of a joint to the middle of the bridge, with an intermediate
                    portion, calculated to receive the rounded ends of the opposite ribs, somewhat
                    like an interarticular cartilage; but it is impossible to devise any kind of
                    joint without limiting the pressure, during the change of form, to a very small
                    portion of the surfaces, which could not bear fully on each other throughout
                    their extent if any such liberty of motion were allowed, unless all friction
                    between them were prevented; and a similar joint would be required at the
                    abutment, where it would be still more objectionable, as extending to a wider '
                    surface.</p>
                <p>The arrangement of the joints between the portions of the ribs in one or more
                    transverse lines would be a matter of great indifference. Some have recommended
                    to break the joints, as is usual in masonry, in order to tie the parts more
                    firmly together; others to make all the joints continuous, as a safer method, on
                    account of the brittleness of the materials; but if the fabric were well put
                    together, there would be neither any want of firm connection, nor any danger of
                    breaking from irregular strains, in whatever way the joints may be disposed.</p>

                    precautions which have been already mentioned in the answer to the 11th
                    question, there would be no insuperable difficulty in making the abutments

                    Bridges.</hi></p>
                <p>The whole series of the questions which we have been considering are still fully
                    as interesting as they were at the time when they were circulated by the
                    committee of the House of Commons. The practice of building iron bridges has
                    been progressively gaining ground ever since its first introduction in 1779 by
                    Mr Abiah Darby of Colebrook Dale. Mr Wilson, indeed, who assisted Mr Burdon in
                    the erection of the bridge at Wearmouth, mentions in his answers an iron bridge
                    which has stood secure for ninety years; but it must have been on a very small
                    scale, and has not been at all generally known. Of most of the later iron
                    bridges we find a concise account in Dr Hutton’s elaborate Essay on Bridges,
                    which has been reprinted in the first volume of his valuable collection of
                    tracts; but there are some still greater edifices of this kind which still
                    remain to be completed.</p>
                <p>Mr Darby’s construction is not remarkably elegant (Plate CXXXII. fig. 8), but it
                    is by no means so objectionable as several late authors have seemed to think it.
                    The span is 100 feet six inches, the weight 178∣ tons. The curvature of the
                    exterior concentric arches which assist in supporting the roadway, though it may
                    be somewhat too great for the most favourable exertion of their resistance,
                    leaves them still abundantly strong for the purpose intended: nor is it correct
                    to say that every shore supporting a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193736690"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-6690-0279"/>pressure should be straight; for if its own weight
                    bears any considerable proportion to that which it has to support, the curvature
                    ought to be the same with that of a chain of the same weight suspending a
                    similar load in an inverted position; and the parts of the bridge in question
                    seem to differ only about as much from such a form in excess of curvature as a
                    straight line would differ from it in defect. The partial failure which
                    accidentally occurred rather bears testimony to the merits than to the demerits
                    of the bridge, as they would be estimated in any other situation; for the
                    lateral thrust, which it is generally desirable to reduce as much as possible,
                    was here actually too small; and the abutments were forced inwards by the
                    external pressure of the loose materials forming the high banks against which
                    the abutments rested.</p>
                <p>Mr Paine’s iron bridge, exhibited in London, and intended to have been erected in
                    America, was a professed imitation of a catenarian curve; it was a good specimen
                    of that ideal something which a popular reformer generally has in view; a thing
                    not ill imagined, and which might possibly succeed very well under very
                    different circumstances, but which, when closely examined, proves to be wholly
                    unfit for the immediate purpose to which the inventor intends to apply it.</p>
                <p>The bridge at Wearmouth was completed in 1796, in a great measure through the
                    exertions of Mr Burdon, both as architect and as principal proprietor of the
                    undertaking. It is remarkable for springing seventy feet above low-water mark;
                    and the arch rises thirty ŕcet, leaving a height of 100 feet in the whole for
                    the passage of ships in the middle of the stream; the span is 240. The abutments
                    are founded on a solid rock, but their own internal solidity appears to be
                    somewhat deficient. The weight of iron is 250 tons, 210 of them being of cast
                    iron, and 40 of wrought iron. (Plate CXXXIÍ. fig. 9.)</p>
                <p>A bridge was finished in the same year at Build was, near Colebrook Dale (Plate
                    CXXXII. fig. 10), under the direction of Mr Telford, 130 feet in span, weighing
                    174 tons, and rising only seventeen feet in the roadway, but furnished on each
                    side with a stronger arch, of about twice the depth, which extends to the top of
                    the railing, and assists in suspending the part of the road which is below it by
                    means of king-posts, and in supporting the part nearer the abutments by braces
                    and shores. The breadth is only eighteen feet; and the construction would not be
                    so easily applicable to a wider bridge, unless the road were divided in the
                    middle by an additional elevated arch with its king-posts, like the celebrated
                    wooden bridge at Schafhausen, which was burnt down by one of the French armies.
                    A third iron bridge was also erected in 1796, on the Parrot at Bridgewater, by
                    the Colebrook Dale Company. It consists of an elliptic arch of seventy-five feet
                    span and twenty-three feet height, and somewhat resembles the bridge at
                    Wearmouth in the mode of filling the haunches with circular rings; <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> mode not very advantageous for obtaining the greatest
                    possible resistance from the materials, and consequently throwing a little too
                    much weight on the parts of the arch which support them, although it is probable
                    that no great inconvenience has actually arisen from this cause.</p>
                <p>An attempt was also made about the same time to throw an iron bridge over the
                    river Tame in Herefordshire, but it fell to pieces as soon as the centre was
                    removed. A similar failure occurred some time afterwards in a bridge of about
                    180 feet span, which was erected on the Tees at Yarm. In 1802 or 1803 an elegant
                    iron bridge of 181 feet span and sixteen and a half of rise was erected at
                    Staines. Its general form resembled that of the bridge at Wearmouth, but the
                    mode of connection of the parts was somewhat different. In a short time after
                    its completion, it began to sink, and some of the transverse pieces broke in
                    consequence of the change of form. Upon examination it was found that one of the
                    abutments had given way; and when this was repaired and made firmer, the other
                    failed. The abutment was pushed outwards horizontally without any material
                    derangement of its form or direction; a circumstance which could not have
                    happened if its weight had been sufficiently great. But the architect seems to
                    have trusted to the firmness of the iron and the excellence of the workmanship,
                    and to have neglected the calculation of the lateral thrust, which it is of so
                    much importance to determine.</p>
                <p>Mr Rennie executed several iron bridges with success in Lincolnshire; one at
                    Boston over the Witham, of which the span is eighty-six feet, and the rise five
                    and a half only; but the abutments being well constructed, it has stood
                    securely, notwithstanding the fracture of some of the cross pieces of the
                    frames, which had been weakened by the unequal contraction of the metal in
                    cooling. At Bristol, Messrs Jessop erected two iron bridges of 100 feet span,
                    rising fifteen; each of them contains 150 tons of gray iron, and the expense of
                    each was about L.4000. The construction appears to be simple and judicious.
                    (Plate CXXXII. fig. 11.)</p>
                <p>Mr Telford has been employed in the construction of several aqueduct bridges on a
                    considerable scale. One of these was cast by Messrs Reynolds, and completed in
                    1796, near Wellington in Shropshire; it is 180 feet long, and twenty feet above
                    the water of the river, being supported on iron pillars. Another, still larger,
                    was cast by Mr Hazledine, for carrying the Ellesmere Canal over the river Dee,
                    at Pontcysylte, in the neighbourhood of Llangollen. It is supported 126 feet
                    above the surface of the river by twenty stone pillars, and is 1020 feet in
                    length, and twelve feet wide. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Aqueduct,</hi> Plate
                    XLIX.)</p>
                <p>In France, a light iron bridge for foot passengers only was thrown across the
                    Seine, opposite to the gate of the Louvre, in 1803. It is supported by stone
                    piers, which are too narrow to withstand the effect of an accident happening to
                    any part of the fabric, and leaving the lateral thrust uncompènsated; nor is
                    there any immediate reason to apprehend that inconvenience should arise from
                    this deficiency of strength, since it is highly improbable that any partial
                    failure should occur in such a situation, supposing the bridge originally well
                    constructed. (Plate CXXXIII. fig. L)</p>
                <p>But all these works have been far exceeded in extent and importance by the
                    bridges which have been built over the river Thames. The Vauxhall Bridge was
                    completed and opened in August 1816; it consists of nine arches of cast iron,
                    each of seventy-eight feet span, and between eleven and twelve feet rise. The
                    breadth of the roadway is thirty-six feet clear. The architect was Mr Walker.
                    The form of the arches considerably resembles that of Messrs Jessop’s bridges at
                    Bristol, but it is somewhat lighter and more elegant, and it has the advantage
                    of a greater solidity in the blocks supporting the principal part of the
                    pressure. (Plate CXXXΠI. fig. 3.)</p>
                <p>This advantage also characterizes very strongly the masterly design of Mr Rennie
                    shown in the structure at the bottom of Queen Street, Cheapside, opposite to
                    Guildhall, under the name of the Southwark Bridge. It exhibits an excellent
                    specimen of firmness of mutual abutment in the parts constituting the chief
                    strength of the arch, which has been shown in this essay to be so essential to
                    the security of the work, and which the architect had probably been in a great
                    measure induced to adopt from his practical experience of the comparative merits
                    of different arrangements. (Plate CXXXIII. fig. 4, 5.)</p>
                <p>An act of parliament for the erection of this bridge was <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193736703" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6703-0280"/>passed in 1811, but it was
                    not begun till 1814, the act having directed that no operations should be
                    commenced until L.300,000 out of the required L.400,000 should be raised by
                    subscription.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    Southwark Bridge was not completed at the time this article was
                    written.</p></note> The subscribers were allowed to receive ten per cent,
                    annually on their shares, and the remainder of the receipts was to accumulate
                    until it should become sufficient to pay off to the proprietors the double
                    amount of their subscriptions: after this time the bridge was to remain open
                    without any toll. The middle arch is 240 feet in span, the side arches 210 feet
                    each. The abutment is of firm masonry, connected by dowels to prevent its
                    sliding, and resting on gratings of timber supported by oblique piles. The piers
                    stand on foundations nine or ten feet below the present bed of the river, in
                    order to provide against any alterations which may hereafter take place in its
                    channel from the operation of various causes; and they are abundantly secured by
                    a flooring of timber resting on a great number of piles.</p>

                    the pier eight feet.</p>
                <p>It is evident from the inspection of this statement of the weights, that their
                    distribution is by no means capable of being accurately expressed, by any one
                    formula; but it will be amply sufficient for the determination of the thrust to
                    employ the approximation founded on the supposition of a parabolic curve (Prop.
                    T.); and if we afterwards wished to find the effect of any local deviation from
                    the assumed law of the weight, we might have recourse to the mode of calculation
                    exemplified in the answer to the fifth question. But, in fact, that answer may
                    of itself be considered as sufficient to show, that the effect of a variation of
                    a few tons from the load appropriate to each part would be wholly
                    unimportant.</p>
                <p>We must, therefore, begin by finding the weight of a portion of the arch
                    corresponding to a quarter of the span;</p>
                <p>24 and the whole angle, of which the tangent is = ∙2, being 11° 18∣', its sine is
                    ∙1961; and the angle, of which the sine is ∙09805, being 5° 37 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ', we have to compute the 337.5 1</p>
                <p>weight of θyτ,, or <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi> ^ηj1 of the angular extent,
                    beginning from the middle of the arch; and this will be 48 ⅛⅛ + 88 + 95 + (87∕θ)
                    × ∙7345 = 297 tons. Now the weight of the covering-plates, cornice, palisades,
                    roadway, and pavement, is distributed throughout the length, without sensible
                    inequality, making 879 tons, from which the part immediately above the piers
                    might be deducted; but it will be safer to retain the whole weight, especially
                    as something must be allowed for the greater extent of the upper surface of the
                    wedges. We shall therefore have for the interior quarter 297 + 439∙5 = 736∙5
                    tons, and for the exterior 1523 — 736 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 = 786∙5,
                    the difference being fifty tons; one sixth of which added to 736∙5, gives us
                    744*8 for the reduced weight, which is to the lateral thrust as the rise to the
                    half span. But for the rise we must take twenty-three feet, since the middle of
                    the blocks next to the piers is a foot more remote from the intrados than that
                    of the blocks at the crown; and the true half span, measured from the same
                    point, will be 4 × greater than that of the intrados, amounting to</p>

                <p>Hence it appears that the curve of equilibrium nowhere deviates more than about
                    two inches from the middle of the blocks, which is less than one fortieth of the
                    whole depth.</p>
                <p>The half weight of the smaller arches is probably about 1300 tons, and their
                    lateral thrust 3500; and, since the abutment weighs 11,000 tons, the foundation
                    ought to have an obliquity of <hi rend="strikethrough">1ggθθ</hi> &gt; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0r</hi> more than one in four, if it were intended to stand
                    on the piles without friction; but in reality it rises only sixty-six inches in
                    624, or nearly one in nine; so that there is an angular difference of one in
                    seven between the direction of the piles and that of the thrust, which is
                    probably a deviation of no practical importance.</p>
                <p>It remains to be inquired how far the series of masses of solid iron,
                    constituting the most essential part of the arch, is well calculated to
                    withstand the utmost changes of temperature that can possibly occur to it in the
                    severest seasons (Prop. K.) For this purpose, we may take <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    compression or extension of such a structure is to the mean change which takes
                    place in the direction of the chord, as 14*14 to 12∙52, or as 1 ’ 129 to one;
                    and if, in a long and severe frost, the temperature varied from 52° to 20°,
                    since the general dimensions would contract about <hi rend="subscript

                <p>dulus M being about 10,000,000 feet, this change would produce a resistance
                    equivalent to the weight of a column of the same substance 2258 feet high; that
                    is, to about three tons for each square inch, diminishing gradually towards the
                    middle of the blocks, and converted on the other side into an opposite
                    resistance; so that this force would be added to the general pressure below in
                    case of contraction, and above in case of extension. Now, the lateral thrust is
                    derived from a pressure equivalent to a column about 329 feet high, of materials
                    weighing 1523 tons, while the blocks themselves weigh 357; that is, to a column
                    equal in section to the blocks, and 1400 feet high; it will therefore amount to
                    about two tons on each square inch; consequently such a change of temperature as
                    has been supposed, will cause the extreme parts of the abutments to bear a
                    pressure of five tons, where, in the ordinary circumstances, they have only to
                    support two.</p>
                <p>The ingenious architect proposed to diminish this contingent inconvenience, by
                    causing the blocks to bear somewhat more strongly on the abutments at the middle
                    than at the sides, so as to allow some little latitude of elevation and
                    depression in the nature of a joint; and, no doubt, this expedient would prevent
                    the great inequality of pressure which might otherwise arise from the
                    alternations of heat and cold. But it cannot be denied that there must be some
                    waste of strength in such an arrangement, the extreme parts of the abutments,
                    and of the blocks near them, contributing very little to the general resistance;
                    and when we consider the very accurate adjustment of the equilibrium throughout
                    the whole structure, we shall be convinced that there was no necessity for any
                    thing like so great a depth of the solid blocks, especially near the abutments;
                    and that the security would have been amply sufficient if, with the same weight
                    of metal, they had been made wider in a transverse direction, preserving only
                    the form of the exterior ones on each side, if it had been thought more
                    agreeable to the eye. In carpentry, where there is often a transverse strain,
                    and where stiffness is frequently required, we generally gain immensely by
                    throwing much of the substance of our beams into the depth; but in a bridge
                    perfectly well balanced, there is no advantage whatever from depth of the
                    blocks. We only want enough to secure us against accidental errors of
                    construction, and against partial loads from extraneous weights; and it is not
                    probable that either of these causes, in such a bridge, would ever bring the
                    curve of equilibrium six inches, or even three, from its natural situation near
                    the middle of the blocks.</p>
                <p>We cannot conclude our inquiries into this subject with a more striking example
                    than by applying the principles of the theory to the magnificent edifice by the
                    same judicious and experienced architect, which now bears the triumphant
                    appellation of Waterloo Bridge; a work not less pre-eminent among the bridges of
                    all ages and countries, than the event which it will commemorate is unrivalled
                    in the annals of ancient or modern history. It consists of nine elliptical
                    arches, each of 120 feet span, and thirty-five feet rise. The piers are twenty
                    feet thick, the road twenty-eight feet wide, besides a foot pavement of seven
                    feet on each side. The arches and piers are built of large blocks of granite,
                    with short counter-arches over each pier. The haunches are filled up, as is
                    usual in the most modern bridges, by spandrels, or longitudinal walls of brick,
                    covered with flat stones, and extending over about half the span of the arch;
                    the remainder being merely covered with earth or gravel, which is also continued
                    over the stones covering the spandrels. The hollow spaces between the walls are
                    carefully closed above, and provided with outlets below, in order to secure them
                    from becoming receptacles of water, which would be injurious to the durability
                    of the structure. The mean specific gravity of the materials is such, that a
                    cubic yard of the granite weighs exactly two tons, of the brick work one ton,
                    and of the earth a ton and an eighth. Hence the weight of the whole may be
                    obtained from the annexed statement. (Plate CXXXIV. fig. 1, 2, 3.)</p>

                <p>From this statement, and from a consideration of the arrangement of the
                    materials, exhibited in the plate, we may infer that the half arch, terminated
                    where the middle line of the arch-stones enters the pier, is equivalent in
                    weight to about 34,000 cubic feet of granite; its inner half containing in round
                    numbers 13,000, and its outer 21,000, whence we have 14,333 for the reduced
                    weight of the quarter arch (Prop. T.) The extreme ordinate will be about
                    twenty-one feet; the middle of the blocks being somewhat more than sixteen feet
                    above the springing of the arch, and the key-stone being four feet six inches
                    deep; consequently the horizontal thrust will be express-f*∏</p>

                <p>The old London Bridge, which for more than 600 years had been exposed to the
                    corrosive power of the atmosphere in the upper part of its structure, and the
                    continual action of a rapid current in the lower, had for several years been
                    reckoned insecure. Accidents, attended with loss of life and the destruction of
                    property, were frequent, in consequence of the great velocity with which barges
                    and smaller craft were carried by the stream through its arches, and of their
                    descent, by means of a considerable fall, from one level to another. At length,
                    in 1823, an act of parliament was obtained for rebuilding the bridge and
                    improving and making suitable approaches to it. The act directed that the new
                    bridge should be erected according to a plan of the late John Rennie, justly
                    celebrated for his consummate skill in his profession. He, however, having died
                    before any thing had been done to carry his views into effect, the execution was
                    intrusted to his son, now Sir John Rennie, and the building contracted for by
                    Messrs Joliff'e and Banks.</p>
                <p>The new bridge, consisting of five elliptical arches, was originally intended to
                    be on the site of the old one, and its elevation was to correspond with the
                    level of the ancient approaches. The corporation of London, however, changed
                    this part of the plan, and determined that it should be built 180 feet farther
                    up the river, by which the steep ascent of Fish Street Hill would be avoided;
                    but this advantage was counterbalanced by a heavy expense for the approaches.
                    The whole expense of the bridge, with its approaches, may cost about
                    L.2,000,000; and of this sum L.200,000 was to be contributed by the
                    government.</p>
                <p>The building was begun by driving the first pile of a coffer-dam for the south
                    pier on the 15th of March 1824. The bed of the river at the site of the bridge
                    is about thirty feet deep at low water of spring-tides, and the current being at
                    all times extremely rapid, the coffer-dams in which the piers were to be built,
                    required to be constructed with more than ordinary strength to keep out the
                    water. Their general form was elliptical; three rows of piles dressed in the
                    joints, and shod with iron, many of them eighty or ninety feet long, were driven
                    into the ground, and, after being firmly bolted together, were puddled with
                    clay; wooden stays or props were then introduced between the different rows of
                    piers, and the whole interior space strongly truss-framed in a diagonal manner,
                    and the longitudinal beams firmly strapped together, forming at the joints
                    abutments for the braces. Stairs were also formed for descending into the
                    coffer-dam, and pumps fixed to raise the water arising from springs or leakage.
                    The first coffer-dam was completed on the 27 th of April 1825, and the first
                    stone of the bridge was laid on the 15th of June, with all due ceremony. The
                    foundations of the piers are of wood. Piles of beech were first driven in the
                    interior of the coffer-dam to a depth of nearly twenty feet into the stiff blue
                    clay which forms the natural bed of the river; two rows of horizontal sleepers,
                    about twelve inches square, were then laid on the head of these piles, and
                    covered with beech planking six inches thick, and on this floor the lowermost
                    course of masonry was laid.</p>
                <p>The obstruction which the navigation of the river suffered by the works of the
                    new bridge made it expedient to throw two of the small arches of the old bridge
                    at each end into one. This was effected with great skill, and in the short space
                    of about six weeks.</p>
                <p>The flatness of an elliptical arch produces a greater load on the centring which
                    supports the arch while building, than in the erection of semicircular arches;
                    and for this reason the new bridge required centres of more than ordinary
                    strength. The principle of construction adopted was that of the diagonal truss.
                    Each centre was composed of ten frames or ribs, which were supported at the two
                    ends on piles driven into the bed of the river. On the top, these frames were
                    boarded over with stout planks placed within two or three inches of each other.
                    The arches being unequally wide, four sets of centres were used; and although
                    each consisted of nearly 800 tons of timber, it was erected in about ten days.
                    The first arch was keyed in on the 4th of August 1827; and so much progress had
                    been made in the other arches, that the last was keyed in on the 10th November
                    1828. Conformably to the improved modern practice of building bridges, instead
                    of filling up the spandrels of the arches with loose rubble-work, longitudinal
                    or hance-walls, as they arc called, have been built over the arches. On the top
                    of these large blocks of stone are bedded, and surmounted by heavy stone
                    landings, on which is laid a course of tarras or cement, and above that the
                    roadway. The approach from the city side is brought to the level of the bridge,
                    or nearly so, by a series of land arches in continuation of the bridge, and more
                    particularly by one over Tooley Street on the Surrey side, and another over
                    Thames Street on the city side. This arch is a very flat ellipse; it extends
                    over both the roadway and foot paths. The centre on which it was turned was
                    almost entirely supported on struts and uprights, placed so as to range with the
                    lines of the foot paths; and thus a free space was left for carriages and foot
                    passengers while the arch was building.</p>
                <p>The only deviation in the principal part of the bridge from the original plan
                    consisted in an addition of six feet to the width of the roadway, and of two
                    feet to the height of the abutment arches. The first of these was considered to
                    be of such importance, that the expense, L.42,000, was defrayed out of the
                    public purse.</p>
                <p>The bridge was completed on the last day of July 1831, the whole time occupied in
                    its erection having been seven years, five months, and seventeen days.</p>
                <p>The bridge, as has been already stated, consists of five elliptical arches, the
                    least of which is larger than any stone arch of this description ever before
                    erected. The centre arch is 152 feet span, with a rise of twenty-nine feet six
                    inches above high-water mark. The two arches next the centre are 140 feet span,
                    with twenty-seven feet six inches of rise; and the two abutment arches are 130
                    feet span, rising twenty-four feet six inches. The piers are of a rectangular
                    form, and perfectly solid. The great diminution in the quantity of masonry by
                    the semielliptical form of the arch has admitted of the piers being reduced in
                    thickness below the ordinary proportions. The bases of the piers are of a
                    circular cone-topped form; they harmonize with the waving line of the water, and
                    prevent the impression of tameness which might have resulted from the plainness
                    and rectangular shape of the shafts. A simple modillion cornice, supported on
                    dentils formed of solid beams of granite, runs along the upper part of the
                    bridge, and marks externally the line of roadway. This is surmounted by a close
                    parapet, in perfect keeping with <pb break="no" facs="nls:193736742"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-6742-0283"/>the simplicity of the whole structure. The line of
                    roadway, or upper surface of the bridge, is a segment of a very large circle,
                    the rise being only one in 132. The abutments are each seventy-three feet wide
                    at the base, and they spread out backward, so as to sustain the thrust of the
                    bridge with the best effect.</p>
                <p>The length of the bridge from the extremities of the abutments is 982 feet, and
                    within the abutments 728 feet; the roadway is fifty-three feet between the
                    parapets, being eight feet wider than the old bridge, and eleven feet wider than
                    any other bridge on the Thames. Of this width, the footways occupy nine feet
                    each, and the carriageway thirty-five feet. The whole bridge, including the dry
                    arches over Thames and Tooley Streets, is constructed of the finest granite,
                    selected from the quarries of Aberdeen, Heytor, and Penryn. The remaining arches
                    over which the approaches pass are of brick. The total quantity of stone
                    employed was about 120,000 tons. Magnificent candelabra of brass support the gas
                    lamps, and the ends of the parapet are finished with four immense blocks of
                    granite. The building expense of the bridge amounts at present to L.506,000; the
                    remainder of the whole expense has been incurred by the approaches. A side view
                    of the bridge is exhibited in Plate CXXXIII. fig. 7, and a plan of the roadway
                    in fig. 8.</p>
                <p>A few years ago the elliptical arches of Blackfriars and Waterloo Bridges were
                    considered as the largest ever erected; but the centre arch of the one is less
                    by one half, and that of the other by one fourth, than the centre arch of the
                    new London Bridge. Plate CXXXIII. fig. 2, will give a distinct notion of their
                    relative magnitudes, in which AA represents the curve of the Blackfriars arch,
                    BB that of the Waterloo, and CC that of the new London Bridge, stretching out
                    far above and beyond the others.</p>
                <p>Dunkeld Bridge, which crosses the Tay, was completed in the year 1809, after a
                    design of Mr Telford; and, by competent judges, is regarded as one of his
                    happiest efforts. It consists of five large and two small arches. The figure of
                    the arch is a segment of a circle. This is the form which Mr Telford seems to
                    have adopted for all his bridges. Some may be of opinion that it is less elegant
                    than the semi-ellipse; but looking at Dunkeld Bridge, we hesitate to pronounce
                    an absolute opinion.</p>

                <p>The Dean Bridge, Edinburgh, is remarkable on account of its situation, its
                    magnitude, the style of its elevation, 'the peculiarities of the details of its
                    construction, and the practical advantages of those peculiarities as proved by
                    the complete success which has attended the execution of the design.</p>
                <p>This edifice is situated at the north-west extremity of the city of Edinburgh,
                    and crosses the deep ravine formed by the stream called the Water of Leith, a
                    little above St Bernard’s Well. This ravine had previously been found an
                    effectual barrier to the extension of the New Town in the north-western
                    direction, and presented an obstacle to the improvement of the high northern or
                    Queensferry Road, which could only be surmounted by a spacious bridge.</p>
                <p>The length of the Dean Bridge is 447 feet, and the width between the parapets
                    thirty-nine feet, consisting of a carriageway twenty-three feet wide between the
                    curbstones, and two footpaths, each eight feet wide. The height of the roadway
                    above the bed of the river is 106 feet.</p>
                <p>The style of the elevation is unprecedented, and demands our particular
                    attention.</p>
                <p>A lofty bridge forming a commodious roadway across a deep ravine, will, from the
                    nature of its romantic situation, and its evident utility, excite our
                    admiration, notwithstanding that, when examined as a work of art, solely upon
                    its own merits, and when our minds are divested of the fulness of gratification
                    derived from the surrounding scenery, we frequently find its architectural
                    details and outline devoid of taste, and deservedly the object of our
                    disapprobation.</p>
                <p>Upon examining, strictly upon their own merits as architectural productions, even
                    the grandest viaducts and aqueducts hitherto constructed of masonry only, it
                    will, we venture to say, be generally felt, either that the pillars have a heavy
                    and clumsy appearance, or that the great mass of masonry being uppermost, the
                    superstructure appears too massive, on account of the unusual altitude at which
                    it is supported; and we are of opinion that the expansive mass of dead flat
                    masonry presented by the spandrels over the pillars, and between the adjacent
                    arches, is the principal cause of the anomaly, especially when semicircular
                    arches, on many accounts to be preferred in such situations, are adopted.</p>
                <p>This observation is in some measure applicable to all descriptions of stone
                    bridges. To large bridges over rivers, of which the springers, and consequently
                    the mass of the spandrels, do not require to be elevated far above the surface
                    of the water, the objection has less weight; but even in this case the
                    difficulty has been generally felt, as is proved by the incessant endeavours of
                    engineers to form new designs for carrying up the masonry over the piers, so as
                    to give relief to the face of the spandrel walls. The ordinary devices for this
                    purpose, if applied to a lofty bridge or viaduct, would be attended with many
                    practical objections, and would fail of producing the desired effect.</p>
                <p>It therefore remained a desideratum to devise a method by which the masonry
                    composing the body of a bridge, to be supported upon lofty pillars, may have its
                    exterior elevation or outline relieved, so as to break the flatness of the
                    spandrel walls, thereby giving lightness and elegance to the superstructure; and
                    it was essential to the perfect fulfilment of this object to produce the desired
                    effect by some bold stroke of extension upon the general plan, not by the aid of
                    minor superficial ornaments, now generally discarded, particularly from bridges
                    whose magnitude alone insures grandeur, and purity of design the most effective
                    beauty.</p>
                <p>With the aid of Plate CXXXV. the following description will convey an accurate
                    idea of the design of the Dean Bridge, which maybe regarded as consisting of
                    these parts, viz. the main body of the bridge supporting the carriageway, and
                    the wing-arches on each side supporting the footpaths.</p>
                <p>The main body of the bridge consists of four arches, segments of circles, each
                    ninety feet span and thirty feet rise; consequently the radius of curvature of
                    the arch is forty-eight feet nine inches. The width across the soffit is
                    thirty-one feet. These main arches are supported upon hollow pillars, hereafter
                    more particularly described, eleven feet thick and thirty-one feet wide,
                    agreeably to the soffit of the arch. The arch springers are set at the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193736755" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6755-0284"/> height of
                    sixty-seven feet above the level of the bed of the stream flowing underneath the
                    second arch from the south. The depth of the arch-stones of these main arches is
                    three feet, being one thirtieth of the span. Over the pillars, and between the
                    adjacent arches, the spandrels are built up solid to the height of twelve feet
                    above the arch springers. The remainder of the spandrels is left hollow, with
                    the exception of the longitudinal spandrel walls, four feet apart, and one foot
                    six inches thick, which being corbelled at the top, and covered with flag
                    pavement stones, support the bridge roadway. The exterior spandrel walls are two
                    feet six inches thick, faced with close-jointed ashlar.</p>
                <p>The wing-arches supporting the footpaths constitute the peculiar characteristic
                    of the Dean Bridge, springing from pilasters brought up from the foundation, and
                    executed at the same time with the main pillars, five feet wide in front, and
                    projecting six feet from the body of the pillars.. These pilasters are continued
                    up the face of the spandrels of the main arches to the height of seventeen feet
                    four inches above the level of the lower arch springers, at which height the
                    springers for the upper arches are laid. The upper or wing-arches extend over
                    the main arches. There are therefore four on each side of the bridge, each
                    ninety-six feet span, and sixteen feet eight inches rise; consequently the
                    radius of curvature is seventy-seven feet five inches; the width across the
                    soffit is eight feet two inches, of which five feet project in front of the face
                    of the spandrels of the lower arches, the remainder, three feet two inches,
                    being bonded into the main body of the bridge. The depth of the arch-stones is
                    two feet six inches, or about one thirty-eighth part of the span. The face of
                    the outer spandrels of the upper arches is one foot within the face of the main
                    pilasters, allowing an intake of six inches upon the face of the upper arch
                    springers, and the remaining six inches for the projection of a pilaster up the
                    spandrels, in order to relieve, as far as practicable, the flatness of this part
                    of the work.</p>
                <p>The upper arches, by a bold projection of five feet, effectually break up and
                    relieve the extensive surface of dead masonry that would otherwise be presented
                    by the spandrels of the ninety feet arches, which being elevated upon lofty
                    pillars, would, when viewed from the walks by St Bernard’s Well, along the banks
                    of the rivulet, present a mass of flatness and uniformity detractive from the
                    general gratification which the height and magnitude of the edifice, and the
                    beauty of the surrounding scenery, would nevertheless insensibly create.</p>
                <p>The upper arches of the Dean Bridge forming in a measure a secondary member of
                    the edifice, their spandrels may with propriety be further relieved with
                    ornamental sculpture, which, though generally excluded from modern bridges,
                    would in this case be rendered appropriate by the circumstance of the close
                    vicinity of the bridge to the most splendid buildings of the New Town of
                    Edinburgh. However, the general purity of the design renders it doubtful whether
                    or not such embellishment would be conducive to the perfection of the work, and
                    may be regarded as doubtful.</p>
                <p>The cornice consists of a frieze course and cordon, together two feet six inches
                    in height. The parapet consists of a base, dado, and coping, together four feet
                    in height above the footpath pavement. The profile of the cornice and parapet
                    will be best understood by reference to Plate CXXXV. It will be observed that
                    the members are very few, bold, and easily executed; the effect thus produced
                    upon the elevation is particularly striking; and smaller members at such an
                    elevation would fail of producing any effect.</p>
                <p>We shall now consider the peculiarities and practical advantages of the details
                    of the construction of the Dean Bridge.</p>
                <p>The pillars which support the main arches or body of the bridge are eleven feet
                    thick, but not of solid masonry, there being four voids in the shaft of each
                    pillar, of which the dimensions and construction will be clearly understood from
                    Plate CXXXV. fig. 1 and 2. The side walls are three feet thick, and the interior
                    cross walls which connect them two feet, all of squared ashlar, laid in uniform
                    courses throughout; the interior stones being of the same height as the face
                    stones, and as fully and truly squared upon the bed. In these three-feet walls
                    every alternate course consists entirely of headers, three feet on the bed, and
                    the intermediate courses are of stretchers laid in pairs, each about one foot
                    five and a half inches on the bed, the space of about one inch being left for
                    the longitudinal joint, to allow room for forcing down stiff mortar with a
                    wooden sword, it being found that this method of grouting the vertical joint
                    with stiff mortar makes more solid work than would be effected by laying the
                    stones nearly close, and pouring in thin grout, which gradually dries up and
                    leaves the joint void.</p>
                <p>Many practical advantages attend the construction of hollow pillars. That part
                    only of the masonry is omitted which, if the pillar were solid, would tend in
                    the least degree to its effective stability, and, consequently, being almost a
                    useless mass, would do more harm than good, by operating as a pernicious load
                    upon the foundations. Also, by this method, the bed of every stone throughout
                    the work is exposed to view, which insures perfect workmanship in the setting,
                    on which the strength of masonry mainly depends. Moreover, the great proportion
                    of materials,' labour, and workmanship thus saved is an important
                    consideration.</p>
                <p>In the dressing of ashlar required to carry a heavy load, as that for the pillars
                    of a bridge, especial pains must be taken that the stones be as full at the back
                    as at the front; for it is here of importance to observe that workmen,
                    especially piece-workmen, find it much to their advantage to infringe upon this
                    fundamental rule in good masonry. By working the stone lean on the back, they
                    can slap away more freely and do more work than if truth to the square be
                    insisted on; and, moreover, when the stone comes to be laid, the inequality of
                    pressure will produce a fine joint without any trouble on the part of the
                    setter. To this vicious practice of working ashlar lean on the bed, the skirping
                    of the face-work and bulging of the walls may generally be attributed; and it is
                    principally owing to its having been specified that drafts be put along the
                    backs of the beds of the ashlar, and the stone kept full, that the great
                    pressure on the three-feet walls of the pillars of the Dean Bridge has produced
                    no skirps or cracks in any part of the work.</p>
                <p>It remains to be explained by what method the upper arches were executed, so as
                    to allow of their subsiding freely upon the centres being struck, without
                    receiving any obstruction from the lower spandrels; for it is evident, that had
                    the centres of the main arches been struck and the spandrels completed close up
                    to the soffit of the upper arches, the upper arches would, upon their centres
                    being subsequently struck, have been subject to unequal depression; the interior
                    three feet two inches of the soffit being hard upon the lower spandrel walls,
                    and the projecting five feet left to subside freely by its own weight, which
                    unequal bearing would infallibly have disturbed the whole superstructure. And it
                    is equally evident that the lower and upper arches, being dissimilar, would not
                    subside equally, and therefore could not be struck at the same time dependent on
                    each other. The course, therefore, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193736768"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-6768-0285"/>pursued in the case of the Dean Bridge, was to
                    strike the centres of the lower arches as soon as the arch-stones were laid, and
                    immediately to proceed with the turning of the upper arches and the striking of
                    their centres, previous to the completion of the lower spandrels. This was a
                    most delicate operation, and we believe it to have been unprecedented; for the
                    pilasters or pillars of the upper arches being only five feet wide, it follows
                    that the four upper arches of ninety-six feet span each were supported solely
                    upon their pillars of five feet thick, being only one nineteenth of the span of
                    the arch. To accomplish this, it was evidently necessary that all the four
                    arches should be struck as gradually and as equally as possible, and which was
                    done with great care, never allowing the slack blocks to be driven farther at
                    one time than sufficient to let down the centre a quarter of an inch. It was
                    found that these upper arches subsided very nearly equally and gradually during
                    the course of a month, by which time they attained permanent stability, and the
                    total depression amounted to about four and a half inches each at the crown. The
                    lower arches subsided about three inches each at the crown. In constructing the
                    centres a subsidence of three inches was calculated upon for the lower arches,
                    and six inches for the upper arches, and so much additional rise given to the
                    centres accordingly, over and above what was intended for the arches when
                    complete.</p>
                <p>After having allowed the upper arches freely to attain their position of
                    permanent stability, a considerable portion of their spandrel walling was built,
                    and the centring removed, and the masonry of the lower spandrels made good up to
                    their soffits. In completing the exterior spandrels of the upper arches, which
                    are only eighteen inches thick, they were connected with the interior spandrels
                    by means of dovetailed bond-stones, which, at the same time that they gave
                    stability and stiffness to the walls, effectually tied them to the interior
                    work, rendering the wings and the main body of the bridge a nerfectly connected
                    mass.</p>
                <p>In all extensive edifices composed of heavy materials, it is of primary
                    consequence to the stability of the work that good arrangements be made whereby
                    every stone may be laid with ease and expedition, by means of cranes or other
                    mechanical contrivances. This point cannot be too forcibly insisted upon; for
                    whatever pains maybe taken in preparing the materials, it will frequently be
                    found, upon setting the stones, that the bed of lime is either too full or too
                    lean, or that the stone is in some respects unsuitable, and ought to be raised.
                    If, therefore, it can be raised with ease and expedition, it is done at once,
                    and the fault rectified; but if the arrangements for setting be imperfect, the
                    uniformity of the bed of lime is disturbed before the stone is properly seated
                    in its place, and glaring imperfections will be submitted to rather than incur
                    the labour and loss of time consequent to its reparation. The success which has
                    attended the execution of the Dean Bridge, and the expedition with which the
                    work was carried on, are in a great measure attributable to the judicious manner
                    in which the cranes, machinery, and scaffolding were constructed.</p>
                <p>The Dean Bridge was commenced in October 1829, and completed, with the exception
                    of the parapet, in December 1831. It is gratifying to all concerned, that not a
                    single accident occasioning loss of life or limb occurred during the progress of
                    the work.</p>
