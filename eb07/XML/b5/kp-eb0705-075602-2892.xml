                    George Gordon,</hi> the only son of Captain Byron, and Catharine, sole child and
                    heiress of George Gordon, Esq. of Gight, in Scotland, was born on the 22d
                    January 1788, in Holies Street, London. His father, a man of dissolute and
                    extravagant habits, died in 1791, at Valenciennes, leaving his widow, who was
                    then residing at Aberdeen, to support herself and her son on a pittance of L.135
                    per annum. In 1794 his cousin, the grandson of the fifth Lord Byron, died in
                    Corsica, and he became the presumptive heir to the peerage. The fifth Lord Byron
                    died in 1798, and he succeeded to tho title; and in the autumn of that year
                    removed with his mother from Aberdeen to Newstead Abbey, in Nottinghamshire,
                    which since the reign of Henry VIII. had been in the possession of the ancient
                    family of Byron. Lord Byron had received the first rudiments of education at a
                    grammar-school in Aberdeen. He was next sent in 1799 to the school of Dr Glennie
                    at Dulwich, and in 1801 to Harrow, which he quitted in 1805. He is described by
                    the head master of the latter school, the Rev. Dr Drury, as sensitive in
                    disposition, intractable except by gentle means, shy, defectively educated, and
                    ill prepared for a public school; but exhibiting the germs of considerable
                    talent, though it does not appear to have been then foreseen in what mode his
                    talents would display themselves. He excelled in declamation; and oratory,
                    rather than poetry, was thought to be the prevailing bent of his genius. He
                    seems to have been an active and spirited boy, at first unpopular, but finally a
                    favourite; ardent in his school friendships, and jealous of the attachment of
                    those whom he preferred. Among these the most learned were Lords Clare and
                    Delawarr, the Duke of Dorset, Mr Harness, and Mr Wingfield. He was on friendly
                    but less intimate terms with the most distinguished of his school-fellows,· the
                    present Sir Robert Peel. In classical scholarship Lord Byron acknowledged
                    himself very inferior to Peel; but he was thought superior to him and to most
                    others in general information. This was indeed extensive to a very unusual
                    degree; and he has left on record an almost incredible list of works, in many
                    various departments of literature, which he had read before the age of
                    fifteen.</p>
                <p>In October 1805 he was removed to Trinity College, Cambridge. He slighted the
                    university, neglected its studies, and rebelled against its authority. Meanwhile
                    he had commenced his poetical career, but at first feebly and with faint promise
                    of future excellence. He first attempted poetry as early as 1800, under the
                    inspiration of a boyish attachment to his young cousin, a daughter of Admiral
                    Parker. In November 1806 he caused to be printed by Ridge, a bookseller at
                    Norwich, for private circulation, a small volume of poems, among which one,
                    written at the age of fifteen, is remarkable as containing a presage of his
                    future fame. Some of the poems in this collection were of too licentious a
                    character; and, on the advice of Mr Becker, a gentleman to whom the first copy
                    had been presented, it was with praiseworthy promptitude suppressed, and
                    replaced by a purified edition. In 1807 appeared his first published work, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Hours of Idleness;</hi> a collection of poems little worthy of
                    his talent, and chiefly remembered through the castigation which it received
                    from the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review.</hi> To this critique, which galled
                    but did not depress him, we owe the first spirited outbreak of his talent, the
                    satire entitled <hi rend="italic">English Hards and Scotch Reviewers,</hi> which
                    was published in March 1809. The length of this poem was increased, and many
                    changes made in it, during its progress through the press. Censures of
                    individuals were turned into praises, and praises into censures, with all the
                    fickleness and precipitance of his age and character. It contained many harsh
                    judgments, of which he afterwards repented; and able and vigorous as the satire
                    was, and creditable to his talents, the time soon arrived when he was laudably
                    anxious to suppress it. A few days previous to the publication of this <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193742905" xml:id="kp-eb0705-2905-0757"/> satire, on the
                    17th of March 1809, he took his seat in the House of Lords. He seems on that
                    occasion to have keenly felt the loncliness of his position. He was almost
                    unknown to society at large; there was no peer to introduce him; and his
                    mortification led him to receive with ungracious coldness the welcome of the
                    lord chancellor. His unfriended situation inspired him with disgust, and chilled
                    his incipient longing for parliamentary distinction; and even a few days after
                    taking his seat he retired to Newstead Abbey, and engaged with his friend Mr
                    (now Sir J. C.) Hobhouse to travel together on the Continent. About the end of
                    June the friends sailed together from Falmouth to Lisbon; travelled through part
                    of Portugal and the south of Spain to Gibraltar; sailed thence to Malta and
                    afterwards to Albania, in which country they landed on the 29th of September.
                    From this time till the middle of the spring 1811, Lord Byron was engaged in
                    visiting many parts of Greece, Turkey, and Asia Minor; staying long at Athens,
                    Constantinople, and Smyrna. He touched again, on his return, at Malta, quitted
                    it on the 2d of June, and early in July, after two years absence, landed in
                    England. His affairs during this period had fallen into disorder, and it became
                    advisable to sell either Roehdale or Newstead. The latter he was then most
                    anxious to retain, and professed that it was his “only tie” to England, “and if
                    he parted with that, he should remain abroad.” In a letter to a friend, written
                    during his homeward voyage, he thus expresses his melaneholy sense of his
                    condition: “Embarrassed in my private affairs, indifferent to public,— solitary
                    without the wish to be social,—with a body a little enfeebled by a succession of
                    fevers, but a spirit I trust yet unbroken,—I am returning home without a hope,
                    and almost without a desire.” This gloom was still deepened by numerous
                    afflictions. His mother died on the 1st of August, without his having seen her
                    again since his return to England; and he was deprived by death of five other
                    relatives and friends between that and the end of August. “In the short space of
                    one month,” he says, “I have lost her who gave me being, and most of those who
                    made that being tolerable.” Amongst the latter were Wingfield, and Matthews, the
                    brother of the author of the <hi rend="italic">Diary of an Invalid.</hi> At this
                    period of distress he was approaching unsuspectingly a remarkable epoch of his
                    fame. He had composed while abroad two poems very different in character, and
                    which he regarded with strangely misplaced feelings; the one called <hi
                    rend="italic">Hints from Horace,</hi> a weak imitation of his former satire; the
                    other the first two cantos of <hi rend="italic">Childe Harold.</hi> The former
                    he intended to publish immediately; but the latter he thought of so dispargingly
                    (owing probably to the injudicious comments of the single friend who had
                    .hitherto seen it), that it might probably have never become known to the public
                    but for the wise advice of Mr Dallas. In compliance with the request of that
                    gentleman, he withheld the <hi rend="italic">Hints from Horace,</hi> which would
                    have been injurious rather than beneficial to his fame, and allowed <hi
                    rend="italic">Childe Harold</hi> to be offered for publication. He received from
                    his publisher, Mr Murray, L.600 for the copyright, which he gave to Mr Dallas.
                    The publication was long delayed; for though placed in the publisher’s hands in
                    August, it did not appear till the beginning of March 1812. It, however,
                    received during this interval considerable improvements; and the fears of the
                    author were allayed by the approbation of Mr Gifford, the translator of Juvenal,
                    and then editor of the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review.</hi> The success of
                    the poem exceeded even the anticipation of this able critic; and Lord Byron
                    emerged at once from a state of loncliness and neglect, unusual for one in his
                    sphere of life, to be the magnet and idol of society. As he tersely says in his
                    memoranda, “I awoke one morning and found myself famous.” A few days before the
                    publication of <hi rend="italic">Childe Harold,</hi> he attracted attention, but
                    in a minor degree, by his first speech in the House of Lords on the subject of
                    the house-breaking bill. He opposed it, and with ability; and his first
                    oratorical effort was much commended by Sheridan, Sir F. Burdett, and Lords
                    Grenville and Holland. He had prepared himself, by having committed the whole of
                    this speech to writing. It was well received, and he was extremely gratified by
                    its success. He might perhaps have beenincited by the praises it received to
                    seek political distinction; but the greater success which attended his poem
                    turned his ambitious feelings into a different channel. He nevertheless spoke
                    again about six weeks afterwards, on a motion of Lord Donoughmore, in favour of
                    the claims of the Roman Catholics, but less successfully than before. Less
                    clearness was displayed in the matter of his speech, and his delivery was
                    considered as theatrical. In the autumn of this year he wrote an address at the
                    request of the Drury-lane Committee, to be spoken at the re-opening of the
                    theatre; and not long afterwards he became a member of that committee. The same
                    autumn he engaged to sell Newstead for L. 140,000, of which L.60,000 was to
                    remain in mortgage on the estate for three years; but this purchase was never
                    completed. In May 1813 appeared his <hi rend="italic">Giaour,</hi> a wildly
                    poetical fragment, of which the story was founded on an event that had occurred
                    at Athens while he was there, and in which lie was personally concerned. It was
                    written rapidly, and with such additions during the course of printing as to be
                    more than trebled in length, and swelled from about four hundred lines to
                    upwards of fourteen hundred. On the 2d of June in this year he spoke for the
                    last time in the House of Lords, on presenting a petition from Major Cartwright.
                    He had now apparently ceased to regard parliamentary distinction as a primary
                    object of ambition.</p>
                <p>In his journal of November 1813 is the following entry: “I have declined
                    presenting the debtors’ petition, being sick of parliamentary mummeries. I have
                    spoken thrice, but I doubt ray ever becoming an orator; my first was liked, my
                    second and third, 1 don’t know whether they succeeded or not; I have never set
                    to it <hi rend="italic">con</hi><hi rend="italic">amore.”</hi> In November he
                    had finished the <hi rend="italic">Bride of Abydos</hi> (written in a week), and
                    it was published the following month. The <hi rend="italic">Corsair,</hi> a poem
                    of still higher merit and popularity, appeared in less than three months
                    afterwards: it was written in the astonishingly short space of ten days. During
                    the year 1813 he appears to have first entertained a serious intention of
                    marriage, and became a suitor to Miss Millbanke, only daughter and heiress of
                    Sir Ralph Millbanke. His first proposal was rejected; but the parties continued
                    on the footing of friendship, and maintained a correspondence, of which, and of
                    that lady, he thus speaks, and it may be presumed with the most perfect
                    sincerity, in his private journal: “Yesterday a very pretty letter from
                    Annabella, which I answered. What an odd situation and friendship is ours!
                    without one spark of love on either side, and produced by circumstances which in
                    general lead to coldness on one side, and aversion on the other. She is a very
                    superior woman, and very little spoiled, which is strange in an heiress—a girl
                    of twenty—a peeress that is to be in her own right—an only child, and a <hi
                    rend="italic">savante,</hi> who has always had her own way. She is a poetess, a
                    mathematician, a metaphysician, and yet withal very kind, generous, and gentle,
                    with very little pretension: any other head would be turned with half her
                    acquisitions and a tenth of her advantages.” In September 1814 he made a second
                    proposal by letter, which was accepted; and on the 2d of January 1815 he was
                    married to Miss Millbanke, at Seaham, the country seat of her father. The only
                    issue<pb break="no" facs="nls:193742918" xml:id="kp-eb0705-2918-0758"/> of this
                    marriage, Augusta Ada, was born on the 10th of December of that year. We cannot
                    lift the veil of their domestic life; we can only state the unfortunate results.
                    On the 15th of January 1816, Lady Byron left London for Kirkby Mallory, the
                    residence of her parents, whither Lord Byron was to follow her. She had, with
                    the concurrence of some of Lord Byron’s relatives, previously consulted Dr
                    Baillie respecting the supposed insanity of her husband, and by the advice of
                    that gentleman had written to him in a kind and soothing tone. Lady Byron’s
                    impressions of the insanity of Lord Byron were soon removed, but were followed
                    by a resolution on her part to obtain a separation. Conformably with this
                    resolution, Sir Ralph Millbanke wrote to Lord Byron on the 2d of February,
                    proposing such a measure. This proposal Lord Byron at first rejected, but
                    afterwards consented to sign a deed to that effect. Dr Lushington, the legal
                    adviser of Lady Byron, has stated in a published letter, that he “considered
                    reconciliation impossible.” Of the circumstances which led to such an event, and
                    on which Dr Lushington founded such an opinion, the public is at present
                    uninformed. We are therefore, in absence of full and satisfactory evidence,
                    bound to suspend our judgment on the merits of this melancholy case, and dismiss
                    it with the foregoing statement of the leading facts. In the course of the
                    spring he published the <hi rend="italic">Siege of Corinth</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Parisina.</hi> He also wrote two copies of verses, which appeared
                    in the public papers, <hi rend="italic">Pare thee well,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">A Sketch from Private Life</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> of which
                    his separation from his wife, and the instrumentality which he imputes to an
                    humble individual in conducing to that separation, were the themes. This private
                    circumstance had become the subject of general comment. The majority of those
                    who filled the circles in which Lord Byron had lately lived declared against
                    him, and society withdrew its countenance. Lord Byron, deeply stung by its
                    verdict, hastily resolved to leave the country; and on the 25th of April 1816 he
                    quitted England for the last time. His course was through Flanders and along the
                    Rhine to Switzerland, where, at a villa called Deodati, in the neighbourhood of
                    Geneva, he resided during the summer. From thence he made two excursions, one in
                    the central part of Switzerland, in company with Mr Hobhouse, and another
                    shorter excursion with a celebrated poetical compeer Mr Shelley, with whom he
                    became acquainted soon after his arrival at Geneva. He remained in Switzerland
                    till October, during which time he had composed some of his most powerful works;
                    the third canto of <hi rend="italic">Childe Harold,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prisoner of</hi><hi rend="italic">Chillon,</hi><hi rend="italic">Darkness,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">Dream,</hi> part of <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> and a
                    few minor poems. In October he quitted Switzerland in company With Mr Hobhouse,
                    and proceeded by Milan and Verona to Venice. Here he resided from the middle of
                    November 1816 to the middle of April 1817. During this period his principal
                    literary occupation was the completion of <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> of
                    which he re-wrote the third act. He visited Rome for about a month in the
                    spring, and then returned to Venice, at which city, or at La Mira, in its
                    immediate vicinity, he resided almost uninterruptedly from this time till 1816.
                    He wrote during this period the <hi rend="italic">Lament of Tasso,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Beppo,</hi> the fourth canto of <hi rend="italic">Childe Harold,
                    Marino Faliero,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Foscari, Mazeppa,</hi> and part of
                    <hi rend="italic">Don Juan.</hi> The licentious character of his life while at
                    Venice corresponded but too well with the tone of that production. His able
                    biographer and friend Mr Moore, after adverting to his <hi rend="italic"
                    >liaison</hi> with a married Italian woman, says: “Highly censurable in point of
                    morality and decorum as was his course of life while under the roof of Madame *
                    * it was (with pain I am forced to confess) venial in comparison with the
                    strange headlong career of license to which, when weaned from that connection,
                    he so unrestrainedly, and, itmay be added, defyingly, abandoned himself.” This
                    course of unbridled libertinism received its first check from the growth of
                    attachment which, as it was still unhallowed, not even the good which it may
                    seem to have done in the substitution of a purer sentiment, will enable us to
                    regard with satisfaction. In April 1819 he first became acquainted with the
                    Countess Guiccioli, the young and newly-married wife of an elderly Italian
                    nobleman. A mutual attachment, which appears to have commenced on the part of
                    the lady, soon arose between Lord Byron and the Countess Guiccioli. Their
                    passion was augmented by occasional separation, the interest excited by her
                    severe illness during one of their forced absences, and theimprudent
                    complaisance of the husband in leaving them much in the society of each other.
                    They long lived together in a half-permitted state of intimacy, the lady
                    appearing with the consent of her husband to share his protection with that of
                    Lord Byron. But this equivocal position soon terminated in the separation of the
                    Count and Countess Guiccioli. The lady then went to reside with her father; and
                    under his sanction, during the next three or four years, she and Lord Byron
                    enjoyed the intimate possession of each other’s society. In December 1819 Lord
                    Byron quitted Venice for Ravenna, where he remained till the end of October
                    1821. During this period he wrote part of <hi rend="italic">Don Juan,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Prophecy of Dante,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sardanapalus,</hi> a
                    translation of the first canto of <hi rend="italic">Pulci</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">s Mor-gante Maggiore,</hi> and the
                    mysteries, <hi rend="italic">Heaven and Earth,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cain;</hi> the latter of which may be justly considered as among the most
                    faulty in principle, and powerful in execution, of the productions of his
                    genius. He also wrote a letter on Mr Bowles’s strictures on Pope, dated 7th
                    February 1821, in which he defends the poet against his commentator; and an
                    answer to an article in Blackwood’s Magazine, entitled “Remarks on Don Juan,”
                    but this was never published.</p>
                <p>During this period an insurrectionary spirit broke out in Italy; the Carbonari
                    appeared; and secret societies began to be formed. The brother of the Countess
                    Guiccioli, Count Pietro Gamba, .espoused the cause of the insurgents, and
                    through his means Lord Byron became implicated in the proceedings of that party.
                    In his private journal of 16th February 1821, Lord Byron complains of the
                    conduct of that gentleman and others, in sending to his house, without apprising
                    him, arms with which he had a short time previously furnished them at their
                    request, and thereby endangering his safety, and exposing him to the vengeance
                    of the government, which had lately issued a severe ordinance against all
                    persons having arms concealed. In July 1821, the father and brother of Madame
                    Guiccioli were ordered to quit Ravenna, and repaired with that lady, first to
                    Florence, and afterwards to Pisa, where they were joined in October by Lord
                    Byron. He remained at Pisa till September 1822, Madame Guiccioli still living
                    with him under the sanction of her father, who, in consequence of one of the
                    conditions of her separation from her husband, was always to reside with her
                    under the same roof. While here he lost his illegitimate daughter Allegra, and
                    his friend Shelley, who was drowned in July 1822 in the Bay of Spezia. The body
                    was burned, and Lord Byron assisted at this singular rite. His principal
                    associates during this time had been the Gambas, Shelley, Captain Medwyn, and Mr
                    Trelawney. He had also become associated with the brothers John and Leigh Hunt,
                    in a periodical paper called the <hi rend="italic">Liberab</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> a</hi> transaction certainly disinterested, inasmuch as it does
                    not appear that he expected either profit or fame to accrue to himself from the
                    undertaking; and beseems to have allowed his name to be connected with it from a
                    desire to serve the Hunts, of whom Leigh Hunt, with his wife and family, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193742931" xml:id="kp-eb0705-2931-0759"/>received an asylum
                    in his house. An affray with a serjeant-major at Pisa rendered his residence in
                    that city less agreeable; and his removal from it was at length determined by an
                    order from the Tuscan government to the Gambas to quit the territory.
                    Accordingly, in September 1822, he removed with them to Genoa. While at Pisa he
                    had written, besides his contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Liberal,
                    Werner,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Deformed Transformed,</hi> and the remainder
                    of <hi rend="italic">Don Juan.</hi></p>
                <p>In April 1823 he commenced a correspondence with the Greek committee, through
                    Messrs Blaquiere and Bowring, and began to interest himself warmly in the cause
                    of the Greeks. In May he decided to go to Greece; and in July he sailed from
                    Genoa in an English brig, taking with him Count Gamba, Mr Trelawney, Dr Burns,
                    an Italian physician, and eight domestics; five horses, arms, ammunition, and
                    medicine. The money which he had raised for this expedition was 50,000 crowns;
                    10,000 in specie, and the rest in bills of exchange. In August he arrived at
                    Argostoli, the chief port of Cephalonia, in which island he established his
                    residence till the end of December. His first feelings of exaggerated enthusiasm
                    appear to have been soon cooled. Even as early as October he uses, in letters to
                    Madame Guiccioli, such expressions as, “I was a fool to come here ;” and, “of
                    the Greeks I can’t say much good hitherto; and I do not like to speak ill of
                    them, though they do of one another.” During the latter part of this year we
                    find him endeavouring to compose the dissensions of the Greeks among themselves,
                    and assisting them with a loan of L.4000. About the end of December 1823 he
                    sailed from Argostoli in a Greek mistico and after narrowly escaping capture by
                    a Turkish frigate, landed on the 5th of January 1824 at Missolonghi. His
                    reception here was enthusiastic. The whole population came out to welcome him;
                    salutes were fired; and he was met and conducted into the town by Prince
                    Mavrocor-dato, and all the troops and dignitaries of the place. But the
                    disorganization which reigned in this town soon depressed his spirits, which had
                    been raised by this reception, and filled his mind with reasonable misgivings of
                    the success of the Greek cause. Nevertheless his resolution did not seem to
                    fail, nor did he relax in his devotion to that cause, and in his efforts to
                    advance it. About the end of January 1824 he received his commission from the
                    Greek government as commander of the expedition against Lepanto, with full
                    powers both civil and military. He was to be assisted by a military council,
                    with Bozzari at its head. Great difficulties attended the arrangement of this
                    expedition, arising principally from the dissensions and jealousies of the
                    native leaders, and the mutinous spirit of the Suliote troops; with which
                    latter, on the 14th of February, Lord Byron came to a rupture, in consequence of
                    their demand, that about a third part of their number should be raised from
                    common soldiers to the rank of officers. Lord Byron was firm, and they submitted
                    on the following day. Difficulties in the civil department harassed him at the
                    same time, aggravated by a difference of opinion between himself and Colonel
                    Stanhope, on the subject of a free press, which the latter was anxious to
                    introduce, and for which, on the other hand, Lord Byron considered that Greece
                    was not yet ripe. On the 15th of February, the day of the professed submission
                    of the Suliotes, he was seized with a convulsive fit, and for many days was
                    seriously ill. W hile he was on a sick bed, the mutinous Suliotes burst into his
                    room, demanding what they called their rights; and though his firmness then
                    controlled them, it soon afterwards became necessary to get rid of these lawless
                    soldiers, by the bribe of a month’s pay in advance,—and with their dismissal
                    vanished the hopes of the expedition against Lepanto. After this he turned his
                    mind chiefly to the fortification of Missolonghi, the formation of a brigade,
                    and the composition of the differences among the Greek chieftains. Since his
                    attack in February he had never been entirely well. Early in April he caught a
                    severe cold through exposure to rain. His fever increased, and in consequence of
                    his prejudice against bleeding, that remedy was delayed till it was too late to
                    be effectual. On the 17th (the second day after he had been bled) appearances of
                    inflammation in the brain presented themselves. The following day he became
                    insensible, and about twenty-four hours afterwards, at a quarter past six in the
                    evening of the 19th of April 1824, Lord Byron breathed his last. Public honours
                    were decreed to his memory by the authorities of Greece, where his loss was
                    deeply lamented. The body was conveyed to England, and on the 16th of July was
                    deposited in the family vault, in the parish church of Hucknell, near Newstead,
                    in the county of Notts. By his will, dated 29th July 1815, Lord Byron bequeathed
                    to his half-sister, Mrs Leigh, during her life, and after her death to her
                    children, the monies arising from the sale of all such property, real and
                    personal, as was not settled upon Lady Byron and his issue by her. The executors
                    were Mr Hobhouse, and Mr Hanson, Lord Byron’s solicitor.</p>
                <p>The personal appearance of Lord Byron was prepossessing. His height was five feet
                    eight and a half inches; his head small; his complexion pale; hair dark brown
                    and curly; forehead high; features regular and good, and somewhat Grecian; eyes
                    light grey, but capable of much expression. He was lame in the right foot,
                    owing, it was said, to an accident at his birth; which circumstance seems always
                    to have been to him a source of deep mortification, little warranted by its real
                    importance. It did not prevent him from being active in his habits, and
                    excelling in various manly exercises. He was a very good swimmer; successfully
                    crossed the Hellespont in emulation of Leander; swam across the Tagus, a still
                    greater feat; and, greatest of all, at Venice in 1818, from Lido to the opposite
                    end of the grand canal, having been four hours and twenty minutes in the water
                    without touching ground. In his younger days he was fond of sparring; and
                    pistol-shooting, in which he excelled, was his favourite diversion while in
                    Italy. In riding, for which he professed fondness, he did not equally excel. He
                    was nervous both on horseback and in a carriage, though his conduct in Greece,
                    and at other timfes, proved his unquestionable courage on great occasions. He
                    had always a fondness for animals, and seemed to have preferred those which were
                    of a ferocious kind. A bear, a wolf, and sundry bull-dogs, were at various times
                    among his pets. The habits of his youth, after the period of boyhood, were not
                    literary and intellectual; nor were his amusements of a refined or poetical
                    character. He was always shy, and fond of solitude; but when in society, lively
                    and animated, gentle, playful,and attractive in manner; and he possessed the
                    power of quickly conciliating the friendship of those with whom he associated.
                    He was very susceptible of attachment to women. The objects of his strongest
                    passions appear to have been Miss Chaworth, afterwards Mrs Musters, and the
                    Countess Guiccioli. His amours were numerous, and there was in his character a
                    too evident ρroneness to libertinism. His constitution does not seem ever to
                    have been strong, and his health was probably impaired by his modes of life. He
                    was abstemious in eating, sometimes touching neither meat nor fish. Sometimes
                    also he abstained entirely from wine or spirits, which at other times he drank
                    to excess, seldom preserving a wholesome moderation and regularity of system.
                    His temper was irascible, yet placable. He was quickly alive to tender and
                    generous emotions, and performed many acts of disinterested liberality, even
                    towards<pb break="no" facs="nls:193742944" xml:id="kp-eb0705-2944-0760"/> those
                    whom he could not esteem, and in spite of parsimonious feelings, which latterly
                    gained hold upon him. He was a man of a morbid acuteness of feeling, arising
                    partly from original temperament, and partly from circumstances and habits. He
                    had been ill educated; he had been severely tried; his early attachments, and
                    his first literary efforts, had equally been unfortunate; he had encountered the
                    extremes of neglect and admiration; pecuniary distresses, domestic afflictions,
                    and the unnerving tendency of dissipated habits, had all conspired to aggravate
                    the waywardness of his excitable disposition. It is evident that, in spite of
                    his assumed indifference, he was always keenly alive to the applause and censure
                    of the world; and its capricious treatment of him more than ordinarily
                    encouraged that vanity and egotism which were conspicuous traits of his
                    character.</p>
                <p>The religious opinions of Lord Byron appear, by his own account of them, to have
                    been “unfixed but he expressly disclaimed being one of those infidels who deny
                    the Scriptures,and wish to remain “in unbelief.” In politics he was liberal, but
                    his opinions were much influenced by his feelings; and, though professedly a
                    lover of free institutions, he could not withhold his admiration even from
                    tyranny when his imagination was wrought upon by its grandeur. He would not view
                    Napoleon as the enslaver of France; he viewed him only as the most extraordinary
                    being of his age, and he sincerely deplored his fall.</p>
                <p>Lord Byron’s prose compositions were so inconsiderable that they may almost be
                    overlooked in the view of his literary character. His letters nevertheless must
                    not pass wholly unnoticed. Careless as they are, and hastily written, they are
                    among the most lively, spirited, and pointed specimens of epistolary writing in
                    our language, and would alone suffice to indicate the possession of superior
                    talent. The critical theories of Lord Byron were remarkably at variance with his
                    practice. The most brilliant supporter of a new school of poetry, he was the
                    professed admirer of a school that was superseded. The most powerful and
                    original poet of the nineteenth century, he was a timid critic of the
                    eighteenth. In theory he preferred polish to originality or vigour. He evidently
                    thought Pope the first of our poets; he defended the unities; praised Shakspeare
                    grudgingly; saw little merit in Spencer; preferred his own <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hints from Horace</hi> to his <hi rend="italic">Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage
                    ì</hi> and assigned his eminent contemporaries Coleridge and Wordsworth a place
                    far inferior to that which public opinion has more justly accorded to them.</p>
                <p>The poetry of Lord Byron produced an immediate effect unparalleled in our
                    literary annals. Of this influence much may be attributed, not only to the real
                    power of his poetry, but also to the impressive identification of its principal
                    characteristics with that which, whether truly or falsely, the world chose to
                    regard as the character of the author. He seemed to have unbosomed himself to
                    the public, and admitted them to view the full intensity of feelings which had
                    never before been poured forth with such eloquent directness. His poems were as
                    tales of the confessional, portraitures of real passion, not tamely feigned, but
                    fresh and glowing from the breast of the writer. The emotions which he excelled
                    in displaying were those of the most stormy character,—hate, scorn, rage,
                    despair, indomitable pride, and he dark spirit of misanthropy. It was a narrow
                    circle, but in that he stood without a rival.</p>
                <p>His descriptive powers were eminently great. His works abound in splendid
                    examples; among which the Venetian night-scene from Lioni’s balcony, Terni, the
                    Coliseum viewed by moonlight, and the shipwreck in Don Juan, will probably rise
                    foremost in the memories of many readers. In description he was never too
                    minute. He selected happily, and sketched freely, rapidly, and boldly. He seized
                    the most salient images, and brought them directly and forcibly to the cye at
                    once. There was, however, in his descriptive talent, the same absence of
                    versatility and variety which characterized other departments of his genius. His
                    writings do not reflect nature in all its infinite change of climate, scenery,
                    and season. He portrayed with surpassing truth and force only such objects as
                    were adapted to the sombre colouring of his pencil. The mountain, the cataract,
                    the glacier, the ruin,— objects inspiring awe and melancholy,—seemed more
                    congenial to his poetical disposition than those which led to joy or
                    gratitude.</p>
                <p>His genius was not dramatic; vigorously as he portrayed emotions, he was not
                    successful in drawing characters; he was not master of variety; all his most
                    prominent personages are strictly resolvable into one. There were diversities,
                    but they were diversities of age, clime, and circumstances, not of character.
                    They were merely such as would have appeared in the same individual when placed
                    in different situations. Even the lively and the serious moods belonged alike to
                    that one being; but there was a bitter recklessness in the mirth of his lively
                    personages, which seems only the temporary relaxation of that proud misanthropic
                    gloom that is exhibited in his serious heroes; and each might easily become the
                    other. It may also be objected to many of his personages, that, if tried by the
                    standard of nature, they were essentially false. They were sublime
                    monstrosities;— strange combinations of virtue and vice, such as had never
                    really existed. In his representations of corsairs and renegades, he exaggerates
                    the good feelings which may, by a faint possibility, belong to such characters,
                    and suppresses the brutality and faithlessness which would more probably be
                    found in them, and from which it is not possible that they should have been
                    wholly exempt. His plan was highly conducive to poetical effect; but its
                    incorrectness must not be overlooked in an estimate of his delineation of human
                    character. In his tragedies there is much vigour; but their finest passages are
                    either soliloquies or descriptions, and their highest beauties are seldom
                    strictly of a dramatic nature. Many of his dialogues are scarcely more than
                    interrupted soliloquies; many of his arguments such as one mind would hold with
                    itself. In fact, in his characters, there was seldom that degree of variety and
                    contrast which is requisite for dramatic effect. The opposition was rather that
                    of situation than of sentiment; and we feel that the interlocutors, if
                    transposed, might still have uttered the same things.</p>
                <p>It is to be deplored that scarcely any moral good is derivable from the splendid
                    poetry of Lord Byron. The tendency of his works is to shake our confidence in
                    virtue, and to diminish our abhorrence of vice ;—to palliate crime, and to
                    unsettle our notions of right and wrong. Even many of the virtuous sentiments
                    which occur in his writings are assigned to characters so worthless, or placed
                    in such close juxtaposition with vicious sentiments, as to induce a belief that
                    there exists no real definable boundary; and it may perhaps be said with truth,
                    that it would have been better for the cause of morality, if even those virtuous
                    sentiments had been omitted. Our sympathy is frequently solicited in the behalf
                    of crime. Alp, Conrad, Juan, Parisina, Hugo, Lara, and Manfred, may be cited as
                    examples. They are all interesting and vicious. In the powerful drama of <hi
                    rend="italic">Cain.</hi> the heroes are Lucifer and the first murderer; and the
                    former is depicted, not like the Satan of Milton, who believes and trembles, but
                    as the compassionate friend of mankind. Resistance to the will of the Creator is
                    represented as dignified and commendable; obedience and faith as mean, slavish,
                    and contemptible<pb break="no" facs="nls:193742957" xml:id="kp-eb0705-2957-0761"
                    />. It is implied that it was unmerciful to have created us such as we are, and
                    that we owe the Supreme Being neither gratitude nor duty. Such sentiments are
                    clearly deducible from this drama. Whether they were i those of Lord Byron is
                    not certain; but he must be held accountable for their promulgation. (γ. <hi
