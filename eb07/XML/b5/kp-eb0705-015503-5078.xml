                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">BOW</label><hi rend="italic">{arcus),</hi> a weapon of
                    offence, made of wood, horn, or other elastic' matter, which, being strongly
                    bent by means of a string fastened to its two ends, throws out an allow with
                    great force in suddenly recovering its natural state. It is also called the <hi
                    rend="italic">long-bow,</hi> by way of distinction from the cross-bow or
                    arbalest.</p>
                <p>The bow is the most ancient and the most universal of all weapons. It has been
                    found to obtain amongst the most barbarous and remote tribes, and it is an
                    invention at once so obvious and so simple that no nation has missed it. *</p>
                <p>The use of the bow and arrow was first abolished in France under Louis XI. and in
                    their place were introduced the Swiss arms, that is, the halberd, pike, and
                    broadsword. The long-bow was formerly in great vogue in England; most of our
                    victories in France were acquired by it, and many laws were made to regulate and
                    encourage its use.' The parliament under Henry VIII. complain “of the disuse of
                    the long-bow, heretofore the safe-guard and defence of this kingdom, and the
                    dread and terror of its enemies.”</p>
                <p>The, art of using bows is called <hi rend="italic">archery</hi> and those
                    practised therein are denominated <hi rend="italic">archers</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">bowmen.</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Arciiér</hi> γ. <hi
                    rend="superscript">!</hi></p>
                <p>. The strength of a bow may be calculated on this principle, that its spring, or
                    the power whereby it restores itself to ĩts natural position, is always
                    proportional to the diśtanéë or space it is removed therefrom.</p>
                <p>The most barbarous* nations often excel in fabricating those* things which they
                    have the greatest necessity for in the common offices of life. The Laplanders,
                    who support themselves almost entirely by hunting, have an art of making bows
                    which we, in these more genial parts of the world, never arrived at. Their bow
                    is constructed of two pieces of tough and strong wood, shaved down to the same
                    size, and flattened on each side; the two flat sides of the pieces being brought
                    closely and evenly together, and then joined by means of a glue made of the
                    skins of perch, Waich they make superior in strength to ours. The two pieces,
                    when once united in this manner, never separate, and the bow is of much more
                    force to expel the arrow than it could possibly have been under the same
                    dimensions if formed only of one piece.</p>
                <p>Among the ancients, the bow-string was made of horse hair, and hence called hw«;
                    though Homer’s bow-strings were frequently made of hides cut into small thongs,
                    whence roξα <hi rend="italic">βοuα.</hi> The ’ uppermost part of the bow, to
                    which the string was fastened, wŭs called <hi rend="italic">κt&gt;ξωvη,</hi>
                    being com-mohly made of gold, -and the last thing towards finishing the bow. The
                    Grecian boWs were frequently' beahtified' with gold or Silver, whence <hi

                    the matter of which they were ordinarily composed seems to have been wood,
                    although they were anciently, Scythian-like, made of horn, <hi

                    Pandarus in Homer.' <hi rend="superscript"> , λ</hi> ' ’ A l’ .v⅛ . » &gt; ⅞⅝
                    <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi></p>
                <p>The invention' of the bow <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> s usually ascribed to
                    Apolloí and it was communicated to the primitive inhabitants of Crete who are
                    sāid to'haVè been the’first of mortals that understood’the u⅛e of bows and
                    arrows. Accordingly;' even in later’ages, the Cretan bows were tan.OuS⅛ and
                    preferred by the Greeks to all others. Some, however, prè-ferred to honour
                    Perśes, the son of Perseus, as the inventor of the bow; while others ascribe it
                    to Scythus, son of Jupiter, and progenitoι of the Scythians, who Were excellent
                    in this art, and by many reputed the first masters of it. From them it was
                    derived by the Grecians, some of whose ancient nobility were instructed by the
                    Scythians in the use of the bow, which in those days passed for*a most princely
                    education. It was first introduced into the Roman army during the second Punic
                    war.</p>
                <p>The Scythian bow was famous for its incurvation, which distinguished it from the
                    bows of Greece and other nations, being so great as to form a half moon or
                    semicircle; and hence the shepherd in Athenaeus, describing the letters in
                    Theseus’s name, and expressing each of them by some apposite resemblance,
                    compares the third to the Scythian bow, meaning not the more modern character Σ,
                    but the ancient C, which is semicircular, and bears the third place in the name
                    of the hero, ΘHCEVC, as spelt in ancient Greek. -</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Cross-Bow</hi> is also called <hi rend="italic"
                    >arbalest</hi> or <hi rend="italic">arbalet,</hi> which word is derived from <hi

                    bow with a sling.” The arbalet consists of a steel bow set in a shaft of wood,
                    furnished with a string and a trigger; and it is bent with a piece of iron
                    fitted for that purpose. It serves to project bullets, large arrows, darts, and
                    other m⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> siles. The ancients had large machines
                    for throwing many arrows at once, called <hi rend="italic">axbalets</hi> or <hi
