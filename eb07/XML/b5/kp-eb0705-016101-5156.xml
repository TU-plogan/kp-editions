                <p><label type="entry">BOYD, <hi rend="smallcaps">Mark Alexander</hi></label>, a
                    younger son of Robert Boyd of Pinkill in Ayrshire, was born on the 13th of
                    January 1562. He is said to have come into the world provided with a couple of
                    teeth. He learned the rudiments of the Latin and Greek languages at Glasgow
                    under two grammarians, but was of so high and untractable a spirit, that they
                    despaired of ever making him a scholar. Having quarrelled with his masters, he
                    beat them both, burnt his books, and forswore learning. His uncle, James Boyd of
                    Trochrig, was at that time archbishop of Glasgow; and, as he soon lost his
                    father, his academical studies were conducted under the superintendence of this
                    relation. After he entered the university, he was engaged in some very riotous
                    proceedings, which have been particularly detailed by the able biographer of
                    Melville. While he was yet a youth he followed the court, and exerted the usual
                    means of obtaining preferment; but the fervour of his temper soon precipitated
                    him into quarrels, from which he came off with honour and safety, though
                    frequently at the hazard of his life. As he was nearly related to Lord Boyd, it
                    is probable that he relied chiefly on his patronage; but, as Lord Hailes
                    remarks, “all that we learn of his proficiency at court is, that he fought one
                    duel, and was engaged in numberless broils.” With the approbation of his
                    friends, he went to serve in the French army, and carried with him his little
                    patrimony, which he soon dissipated at play. He was shortly after roused by that
                    emulation which is natural to superior minds, and applied himself to letters
                    with unremitted ardour, till he attained to no mean proficiency as a scholar.
                    Leaving his native country in 1581, when only in his twentieth year, he was not
                    yet past the age of academical study; and he attended the lectures of several
                    professors in the university of Paris, particularly those of Passerat, professor
                    of eloquence, and of Genebrand, professor of Hebrew. Having next directed his
                    attention to the civil law, he went to Orleans, and became a pupil of J. Robert,
                    “a man principally known for having dared to become the antagonist of Cujacius.”
                    But from the university of Orleans he speedily removed to that of Bourges, where
                    he is said to have obtained the friendship of Cujacius, by writing some verses
                    in obsolete Latin; and, as one of his biographers has suggested, that learned
                    man could not fail to relish verses which approached the standard of the twelve
                    Tables.</p>
                <p>The plague having driven him from Bourges, he sought a place of refuge at Lyon;
                    and, when the infection extended to that city, he retired into Italy, where he
                    contracted a friendship with a person whom he names Cornelius Varus. Having been
                    seized with an ague, he returned to Lyon to try the effect of change of air; and
                    the only regret which he felt in quitting Italy, is said to have arisen from his
                    being thus deprived of the literary conversation and salutary advice of his
                    friend. It was about the year 1585 that he revisited France. In 1587 he served
                    with the royal forces opposed to the mercenary army of Germans and Swiss, which
                    had invaded that country to support the king of Navarre. He served under an
                    officer of cavalry, who was a Greek by birth; and, during this campaign, he was
                    wounded by a shot in the ancle. In 1588 he took up his abode in Toulouse, and
                    applied himself to the study of the civil law under Roaldes, a professor of
                    eminence. About the same period he appears to have written several tracts on the
                    science of jurisprudence, and even to have projected a systematical work on the
                    law of nature and nations. But his studies met with an unforeseen interruption,
                    in consequence of the tumults which ensued at Toulouse, and during which the
                    first president Duranty, the advocate-general Dafis, and other individuals of
                    inferior quality, were murdered by the inhabitants. During this season of
                    outrage Boyd was thrown into prison; and, as innocence afforded him no security,
                    he was exposed to imminent danger of his life; but he owed his deliverance to
                    the intercession of some of his friends. He now retired to Rochelle; but as the
                    climate did not agree with his constitution, he afterwards fixed his residence
                    at Fontenay in Poictou. In this retreat he devoted much of his time to study,
                    and occasionally resumed the avocation of a soldier, for which he retained a
                    violent propensity. He is reported to have acted as preceptor to a young French
                    gentleman of the reformed religion, but of such an engagement his own writings
                    communicate no information. About the year 1591 he appears to have formed a
                    design of reading lectures on the civil law; and the heads of his prelections on
                    the Institutes of Justinian are still preserved among his other papers in the
                    Advocates Library.</p>
                <p>His friends in Scotland, and among others Patrick Sharpe, under whom he had
                    studied in the university of Glasgow, urged him to return to his native country;
                    but, according to his own account, the state of his health had long obliged him
                    to live obscurely in France, and his scanty circumstances would not allow him to
                    make a tolerable figure in Scotland. He endeavoured however to strengthen his
                    interest in his native land, by dedicating to James the Sixth a collection of
                    his poems and epistles, printed at Antwerp, 1592, in 12mo. Three years
                    afterwards, while preparing to return home, he received intelligence of the
                    death of his elder brother William, for whom he apparently cherished a very
                    sincere affection. Of his subsequent history, few particulars have been
                    recorded. We are however informed that he at length returned to Scotland; and,
                    after a short residence having undertaken to accompany the earl of Cassilis in
                    his travels, he completed this engagement, and once more revisited his native
                    country, where he died of a slow fever, on the 10th of April 1601. At the time
                    of his death he was only in the fortieth year of his age.</p>
                <p>Boyd appears to have been a person of a restless and turbulent disposition; and,
                    as he added courage to strength, his sword must at least have been as formidable
                    as his pen. He was tall, robust, and well-proportioned, and, possessing a
                    handsome and pleasing countenance, he had much of the gallant bearing of a
                    soldier. His literary vanity was not the least conspicuous part of his
                    character. He was however a man of genius; and if his disposition and
                    circumstances had been more favourable for persevering and systematic exertion,
                    he might have secured a high reputation among the scholars of the age.<note
