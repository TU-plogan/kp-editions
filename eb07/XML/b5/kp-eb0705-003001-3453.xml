                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Linnaeus</hi> divides all natural objects into three grand
                    classes, which he calls kingdoms; and the sciences which treat of these are
                    zoology, botany, and mineralogy. Botany, with which we are to be occupied in
                    this place, enables us to distinguish, arrange, and name all plants or
                    vegetables.</p>
                <p>Some years ago, Baron Humboldt made a calculation as to the probable number of
                    the different species of plants existing on the face of our globe. Of late,
                    however, owing to the many novelties that have reached us from Brazil and the
                    East Indies, it has been supposed that his estimate is much under the truth. At
                    least sixty or seventy thousand, described or undescribed, are scattered through
                    different collections, and every day brings to light additional species; so that
                    at present the probable number of vegetable productions may not be too highly
                    estimated at nearly a hundred thousand. To obtain a knowledge of every one of
                    these individually, and without relation to any other, would be a Herculean
                    task, for which the utmost extension of human life might not be sufficient, and
                    which, though procured, could not be imparted to others. The study would thus be
                    selfish, and the labours of a lifetime useless. Valuable medical properties
                    might be observed in some one vegetable; but posterity would, in all
                    probability, find similar properties in another plant, much sooner than
                    re-discover that formerly known. Thus many plants whose medical qualities were
                    highly esteemed by our ancestors, are now entirely unknown to us as possessing
                    such. To remedy these evils, means must be resorted to for the classifying or
                    arranging of vegetables. If we divide them into trees, shrubs, herbaceous,
                    biennial, and annual, we shall have five divisions; so that supposing an equal
                    number to each, we shall have only to look into one of those sections for what
                    we are in quest of. Again, each of these may be subdivided according to the
                    height to which the plant grows, the colour of its flower, or its capability of
                    bearing an esculent fruit. But this is one of the rudest systems, and, though
                    used in the earliest state of the science, was soon found to be subject to great
                    variation, and to want the necessary precision. Other more philosophical
                    divisions were afterwards adopted, to which, and the steps requisite for the
                    knowledge of them, we intend to devote this article.</p>
                <p>The necessity of a classification being once admitted, resemblances between
                    individuals, not before observed, could not long escape the attention. Thus the
                    affinities <hi rend="italic">inter se</hi> of the different species of pine, of
                    the ash, of the lime, of the strawberry, or of the rose, must soon have been
                    admitted; and in framing a system, care would be taken to place these by the
                    side of the allied species, whether in appearance or in qualities. This is what
                    is termed arranging plants according to their species. It would likewise be soon
                    observed that small groups of these species had more affinity between themselves
                    than with other groups;— a general idea would thus be attached to each of these,
                    which would now form a genus ;—and when these genera were placed one after the
                    other according to some property or resemblance real or fancied, we should have
                    the arrangement of plants by their genera. Whether, then, we proceed by making
                    grand primary cuts or divisions among all the known vegetables, and then proceed
                    to subdivide these until we arrive at genera and species; or commence by the
                    grouping of species and genera, and mount upwards, we shall attain the means of
                    more readily distinguishing and naming plants, and consequently of imparting to
                    others the result of our observations on their properties and uses.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">cui bono</hi> in botany is a question that has often been
                    asked by those who conceive that mere classification is the ultimate object of
                    botany; but, from what has already been said, we trust it will be seen that
                    classification is only the necessary consequence of a wish to impart our ideas
                    to others. It is a universal language, without which the observations of one can
                    be of no use to another, but by which the instructed can unfold to each other,
                    at the remotest parts of the earth, what species or genera of plants have been
                    discovered to possess remarkable properties. “The standing objection to botany,”
                    says the eloquent author of the <hi rend="italic">Natural History of
                    Seibourne,"</hi> has always been, that it is a pursuit that amuses the fancy and
                    exercises the memory, without improving the mind, or advancing any real
                    knowledge; and where the science is carried no farther than a mere systematic
                    classification, the charge is but too true. But the botanist who is desirous of
                    wiping off this aspersion should be by no means content with a mere list of
                    names; he should study plants philosophically,— should investigate the laws of
                    vegetation,—should examine the powers and virtues of efficacious herbs,—should
                    promote their cultivation, and graft the gardener, the planter, and the
                    husbandman, on the phytologist: not that system is by any means to be thrown
                    aside,—without system, the field of nature would be a pathless wilderness; but
                    system should be subservient to, not the main object of, our pursuit.” Nor ought
                    an objection to be urged against the pursuit of those parts of botany from which
                    hitherto no immediate use has been derived. From the highest organized plant to
                    the lowest, all form a chain, in which a link lost or broken disconnects the
                    whole, and to which the recent addition of new links, in the shape of new
                    species, has tended much to the increase of our knowledge. What anatomist has
                    not derived delight from the examination of the eye of a fly; and what botanist
                    has not obtained information from the meanest weed! But it is even important to
                    attend to the lowest class of vegetables. The lichens furnish many valuable
                    dyes; the algae afford food or medicine; and we are all so alarmed at the
                    poisonous effects of many fungi, that scarcely above two or three species are
                    eaten in this country, whereas, if attention were paid to their botanical
                    character, several far superior in flavour to the common mushrooms might be made
                    use of with perfect safety.</p>
                <p>The definition of botany here adopted, though easily understood and perfectly
                    correct, is sometimes of little value to the practical man. Between mineralogy
                    and the two other sciences of zoology and botany we believe there can be little
                    confusion; but between zoology and botany, in the subjects belonging to both of
                    which the living principle seems equally to exist, not only are there great
                    points of resemblance, but instances occur in which it is nearly impossible for
                    the eye to determine whether what we see belongs to the one or to the other
                    kingdom.</p>
                <p>The distinction made by Linnaeus between plants and animals consisted principally
                    in the power of motion in the latter. Many animals have, however, now been
                    discovered, which seem to be unable to remove themselves from the spot on which
                    they first made their appearance; and, on the other hand, there are many plants,
                    as the duckweed <hi rend="italic">(Lemna),</hi> ball-conferva (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Conferva oegagropila),</hi> and others, which, if they have roots, do not send
                    them into the earth, but float about as if in search of food; and our
                    distinguished countryman Mr Brown, whose philosophical observations all must
                    respect, has within these few years demonstrated that the component particles or
                    molecules <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733466" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3466-0031"/> of
                    all matter whatever, whether organized or not, when suspended in a fluid, and
                    viewed with a suitable microscope, are found to be in motion without any visible
                    agency. Perhaps the true differences are to be looked for in sensation and an
                    intestinal canal in the animal kingdom, into which the food is collected; whilst
                    plants are endowed only with irritability, and receive the food through many
                    canals or mouths. But this, although it were universally acknowledged, is of
                    little service, as confusion is only likely to arise in the case of the smallest
                    and least organized, and where the correct knowledge of the anatomical structure
                    is attended with almost insuperable difficulties. In many zoophytes, or lower
                    tribes of marine animals, the external horny or calcareous covering so resembles
                    a plant in its mode of ramification, as to cause doubts which are not easily
                    removed; and there consequently exist many natural objects to this day that are
                    claimed by both the zoologist and botanist. This similarity, combined with the
                    motion to be observed in all molecules, has, we think, given rise to the
                    singular delusion under which many celebrated men abroad have for some years
                    past laboured, when they assert that the minute aquatic algae were animalcules
                    in the first stages of their being, but which afterwards took root and became
                    plants. A rudimentary plant may have often been mistaken for an ŉfusory animal,
                    and may have even been described as such; and although there be no absolute
                    practical character of almost any use to enable us to distinguish the two, yet
                    we consider their identity as a mere matter of speculation, that has never been
                    proved, and which is not borne out by any analogy derived from what are more
                    organized, and on which observations would be less subject to error.</p>
                <p>Subservient to the actual classification and determination of plants, and
                    consequently forming branches of the science of botany, are, lsĄ Organography,
                    or the anatomy of plants, or the knowledge of the structure of their parts or
                    organs; 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, Physiology, or the knowledge of the functions
                    of these parts; 3cř, Pathology, or the derangements to which these functions are
                    exposed; <hi rend="italic">⅛th,</hi> Terminology or Glossology, or a knowledge
                    of the terms employed to designate the parts or organs; <hi rend="italic"
                    >5th,</hi> Phytography, or the art of describing plants, so that every species
                    may be distinguished and recognised; and, <hi rend="italic">lastly,</hi>
                    Taxonomy, or the art of combining all these in such a way as to produce a
                    systematic arrangement or classification.</p>
                <p>What are usually called <hi rend="italic">medical</hi> botany, <hi rend="italic"
                    >agricultural</hi> botany, and <hi rend="italic">economical</hi> botany, do not
                    belong to the science of botany, as one might at first suppose from the names,
                    but form respectively mere connecting links between botany and materia medica,
                    as well as agriculture and domestic economy. They exhibit the relation existing
                    between vegetables and the arts, and point out the uses to which different
                    plants are applied. But although they therefore must fall under other subjects
                    in this work, a .certain knowledge of their general relation must be of
                    considerable use to the botanist, inasmuch as it may enable him to frame a
                    classification that will bring nearer together plants of similar properties and
                    virtues, as well as of a similar form and structure.</p>
                <p>In the same way, botanical geography is not a branch of botany. This exhibits the
                    relation between vegetables and the soil on which they grow, and the climate in
                    whiclι they delight, or, in other words, the physical causes, and the laws of
                    their distribution over the surface of our globe. This will form a part of
                    Physical Geography.</p>
                <p>Horticulture or gardening, or the art of cultivating plants so as to improve
                    their beauty or ameliorate their qualities, is dependent on vegetable pathology;
                    but it has long been considered as separate from botany, and will be treated of
                    as a distinct science.</p>
                <p>The above six branches of botany are so intimately connected, that it is
                    difficult to discuss one without encroaching on the others. As, however, these
                    are discussed in other parts of this work, we shall here confine ourselves, as
                    much as the nature of the subject will admit, to the three latter ;—Glossology,
                    Phytography, and Taxonomy; under which last will be found a snort historical
                    sketch of the science.</p>
                <p>I.—GLOSSOLOGY.</p>
                <p>Glossology, or, as Linnaeus called it, Terminology, gives us, as has already been
                    stated, the knowledge of the terms employed, or furnishes definitions of the
                    names applied to the different parts or organs.. The structure of these
                    constitutes organography or anatomy. An account of the organs themselves belongs
                    also, strictly speaking, to the same branch of the subject; but as a mere
                    explanation of terms might prove useless and uninteresting, without
                    understanding to what these terms are to be applied, we shall here exclude the
                    elementary organs, or those which compose the others, and blend the two
                    together; and thus, by explaining the organs and their successive developments,
                    endeavour to lay a foundation, without which a knowledge of the natural system
                    of classification cannot be acquired. Under <hi rend="smallcaps">Vegetable
                    Anatomy,</hi> these organs arc treated of as subservient to physiology. Here we
                    shall consider them as connected with classification. And as in this article we
                    do not intend to insert a catalogue or description of plants, so we shall pass
                    over many terms that are not essential to a general view of the subject.</p>
                <p>The organs of plants not elementary have been divided by De Candolle into the
                    fundamental and reproductive. The former are such as are essential to the
                    nutrition of the plant, while the latter are mere modifications of these. We
                    shall therefore first proceed to the</p>
                <p>FUNDAMENTAL ORGANS.</p>
                <p>These consist of roots, stems, and leaves.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Poots (Padices).</hi></p>
                <p>We shall suppose a seed put into the ground under favourable circumstances. The
                    inherent vital principle common to both plants and animals begins to operate;
                    and a development takes place downwards as well as upwards. The descending
                    portion is termed the Root; and by it plants are fixed to the earth, and
                    nutriment absorbed. In some aquatic plants no root whatever is perceptible. But
                    in such apparent aberrations from what seems a general rule of nature, it may be
                    presumed by analogy that roots do exist even when they have not been observed;
                    in confirmation of which it may be stated, that many plants to which roots were
                    long denied, have actually possessed them in some parts of their existence, and
                    are capable of deriving nourishment either from the earth, water, or air,
                    although in a few the foliaceous portions of the plant are such as almost to
                    preclude the necessity of their having any.</p>
                <p>There are several characters which distinguish the root from the stem. The
                    principal are the absence of leaves, of pith even in those plants in which it is
                    abundant in the stem, and of spiral vessels.</p>
                <p>A root usually consists of three parts: the <hi rend="italic">neck (collum),</hi>
                    or line of separation from the stem; the <hi rend="italic">body</hi> or middle
                    portion of the root; and the attenuated fibrous portion, or little roots through
                    which the nourishment is principally derived. Keeping this in view, a root of
                    the simplest kind is, Jsŕ, what is termed <hi rend="italic">conical,</hi> or the
                    principal or tap root as it is sometimes called; this tapers downwards, emitting
                    fibres from various parts of its surface, as in the carrot (Plate CXII. fig. 1):
                    2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, when the conical root is attenuated <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193733479" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3479-0032"/> towards the neck, as well as
                    below, it is called <hi rend="italic">fusiform</hi> (fig. 2), as the radish:
                    3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, when swollen out extremely in the upper part, and
                    suddenly attenuated below, it is <hi rend="italic">napiform</hi> (fig. 3), as in
                    the turnip: <hi rend="italic">Ąth,</hi> when the fusiform root is as it were cut
                    off suddenly, it is termed <hi rend="italic">abrupt (proemorsus)</hi> (fig. 4),
                    as in the devil’s bit scabious: <hi rend="italic">Sth, fibrous</hi> when the
                    body of the root is so reduced as not to be apparent, and nothing is seen but
                    simple or branched fibres proceeding from the neck: <hi rend="italic">Sth,</hi>
                    when these fibres swell out slightly in the middle, the root is called <hi
                    rend="italic">fasciculated</hi> (fig. 5): <hi rend="italic">Ιth,</hi> when the
                    fibrous root bears, either at its neck, or here and there attached to its
                    fibres, one or more tubers, fleshy, and containing much starchy feculent matter,
                    it has been often called <hi rend="italic">tuberous,</hi> but ought really to be
                    termed <hi rend="italic">tuberiferous,</hi> such tubers serving for the
                    nourishment of the plant; when two of such tubers are placed together, as in
                    some species of orchis, they are said to be <hi rend="italic">didymous</hi>
                    (fig. 6); and when these again are divided up to the middle into diverging
                    lobes, they are <hi rend="italic">didymous palmate</hi> (fig. 7). Some give the
                    name of tuberous roots to any root whatever that contains swellings or tubercles
                    on some part of its length; but in neither sense ought tubers to be classed
                    among roots. In the one they are more properly short, fleshy, subterranean
                    stems, containing usually eyes or buds, from which new plants arise; and in the
                    other they have a very different structure, and are generally termed, <hi
                    rend="italic">8th, granulated</hi> roots. These exhibit a collection of small
                    tubercles with eyes fit for the reproduction of the plant, without being
                    enveloped by cellular tissue filled with starchy fecule, and thus differ
                    essentially from the tuberiferous. In the same predicament with the tuberiferous
                    is the <hi rend="italic">bulbous</hi> root (fig. 8). This consists of a thin,
                    flat tubercle, called by cultivators of hyacinths the crown, from the lower part
                    of which proceeds a fibrous root, while above there is a bulb or peculiar kind
                    of bud, formed of a number of scales (as in the lily), or coats (as in the
                    onion), closely applied to each other; such may rather be termed <hi
                    rend="italic">bulbiferous</hi> roots, the bulb being equivalent to a leaf-bud,
                    and the crown to a stem.</p>
                <p>With regard to direction, there are only two requiring any notice. The one is <hi
                    rend="italic">contorted,</hi> when bent upwards and downwards in a zig-zag
                    manner, as may be seen in the bistort; the other is a <hi rend="italic"
                    >creeping</hi> root. The usual direction for a root is towards the centre of the
                    earth, but it sometimes happens that one or all of its parts deviate at a right
                    angle from this, and proceed laterally parallel to the surface. When this takes
                    place it is said to be <hi rend="italic">creeping.</hi> Roots of this kind are
                    said to be among the greatest enemies the agriculturist has to encounter; but
                    they are in a measure harmless, much confusion prevailing between them and
                    subterranean branches; and we would therefore warn the young botanist not to
                    fall into the error. Indeed the number of creeping roots is much less than has
                    been generally thought; for in most cases these will be found to be true
                    branches springing off from the stem above the neck of the root, but afterwards
                    developed under ground, and even from different points throwing out radical
                    fibres. Among these is the couchgrass (<hi rend="italic">Triticum reperis},</hi>
                    and the potato, the fibrous parts of which bearing the tubers are now
                    ascertained to be branches, as might indeed have been long ago suspected, from
                    the care found necessary by cultivators to be paid to the heaping up of the
                    earth on the lower part of the stem, so as to increase the number of these
                    branches, and render the crop more abundant. In some plants, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Vicia amphicarpa,</hi> such branches or false roots bear pods
                    under ground.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stems ( Caules).</hi></p>
                <p>Reverting to the germination of a seed, that part which springs upwards is the
                    stem: it is therefore the intermediate body between the root and the leaves.
                    When the first state of germination is observed, the rising stem is surrounded
                    by rudimentary leaves. It is thus similar to those gems or leaf-buds that are
                    afterwards observed in the axillae of all leaves, and which afterwards become
                    branches; and it may therefore be stated in general terms, that all stems are
                    produced by the successive developments of leaf-buds.</p>
                <p>When the stem of a plant arising from a seed is evident, the plant is termed <hi
                    rend="italic">caulescent;</hi> and when not apparent, or scarcely so, the plants
                    have received the names of <hi rend="italic">acaules</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >subacaules.</hi> These last terms, however, mustnot be taken in a rigorous
                    sense; for although a stem be sometimes extremely short, or even entirely under
                    ground, it always exists. We may refer here to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gentianaacaιιlis, Carduus acaulis,</hi> and many others, said to have no stem,
                    but which really have one so surrounded by the bases of the leaves, as to be
                    overlooked until they be planted in a more genial soil, when the stem becomes
                    more visible. We have already stated that the crown of what is called a bulbous
                    root is the real stem ;—and in the genus <hi rend="italic">Cyclamen,</hi> what
                    is usually considered a tuber is an actual stem, from the base of which fibrous
                    roots are protruded, and from the top, leaves and flowers.</p>
                <p>It often happens that the stem, instead of ascending, stretches, either wholly or
                    in part, under ground or on the surface, emitting here and there roots from
                    below, and branches or leaves which rise upwards. Such a stem is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">rhizorna</hi> (fig. 9), or, if it do not emit fibres, a <hi
                    rend="italic">cor-mιιs.</hi> Most of what Linnaeus improperly described as
                    creeping roots are of the former description: of these each rising branch may
                    easily be separated, and becomes a new individual. The jointed roots or sealy
                    roots of botanists are also subterranean stems; for the knots and scales are the
                    rudiments of buds and leaves, which no true root possesses. Sometimes a plant
                    pushes out horizontally long stems of a peculiar nature, emitting only from the
                    extremity roots and leaf-buds, as in the strawberry. Such stems are termed <hi
                    rend="italic">stolones</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rιmners.</hi></p>
                <p>Branches as well as stems arise from leaf-buds. Every leaf or modification of a
                    leaf possesses these in their axillae, or the angle formed by the leaf and the
                    branch; and therefore all leafy stems must likewise be branched, and without any
                    limit to the ramification, unless the leaf-bud has met with injury, or in
                    peculiar circumstances has not been called into action. As leaf-buds are
                    axillary, so branches are not elongated, strictly speaking, by means of
                    leaf-buds, but by a prolongation of the axis of the original leaf-bud from which
                    it arose. This distinction is, however, very subtile and unnecessary; for the
                    terminal sealybud, though only the undeveloped portion of a leaf-bud, is so
                    similar to regular leaf-buds in the external as well as internal structure, that
                    they cannot be distinguished but by their position. De Candolle indeed calls
                    them all leaf-buds, and we ourselves feel inclined to admit the idea of a
                    terminal leaf-bud; but, while we do so, we must add, that from the terminal
                    being really only a portion of an axillary one, it must be viewed as a
                    modification of the axillary; and therefore, although appearances be sometimes
                    against us, we must again repeat that all leaf-buds are axillary. Spurious
                    leaf-buds, or <hi rend="italic">gemmae</hi> as they are called, sometimes
                    capable of producing branches and leaves, or even new individuals, are
                    frequently scattered irregularly on the stem or branches, as, for example, on
                    the elm, where they are abundant; but these must not be confounded with true
                    leafbuds. The leaf-buds, the development of which depends on the rise of the
                    sap, have the outer or lower scales or leaves first expanded; and this same law
                    ought to hold with regard also to their successive development. And such is the
                    case in some trees. But the extremities of the branches <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193733492" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3492-0033"/> being almost always more
                    herbaceous than below, and more liable to be acted upon by atmospherical heat,
                    the buds towards the summits are usually first evolved, and then, proceeding
                    gradually downwards, those below them, so that the lowest buds are the last
                    expanded.</p>
                <p>The summit of branches or stems is usually green, soft, and herbaceous; and when
                    the primary stems do not rise above the surface, but only the tender branches,
                    that plant is termed <hi rend="italic">herbaceous,</hi> in opposition to those
                    with a <hi rend="italic">perennial</hi> stem. An herbaceous stem generally dies
                    down to the ground every year. A perennial stem may be <hi rend="italic"
                    >succulent</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fleshy, woody, shrubby,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">somewhat shrubby;</hi> but these terms bear their own meaning.
                    Linnaeus devised for expressing the duration of plants four very simple marks,
                    which have been adopted by nearly all botanists. These are, ☉, to denote annual;
                    $, biennial; and █, perennial; while █ indicates a shrub or tree. De Candolle,
                    however, has somewhat changed these and added others. He adopts four principal
                    signs, ☉, █, █, and █. The first relates to a plant called monocarpic, or which
                    flowers and fructifies only once; the second denotes a rhizocarpic plant, which
                    has herbaceous stems that die down to the ground every year; the third applies
                    to a caulocarpic one, whose stems are straight and perennial; and the last marks
                    a climbing plant. The first, third, and fourth of these, being indefinite, are
                    divisible into several others: Thus, ➀, shows the life of the plant is only for
                    one year; ➁, for two years; █, that it is many years before it flowers, but
                    after which it dies. Again, 5, indicates a suffruticoe plant, or one that though
                    shrubby does not elevate itself more than a foot or two; ,î, denotes a shrub of
                    from two to ten feet high, in which the branches arise from the base of the
                    stem; <hi rend="italic">5,</hi> marks a small tree of from ten to twenty-five
                    feet high, and whose trunk is without branches at the base; and .Ç, is a decided
                    tree upwards of twenty-five feet. As to the symbol for climbing, Ç marks a plant
                    that climbs to the right, and 3 one that climbs to the left. To these the same
                    botanist has added ∆, to point out an evergreen.<note anchored="true"

                    pistilla and no stamens; £Į, according to him, designates a plant which has

                    composed of transparent vesicles, variously cohering with each other.</p><p><hi

                    <hi rend="italic">Spiral vessels</hi> are formed of elastic tissue, twisted
                    spirally into the form of a cylinder, and capable of being unrolled. To these

                    >Ducts</hi> are elongated, transparent tubes, composed of a tissue that is not
                    capable of unrolling.</p></note> called <hi rend="italic">pith.</hi> Around
                    this, and inside of the wood, are placed a series of spiral vessels and ducts,
                    constituting the <hi rend="italic">medullary sheath.</hi> This communicates on
                    the one side with the pith, and on the other with the medullary rays, leaf-buds,
                    and veins of the leaves. Next we find the <hi rend="italic">wood,</hi>
                    consisting of concentric layers, one of which is formed every year. These layers
                    are composed of cellular tissue, woody fibre, and ducts, and are traversed by
                    the medullary rays composed of cellular tissue, and connecting the centre with
                    the circumference. The fully formed or central layers are called the <hi
                    rend="italic">heart-wood,</hi> and the exterior the <hi rend="italic"
                    >alburnum.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">bark</hi> surrounds the wood. This may be
                    seen to have the same number of concentric layers as the wood, but of these the
                    hardest or most fully formed is exterior, and the youngest interior. The <hi
                    rend="italic">liber</hi> is that portion of the bark which is successively
                    formed next the wood. Each concentric layer, whether of wood or bark, consists
                    of two strata, the one of woody fibre and ducts, the other of cellular tissue,
                    of which the latter in the wood is interior, and in the bark exterior; so that
                    wood and bark may be viewed as similarly constituted of woody fibre and pith;
                    which last, however, in the bark, is on the outside. Betwixt the liber and
                    alburnum is formed in spring a viscid secretion called <hi rend="italic"
                    >cambium.</hi> The matter which causes such plants to increase in diameter has
                    been found by experiment to descend; but the investigation of this subject
                    belongs more to vegetable anatomy and physiology. Suffice it to say, that such
                    an appearance as we have above described takes place in a very great proportion
                    of vegetables; and from the circumstance of their receiving the annual increase
                    between the outside of the old wood and inside of the old bark, some botanists
                    have termed such plants <hi rend="italic">Exogenous (Exogenae).</hi> There are
                    other plants, however, in which no such distinctions exist, and where the stem
                    is formed of bundles of ducts and spiral vessels interspersed through a cellular
                    tissue; and this is surrounded by a stratum of cellular tissue and woody fibre,
                    different from bark, inasmuch as it cannot be separated from the stem itself.
                    Such plants have their diameter increased by the addition of central vascular
                    tissue and ducts, and are therefore called <hi rend="italic">Endogenous
                    (Endogence)&gt;</hi> Both Exogenae and Endogenae containing spiral vessels, are
                    called <hi rend="italic">vascular,</hi> in opposition to another division of
                    vegetables, the <hi rend="italic">cellular (cellulares),</hi> in which they do
                    not exist; but as these plants do not spring from seeds, we shall pass them over
                    at present.</p>
                <p>Occasionally, projections from the medullary sheath reach the circumference of
                    the stem and branches, forming what are called <hi rend="italic">nodi,</hi> to
                    which are attached leaves and leafbuds; and the spaces between these nodi are
                    called <hi rend="italic">internodia.</hi> The tuber of the potato seems to be a
                    collection of these nodi and leaf-buds (there called eyes), the leaves being
                    abortive from the tubers being formed under ground.</p>
                <p>The stem peculiar to the grasses and other allied tribes is termed a <hi
                    rend="italic">culm(culmzis).</hi> This is simple, or rarely branched, generally
                    hollow within or fistulose, and separated at intervals by knots or partitions,
                    from which issue the leaves.</p>
                <p>The stem may be <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> or <hi rend="italic">branched,</hi>
                    and with the branches may be <hi rend="italic">cylindrical</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">conical; round (teres)</hi> or <hi rend="italic">angled; smooth
                    (laevis), furrowed, glabrous</hi> (free from any processes), or <hi
                    rend="italic">rough,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pubescent,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">hairy.</hi> These terms, bearing the same signification in botany
                    as in common language, need no definition. Among Endogenous plants, from the
                    abortion of leaf-buds, the stems are usually cylindrical and unbranched; while,
                    from the leaf-buds being almost always developed in the Exogenae, the stems are
                    generally branched and conical.</p>
                <p>Belonging to the stem we may take notice of two processes. The one is a <hi
                    rend="italic">spine (spina),</hi> which always arises from what was a leaf-bud;
                    it is therefore a kind of branch, and must not be confounded with the other
                    process, or <hi rend="italic">prickle (aculeus),</hi> which does not spring from
                    leaf-buds, and is a mere dilatation of the cellular portion of the bark.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Leaves (Eolia).</hi></p>
                <p>Leaves are those expansions which issue laterally from the stem and branches of
                    plants. They take their origin <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733505"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-3505-0034"/> from the bark, and are always to be observed,
                    either in a rudimentary or perfect state, immediately below the leafbuds. They
                    are originally continuous with the stem and nodi, but afterwards, from acause
                    that does not appear to be yet well understood, an articulation more or less
                    complete takes place, when the leaf falls off. Very few instances occur where
                    there are no leaves on the stem, as in the genera <hi rend="italic">Orobanche,
                    Lathreea,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cuscuta,</hi> and even then there are
                    rudimentary leaves m the shape of scales or tubercles. ' The first thing we have
                    to attend to is the position of the leaves. Those situated near the root are
                    often larger, and of a different shape, from those higher up the stem; and the
                    former are termed <hi rend="italic">radical,</hi> the latter <hi rend="italic"
                    >cauline</hi> leaves. We usually observe, that as these approach the extremity
                    of the branches which bear the flower, they decrease much in size, assume a
                    different form and colour, and are termed <hi rend="italic">floral leaves</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">bracteas.</hi> Of these we shall afterwards have occasion
                    to speak, when we come to the inflorescence of plants.</p>
                <p>When the stem or branch is cut through, several leaves are sometimes found in the
                    same horizontal plane. When only two are observed, and these opposite to each
                    other, they are usually said to be <hi rend="italic">opposite.</hi> It has,
                    however, been lately proposed to term opposite those only, the bases of whose
                    petioles are connected either by stipules or otherwise, reserving to the others
                    the appellation of <hi rend="italic">pseudo-opposite;</hi> but this distinction
                    has been hitherto adopted by almost no systematic writer. When more than two are
                    in the same plane, they are said to be in <hi rend="italic">whorls,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">verticillate;</hi> but, strictly speaking, such are of very rare
                    occurrence; <hi rend="italic">Hippuris</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Myriophyllum</hi> may however serve as examples. But it is improper to apply
                    this term to the leaves of the genus <hi rend="italic">Galium,</hi> in which the
                    two opposite leaves alone bear axillary leaf-buds, the others being mere
                    foliaceous stipules.</p>
                <p>When the branch is cut through horizontally, and only one leaf appears in the
                    section, the leaves were said by Linnaeus to be <hi rend="italic">scattered
                    (sparsa),</hi> or <hi rend="italic">alternate,</hi> with little discrimination.
                    More modern botanists have, however, observed that fliese are primarily arranged
                    regularly; but afterwards so many disturbing causes occur as to render their
                    true disposition scarcely perceptible. By true alternate leaves ought to be
                    understood those only which are placed on two sides of the branch, in such a way
                    that the third leaf is under the first, and the fourth under the second; and
                    when such are close together they are said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >distichous.</hi> But leaves are usually placed in simple spirals, in such a way
                    that the sixth is under the first, the seventh under the second, and so on.
                    There are also instances where the spiral is formed of more than five leaves,
                    and hence there may be double, triple, quintuple, or sextuple spirals. The
                    practice, however, still prevails of calling all such alternate in which the
                    spiral is not very evident.</p>
                <p>Of these two systems the type of the verticillate is the opposite, whilé that of
                    the spiral is the alternate; and cases even happen where the one of these seems
                    almost to pass into the other. Thus, in Exogenous plants, although the leaves
                    maybe opposite to each other on the lower part of the plant, they often assume
                    the spiral direction above; and, in the Endogenae, although the lower leaves be
                    in a spiral, the upper ones are sometimes verticillate. This induced
                    Desfontaines to institute a close analysis, by which he discovered a remarkable
                    relation between the structure of the stem, the number of cotyledons, and the
                    disposition of the leaves, from which we are now enabled to derive a general
                    law, that in all Dicoyledonous or Exogenous vegetables, the leaves are primarily
                    opposite, or verticillate, but may become alternate, or form a spiral, according
                    to the mode of growth of the plant; and that in all the Monocotyledonous, or
                    Endogenae, the reverse happens, the leaves being primarily alternate, or in a
                    spiral, but afterwards subject’to be more or less exactly opposite. Thus, in the
                    position of the leaves we have an auxiliary to enable us to determine to which
                    of these two great classes of vegetables a plant belongs.</p>
                <p>Some botanists add to the above <hi rend="italic">fascicled</hi> leaves <hi
                    rend="italic">(folia fasciculata);</hi> but these are combinations of which both
                    systems are susceptible. Thus, in <hi rend="italic">Aspalathus,</hi> where the
                    three leaflets appear to arise from one point, this is a deception caused by the
                    shortness of the petiole. Another case commonly quoted is, when the leaf becomes
                    abortive at the same time that a very short branch furnished with leaves appears
                    from the leaf-bud. Thus, in the barberry, the thorn is the rudiment c∙f the real
                    leaf; and what we call leaves are new leaves placed close together on a very
                    short branch, and belonging to the leaf-bud. In the pine tribe the sheath is the
                    rudiment of the leaf; while the two, three, or five leaves within it are the
                    first leaves of an abortive branch. The cedar exhibits and explains this very
                    easily; for in the early part of spring, the leaves are fasciculated; but in
                    summer, when the leaf-buds or axillary branches have time to elongate, the
                    leaves become alternate.</p>
                <p>A leaf consists of the petiole, the lamina or limb, and a pair of stipules; but
                    sometimes only one of these three parts can be observed. The joeŵfe is that
                    which connects the lamina with the stem, and through it the bundles of ducts and
                    spiral vessels pass before they branch out in the limb. Its form is usually
                    cylindrical or slightly channelled above; but it sometimes happens that it is
                    flattened, and presents on each side a foliaceous appendage, when it is said to
                    be margined, as in <hi rend="italic">Dionoea muscipula</hi> (fig. 41, 6). This
                    margin is frequently contracted at regular intervals; and from each contraction
                    in a compound leaf springs a leaflet. We often find, however, that the leaflets
                    are abortive, in which case the petiole may easily be mistaken for the lamina;
                    and this is indeed what is called by some a lomentaceous leaf. But more commonly
                    a terminal leaflet remains, although the others be abortive, as we see in the
                    orange tree; and to distinguish the two kinds we must be much guided by analogy.
                    This confusion is however of little consequence; for as we may regard the
                    longitudinal nerve of the leaf as a prolongation of the petiole, the limb or
                    lamina itself may be viewed as a margined petiole.</p>
                <p>The fibres that pass through the petiole, and which in Exogenous plants arise
                    from the medullary sheath, and in the Endogenous from the bundles of vascular
                    tissue, sometimes in the former class, instead of being united from the base
                    into a compact bundle, as more commonly happens, spring side by side from
                    various points more or less round the branch. The base of the petiole is thus
                    plane, and is <hi rend="italic">amplexicaul</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >semi-amplexicaul,</hi> or perhaps even <hi rend="italic">sheathing
                    (vaginans).</hi> Before the fibres enter the lamina, however, they tend to one
                    point, so that the upper portion does not differ from a common petiole with a
                    rounded base. This expansion of the base of the petiole is to be seen in a
                    remarkable manner in the upper leaves of <hi rend="italic">Bupleurum
                    perfoliatum</hi> and some others, where it has all the appearance of a
                    foliaceous limb.</p>
                <p>Towards the summit of the stems of the <hi rend="italic">Umbelliferoe,</hi> the
                    lamina and the cylindrical part of the petiole frequently disappear, nothing
                    remaining but the sheathing base. In <hi rend="italic">Lathgrus Nissolia</hi>
                    this happens to all the leaves, and there the sheathing base becomes mpre
                    dilated than usual. The affinity derived from other considerations between <hi
                    rend="italic">Pyrola</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Monotropa</hi> shows that the
                    scales of the latter arepetiolar sheaths, and in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orobanche</hi> tribe they must be viewed in the same manner.</p>
                <p>It happens sometimes, especially when the lamina is not developed, that the
                    petiole, without being sheathing <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733518"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-3518-0035"/> at the base, expands throughout its whole length,
                    and takes a state intermediate between foliaceous and petiolar. This has
                    received the name of <hi rend="italic">phyllodium;</hi> as in many species of
                    <hi rend="italic">Acacia</hi> from New Holland, some of which when young present
                    a slender petiole and a bipinnate leaf, but afterwards lose their leaflets by
                    the dilatation of the petiole.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the petiole is elongated beyond the lamina, or perhaps in compound
                    leaves the terminal leaflet may have no lamina but only the midrib, while the
                    petiole or midrib retains its usual cylindrical figure, becomes very long,
                    twists spirally, and then constitutes a tendril <hi rend="italic">{cirrhus)</hi>
                    (fig. 37, <hi rend="italic">a).</hi> In others, though rarely, the leaves are
                    abortive, and the petiole remains straight and cylindrical. In some plants with
                    compound leaves, as in <hi rend="italic">Astragalus Tragacantha,</hi> the
                    terminal leaflet becomes abortive or is changed into a spine, when the petiole
                    is said to be spinescent.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">lamina</hi> of the leaf next claims our attention. This is
                    an expansion of the parenchyma of the petiole, and commences where the bundles
                    of vascular tissue that traverse the petiole begin to diverge from each other
                    and form what are called the veins of the leaf. The divergence of these fibres,
                    says De Candolle, is in two different ways. They either separate, making with
                    the base or its prolongation an angle properly so called, and most frequently an
                    acute one, when the leaves may be said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >angulinerved;</hi> or they form on the base or its prolongation a curvature,
                    when the leaves may be termed <hi rend="italic">curvinerved.</hi> The former
                    structure is essential to the Exogenae, the latter to the Endogenae. Among
                    those, the nerves of which form an angle, there are four forms.</p>
                <p>1. Leaves <hi rend="italic">penninerved</hi> (fig. 14), where the petiole is
                    prolonged into one longitudinal nerve, which on both sides sets out lateral
                    nerves, as in the Spanish chestnut. In a linear leaf these lateral nerves must
                    be all equal in length; in an elliptic, oval,' or orbicular leaf, those about
                    the middle must be longer than those at the base or summit of the leaf; in an
                    ovate one, the longer nerves are below the middle; in an obovate leaf, above the
                    middle. When the lower pair or two lower pairs of nerves are much larger than
                    the others, and almost the size of the midrib, as in the Jerusalem artichoke,
                    the leaves are said to be <hi rend="italic">tripli-nerved</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">quintuplinerved.</hi></p>
                <p>2. Leaves <hi rend="italic">palminerved</hi> (fig. 10), where several nerves
                    diverge all at once from the base of the leaf.</p>
                <p>3. Leaves <hi rend="italic">peltinerved</hi> (fig. 11), where several nerves
                    radiate from the apex of the petiole in a plane different from the direction of
                    the petiole. It results from this disposition that the lamina does not appear at
                    first to be a prolongation of the petiole, but rather a disc placed at its
                    summit. It is evident, when the point of attachment is near the margin of the
                    lamina, that we should have almost a palminerved leaf; indeed in some plants
                    these two forms occur promiscuously.</p>
                <p>4. Leaves <hi rend="italic">pedalinerved,</hi> where the central nerve is very
                    short, but setting off on both sides two strong diverging lateral nerves, which,
                    instead of being branched alike on both sides, present almost no lateral nerves
                    on the outer side; whilst, in the inside, secondary nerves spring out almost
                    parallel to each other. This form is of rare occurrence, but may be seen in some
                    passion-flowers.</p>
                <p>The curvinerved leaves may either have their nerves converging or diverging; but
                    these require little illustration.</p>
                <p>In Exogenous plants the veins branch in various directions, anastomosing, and
                    forming a kind of net-work. In Endogenous plants they are nearly parallel to
                    each other, being connected by single transverse unbranched veins. To this the
                    <hi rend="italic">ConifercP</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cycadeoe</hi> form
                    perhaps the only exceptions r these have the stems of the Exogenous, but the
                    same arrangement of the veins as in the Endogenae.</p>
                <p>The veins of some leaves are capable of producing from their extremities <hi
                    rend="italic">gemmae</hi> similar to those we have described as occurring on the
                    stetŉ and branches. These gemmae usually arise from the margin; but as the vein
                    must be open, or have a stoma, as it is anatomically called, at the point of
                    insertion; and as such stomata, though frequent on the under side, have been
                    rarely observed on the upper surface; so the gemmae are seldom or never produced
                    on the upper side.</p>
                <p>A leaf is either simple or compound. It is <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> when its
                    lamina is entire <hi rend="italic">{folium integrum),</hi> or when, if separated
                    into several divisions, these segments are not articulated with the petiole. The
                    position and ramification of the nerves have great influence in determining the
                    shape of the leaf. Of those that are entire, the simplest of all forms is the
                    <hi rend="italic">linear</hi> (fig. 12), where the margins are parallel. By the
                    central position of such a one being slightly dilated, we have an <hi
                    rend="italic">oblong;</hi> when more dilated, an <hi rend="italic"
                    >elliptical</hi> leaf (fig. 13); and when much so, an <hi rend="italic"
                    >orbicular</hi> one. When the dilatation is below the middle, we have an <hi
                    rend="italic">ovate</hi> (fig. 14); when above the middle, an <hi rend="italic"
                    >obovate</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The terms

                    and <hi rend="italic">oboval.</hi> A truly ovate leaf relers to thickness as
                    well as surface. It has indeed the shape of an egg, and oval is the longitudinal
                    section of such.</p></note> leaf (fig. 15). When the oblong tapers gradually
                    into a point at the apex, it becomes <hi rend="italic">lanceolate</hi> (fig.
                    16). If a leaf be very narrow, and taper upwards from its base, it is <hi
                    rend="italic">subulate</hi> (fig. 17); and when long, narrow, stiff, and sharp,
                    it is said to be <hi rend="italic">acicular</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >setaceous</hi> (fig. 18); when narrow and very slender, it is <hi rend="italic"
                    >filiform.</hi> When an elliptical leaf tapers much below, so as to be narrow at
                    the base, and broad and rounded at the summit, it becomes <hi rend="italic"
                    >spathulate</hi> (fig. 19); and when narrow at the base, and truncated or
                    somewhat squared off at the top, it is <hi rend="italic">cuneiform.</hi> Such
                    are the principal forms. When almost any of these are produced at the base, so
                    as to have two lobes on each side of the petiole, they are said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">cordate</hi> or <hi rend="italic">heart-shaped</hi> (fig. 20 and
                    21) when the lobes are rounded; <hi rend="italic">sagittate</hi> (fig. 22) when
                    acute and scarcely diverging; and <hi rend="italic">hastate</hi> (fig. 23) when
                    acute and diverging much outwards. When an orbicular leaf becomes cordate at the
                    base, it is called <hi rend="italic">reniform</hi> (fig. 24).</p>
                <p>Leaves, or rather the lamina of leaves, are either sharp-pointed or <hi
                    rend="italic">acute, pungent, mucronate,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"

                    15, 24,); when such a leaf has a small sinus at the apex, it is <hi
                    rend="italic">retuse</hi> (fig. 25); when the sinus is deeper, as if a piece had
                    been cut out, it is <hi rend="italic">emarginate</hi> (fig. 26); and when still
                    more so, <hi rend="italic">obcordate;</hi> till by degrees we have <hi

                    27), and <hi rend="italic">bipartite.</hi> What is called the appendage (fig.
                    41, <hi rend="italic">a)</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Ωioncea muscipula</hi> is a
                    two-lobed lamina. From the gradual transition of one form into another,
                    botanists might long ago have learned the little importance to be attached to
                    any individual shape; unhappily, however, for science, species have too often
                    been multiplied on such weak grounds. In studying the phytographical department,
                    we would recommend, that either in describing, or endeavouring to understand a
                    description, each form should to be taken with a considerable latitude of
                    meaning, and as subject to vary into the others on either side.</p>
                <p>A divided leaf may be <hi rend="italic">cleft {folia trifida, quadrifida,</hi>
                    &amp;c.), or, if the divisions be deeper, it is <hi rend="italic">lobed {folia
                    triloba,</hi> &amp;c.), and, when deeply cut, partite <hi rend="italic">{folia
                    tripartita,</hi> &amp;c.); but when the divisions are deep and unequal, the leaf
                    is <hi rend="italic">laciniated</hi> (fig. 28). When a leaf is rounded at both
                    extremities, but contracted in the middle, it is <hi rend="italic"
                    >panduriform</hi> (fig. 29) or violin-shaped; and when there are more than <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193733531" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3531-0036"/> one contraction
                    on each side, as in the oak, it is <hi rend="italic">sinuated</hi> (fig. 30).
                    When a leaf is divided laterally into lobes more or less deep, it is <hi
                    rend="italic">pinnatiful (fig.</hi> 31); when these lobes are very narrow and
                    nearly parallel, it is <hi rend="italic">pectinate;</hi> when the lateral lobes
                    are acute and recurved, it is <hi rend="italic">runcinate</hi> (fig. 32); when
                    the terminal lobe of a pinnatiful leaf is round and larger than the others, the
                    leaf is <hi rend="italic">lyrate</hi> (fig. 33); when a leaf is so deeply
                    divided laterally that the lobes are only connected at their base, it is <hi
                    rend="italic">pinnatipartite;</hi> and when the lobes are completely isolated,
                    it is <hi rend="italic">pinnati-sect</hi> (fig. 34). Linnaeus, as well as many
                    modern botanists of eminence, called the last <hi rend="italic">pinnate·,</hi>
                    and referred it to a compound leaf; but the transition from the entire leaf to
                    the pinnatisect shows distinctly that the latter is but a simple leaf, of which
                    all the parenchyma has not been developed.</p>
                <p>A divided leaf may have its lobes again divided, when it is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">bi</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tri-pinnatiful,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">compound</hi> leaf is when the lamina is articulated with the
                    petiole. It is either digitate or pinnate. Leaves are <hi rend="italic"
                    >digitate</hi> (fig. 35) when all the leaflets start from the same point at the
                    apex of the petiole, as in the lupines; in the orange there is but one leaflet;
                    in other plants three, four, or more. Leaves are <hi rend="italic">pinnate</hi>
                    when the leaflets spring out laterally from the common petiole, and are <hi
                    rend="italic">oppositely</hi> (fig. 36) or <hi rend="italic">alternately</hi>
                    pinnate, according as these leaflets are opposite to or alternate with each
                    other; and are <hi rend="italic">imparipinnate</hi> (fig. 36) or <hi
                    rend="italic">pαripinnate</hi> when there is, or is not, a terminal leaflet.
                    When there is but one, two, or three pairs of leaflets, the leaf is said to be
                    <hi rend="italic">unijugate (folium unijugum), bijugate, triĵugate (i∖g.</hi>
                    37), &amp;c. A <hi rend="italic">decompounded</hi> caf is where the common
                    petiole is divided into secondary petioles, each of which bears a foliole or
                    leaflet. Of these, when the secondary petioles all spring from the apex of the
                    common petiole, the leaf is <hi rend="italic">digitato-pinnate;</hi> or when
                    there are only two secondary petioles, <hi rend="italic">conjugato-pinmate</hi>
                    (fig. 38). When each of the secondary petioles bears only one pair of leaflets,
                    the leaf is <hi rend="italic">bigeminate</hi> (fig. 39); and when the secondary
                    petioles spring out as leaflets do in a pinnate leaf, but are themselves
                    pinnate, the leaf is <hi rend="italic">bipinnate,</hi> (fig. 40). Decompounded
                    leaves may be again divided, when they are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >supradecompounded (folia supradecomposita).</hi></p>
                <p>The margin of the divisions of a simple or compound leaf is variously modified.
                    It may be <hi rend="italic">very entire (integerrimum)</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >crenulate,</hi> when furnished with little projecting points; or <hi
                    rend="italic">dentated,</hi> when the margin presents small radiating acute
                    teeth, that neither incline to the bottom nor to the apex of the leaf (fig. 21);
                    or <hi rend="italic">serrated</hi> (fig. 14), when the teeth are inclined; or
                    <hi rend="italic">thorny,</hi> when the teeth are narrow, stiff, and sharp (as
                    in the holly); or <hi rend="italic">ciliated,</hi> when there is a series of
                    hairs along the edge, like a person’s eye-lashes.</p>
                <p>With regard to the <hi rend="italic">expansion, surface, pubescence, consistence,
                    form</hi> (we do not mean by this the superficial shape, but the shape as a
                    mass, of which the other is but a section), and <hi rend="italic">colour,</hi>
                    it is unnecessary to say any thing, having restricted ourselves to a more
                    general view of the subject.</p>
                <p>Leaves unite very easily either with each other or with the stem. When two have
                    their margins close together at the time of their development, they often unite
                    quite accidentally; but there are some plants in which such a union is not
                    accidental, but constant. In the honeysuckle a transition maybe observed from
                    the leaves perfectly distinct, to those that are joined by their bases. The
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Eauhinia</hi> presents many instances of leaves being
                    united by their edges: a palminerved leaf may thus be viewed as composed of
                    several penninerved leaves soldered partly together. When leaves unite to the
                    stem they are termed decurrent; and this may be either caused by the middle
                    nerve coalescing with the stem, as in the floral leaves of the lime tree, or by
                    the adherence merely of a prolongation of the parenchyma of the leaf.</p>
                <p>Some botanists speak of an <hi rend="italic">appendiculate</hi> leaf, in which
                    there ought to be an extraneous body attached to it; but the more the structure
                    of the different parts is studied, the fewer instances are to be recorded. Thus
                    a cirrhus or tendril is usually an abortive leaflet, or petiole, or stipule. The
                    supposed appendage of <hi rend="italic">Dionaea muscipula</hi> (fig. 41, <hi
                    rend="italic">a)</hi> is the real lamina of the leaf, while the supposed leaf is
                    the petiole (fig. 41, <hi rend="italic">b).</hi> The pitcher of <hi
                    rend="italic">Nepenthes</hi> (fig. 42, <hi rend="italic">a)</hi> is also now
                    regarded as the leaf; and the lower portion (fig. 42, <hi rend="italic">c)</hi>
                    the petiole, which is partly margined. This plant, however, is scarcely yet
                    completely understood; probably the lid (fig. 42, <hi rend="italic">b)</hi> to
                    the pitcher alone is the limb of the leaf; while the petiole at first consisting
                    (as in the lower leaves (fig. 43, 44) that arise from the plumule on
                    germination) of a mere pitcher, afterwards elongates (fig. 42, <hi rend="italic"
                    >c, a)</hi> into a margined portion, a cirrhus, and a pitcher, In <hi
                    rend="italic">Sarracenia,</hi> said also to have a pitcher-shaped leaf, the
                    petiole forms a hollow sheath with the lamina or lid at its apex.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stipules</hi> (fig. 37, <hi rend="italic">b)</hi> are those
                    small foliaceous organs sometimes situated on each side at the base of the
                    petiole. They never occur in the Endogenae, nor in any Exogenous plants that
                    have sheathing petioles, and are rarely found in genera with opposite leaves.
                    Their presence or absence seems to be eminently connected with the general
                    symmetry of plants, for they exist or are wanting in all of the same family.
                    They have frequently the same structure, and are often transformed into leaves;
                    even leafbuds have been observed in the axils of some of them, so that they may
                    be viewed as rudimentary leaves. Stipules sometimes change into spines; but the
                    spines in <hi rend="italic">Acacia</hi> are not stipules, but prolongations of a
                    swelling of the stem under the leaf, which serves it ais a kind of support. This
                    is evident from there being frequently real stipules independent of the spines;
                    but usually, when the spines are formed, the stipules above them are abortive.
                    Stipules seem occasionally to change into tendrils, and this is the most
                    probable explanation of the lateral tendrils of the gourd and cucumber tribe.
                    They are in general smaller than the leaves; but in <hi rend="italic">Lathyrus
                    aphaca</hi> they are remarkably large, while the leaves are entirely abortive.
                    Those at the base of the same petiole are not always alike; one of them even in
                    some plants becoming abortive, while the other persists. Stipules that are
                    situated between the petiole and the branch are <hi rend="italic"
                    >intrapetiolar;</hi> and, in the case of opposite leaves, when they are between
                    the two opposite petioles, they are <hi rend="italic">interpetiolar,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">intrafoliaceous.</hi> Stipules sometimes unite together, and when
                    so, if they form a sheath round the stem, they are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >ochreae;</hi> and if the union take place between the petiole and the stem they
                    are termed <hi rend="italic">intra-axillary.</hi> They also often adhere to the
                    petiole by their margins, and then one must use the greatest caution not to
                    confound with them the cellular appendages of the petiole itself.</p>
                <p>Leaves arise on the young shoots, or already exist more or less developed jvhen
                    the shoot begins to appear. At this period the external leaves frequently take
                    the appearance of scales, and serve as a ’ protection to the others. The compact
                    mode in which the young leaves are arranged before expansion is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">vernation</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gemmation,</hi> and is
                    determined by different causes, viz. their position on the stem and mode of
                    adherence, the disposition of the principal nerves, and the different degrees of
                    separation or union of the parts. All the appearances resulting from these may
                    be reduced to three classes: 1⅛ They are folded or rolled longitudinally on the
                    midrib, which remains straight; or, 2cZ, they are folded or curved, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193733544" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3544-0037"/> so that the
                    summit touches the base; or, 3d, they are neither curved nor folded in a
                    sensible degree.</p>
                <p>The usual state of Exogenous plants is to have the leaves so folded that the two
                    parts of the lamina on each side the midrib are applied to each other by their
                    upper surface; but this is much modified by other circumstances. Thus, when two
                    penninerved leaves are strictly opposite, and another pair at right angles to
                    these, they are only half folded, in such a way as to inclose the inner pair;
                    and such a vernation is termed <hi rend="italic">opposite</hi> (fig. 45). When
                    less decidedly opposite, one of the sides of each leaf is exterior and the other
                    interior (fig. 46), and then the vernation is <hi rend="italic">half-equitant
                    {semiamplexa)</hi>; and when the leaves are alternate or spiral, they are each
                    of them folded by themselves, and placed side by side, when it is called <hi
                    rend="italic">conduplicate</hi> (fig. 47.) Palminerved leaves being considered
                    as composed of several penninerved ones united by their margins for some part of
                    their length, each of the divisions has a tendency to be folded, exhibiting a
                    <hi rend="italic">plicate</hi> vernation (fig. 48). The leaflets of palmate
                    leaves present of course the same disposition. Some penninerved leaves, although
                    folded together, have the margins rolled outwards, as in the rosemary, and the
                    vernation is <hi rend="italic">revolute</hi> (fig. 49); or they may be rolled
                    in, as in the water-lily, and it is <hi rend="italic">involute</hi> (fig. 50).
                    These latter peculiarities are very rare among the Exogenae, but common among
                    the Endogenae. When the young leaves are so narrow that they are not folded, but
                    cover each other without any apparent order, they are said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">imbricated.</hi> Such plants as have a petiole that embraces the
                    stem for some length (which chiefly happens among the Endogenae) present a
                    slightly different disposition. Here most of the leaves are reduced to a dilated
                    petiole, and are simply curved and imbricated the one over the other, as in the
                    coats of what are erroneously called bulbous roots (fig. 8); but there are other
                    plants with a sheathing petiole, that show an inclination to a
                    longitudinally-folded leaf (as in the <hi rend="italic">Iris')</hi> as much as
                    if they had a midrib, and the vernation is <hi rend="italic">equitant</hi> (fig.
                    51); so called because, as they are alternate, each of them rides upon or
                    embraces by its two margins the two margins of the leaf that follows it. Another
                    disposition, but almost peculiar to the Endogenae, is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >convolute</hi> (fig. 52), as in the scitamineae, where the limb is rolled round
                    one of its margins on an axis. The vernation is termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >replicate</hi> when the leaf is so folded that the upper part is applied to the
                    lower, as in the aconite; and <hi rend="italic">circinal</hi> when, instead of
                    being folded, it is rolled in such a way that the apex serves as an axis; which
                    last curious structure may be observed in the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Drosera,</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">Cycadeae.</hi><hi rend="italic
                    smallcaps"> Cellular Plants.</hi></p>
                <p>The observations hitherto made relate almost exclusively to Vascular plants, the
                    terms relating to the external forms of which alone can be applied also to the
                    Cellular vegetables; so that, before proceeding to the reproductive organs, we
                    may devote a few lines to such as come under the latter denomination. And here
                    we must draw a line between such as are furnished with ducts in addition to mere
                    cellular tissue, and those in which we find an entire homogeneousness of
                    structure; and, for the sake of distinction, we shall call the former <hi
                    rend="italic">ductulosoe,</hi> and the latter <hi rend="italic"
                    >edux-tulosoe.</hi><hi rend="italic">Ductulosoe.</hi></p>
                <p>All belonging to this section, on account of the presence of ducts, and in some
                    instances apparently of stems, more than one author of eminence has classed with
                    vascular plants; but' there are no spiral vessels present, and although it is
                    often difficult to distinguish between spiral vessels and ducts, we prefer to
                    make the characters of the two great classes of vegetables depend on the
                    presence or absence of the former, rather than of the latter; the more so
                    because we feel convinced, that, with the aid of spiral vessels, and not without
                    them, can true seeds be produced. As ducts are always to be observed in roots,
                    even in the most fibrous, so there is a presumption that true roots exist in all
                    the ductulosoe. As, however, no spiral vessels occur above the root, there can
                    be no collum or line of separation between stem and root, and therefore the
                    whole plant may be viewed as one uniform body, every section presenting the same
                    structure. On account of the appearance of stems, the ductulosoe may be said to
                    have an axis.</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">Equisetaceae</hi> must first be noticed. These have
                    little or no resemblance to the other ductulosoe, and almost as little to the
                    vascular plants. Their nearest affinity is perhaps with the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Casuarina</hi> (one of the Exogenae). Their vernation is straight.
                    They have no true leaves, but a furrowed fistular stem, in which, under the
                    cuticle or external membranous coating, so much silex is deposited as to render
                    some of the species of great use in polishing furniture and other household
                    utensils. The stem is moreover articulated, separating at the joints, each
                    articulation being surrounded by a prolongation of the joint below it in the
                    shape of a membranous toothed sheath; the number of the teeth, if not combined,
                    corresponding with the number of the furrows on the stem. The stem is either
                    simple, or has branches articulated like the stem, placed in whorls at their
                    articulations, each whorl consisting of as many branches as there are teeth to
                    the sheath.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Filices</hi> or ferns seem to approach very closely to
                    some of the Endogenae, particularly to the palms, in general habit, and also
                    slightly to the <hi rend="italic">Cycadeae,</hi> which form part of the
                    Exogenae; but if our ideas be correct, the affinities that have been traced
                    between them have been much exaggerated.</p>
                <p>In our estimation, an entire fern corresponds only to a leaf among the vascular
                    plants; and that part which has been called a <hi rend="italic">stem</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">rhizorna</hi> under ground, or a <hi rend="italic">stipes</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">caudex</hi> when erect and above ground, as in the tree ferns,
                    is, we think, analogous to a mere petiole. Each leafy expansion has been termed
                    a <hi rend="italic">frond,</hi> without sufficient attention having been paid to
                    its origin. But a frond whose stipes pushes out radicular fibres from its base,
                    is, we think, similar to a simple leaf; while those species whose frond is
                    attached to a rhizoma or caudex resembles a pinnate leaf. Thus the ferns do not
                    resemble vascular plants, but only a portion of one. The vernation of all, with
                    the exception of <hi rend="italic">Ophioglossurn</hi> and its allies, is
                    circinnate like the <hi rend="italic">Cycadeae;</hi> but instead of being rolled
                    inwards, it is rolled outwards, unlike any vascular plant that we remember. As,
                    however, the views here announced have not hitherto been adopted by any
                    botanist, we may, in reference to the terms more generally in use, mention, that
                    every leafy portion which rises aboveground is termed a <hi rend="italic"
                    >frond,</hi> and its stalk or support a <hi rend="italic">stipes.</hi> The
                    creeping part under ground or on the surface is termed a <hi rend="italic"
                    >rhizoma,</hi> and when erect and like the trunk of a tree, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >caudex.</hi> The stipes is flattish or concave on the side corresponding with
                    the upper surface of the frond, and convex on the other. It is <hi rend="italic"
                    >glabrous,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rough,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >prickly,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sealy(paleaceus),</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >dσινny {pubescens),</hi> as in vascular plants. The frond is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">simple,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lobed,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >pinnatiful,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pinnatipartite,</hi> as in a true leaf.
                    It is even called <hi rend="italic">pinnate</hi> when there is no membranous
                    connection between the divisions, although there be no articulation at the base
                    of each. In substance also it may vary from rigid and coriaceous to thin and
                    membranous.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Marsiliaceae.</hi> These are either creeping or floating <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193733557" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3557-0038"/> plants; the
                    former have petioles to what are called their leaves, with a circinnate
                    vernation like the ferns. The supposed leaves are of a coriaceous texture, and
                    either consist of three or more wedge-shaped divisions, and are conduplicate
                    when young; or they are entirely abortive, leaving nothing but the petiole, as
                    in <hi rend="italic">Pilularia.</hi> T hose, again, which float have the leaves
                    closely imbricated and sessile, and resemble the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hepaticae,</hi> and appear to be involute, or folded together in vernation.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Lycopodiaceae</hi> are seemingly intermediate between the
                    ferns and mosses with which they were formerly confounded. They have either
                    creeping stems or a cormus, with erect branches, which are either round or
                    angled, and provided with leaves. The leaves vary from setaceous to ovate, are
                    acute, undivided (with only one exception), smooth, and of a thick texture,
                    resembling often in a slight degree those of the pine tribe. In several,
                    however, they are plain and foliaceous; sometimes they are closely imbricated
                    round the stem, or they appear distichous, with generally two other rows of
                    smaller ones, that are appressed, and may be taken for stipules. They have
                    either a middle nerve or none at all. In one genus, the leaves are reduced to
                    mere scattered teeth, and in another they are all radical, long, subulate,
                    channelled above, and convex below. Their vernation is straight. They are
                    usually found on mossy ground, sometimes on trees, rarely in or under water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Eductulosae.</hi></p>
                <p>These are entirely composed of cellular tissue, so that here we find as much
                    uniformity in their internal structure as diversity in the other classes of
                    vegetables; but, by a strange compensation, their external forms are even more
                    varied than in the higher organised plants.</p>
                <p>The entire mass of these vegetables appears to be composed of one substance,
                    which takes different shapes, destined to fill different functions, without
                    actually constituting distinct organs. Persoon, in speaking of the mushroom, has
                    named the whole portion that does not serve for the reproduction of the species
                    a <hi rend="italic">peridium;</hi> Acharius has called it a <hi rend="italic"
                    >thallus</hi> in the lichens; and Lamaroux,∕ ’ roMs or <hi rend="italic"
                    >frond</hi> in the algae. De Candolle, again, is disposed to apply the term <hi
                    rend="italic">thallus</hi> generically to all the nutritive organs combined in
                    the true cellular plants, at least to those of the algae, fungi, lichens, and
                    hepaticae; and it would be well if botanists, who have made these tribes their
                    study, had agreed to drop entirely the terms <hi rend="italic">leaves,
                    stem,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">roots,</hi> which have no real affinity with
                    those of vascular plants, and can be only applied metaphorically. But as they
                    are generally retained in some of these orders, we will continue also to employ
                    them.</p>
                <p>5. The <hi rend="italic">Musci</hi> or mosses have most affinity with the
                    ductulosae, and approach very closely indeed to some of the lycopodiaceae. What
                    are called their roots consist of slender fibres of a brownish colour, more or
                    less branched and jointed, which spring either from the base of the stem, as in
                    <hi rend="italic">Phascum,</hi> or along it, as in several species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Eryum,</hi> in which great part of the stem is sometimes covered
                    with these radicular fibres. The stem is cylindrical, but is said to be
                    compressed, plane, or tetragonal, according to the disposition of the leaves. It
                    is often very short and simple, especially when the plant is annual, but is
                    sometimes branched, either by pushing out roots near the base, or by emitting
                    lateral or terminal branches, each of which denotes usually a year’s growth, and
                    they are thus called by Hedwig <hi rend="italic">innovations.</hi> The leaves
                    arise from the stems, being sometimes collected together at the base, sometimes
                    at the apex, and sometimes alternate or in a spiral: they <hi rend="superscript"
                    > 1</hi> are sessile, and embrace the stem at their base; and they have the
                    appearance of oval or elongated scales, rarely obtuse, generally pointed or
                    acuminated, and the point is not unfrequently prolonged into a long hair, or
                    twisted like a cirrhus or tendril. Only one instance is yet known where the
                    hair-like point is branched. They are usually entire, but in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diphyscium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Buxbaumia</hi> they are laciniated. Some
                    leaves are deprived of all appearance of a nerve, and are entirely formed of a
                    homogeneous cellular tissue; others present in the middle a nerve variable in
                    length; others again two nerves; and these nerves are formed of cells, which by
                    their union imitate the nerves of vascular leaves. The margin is either entire,
                    crenated, toothed, or serrated; and the serratures are sometimes so fine as to
                    cause it to be called ciliated; but these appearances are not occasioned, as in
                    vascular plants, by (as it were) an incision into the leaf, but arise from a
                    mere contraction of the marginal cellules, more or less evident in the same
                    species, and even specimen, in different states of its growth. The leaves, as we
                    have said, embrace the stem, but sometimes in so very oblique a manner as to
                    form two opposite vertical rows, and thus appear distichous, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Schistos-tega pennata.</hi> But this must not be confounded with
                    the structure in that section of <hi rend="italic">Dicranum</hi> called <hi
                    rend="italic">Eissidens,</hi> in which the leaf is slightly folded, and the
                    upper portion on each side of the nerve soldered closely together, while the
                    nerve itself is prolonged at the back into an appendage equal to the half of the
                    leaf. Some botanists seem inclined to suppose that these leaves, resembling
                    those of an <hi rend="italic">Iris,</hi> may be formed by the partial soldering
                    of two closely approximated and obliquely placed leaves; blit we are borne out
                    in our view by an examination of the young leaves, either at the very base of
                    the stems, or at the perichaetium, in which they are as in other mosses, the
                    nerve not being yet provided with its appendage.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Arnott, <hi rend="italic">Nouν. Disp. des
                    Mrnsses,</hi> p. 27∙</p></note></p>
                <p>6. The <hi rend="italic">Hepaticae</hi> resemble much the mosses, and most of all
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Jungermannia.</hi> But here there is no trace of
                    nerves; and at the base of the leaves are often to be found leafy appendages or
                    accessory leaves, falsely called stipules, sometimes united by the side to the
                    leaf and sometimes distinct from it. There are some species of this genus
                    without these appendages, having the leaves vertical, scarcely at all embracing
                    the stem, but having their margins prolonged down its side, so that the stem
                    resembles a petiole furnished with distichous segments. When these segments are
                    united by the edges on each side, we have a foliaceous limb, and such species
                    are called <hi rend="italic">frondose,</hi> the midrib corresponding to what is
                    termed the stem in the others. Sometimes this midrib is obscure, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Jung.epiphylia;</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Jung.pinguis</hi> it
                    cannot be traced, so that we may pass to the genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anthoceras, Marchantia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Riccia,</hi> in which we see
                    only a nerveless foliaceous disc, representing both stem and leaves; pushing out
                    from below, the roots; and from above, the organs of fructification. From the
                    supposed existence of a stem and leaves, both musci and hepaticae are said to
                    have an axis.</p>
                <p>. 7. The <hi rend="italic">Algae</hi> are principally found in water, and con-,
                    sist of expansions, sometimes filiform, sometimes foliaceous, or a mixture of
                    these. Their perfect homogeneousness has been acknowledged by all who have
                    studied them, and thus the appellations of frond or thallus has been given to
                    the whole mass of the plant. They present different degrees of consistence; some
                    being coriaceous and of an olive colour, others cartilaginous and of a rose
                    colour; some membranaceous, and others gelatinous. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193733570" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3570-0039"/> • large species, in
                    particular, so subject to be tossed about by the violent motion of the waves of
                    the sea, are furnished with a small flat base called a <hi rend="italic">callous
                    disc,</hi> by which they are fixed to the rocks; and others are provided for the
                    same purpose with short, blunt, and often thick, rootlike processes. The
                    foliaceous part of the algae is often traversed with veins similar in appearance
                    to the nerves in true leaves; but these are merely composed of elongated
                    cellular tissue; while other species are entirely destitute of them. The cells
                    of this tribe are variously approximated in the same plant; and hence we have
                    frequently a sort of bark, distinct as it were from the central portion:
                    sometimes they are arranged so that one cell constitutes the whole thickness of
                    the frond, which thus becomes very thin and membranous; in other cases they are
                    placed end to end, forming threads, as in the <hi rend="italic">Confervae.</hi>
                    These threads are moreover usually furnished with dissepiments or partitions at
                    nearly equal distances, bearing a pretty constant proportion to the diameter of
                    the thread. The genus <hi rend="italic">Hydrodictyon</hi> presents a remarkable
                    structure: the frond is composed of numerous pentagons, each of the five sides
                    of which are confervoid threads, that in maturity separate from each other, and
                    give rise to plants similar to that of which they formed a part. <hi
                    rend="italic">Chara</hi> is supposed to have an axis, the other algae none; but
                    some species of the fuci and confervae tribes present as much an axis as the
                    other.</p>
                <p>8. Among the <hi rend="italic">Lichens</hi> the variety of form is still greater.
                    Some present plane foliaceous expansions, as in the hepaticas; others are of a
                    substance quite gelatinous, as in some <hi rend="italic">Algae.</hi> Some have
                    cylindrical stems, more or less branched, of which several are provided with
                    small, plane, leaf-like processes; in other species all these different forms
                    are reduced to so small dimensions that the whole thallus, or nutritive organs
                    of the plant, consists of a mere crust, composed either of foliaceous scales, of
                    small stems compactly placed together, or of a granular or pulverulent matter.
                    The surface presents also much variation: sometimes it is quite smooth;
                    sometimes provided with hairs or ciliae of different kinds; and sometimes it
                    pushes out fibres, which serve to fix the plant. In many species the thallus,
                    without the intervention of any fibres or roots, is so cemented to the rock or
                    tree on which it grows, that it cannot be detached. In the flat species the two
                    surfaces are very dissimilar, both in colour and structure. But lichens even
                    appear to consist of two distinct layers of tissue. Of these the interior, which
                    Eschweiller has termed the living or medullary portion of the thallus, is
                    imperfectly cellular or filamentous; while the other, the cortical or exterior,
                    seems to be merely formed of the dead cellules of the former, and to serve as a
                    protection to it.</p>
                <p>9. The <hi rend="italic">Fungi</hi> present cells, sometimes round and sometimes
                    elongated, in the form' of hollow threads, which are either placed closely
                    together or irregularly separated. Their consistence is variable, being soft or
                    hard, fibrous or gelatinous, fleshy or coriaceous. They never grow in water.
                    Their colours are variable, often vivid, but never truly green. There is
                    scarcely anything that can be termed a frond or thallus; but instead of it there
                    is often a peridium or sporangium, that covers the fructiferous organs; indeed,
                    the whole plant maybe viewed generally as a mass of reproductive matter. In the
                    agarics and other allied genera there is a <hi rend="italic">stipes,</hi>
                    metaphorically called a stem, which arises from a membranous integument, termed
                    a <hi rend="italic">volva</hi> or wrapper, that in the young state envelopes
                    thj≡ whole. The upper horizontal part of these plants is called a cap or <hi
                    rend="italic">pileus,</hi> which is provided on its under side with thin
                    radiating expansions, termed gills or <hi rend="italic">lamedae,</hi> or with
                    fine tubes. Some have a delicate fringe or veil <hi rend="italic">(velum),</hi>
                    that connects the margin of the pileus at a certain age with the stem: in a few
                    this veil has the appearance of a&lt; ring round the stipes, and is then called
                    an <hi rend="italic">annulus.</hi></p>
                <p>REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS.</p>
                <p>We now come to the reproductive organs, or those organs essential to the
                    reproduction of the plant; and under this denomination we comprehend all those
                    parts that are situated beyond the leaves. Linnaeus first made the observation,
                    that the parts of a flower were metamorphosed leaves; and this will appear very
                    evident from considering the facility with which any one part changes into
                    aríother. Thus, leaves gradually pass into bracteas, and the latter have often
                    so much the appearance of true leaves as to be only distinguished from them by
                    their position. Between bracteae and bracteolae there is scarcely a limit; and
                    either of these, when immediately under the flower, is often liable to be
                    confounded with the calyx, or supplies the place of a calyx. Again, between a
                    calyx and corolla there is the closest resemblance; so much so, that when one
                    only was present, it has been a matter of dispute by what name it ought then to
                    be described ;—Jussieu and his followers calling it uniformly by that of calyx,
                    but Linnaeus pronouncing it a calyx only if green, and a corolla if coloured;
                    whilst more modern botanists, to avoid a discussion attended with little good,
                    have adopted instead of it the ambiguous term <hi rend="italic">perianth.</hi>
                    But horticulture shows this affinity in a still more striking degree; many of
                    the primrose tribe in cultivation having the calyx changed into a corolla placed
                    under the true corolla, and in every respect similar to it. In a double flower,
                    all are aware, the stamina change into petals; and in the water-lily <hi
                    rend="italic">(Nymphaea)</hi> it is no easy matter to draw the respective lines
                    of demarcation between stamens, corolla, and calyx. It is more difficult to
                    admit at first the connection between the fruit and the others, instances of the
                    metamorphosis being more rare. Thus, in half double flowers, the fruit, or parts
                    of the fruit, or carpella as they are called, remain often unchanged, as in the
                    peony; but in many truly double flowers, as among the pinks and carnations,
                    every portion of the fruit is actually transformed into petals. On the other
                    hand, in <hi rend="italic">Magnolia fuscata,</hi> the stamens actually change
                    into carpels; and we have specimens before us, exhibiting the same change in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Salix Croioeana.</hi> In some species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ononis,</hi> and the other genera of leguminous plants, in which there is
                    usually one perfect carpel, we have seen it transformed into a leafy process,
                    demonstrating that the carpel is nothing but a folded leaf.</p>
                <p>The parts belonging to the flower, though thus primarily alike, yet differ much
                    afterwards, particularly in their physiology. The more foliaceous parts, as the
                    bracteae, calyx, and corolla, serve for the nutriment or protection of the
                    others, which are more immediately called the sexual organs. In several parts of
                    the flower we may distinguish the portions of the leaves of which they are
                    composed, so as to detect more or less clearly the petiole and the lamina. Thus,
                    in a calyx the sepals are usually formed by dilated petioles, although in the
                    roses the lamina also makes its appearance. Of the corollas, the petals
                    represent in general a dilated petiole; but sometimes an unguis or claw may be
                    noticed, as well as a limb, conformable to the petiole and lamina of a leaf.
                    Among stamina, the filament is the petiole, while the anther is produced by each
                    side of the lamina being rolled inwards, and forming two loculi or bags. The
                    carpels are formed by the folding of the lamina of a leaf, the ovules arising
                    from the extremities of the lateral nerves. Here the petiole is often wanting,
                    though in several genera of <hi rend="italic">Legurninosae,</hi> in the caper
                    plants, and others, it is very distinct.</p>
                <p>From what we have now said, it may be laid down as an <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193733583" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3583-0040"/> .axiom, that a flower is an
                    assemblage of several whorls of foliaceous origin, arranged above or within each
                    other, so closely that the internodia, or distance between each series, is not
                    distinguishable. But this will be better understood when we come to the
                    definition of the particular parts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Inflorescence.</hi></p>
                <p>Inflorescence is the ramification of that part of a plant intended for its
                    reproduction; or, in other words, it is the mode in which the flowers of a plant
                    are distributed. The organs peculiar to it are peduncles, pedicels, bracteae,
                    and bracteolae or the accessory envelopes to the flowers.</p>
                <p>As leaves are lateral, so must also be the parts of the flower, hence we might
                    naturally expect the-floral stem or branch to be prolonged beyond it; and this
                    indeed often happens in monstrosities, as in some roses and pear trees; but
                    otherwise the flower absorbs all the nutriment from the branch destined to that
                    purpose. Thus we may state as a general law, that a flower is terminal on the
                    little branch that supports it; and this branch is termed a <hi rend="italic"
                    >peduncle</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pedicel.</hi> The pedicel with the flower
                    being thus precisely similar to a branch and its leaves, the flower-bud which
                    gives rise to such must be analogous to leaf-buds; and the great difference
                    between them is, that the latter elongate indefinitely in the form of branches,
                    while the former do not elongate beyond the flower.</p>
                <p>Flower-buds always, therefore, like leaf-buds, are terminal, or arise from the
                    axils of leaves, which leaves are called <hi rend="italic">bracteae</hi> or
                    floral leaves; and those leaves which appear on the pedicel, between the
                    bracteae and calyx, are called <hi rend="italic">bracteolae.</hi> These are
                    often confounded, but are nevertheless essentially distinct; the former
                    belonging more to the stem, the latter to the flower-bud. Bracteas and
                    bracteolae are often beautifully coloured, the more so, usually, the nearer they
                    are to the flower. When a single one is rolled together, highly developed and
                    coloured, and is placed at the base of the form of inflorescence called a spadix
                    (fig. 53, ó), it is named a <hi rend="italic">spatha</hi> (fig. 53, a); and the
                    upper ones, arising among the flowers themselves, are termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >spathellae.</hi> When several are verticillate, or densely imbricated around
                    the base of the form of inflorescence called an umbel or capitulum, they are
                    termed an <hi rend="italic">involucrum;</hi> and those at the base of each
                    partial umbel are called <hi rend="italic">involucella.</hi> In the grasses
                    there are usually two at the base of the spikelets, which receive the nameóf <hi
                    rend="italic">glumes;</hi> while the small ones surrounding each floret in the
                    spikelet, called <hi rend="italic">glumellae</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >paleae,</hi> may be viewed as involucella. Small imbricated bracteas are often
                    called <hi rend="italic">scales,</hi> as in the thistle and artichoke. On
                    dissecting the capitulum of flowers of many of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Compositoe,</hi> small colourless bracteae may be perceived at the base of the
                    florets ;—these have received the name of <hi rend="italic">paleae,</hi> but
                    they appear to be a mere continuation or modification of the scales of the
                    involucrum.</p>
                <p>With regard to the axis of inflorescence and its bracteae, sometimes the axis
                    itself, but more usually the branch which springs from it, is termed a <hi
                    rend="italic">peduncle.</hi> These peduncles often bear bracteae, from the axils
                    of which arise secondary peduncles. The same may again happen, and the ultimate
                    support to the flower is then termed a <hi rend="italic">pedicel.</hi> A pedicel
                    may be clothed with bracteolae; but these have no flower-buds in their axils,
                    and therefore each can only, strictly speaking, bear but one flower. In the
                    honeysuckles there appear to be two flowers and two fruits to each stalk, but
                    this is caused by the combination or union of the two pedicels that terminate
                    the axis. When two or more pedicels spring near to each other from the axis of
                    inflorescence, the axis is termed a <hi rend="italic">rαchis.</hi> Those axes
                    that spring out of the earth, and bear no true leaves, are denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">scapes.</hi> Pe duncles are usually cylindrical or slightly
                    compressed; in &lt; <hi rend="italic">Xylophyllum</hi> it is said to be flat or
                    foliaceous, but this appearance originates rather from the expansion of the axis
                    or rachis than of the peduncle itself. In the case of an umbel, the axis tends
                    to dilate at the apex, and this dilatation seems to depend on two causes: it is
                    either in proportion to the number of flowers that ought to be on the summit, or
                    it becomes the larger the more sessile the flowers are on the horizontal
                    expansion. That kind of umbel found in thistles and other compound flowers is a
                    remarkable illustration of this: the expansion on which the flowers are situated
                    here bears the name of <hi rend="italic">receptacle;</hi> some few botanists
                    calling it also, in particular cases <hi rend="italic">plioranth</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">clinanth.</hi> These receptacles are sometimes quite flat,
                    sometimes conical or cylindrical, and sometimes concave; and in the fig the
                    margins of the receptacle are so approximated as to represent a bag, on the
                    interior surface of which all the flowers are seated. By many botanists the axis
                    of inflorescence is termed the peduncle, and the peduncles pedicels. But it is
                    impossible here to lay down any certain rules by which these may be understood,
                    the same author at different times using the same terms with a different
                    meaning.</p>
                <p>The inflorescence of plants is very various, and depends entirely on the power of
                    developing the flower-buds in the axils of the bracteas. Two points are,
                    however, common to all the forms: all must be axillary, or a modification of
                    that, and have the flowers terminal on the peduncles or pedicels. They may be
                    reduced to two classes; <hi rend="italic">simple,</hi> when it is formed by the
                    development of one bud and one branch; or <hi rend="italic">compound,</hi> when
                    it is formed by the development of several buds or branches.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Simple inflorescence.—</hi> When a flower-bud gives rise to
                    only one flower, terminal on its peduncle, and the axis of the plant does not
                    elongate beyond the bud, the flower is commonly called <hi rend="italic"
                    >terminal and solitary.</hi> When, however, the axis continues to elongate, and
                    the bractea retains the form and size of a leaf, the flower is called <hi
                    rend="italic">axillary and solitary.</hi> But if the buds, instead of giving
                    rise to one terminal flower, have the axis elongated, bearing several flowers,
                    and each flower on a peduncle, a <hi rend="italic">raceme</hi> is produced; and
                    when each flower is sessile, or placed in the axil of the bracteae, without a
                    peduncle, a <hi rend="italic">spike</hi> is formed. The difference between these
                    two is very slight, or. more properly speaking, a spike is a mere conventional
                    term, to imply those cases where the peduncle is scarcely perceptible; and, by
                    the aid of horticulture, the one is frequently made to pass into the other. When
                    the bracteas are nearly equal in size and closely imbricated, and the spike
                    articulated with the stem, it is termed an <hi rend="italic">amentum</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">catkin:</hi> but this articulation is often not to be detected;
                    thus, in some willows, the male catkins fall off, while the female are
                    permanent. The real spikes of the grasses are commonly termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >spikelets</hi> or <hi rend="italic">locustae;</hi> and when we there speak of
                    the flowers being in spikes or panicles, we actually mean that the spikelets are
                    arranged in spikes or panicles. The <hi rend="italic">spadix</hi> (fig. 53, ó)
                    is a sort of spike, in which the flowers are closely packed together upon a
                    succulent axis, which is enveloped in a coloured convoluted bractea or spatha:
                    the spadix is usually simple, but in some palms it is branched. A <hi
                    rend="italic">raceme</hi> differs, as we have said, from a <hi rend="italic"
                    >spike</hi> by having the pedicels that issue from the bracteas more elongated.
                    When a raceme has its peduncles spreading, elongated, and bearing bracteae, and
                    pedicels again arising from these bracteae, a <hi rend="italic">panicle</hi> is
                    formed. Usually in these two the lower peduncles are only slightly longer than
                    the others; but when they are very long, and the upper ones very short, it is
                    commonly termed a <hi rend="italic">corymb.</hi> But this appellation was given
                    before the subject of inflorescence was properly studied, and with De <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193733596" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3596-0041"/> Candolle we feel
                    inclined to adopt here the terms <hi rend="italic">corymbose raceme,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">corymbose panicle.</hi> When the axis of a raceme is so very short
                    that all the peduncles issue from one point at its apex, we have a simple umbel;
                    and when the same happens to a panicle and to its branches, a compound umbel is
                    formed. In these frequently the bracteas fall off early, or are abortive. A <hi
                    rend="italic">capitulum</hi> may be either a spike, raceme, or umbel, in which
                    all the flowers are placed together in a globular head. Capitula also differ
                    from each other by the form of the axis, many kinds of which may be seen among
                    the <hi rend="italic">Compositoe.</hi> Now, as all these different kinds of
                    inflorescence spring from a solitary flower-bud,—and as a flower-bud is quite
                    analogous to a leaf-bud,—and as in a leaf-bud the outer or lower part is first
                    developed ;—so in a spike, a raceme, a panicle, an umbel, or a capitulum, the
                    lower flowers are first expanded, and this mode of flowering or order of
                    expansion is called <hi rend="italic">centripetal.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Compound inflorescence,</hi> or when the inflorescence is the result of the
                    expansion of several buds or branches.—The most perfect -instance of this is a
                    true <hi rend="italic">corymbus.</hi> Here the axis of the plant assumes the
                    appearance of an axis of inflorescence, developing flower-buds which follow the
                    centripetal order of expansion; but as it is a continuation of the axis of the
                    branch, and as we have already observed that those leaf-buds nearest to the
                    summit are first developed, so, in a compound inflorescence, the flower-buds
                    towards the extremity of the axis are first evolved, and the lower ones the
                    last. In a corymbus, then, each particular branch follows the centripetal law,
                    while the whole mass of inflorescence proceeds in an inverted order. Although we
                    have only referred to the corymb generally as a mode of inflorescence,
                    individually it resembles a raceme, of which the lower flowers have long, and
                    the upper ones short pedicels. The <hi rend="italic">Achillea millefolium</hi>
                    will well illustrate the corymb; each of what is commonly called the flowers of
                    such a plant being a capitulum. Now, let us suppose that the capitulum of such
                    an inflorescence is by some means reduced to a solitary floret,—and
                    approximations to this are to be observed in many <hi rend="italic"
                    >Compositoe,—</hi> we shall then have a <hi rend="italic">cyme,</hi> in which
                    the solitary central flower is first developed, and, lastly, the lower ones.
                    This kind of expansion is called the <hi rend="italic">centrifugal.</hi>
                    Viewing, with De Candolle and Roeper, the terminal bud by which a branch is
                    prolonged, as similar in all respects to a true leaf-bud, and supposing in the
                    same way the existence of a terminal flower-bud, this kind of inflorescence has
                    received the name of <hi rend="italic">terminal</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >definite,</hi> because the flower being supposed to occupy the extremity of the
                    branch, no more can be formed beyond it; while the centripetal inflorescence has
                    been termed <hi rend="italic">indefinite</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >axillary,</hi> because the axis being never terminated by a flower-bud, it may
                    be elongated until there be no morejuiccs left for the further development of
                    the flower-buds. The term <hi rend="italic">cyme</hi> is usually applied to
                    those cases in which the primary branches issue from the same point, while the
                    smaller branches are unequal, starting from different points, but elevating the
                    flowers so that they may be nearly all in one horizontal plane, as in the elder
                    or dogwood. But this is not always the case: the central portion may be
                    elongated; and then, when the peduncles and pedicels are relatively opposite to
                    each other, as in <hi rend="italic">Erythroea,</hi> we have what are called
                    dichotomous cymes. A <hi rend="italic">fasciculus,</hi> on the other hand, is a
                    contracted cyme, in which the lateral branches are very short, and the flowers
                    are clustered together, as in many of the pink tribe. A <hi rend="italic"
                    >glomerulus</hi> is when the cyme is so contracted, and the ramification is so
                    little apparent, that it has been usually confounded with a true capitulum. This
                    disposition is of rare occurrence, but is to be observed in some <hi
                    rend="italic">Compositae.</hi> The last form of inflorescence we shall notice is
                    a <hi rend="italic">thyrsus;</hi> and this may be conceived to be composed of
                    cymes, arising from the axils of the leaves of a branch as it is successively
                    developed. Thus the sage, the thyme, and the labiate plants, exhibit a thyrsus.
                    The stem or branch is prolonged indefinitely, of which the lower flowers first
                    make their appearance; but the inflorescence that proceeds from the axil of each
                    leaf is a true cyme, in which the terminal flowers are first expanded.</p>
                <p>If we be correct in what we have stated, the centrifugal mode of expansion is a
                    reduced form of the centripetal, combined with the mode of development of
                    branches. It ought, therefore, to be scarcely distinguished from the other; and
                    cases do occur only referable by analogy. Roeper and De Candolle, who admit the
                    existence of terminal flower-buds, observe that the terminal mode has two
                    opposite bracteae, while the axillary has but one; and they apply this test with
                    great ingenuity to the case of a solitary peduncle and flowers, in order that it
                    may be referred to one or the other of the two classes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Torus.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">torus,</hi> or the proper receptacle of the flowers, is an
                    expansion of the pedicel, from which spring the petals and stamina, and seems to
                    be formed by an abortion or partial development of one or both of these parts.
                    Although, therefore, not properly by itself an organ, it is of great importance
                    in the structure of flowers-; for not only do the stamens and petals arise from
                    it in the state in which they usually appear to us, but even when these are
                    transformed into nectariferous glands, or into those doubtful bodies sometimes
                    confounded with stamens and sometimes with petals. These appearances may
                    therefore be met with either outside of the petals, or inside of the stamina, or
                    between these. Usually, however, the torus is inconspicuous, and is reduced to a
                    narrow circular space between the calyx and the pistil. When this zone is under
                    the ovary the petals and stamens are said to be hypogynous, and the plants are
                    termed <hi rend="italic">thalamifloroe.</hi> But frequently the external part of
                    the torus extends itself along the bottom or the interior of the calyx, and the
                    stamina and petals are said to be <hi rend="italic">perigynous,</hi> and the
                    plants are called <hi rend="italic">calycifloroe.</hi> When the inner portion of
                    the torus expands along the pistil in a greater or less degree, the stamens and
                    petals then seem to arise from the pistil, and are denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >epigynous.</hi> But there is still another case, when the torus extends both
                    along the calyx and the pistil at the same time; and a necessary consequence of
                    this is, that the tube of the calyx adheres to the pistil. The petals and
                    stamens thus spring from a zone round the apex of the fruit, and between it and
                    the calyx, and seem to be seated on the fruit itself; an appearance which has
                    induced botanists to apply to it also the term <hi rend="italic">epigynous.</hi>
                    But if these two kinds of epigynous insertion were to be considered as but one,
                    so ought in the same way what is called perigynous to be viewed as a
                    modification of the hypogynous; for in the perigynous the torus, though
                    connected with the calyx, was distinct from the fruit, and as much under it as
                    in the true hypogynous; and, strictly speaking, both the perigynous and second
                    kind of hypogynous may be regarded as combinations of the other two. Most modern
                    botanists have, however, considerably altered the signification of some of these
                    terms, especially when speaking of the insertion of the stamens. According to
                    them, when the stamens contract no adhesion with either the calyx or the pistil,
                    they are <hi rend="italic">hypogynous;</hi> when they do arise from the calyx,
                    but are free from the pistil, they are said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >perigynous,</hi> and such does not differ from the view we have taken above;
                    but when the stamens contract an union with both the surface of the calyx and
                    the pistil, they are <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733609"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-3609-0042"/> termed <hi rend="italic">epigynous,</hi> while
                    the true epigynous insertion, or where the stamina are united to the style, but
                    free from the calyx, receives the name of <hi rend="italic">gynandrous.</hi> We
                    think it right to state here, that it is in the altered sense that epigynous is
                    now usually adopted in systematic works. When the torus is conspicuous, and of a
                    fleshy nature, it is often known by the name of <hi rend="italic">disc.</hi> To
                    those bodies between the calyx and pistil, unlike either the stamens or petals,
                    of the nature of which Linnaeus was uncertain, he gave the general name of <hi
                    rend="italic">nectary.</hi><hi rend="italic">Floral Envelopes.</hi></p>
                <p>These immediately surround the sexual organs, and are formed of one or more
                    whorls of variously modified leaves. When there are two whorls, the plants are
                    termed <hi rend="italic">dichlamy-dcae,</hi> and the outer is cal!ed a calyx,
                    the interior a corolla.</p>
                <p>Calyx.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">calyx</hi> is usually of a green colour, and foliaceous;
                    each segment is termed a <hi rend="italic">sepal;</hi> those like leaves are
                    sometimes articulated at their base, when they are either quite distinct from
                    each other, or cohere in the form of a lid (as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eschseholzia)</hi> during the flowering of the plant. But they are often
                    continuous with the peduncle, and consequently persistent. In such cases they
                    are either distinct, or are united together by their margins. When the sepals
                    are distinct, the calyx is said to be <hi rend="italic">bi-, tri-,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">poly-sepalous,</hi> according as there are two, three, or many
                    leaves; and when soldered, it is called <hi rend="italic">gamosepalous,</hi> or,
                    by the strict followers of the Linnaean nomenclature, <hi rend="italic"
                    >monophyllous;</hi> when only slightly united at the base, it is <hi
                    rend="italic">partite (hi-, tri-, quadripartitus,</hi> &amp;c.); when united to
                    the middle, it is termed <hi rend="italic">divided (hi-, trifidus,</hi>
                    &amp;c.); and when soldered till near the apex, it is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >toothed (hi-, tridentatus,</hi> &amp;c.). If no teeth be perceptible, it is
                    then <hi rend="italic">entire;</hi> and in that case the number of parts must be
                    determined analogically, or by other means. The cohering portion is termed the
                    tube. Some sepals in the same calyx may cohere together in a greater degree than
                    the others, and this gives rise to a <hi rend="italic">bilabiate</hi> calyx. In
                    a few genera with articulated sepals, the divisions cohere together, but
                    separate from the tube in the form of a lid or operculum. Sometimes the calyx is
                    reduced to a mere ring round the base of the corolla. In the Valerians this ring
                    is afterwards developed into a <hi rend="italic">ļìappus,</hi> formed of
                    numerous long and fine radiating segments. In many <hi rend="italic"
                    >Composites</hi> the margin of the calyx also constitutes a pappus, appearing
                    either in the form of a ring, or bristles, or scales, or rough hairs <hi
                    rend="italic">(pilosus'),</hi> or feathery hairs <hi rend="italic"
                    >(plumosus).</hi> The calyx may be free from, or unattached to, the fruit; or
                    the tube may be closely incorporated with it, or <hi rend="italic">adherent
                    (calyx adhoerens).</hi></p>
                <p>Corolla.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">corolla</hi> is for the most part more or less coloured;
                    and it exists in the greater part of the Exogenous plants. Sometimes it is very
                    small, and reduced to the appearance of mere scales, and even in some genera is
                    quite abortive; and when this happens, we must proceed with the greatest
                    caution, and depend much on analogy, so as not to confound those groups of
                    plants in which it ought to be present with those furnished with a perianth, in
                    which a true corolla is always supposed to be absent. The divisions of the
                    corolla are called <hi rend="italic">petals.</hi> They are almost always
                    articulated at the base, and consequently fall off; and when this happens at a
                    very early stage, they are said to be <hi rend="italic">caducous.</hi> When the
                    petals have no articulation, as in <hi rend="italic">Campanula,</hi> they either
                    remain for a long time, or are <hi rend="italic">persistent;</hi> or are <hi
                    rend="italic">marcescent,</hi> when they wither away without falling off. When
                    the petals are quite distinct from each other, the corolla is <hi rend="italic"
                    >polypetalous;</hi> or, when more or less united by their margins from the base
                    upwards, <hi rend="italic">monopetalous,</hi> an in- &lt; correct term, which
                    ought to be exchanged for <hi rend="italic">gamopetalous;</hi> and then it may
                    be <hi rend="italic">partite, divided, toothed,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >entire,</hi> in the same way as in the calyx. But petals may also unite in
                    their upper parts, though distinct below. The vine, and the keel <hi
                    rend="italic">(carina)</hi> of a peablossom, or other papilionaceous flowers,
                    exhibit this structure. When the lower part of a petal, as the petiole of
                    leaves, is narrow, and consists of the union of all the vessels that expand and
                    ramify in the upper portion, the contracted part is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >claw</hi> or <hi rend="italic">unguis;</hi> the dilated, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >limb</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lamina.</hi> If the ungues be long, straight,
                    and closely approached to each other, even though distinct, a kind of <hi
                    rend="italic">lube</hi> is formed; but, properly speaking, it is only a tube
                    when the claws are united. The orifice of the tube is termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">throat</hi> or <hi rend="italic">faux;</hi> and this may be <hi
                    rend="italic">nahed (nuda),</hi> or furnished with little <hi rend="italic"
                    >scales</hi> or appendages, called sometimes a <hi rend="italic">crown.</hi> The
                    shape of the corolla is frequently of importance in distinguishing natural
                    groups of plants. When all the petals are equal, it is said ∙ to be <hi
                    rend="italic">regular;</hi> when a monopetalous regular corolla has no tube, but
                    swells out gradually from the base to the summit, it is <hi rend="italic"
                    >hell-shaped</hi> or <hi rend="italic">campanulate</hi> (fig. 54); and <hi
                    rend="italic">urceolate</hi> if it is swollen at the base, and contracted at the
                    top: when there is a tube, and when it is narrow bclow, but dilates upwards, so
                    that the limb is campanulate, the corolla is <hi rend="italic"
                    >infundihuliform,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">funnel-shaped</hi> (fig. 55): it is
                    <hi rend="italic">rotate</hi> (fig. 56) or <hi rend="italic">wheel-shaped</hi>
                    if the tube be very short, and the limb spreading and nearly plain; <hi
                    rend="italic">hypocrateriform,</hi> (fig. 57) when the tube is long, narrow, and
                    cylindrical, and the limb spreading like a star; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >tubular,</hi> when it is almost entirely composed of a narrow elongated tube,
                    slightly dilated upwards; but this may be viewed as a very slender state of the
                    infundibuliform∙ When the petals are unequal in size, or cohere unequally, the
                    corolla is <hi rend="italic">irregular;</hi> and if such petals unite, we shall
                    have an irregular monopetalous corolla, which is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >labiate</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bilabiate</hi> (fig. 58) when the tube is
                    more or less elongated, the throat open and dilated, the limb divided
                    transversely into two parts or lips <hi rend="italic">(labia),</hi> the one
                    superior, the other inferior, which lips are subject to various modifications,
                    one of the most curious being where the upper lip is so slightly developed as to
                    appear to be absent, as in <hi rend="italic">Teucrium.</hi> A <hi rend="italic"
                    >personate</hi> (fig. 59, 60) or mask-like corolla is -when the tube is more or
                    less elongated, the throat very dilated, but closed up by the approximation of
                    the limb, which has two unequal lips, as in the snapdragon; but it is often very
                    difficult to distinguish between personate and labiate flowers. When the upper
                    part of the tube of the corolla is split down on one side, and be∙comes flat, it
                    is what is called <hi rend="italic">ligulate</hi> (fig. 61), as in the
                    hawkweeds, or exterior flowers of the daisy. A regular polypetalous corolla is
                    said to be <hi rend="italic">rosaceous</hi> (Plate CXIII. fig. 62) when composed
                    of three, four, or five, rarely more petals (fig. 62, <hi rend="italic">a),</hi>
                    of which the claw is very short, and the lamina diverging from each other, as in
                    the rose. When there are five petals, the ungues of which are elongated, forming
                    a false tube, and concealed within the calyx, the corolla is <hi rend="italic"
                    >caropdiyllate,</hi> as in the pinks; and when there are only four petals, with
                    long straight claws (fig. 63, <hi rend="italic">a),</hi> and patent lamina,
                    forming as it were a cross, the corolla is <hi rend="italic">cruciform</hi>
                    (fig. 63), as in the wallflower; but it is not essential to this last, that the
                    petals be perfectly alike and equal to each other. Of irregular polypetalous
                    corollas, the only one that has received any particular designation is the <hi
                    rend="italic">papilionaceous</hi> (fig. 64). Here there are five petals; the
                    upper one is usually larger than the others, and covers them before the flowers
                    expand, and is called the <hi rend="italic">vexillum</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >standard</hi> (fig. 64, <hi rend="italic">a),</hi> from its resemblance to a
                    flag; the two lateral ones, like the wings of a butterfly, are the <hi
                    rend="italic">aloe</hi> or <hi rend="italic">wings</hi> (fig. 64, <hi
                    rend="italic">b)</hi>; and the two lower ones, usually more or less <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193733622" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3622-0043"/> united together
                    by their lower margins, representing the keel of a ship, have been called the
                    <hi rend="italic">heel</hi> or <hi rend="italic">carina</hi> (fig. 64, ∙c). Such
                    a corolla belongs only to the <hi rend="italic">Leguminosoe.</hi> In the case of
                    an irregular corolla, whether <hi rend="italic">monopetalous</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">polypetalous,</hi> one of the petals is sometimes provided with a
                    tubular projection, when it is said to be <hi rend="italic">spurred (corolla
                    calcaratα,</hi> fig. 60).</p>
                <p>Perianth.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">perianth·,</hi> called also <hi rend="italic"
                    >perigonium,</hi> as we have already stated, is that ambiguous form of envelope
                    which partakes somewhat of the appearance of a calyx, somewhat of a corolla. The
                    Exogenous plants which possess this are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >monochlamydeoe;</hi> and it exists in all the Endogenae. One must not confound
                    with these the plants in which the calyx and corolla is either deciduous or
                    abortive. The parts of a perianth are strictly termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >tepals.</hi> A corolla being never incorporated with the fruit, as many
                    perianths are, there is a presumption that the latter are more of the nature of
                    a calyx; and an anatomical examination of their external surface confirms this
                    supposition. The internal and often coloured surface, however, is different, and
                    is probably either the torus, or a petaloid expansion of the torus. Not only arc
                    the petals often absent, but even in some cases there is scarcely a rudiment of
                    a perigonium, as in the genus <hi rend="italic">Euphorbia.</hi></p>
                <p>Estivation.</p>
                <p>As any law by which sepals and petals are disposed must obviously be very
                    intimately connected with their <hi rend="italic">estivation,</hi> or primitive
                    arrangement in the flower-bud, so the estivation, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >prafloration</hi> as it is sometimes called, though long neglected, has of late
                    years been made to bear an important part in the classification of plants. The
                    principal modifications are the <hi rend="italic">valvular</hi> estivation (fig.
                    65), when the parts of an envelope are either plane or slightly convex, and
                    merely touch one another by their margins, without the one covering any part of
                    the contiguous one. When the parts are each closely folded together, and unite
                    one to another by their margins into a monopetalous corolla, as in campanula, it
                    is sometimes said to be <hi rend="italic">plicate</hi> (fig. 66); but this is
                    only a modification of the valvular. When they are slightly concave, and a
                    margin of one slightly covering the margin of another, while its other margin is
                    usually in its turn covered, the estivation is <hi rend="italic">imbricated</hi>
                    (fig. 67, <hi rend="italic">a)</hi>; but of this there are several variations.
                    When an imbricated estivation is spirally twisted, which seldom happens, except
                    when the parts are more or less respectively soldered together, it receives the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">twisted</hi> (fig. 67, Z&gt;) or <hi rend="italic"
                    >contorted (oestivatio torsiva,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">contorta).</hi> In
                    some plants the petals are folded irregularly, or crumpled, when their
                    estivation is said to be <hi rend="italic">corrugated (oestivatio
                    cor-rugatwa),</hi> as in the poppy; but this last ought rather to be considered
                    as merely arising from an extraordinary development of the petals. Thus the
                    petals of the <hi rend="italic">Cistus,</hi> independent of being corrugated,
                    are also twisted. When there are more than one series of parts of the same
                    envelope, as in the water-lily, where there are several rows of petals, these
                    alternate with those of the adjoining rows; each row or series may have its own
                    mode of estivation, while, as a whole, it is termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >alternative (oestivatio alternativa)</hi>; in the spider-wort (<hi
                    rend="italic">Tradescantia)</hi> the outer row of the perigonium has a valvular,
                    and the inner a corrugated and imbricated estivation. Again, when the same
                    envelope may have two kinds, it will be readily allowed that the calyx may have
                    one and the corolla another. Thus, in the mallow tribe, the calyx is valvular
                    and the corolla twisted; in the flax and gum-cistus, both parts are twisted, but
                    the corolla is twisted in an opposite direction to that of the calyx.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sexual Organs.</hi></p>
                <p>Many of the ancient philosophers were well aware that there was a difference of
                    sexes in plants as well as in animals; and Theophrastus even states, that the
                    fruit of the female palm will not germinate, unless the pollen of the male be
                    shaken over the spatha of the female when both of them are in flower; but it was
                    not till the time of Grew that any thing certain was understood on the subject.
                    He was the first who regarded the stamens as the male, and the pistilla as the
                    female organs. Linnaeus afterwards improved on Grew’s ideas, and has adduced so
                    many proofs from theory, and, what is of greater importance, from experiments of
                    a tedious and delicate nature, that none now can experience the smallest doubt.
                    An account of his arguments and experiments, and others of a late date, with the
                    mode in which fecundation is supposed to be accomplished, forms one of the most
                    interesting parts of vegetable physiology.</p>
                <p>Stamens or Male Organs.</p>
                <p>Each male organ is a <hi rend="italic">stamen;</hi> but the whole taken
                    collectively forms the <hi rend="italic">androcoeum,</hi> a term that bears the
                    same relation to stamens as a corolla does to petals. These are situated between
                    the petals and pistilla. Although a calyx and corolla be usually present in
                    flowers, yet we have seen that they are not essentially necessary; but no plant
                    can produce seed without the assistance of stamens and pistils, or their
                    modifications. When stamens and pistils occur in the same flower, it is termed
                    <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi> or <hi rend="italic">hermaphrodite;</hi> but, as
                    sometimes happens by abortion or other causes, the stamens appear in one blossom
                    and the pistilla in another. Again, according as these are on one or on
                    different individuals, the flowers are called <hi rend="italic">moncecious</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">dicecious;</hi> and, generally speaking, the flowers are
                    <hi rend="italic">imperfect</hi> or <hi rend="italic">diclinous (flores
                    diclincs).</hi></p>
                <p>The number of stamens is variable, five or ten being the usual number among the
                    Exogenae, and three or six among the Endogenae; but, on the one hand, these are
                    subject to abortions, and on the other to multiplication. When the last takes
                    place, it is by the addition of one or more rows similar to the first; so that
                    although apparently indeterminate, they are actually a certain multiple of the
                    primitive number.</p>
                <p>A stamen consists of a <hi rend="italic">filament</hi> (fig. 68, <hi
                    rend="italic">a)</hi> and an <hi rend="italic">anther</hi> (fig. 68, <hi
                    rend="italic">b).</hi> The former is the body, which arises from the torus, and
                    is sometimes cylindrical, or awl-shaped, or prismεtical, and is even at times
                    expanded, as if into a scale or petal. It is either articulated or contiguous
                    with the torus. Part of it is often united with the petal, particularly when the
                    petals themselves cohere; and the stamen is then called <hi rend="italic"
                    >epipetalous.</hi> Its length is generally proportioned to the style, but it is
                    sometimes wholly wanting, presenting a sessile anther. In the same flower the
                    filaments are generally equal in length, and such are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >isostemones,</hi> but in many they are unequal. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geranium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oxalis,</hi> where there are ten stamens,
                    five are larger than the other five, and alternate with them. WTιen there are
                    six stamens, of which four are larger than the other two, as in the cabbage,
                    mustard, and the other <hi rend="italic">Cruciferoe,</hi> they are called <hi
                    rend="italic">tetradynamous;</hi> and where there are four, of which two are
                    longer than the other two, they are <hi rend="italic">didymous,</hi> but here
                    there is usually the rudiment of a fifth stamen, dissimilar from all the others.
                    The direction of the filaments is usually straight, but they are in some plants
                    bent inwards, in others outwards. In <hi rend="italic">Parietaria</hi> (the
                    pellitory of the walD they are <hi rend="italic">reflexed;</hi> for here the
                    filament is bent backwards in such a way that the upper half lies along the
                    lower, and between it and the perigonium. When the filament is too slender and
                    weak to support the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733635"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-3635-0044"/> weight of the anther, and hangs down, it is <hi
                    rend="italic">pendent;</hi> when it bends towards the lower part of the flower,
                    it is <hi rend="italic">decumbent</hi> or <hi rend="italic">declinate;</hi> and
                    when to the upper part, <hi rend="italic">ascendent.</hi> The filaments are
                    usually <hi rend="italic">free,</hi> or isolated from each other; but they are
                    sometimes united more or less upwards from their base into a column or <hi
                    rend="italic">androphore.</hi> When there is one androphore or bundle of
                    filaments, the stamens are <hi rend="italic">monadelphous;</hi> when two
                    androphores, <hi rend="italic">diadelphous;</hi> and when several androphores,
                    <hi rend="italic">polyadelphous.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">anther</hi> is a kind of bag borne by the filament, and
                    corresponds to the lamina of a leaf. It is either sessile, when there happens to
                    be no filament, or it is placed at the top of the filament in three ways: it may
                    be attached by the middle of its back to the slender apex of the filament, and
                    is then <hi rend="italic">oscillating</hi> or <hi rend="italic">versatile</hi>
                    (fig. 73); or it is attached by its base to the top of the filament, with which
                    it then seems continuous, and is then <hi rend="italic">erect</hi> (fig. 69); or
                    it adheres to the filament by its back, and is then <hi rend="italic"
                    >adnate</hi> or <hi rend="italic">adherent,</hi> in which case the filament is
                    often prolonged into an appendage. When adherent to the inside of the filament,
                    it is said to be <hi rend="italic">introrse,</hi> and to the outside <hi
                    rend="italic">extrorse.</hi> Each bag or cell' of the anther is called a lobe;
                    and the solid substance that connects them, and which in fact corresponds to the
                    midrib of the leaf, is the <hi rend="italic">connectivum</hi> (fig. 69, «).
                    Usually the connectivum is very small and inconspicuous, but in some plants it
                    is prolonged into an appendage, that may be confounded with an elongation of the
                    filament; in others it is prolonged below, as in-some heaths, into an awn or
                    crest; in a few it is so broad that the bags of the anther are at a considerable
                    distance from each other (fig. 70). Usually each anther has two lobes; but in a
                    few plants there, is only one, and this may happen either from some natural
                    conformation of the plant (and only when the anther is erect), but more
                    generally from the accidental abortion of one of the lobes (and then
                    particularly when the lobes are distant), or by the filament happening to be
                    split, each half bearing a lobe, and representing a distinct stamen. The reverse
                    also happens, so that each anther may appear to consist of four lobes; but this
                    arises either from each lobe being divided into two cells, by the back of the
                    lobe being folded inwards; or it has really four, six, or more lobes (as in some
                    willows), caused by the adhesion of two, three, or more stamens into one. The
                    lobes or cells of the anthers open in different ways, by what is termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">line of dehiscence.</hi> This usually indicates the margins of the
                    lamina of the leaf out of which the anther is formed, and therefore the most
                    frequent position of this line is longitudinally along the middle of each lobe
                    (fig. 71), in which case the anthers are <hi rend="italic">bilocular</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">birimose.</hi> When this line does not open during its whole
                    length, but only above or below, exhibiting two pores, as in the heaths, the
                    anther is styled <hi rend="italic">biporose</hi> (fig. 68); or when there is
                    only one lobe, it is called <hi rend="italic">one-pored (poro simplici).</hi>
                    Very rarely, as in the lavender, the anther dehisces <hi rend="italic"
                    >transversely;</hi> but the most singular case is when it opens by <hi
                    rend="italic">valves,</hi> as in the barberry and the laurels (fig. 72), that
                    are free below, and hinged as it were by their upper edge. The anther has
                    various shapes; the principal are <hi rend="italic">globular</hi> when the two
                    lobes form one globe, <hi rend="italic">didymous</hi> when each of the two lobes
                    are globose; the terms <hi rend="italic">linear, sagittate, cordate,
                    reniform,</hi> &amp;c., are also to be applied to it in the same way as to
                    leaves of plants. When the filaments are united, the anthers may be so likewise,
                    as in <hi rend="italic">salix monandra;</hi> or they may be free. But although
                    the filaments may be free, the anthers maybe united to each other by the
                    margins, as in the <hi rend="italic">Compositae,</hi> and such are then called
                    <hi rend="italic">syngenesious.</hi> In <hi rend="italic">Ştapelia,</hi> where
                    the loculi or cells of the anther are at a distance from each other, each
                    coheres with the loculus of the neighbouring anther.</p>
                <p>An anther contains and frequently emits a matter called <hi rend="italic"
                    >pollen,</hi> the use of which is to give life to the ovule or&lt; young seed.
                    The grains of pollen seem to arise from the extremities of the veins which are
                    found in the leaf that constitutes the anther, and are probably formed from the
                    spiral vessels. When the grains of pollen burst, they again discharge a
                    multitude of very minute particles, called <hi rend="italic">mollecules</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">granules.</hi> When the grains of pollen easily detach from
                    each other, they are said to be <hi rend="italic">pulverulent,</hi> and then
                    they may be either perfectly smooth without any viscous coating, or they may be
                    viscous. Sometimes the viscosity is not at once perceptible, but may be traced
                    by means of papillae or small eminences on the surface, which are in fact
                    secretory organs, giving rise to the viscous surface. The nature of these grains
                    of pollen seems constant in each family of plants; and even the shape of these
                    grains is sometimes of consequence in distinguishing natural tribes. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Asclepiadeoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Orchideae</hi> the grains
                    are not pulverulent. Instead of separating readily, all the pollen contained in
                    one cell or bag coheres into what is-then termed a <hi rend="italic"
                    >pollen-mass;</hi> or when each of those are divided into two or four portions,
                    each is sometimes called a <hi rend="italic">mas-sιιle.</hi> When in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Orchideae</hi> these pollen masses are formed of grains united
                    together by means of an elastic tissue, they are said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >sectile</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic">Orchis)</hi>; but in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epipactis</hi> and others they are <hi rend="italic">granulose</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">farinaceous;</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">Cora llorrhiza</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Malaxis,</hi> &amp;c., they are of a solid compact
                    substance.</p>
                <p>Pistils or Female Organs.</p>
                <p>The whole female organs in a flower, taken collectively, have been named <hi
                    rend="italic">gynaeceum.</hi> This may consist of one or more <hi rend="italic"
                    >pistilla,</hi> or distinct portions. Thus, in the primrose there is truly one,
                    in <hi rend="italic">Ranunculus</hi> many pistilla. The female parts being, like
                    the stamens, petals, and sepals, formed of modified leaves, each pistillum may
                    arise either from one such leaf or from the combination of several. These
                    component parts are called <hi rend="italic">carpels,</hi> and are placed in the
                    centre of the flower. They may be arranged, lsí, round a real axis or column,
                    which is the abortive prolongation of the pedicel, and are united to it by their
                    inner angle: this is evident in <hi rend="italic">Malva</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Lavatera,</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">Euphorbia. 2d,</hi> They
                    may be verticillate round the central column, but hanging from its summit, and
                    consequently only attached to it by the apex of the inner angle, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Geraniaceae.</hi> 3d, They may be verticillate round the summit of
                    the axis, but erect, and only adhering by their inner angle at its base; and
                    then the axis may be extremely short, as in <hi rend="italic">Sedum</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Aconitum,</hi> or it may be slightly prolonged, as in some
                    rutaceae. 4√A, The carpels may be placed in a spike round the central column, as
                    in the magnolias and tulip-tree, and some ranunculusses. <hi rend="italic"
                    >5th,</hi> But if the column be very short and round, the carpels, instead of
                    forming a spike, will form a head round the column, as in the strawberry, where
                    the column is fleshy, <hi rend="italic">(i&gt;th,</hi> If the exterior portion
                    of the axis be prolonged along the inner surface of the calyx, while the central
                    part is not, we shall have a hollow cup, in the interior of which the carpels
                    are seated, as in the genus <hi rend="italic">Rosa</hi> or rose; and here the
                    expansion of the axis is united to the tube of the calyx by means of the torus.
                    All plants in’ their primitive state seem to have several carpels in each
                    flower, but they may be reduced to a solitary one by abortion.</p>
                <p>Each carpel (fig. 74) may be viewed as a folded leaf, of which the petiole seldom
                    appears; but when it does it is called a <hi rend="italic">thccaphore,</hi> or
                    support to the fruit. The <hi rend="italic">ovules</hi> or young seeds arise
                    from the extremities of the veins, and therefore are usually attached near to
                    the margins of the leaf, or, as it is folded, to both sides of the inner angle
                    of the carpel; and the parts to which they are fixed are called the <hi
                    rend="italic">placenta.</hi> The ovules, like the pollen of an anther <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193733648" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3648-0045"/> cannot probably
                    be formed without the assistance of spiral vessels, and therefore are not to be
                    looked for in the ferns, which are destitute of these elementary organs. The
                    portion above the thecaphore, containing the ovules, is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ovarium</hi> (fig. 74, <hi rend="italic">a).</hi> But the summits of the
                    placenta are prolonged into two thread-like bodies, sometimes long, and
                    sometimes very short. These are usually combined into one, which is then named
                    the <hi rend="italic">style</hi> (fig. 74, <hi rend="italic">b)</hi>; and its
                    glandular apex, fitted for the absorption of the vivifying part of the pollen,
                    is the <hi rend="italic">stigma</hi> (fig. 74, c).</p>
                <p>The carpels show a still greater tendency to unite with each other than even the
                    exterior parts of the flower, though often this union seems to take place in a
                    very slight degree. In <hi rend="italic">Stapelia</hi> they appear to cohere
                    only by the stigmas; in <hi rend="italic">Asclepias</hi> by the stigmas and
                    styles; in some by the ovaries alone, in others by the ovaries and styles; but
                    the most complete is by the ovaries, styles, and stigmas. When the styles are
                    united there is usually said to be but one, although the pistil ought more
                    properly to be then called <hi rend="italic">gamostyle;</hi> and in the same
                    way, when the ovaries are united, there is still said to be one ovary, called by
                    Linnaeus a <hi rend="italic">germen,</hi> consisting of a number of <hi
                    rend="italic">cells (loculi),</hi> although each of the cells is in fact an
                    ovary.</p>
                <p>The number of <hi rend="italic">stigmas</hi> is determined by that of the carpels
                    and styles, or their divisions; so that in a compound ovarium, when we speak of
                    one stigma, we actually mean several united into one mass (fig. 75, c), as in
                    the primrose. It is <hi rend="italic">sessile</hi> when there is no apparent
                    style, <hi rend="italic">terminal</hi> when placed on the top of the style or
                    ovarium, and <hi rend="italic">lateral</hi> when attached to the sides of these
                    organs. In substance it may be <hi rend="italic">fleshy, glandular,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">membranaceous,</hi> and even <hi rend="italic">petaloid</hi> when
                    it resembles a petal, as in the iris. Its form needs no illustration further
                    than, when several are only partially combined, they arc said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">biful, triful,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">multiful,</hi> as if
                    there were actually a simple one variously divided. Its surface is either <hi
                    rend="italic">smooth</hi> or <hi rend="italic">j)u-bescent;</hi> in some plants
                    it is <hi rend="italic">pencillifornι</hi> (fig. 76), or of hairs forming a
                    small tuft; in others, as in <hi rend="italic">Anemone, Clematis,</hi> and many
                    grasses, it is <hi rend="italic">plumose</hi> (fig. 77), or furnished with hairs
                    arranged in a line on both sides, like the vanes of a feather; and is <hi
                    rend="italic">aspergilliform</hi> (fig. 78) when the hairs are placed in many
                    whirls around the stigma, like a bottle-brush. In a few orders, as <hi
                    rend="italic">Goodenoveae, Scaevoleae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prunoniaceae,</hi> the stigma is enveloped in a peculiar membranous appendage,
                    called an <hi rend="italic">indusium.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">style</hi> is in common language said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">simple (simplex),</hi> or <hi rend="italic">single (unicum),</hi>
                    either when it is the style to one carpel (fig. 74, <hi rend="italic">b),</hi>
                    or is formed by the union of several into one body (fig. 75, <hi rend="italic"
                    >b),</hi> and is <hi rend="italic">divided</hi> when the component parts are
                    more or less adherent. But a style in its simplest state, being actually formed
                    by the prolongation of the two placentae of a carpel, is even then a compound
                    body. What are said to be two styles in the grasses (fig. 78) is thus in reality
                    but one divided style. The two stigmas in <hi rend="italic">Compositoe</hi>
                    indicate the same structure, as well as those of many <hi rend="italic"
                    >Euphorbiaceae,</hi> where the divisions of the style and stigmas are double
                    those of the carpels. The style may be included within the flower <hi
                    rend="italic">(inclusus),</hi> or protruded beyond it <hi rend="italic"
                    >(exsertus).</hi> It is usually <hi rend="italic">terminal</hi> in a compound
                    ovarium; and <hi rend="italic">lateral,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">basilar</hi>
                    (from the base), in a simple one. In some plants with a deeply lobed ovarium,
                    the individual ovaries are attached to each other almost only by their bases;
                    and hence the united style, springing from the point of union, forms as it were
                    a continuation of the axis. The style is of various shapes, but the most
                    singular is when it is petaloid, as in the iris. It may be straight, or
                    declinate, or ascending.</p>
                <p>When no union takes place among the carpels, the <hi rend="italic">ovarium</hi>
                    is termed <hi rend="italic">apocarpous,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ranunculus;</hi> and when there is an adherence, so that a compound ovarium is
                    formed, it is called <hi rend="italic">syncarpous</hi> (fig. 75). In the former
                    case there may be one or more pistilla, according to the number of carpella; in
                    the latter only one. The ovary being formed of the lamina of the leaf, the edges
                    of which may be sometimes rolled inwards, it is evident that we may have each
                    carpel of two cells, as in <hi rend="italic">Astragalus;</hi> but the division
                    is very seldom perfect. When the ovaria are united into a compound or syncarpous
                    ovarium, the sides of the component leaves or ovaria (which sides are then
                    termed <hi rend="italic">dissepiments)</hi> may be evanescent, in which case we
                    have a unilocular ovarium with a central placenta (fig. 79); and when the leaves
                    forming the ovaria are scarcely folded, but nearly plane, the placentiferous
                    margins touching respectively the margins of the next ovaria, an unilocular
                    syncarpous ovarium is produced (fig. 80), having the placenta parietal, or
                    exhibiting longitudinal lines on the interior surface. In a compound ovarium,
                    when the margin of the folded carpel is rolled inwards a little way, so that
                    each ovarium is almost bilocular, it is evident that the placentas must be
                    situated nearly in the centre of each division of the fruit, in which case the
                    two placentae in each cell may either unite closely together, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Kalmia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Rhodod’endrum</hi> (fig. 81); or
                    may diverge from each other (fig. 82), as in the gourds.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In this tribe the sides of the carpel or leaf
                    connecting the exterior with the centre of the compound ovarium are extremely
                    thin <hi rend="superscript"> ln</hi> ∞nspicuous, while the inflexed margins are
                    remarkably well defined; hence Seringe and De Candolle have been erroneously
                    induced to suppose that here the midrib of the constituent leaf is, by some
                    inexplicable means, placed in the centre of the ovarium.</p></note> An
                    apocarpous ovarium may be known from a syncarpous one, when there is no
                    abortion, by the number and position of the placentae. Although in every plant a
                    carpel is present, yet in <hi rend="italic">Cycadcae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coniferoe,</hi> where there is neither style nor stigma, the apocarpous ovarium
                    is phme or spread open like a scale, leaving the naked ovule, on its inner
                    surface, exposed without any covering to the pollen; and even, though very
                    rarely, the carpel may be so modified that the ovary is abortive, and nothing is
                    visible but the naked ovule.</p>
                <p>The ovary is <hi rend="italic">free</hi> or <hi rend="italic">superior</hi> when
                    it contracts no adherence with the calyx; or <hi rend="italic">inferior,</hi>
                    and then it is syncarpous, and the tube of the calyx adheres with it. But the
                    individual ovaria may be placed inside the tube of the calyx without being
                    united with a syncarpous ovarium, as in the roses, when they are said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">parietal.</hi> Between an inferior ovary and ovaries parietal it
                    is sometimes difficult to draw a distinction; for when there is only one series
                    of the latter, they may project so far towards the axis of the fruit as nearly
                    to meet each other, and thus resemble a syncarpous ovary. But the difficulty is
                    diminished by considering that, in a true inferior ovarium, each carpel must so
                    touch the calyx as to represent a syncarpous ovarium seated within the tube.
                    Each carpel must therefore unite laterally with its contiguous one, and at the
                    same time all must be united at the axis of the ovarium, so that there must
                    result from the union one compound pistil. A compound pistil ought thus to
                    indicate an inferior ovary. On the contrary, a separation of pistilla will
                    always be accompanied with parietal ovaries (as in the rose and apple); and to
                    these rules there is, we believe, no deviation. An apparent one is in that
                    section of the genus <hi rend="italic">Rosa</hi> called systylae, as in the
                    Ayrshire rose, and another in <hi rend="italic">Crataegus monogyna,</hi> in both
                    of which the styles unite into one; but even here a slight dissection of the
                    ovarium will show that the individual carpels are not strictly united at their
                    inner margins, and consequently that the ovaria are <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193733661" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3661-0046"/> parietal, and the compound
                    ovary apocarpous, or of more than one pistillum.</p>
                <p>The partially adherent calyx of many saxifrages has led some botanists to say of
                    them that the ovarium is <hi rend="italic">half inferior (semi-superum)</hi>;
                    but from their being two pistilla, it is apocarpous. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Umbelliferoe</hi> there is but one pistil, although two styles; and the ovary
                    is syncarpous and inferior. To avoid confusion, it might be better to adopt the
                    terms of syncarpous and apocarpous ovaria, and adherent or free calyx; and a
                    combination of these will indicate the structure of the fruit.</p>
                <p>Each simple ovarium is more or less compressed; but the usual shape of a
                    syncarpous one is ovoid. It is, however, sometimes elongated. In most plants it
                    is entire, but in the borage tribe and labiate plants it is deeply lobed (Pl.
                    CXIV. fig. 118).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">ovulum,</hi> as we have already explained, is the body
                    borne by the placenta, and is destined to become a seed after impregnation. The
                    position of the ovula is of great importance in determining natural affinities.
                    When it is fixed by its base to the bottom of one of the cells of the ovarium,
                    of which it takes the direction, it is said to be <hi rend="italic">erect,</hi>
                    or if it hangs from the summit of the cell it is <hi rend="italic"
                    >inverted;</hi> but if the ovulum is attached to the middle portion of the
                    placenta, it may have an upright direction, and is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >ascendant,</hi> or point downwards, and is then <hi rend="italic">suspended
                    (appensum');</hi> or if it appears attached by its middle, so that one half
                    points upwards and the other half towards the base of the cell, it is called <hi
                    rend="italic">peritropal.</hi> By most botanists, however, the erect and
                    ascendant ovula are confounded under one name, and the inverted and suspended
                    are known by the term <hi rend="italic">pendulous.</hi> Either of these may at
                    times resemble the other by an accidental inversion, when the ovule is said to
                    be <hi rend="italic">resupinate.</hi> The ovulum is either sessile, or on a
                    stalk called a <hi rend="italic">funiculus ox podosperm</hi> (fig. 83, a), and
                    in either case the point by which the connection is formed is usually termed the
                    base of the ovulum, and its other extremity the apex. The ovulum consists of a
                    nucleus and two external coats; the outer of which (fig. 83, 84, and 85, each at
                    the letter ò) is called the <hi rend="italic">testa</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >primine sac;</hi> and the inner, <hi rend="italic">∖∖∖ointernal membrane, ox
                    secundine sac,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">tegmen</hi> (fig. eaed. c.) The
                    base of the <hi rend="italic">nucleus</hi> (fig. eaed. <hi rend="italic"
                    >d’)</hi> is always incorporated with the base of the internal membrane, and
                    their common base is attached at some points to the testa. The junction of the
                    three forms the <hi rend="italic">chalaza.</hi> The chalaza is sometimes at the
                    base of the testa, but is more frequently at the apex of that external covering,
                    so that the apices of the nucleus and tegmen, though in some plants pointing to
                    the apex of the testa, are more usually directed to its base. Close to the apex
                    of the nucleus, and consequently at the opposite extremity from the chalaza, a
                    small aperture <hi rend="italic">ox foramen</hi> (fig. eaed. e) is to be
                    observed in both the primine and secundine sacs. This foramen (called by Mirbel
                    <hi rend="italic">exostome</hi> in the primine, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >endostome</hi> in the secundine) must always be found near the base of the
                    ovulum when the apex of the nucleus points towards that base, and at the summit
                    of the ovulum when the apex of the nucleus points to that part; and consequently
                    the situation of this foramen will at once indicate the internal structure of
                    the ovulum.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Brown and
                    Mirbel term the chalaza the base, and the foramen the apex of the ovule, without
                    regard to the point of attachment of the ovule to the placenta, which must be
                    attended to in studying their works.</p></note> And this is of the greatest
                    importance, as the future embryo is now well ascertained to be so placed in the
                    nucleus that the radicle points directly to these orifices, as do the cotyledons
                    to the chalaza; and a means is thus given of discovering even in the ovulum the
                    future internal arrangement of the seed. In what we have said, we have presumed
                    the testa, tegmen, and nucleus, to be straight; but in some plants all or some
                    of these are more or less bent or curved, in which case we may have the apex of
                    the nucleus directed towards its base, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cruciferae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chenopodiaceae,</hi> and even the
                    grasses; or towards the side of the testa, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leguminosce.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Mirbel, as we have already stated, considers the base of the ovulum and seed
                    as at the chalaza, and he divides seeds into <hi rend="italic">orthotropous,
                    anatropous,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">campulitropous.</hi> The first are
                    attached to the ovary by their base, having a perfectly regular form, and the
                    axis is rectilinear. The campulitropous are also fixed to the ovary by their
                    base, but their form is irregular, and their axis is curved, so that the two
                    extremities meet. The anatropous, like the orthotropous, have a rectilinear
                    axis, but they are resupinate on their funiculus, to which they adhere
                    longitudinally, and by means of which they are attached to the ovarium at a
                    point near their apex. Ιhese variations are explained by Mirbel, by what he
                    denominates the <hi rend="italic">statics of developments,</hi> or the force of
                    expansion, or of inertness, yr of contraction of the different parts of the
                    ovulum; and he has endeavoured to show how these causes, acting either together
                    or independently, alter or preserve the regularity of the primitive shape. Every
                    ovulum, according to him, has at first a regular form, and the chalaza close to
                    the hilum or funiculus; so that if the force of development be equal at all
                    points, the regularity ofshape must be preserved, but if it be greater on one
                    side than on the other, an irregularity must ensue. In this way an equilibrium (
                    foices must have taken place in an orthotropous seed, but not in the anatropous
                    or campulitropous ones. When an ovulum tends to become anatropous, the chalaza
                    or the inner extremity of the funiculus is pushed forward in a slightly oblique
                    direction, and inverts the ovnlum, so that its base is placed where its summit
                    formerly was, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa;</hi> a kind of resupination
                    which is stated by Mirbel to take place in a very short time,—but
                    notwithstanding he appears to have followed the successive changes. By this
                    inversion the vessels of the funiculus become elongated in proportion to the
                    length of the axis of the ovulum; and such prolongation, united laterally to the
                    pnmine sac, and extending from the exostome to the chalaza, is what is termed
                    the raphe. Three characters distinguish the ovule destined to become in maturity
                    a compulitropous seed; the indissoluble union of the hilum and the chalaza; the
                    great force of deve opment of one of the sides of the ovule; and the inertness
                    or even contraction of the opposite side, which remains stationary, or even
                    diminishes, while the other elongates. Had this last side been free in its
                    development, it would have elongated in a straight line; but it is constrained
                    by the inertness or contraction of the opposite one, and can therefore only
                    increase by turning round the °⅛ T 'n“! <hi rend="superscript"> l r</hi> ≡ <hi

                <p>The testa is usually entire, except at the foramen, but in two known genera, <hi
                    rend="italic">Eanhsia aηADryandra,</hi> it opens longitudinally, leaving the
                    tegmen exposed. The surfaces of the testas of the two collateral ovules in these
                    plants then unite, putting on the appearance of the dissepiment of a capsule;
                    and the two cohering ovula seem to be as one bilocular ovulum. By this means the
                    internal membrane or tegmen becomes the external envelope of the seed.</p>
                <p>When the apex of the nucleus is contiguous to the base of the ovulum, a
                    connection takes place between the base of the ovulum and the base of the
                    nucleus, by a bundle of vessels (fig. 85, ∕) called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >raphe.</hi> This raphe is almost always on the side of the ovule next the
                    placenta, and even the apparent exceptions to this rule tend to confirm it. Thus
                    in the tribe to which <hi rend="italic">Euonymus</hi> belongs, the ovules are
                    erect, yet in some species of that genus they <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193733674" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3674-0047"/> appear suspended, and then
                    have the raphe turned away from the placenta; but if we consider a moment, we
                    shall see, that such may arise not only from their naturally hanging down, but
                    by an erect ovule being as it were pushed over by some peculiar formation of the
                    plant, and thus become resupinate. But a naturally erect ovule become
                    resupinate, must have the part that was formerly next the placenta now turned
                    away from it; and in the same way a naturally pendulous ovule must also, when
                    resupinate, have its raphe turned away from the placenta; and thus we may
                    conclude, when such is the position of the raphe, that the ovule is resupinate,
                    and that the opposite apparent direction is the true one, whether erect or
                    pendulous. This may readily be seen in the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pencca.</hi></p>
                <p>It was till lately generally supposed that the <hi rend="italic">aura
                    polli-naris,</hi> mollecules of pollen, or by whatever other name the vivifying
                    influence might be called, after being absorbed by the stigma and transmitted
                    through the style, entered the ovulum at its base, either directly or by means
                    of the funiculus. The discoveries of Brown and others have however now proved
                    satisfactorily that the entrance takes place by the foramens; and Brongniart has
                    ascertained, that in many, if not in all plants, at the moment of impregnation,
                    a slender tube or filament is protruded through the orifices from the apex of
                    the nucleus, for the more ready absorption of the pollen granules, but which,
                    after having served the intended purpose, withcrs away, leaving only a small
                    projection or papilla, which nearly closes up the foramens. Until, therefore, it
                    was decided that the pollen had not access to the nucleus by the funiculus, but
                    by the foramen, the idea of a naked ovule was inadmissible, and many ingenious
                    but erroneous hypotheses were made to explain the fruit of the pine, &amp;c. in
                    which an exposed ovulum exists.</p>
                <p>But the nucleus is itself a compound body, and consists of two parts. The one is
                    a parenchymatous or loose cellular substance, called by Malpighi the <hi
                    rend="italic">chorion</hi> (fig. 85, <hi rend="italic">g)</hi>; and this again
                    includes a little vesicle or cellular bag (fig. 85, A) termed by the same author
                    the <hi rend="italic">amnios,</hi> originally filled with a mucilaginous fluid,
                    called the <hi rend="italic">liquor amnios.</hi> It is in the interior of this
                    bag that the embryo is formed. As-the phrases chorion and amnios, having
                    reference to animals, are objectionable, the former has now been termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">parenchyma of the nucleus,</hi> and the latter the <hi
                    rend="italic">embryonic sac.</hi> In some plants this parenchyma occupies the
                    great part of the nucleus, but in others it is reduced to a thin transparent
                    membrane, under which the sac lies.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Mirbel takes rather a different view of the subject: he
                    considers the nucleus as a mere envelope, terms it the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tercine,</hi> and states that it incloses two others,—the γwαriiwe, which
                    appears to be attached to the summit of the cavity, and that containing the
                    &lt;p&lt;ιniinc, or embryonic sac, the last envelope, and adhering at both
                    extremities to the quartine. But each of these parts, if they do exist, has not
                    been seen in every ovule; and in those in which they have been observed, they
                    are not all visible at one time, but in succession: when the first is most
                    evident, the last are merely rudimentary; and when the latter are developed, the
                    former are scarcely distinguishable. Mirbel even points out five distinct
                    periods of development.</p></note></p>
                <p>To complete our account of the ovulum, of which we have been obliged to explain
                    the anatomical structure, in order to lay the foundation of a correct knowledge
                    of the parts of the seed, we have further to say, that in many, but not in all
                    plants, a tubular prolongation (fig. 85, A) of the embryonic sac takes place
                    about the time of impregnation, from that extremity of it which is next the base
                    of the nucleus, extending to that base, and connecting it with the sac. This is
                    very conspicuous in the almond and yellow water-lily. Malpighi named it the⅛∙αs
                    <hi rend="italic">umbilicale;</hi> and Gaertner viewed it as a continuation of
                    the vessels of the umbilicus, but erroneously, as it is extremely doubtful if in
                    any case its connection with the base of the nucleus is completed until the
                    embryo, after fecundation, requires a considerable degree of nourishment.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Eruit.</hi></p>
                <p>Fecundation having taken place, the floral envelopes usually fade away, the
                    stamens disappear, and the pistillum begins to increase in size and become the
                    <hi rend="italic">fruit.</hi> Although the style and stigma, having fulfilled
                    their functions, are now nearly obliterated, the fruit ought always to show some
                    traces of them on its surface, whenever they were seen on the ovarium. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Cycadecc</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Coniferoe,</hi> where the
                    ovulum is exposed to the immediate action of the pollen, there is neither style
                    nor stigma upon the scale or open ovary, so neither is there on the fruit,
                    indicating the existence of naked seeds; but the grains of corn and wheat and
                    other grasses, having the remains of a style, arc true fruits; the supposed
                    naked seeds of the borage tribe, and labiatae are for the same reason parts of a
                    fruit. As the pistillum advances towards maturity, many alterations take place,
                    in consequence of abortion, non-development, obliteration, or even union of
                    parts. Thus a compound pistil having a compound or syncarpous ovary, may have a
                    fruit of but one cell, as the hazel-nut; or a solitary pistil may, by the
                    involution and divarication of its placentas, change into a fruit with several
                    cells; or the placenta itself may expand horizontally, dividing one true cell
                    into several spurious ones. In all cases, however, the contrasting the structure
                    of the pistil with that of the fruit will materially aid us in our
                    investigations.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">base</hi> of the fruit (fig. 86, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >ö)</hi> is the part where it is joined to the peduncle. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >apex</hi> (fig. 86, 6) is where the remains of the style are found.</p>
                <p>The portion of the pistil called the ovarium is in the ripe fruit termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">pericarp;</hi> it is sometimes extremely <hi rend="superscript">
                    r</hi> thin, as in the grasses, the borage tribe, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Compositoe,</hi> &amp;c. but is often extremely thick, and even fleshy. As the
                    leaf of a plant has an upper and under surface, and an intermediate parenchyma
                    in which the nerves are placed, so the pericarp consists likewise of three
                    portions: the outer coating, which often determines the form of the fruit,
                    called the <hi rend="italic">epicarp</hi> (fig. 87, 6); the inner lining or the
                    <hi rend="italic">endocarp</hi> (fig. 87, d); and the parenchymatous or fleshy
                    substance between these (fig. 87, c), termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sarcocarp</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mesocarp.</hi> When the ovary is inferior,
                    or united with the tube of the calyx, as in the apple, the epicarp becomes
                    confounded with the tube (fig. 87, «), and then the sarcocarp may be readily
                    taken for the parenchyma of the calyx; but in peaches and other fleshy fruits
                    not adherent to the calyx, it is the sarcocarp that constitutes the flesh. The
                    endocarp is usually a mere membrane, but it sometimes is incorporated with a
                    portion of the sarcocarp; and when this portion becomes hard and osseous, it
                    constitutes what is called a <hi rend="italic">putamen</hi> (when it contains
                    but one seed), or <hi rend="italic">nucules nuculoe</hi> (when they contain
                    several seeds). As an ovary may be apocarpous or syncarpous, so also may be the
                    pericarp. It is therefore said to be <hi rend="italic">unilocular</hi> (fig. 104
                    and 105) when there is one cell, and <hi rend="italic">bi-, tri-</hi> (fig. 88),
                    or <hi rend="italic">multilocular,</hi> according to the number of cells. These
                    <hi rend="italic">loculi</hi> or cells arc separated from each other by <hi
                    rend="italic">dissepiments.</hi> By reverting to what has been said about the
                    ovarium, we shall easily perceive that true dissepiments can only be formed in
                    one way. Two contiguous portions of the endocarp are projected into the interior
                    of the pericarp, and are agglutinated together by the parenchyma of the primary
                    leaf, now the sarcocarp.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733687" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3687-0048"/>
                <p>The dissepiment is thus always of two membranes, which must contain between them
                    vessels and nerves; and these again will point out the former junction of the
                    two membranes, even although, by the sarcocarp drying up, they should have lost
                    their adherence, and have separated from each other. Dissepiments may be <hi
                    rend="italic">complete</hi> when they extend from the base of the epicarp to its
                    apex, and <hi rend="italic">incomplete</hi> when they permit two contiguous
                    cells to communicate with each other. In the thorn-apple <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Datura stramonium)</hi> there appears at first sight to be four dissepiments,
                    two complete and two incomplete; but in reality in this plant there are only
                    two, curiously modified.</p>
                <p>⅛* The axis of the fruit is that round which the constituting carpels are placed.
                    It is sometimes not apparent. When it actually exists it is usually termed a <hi
                    rend="italic">columella,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">Euphorbia, Lavatera,</hi>
                    &amp;c.; but when two mericarpia are united together it is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">commissura</hi> (fig. 92).</p>
                <p>As seeds are inclosed in the pericarp, it is essentially necessary that they,
                    after maturity, have the means of escaping. Sometimes, however, the pericarp
                    does not open naturally, but is either split by the process of germination, or
                    rots away by the action of the soil or of the atmosphere. It is then said to be
                    indehiscent, as in the grasses, <hi rend="italic">Compositoe,</hi> &amp;c. But
                    usually it splits open, and is then dehiscent; and the pieces into which it
                    divides are termed <hi rend="italic">valves.</hi> In some the dehiscence is
                    incomplete, as in <hi rend="italic">Antirrhinum</hi> (fig. 89), where it is
                    indicated by two pores at the apex, and in many <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caryophylleoe</hi> (fig. 90), where the valves only separate at the apex into
                    teeth. The pericarp is said to be <hi rend="italic">uni-, bi-,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">multivalved,</hi> as there are one, two, or many valves. When a
                    fruit is in its simplest state, or formed by the transformation of one
                    carpellary leaf (Plate CXI V. fig. 104), there may be two sutures or lines by
                    which it may open. The one is <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> where the margins of
                    the leaf or the placentae meet, and this is called the <hi rend="italic">ventral
                    suture;</hi> the other, or the <hi rend="italic">dorsal suture (b),</hi> is at
                    the part corresponding to the midrib of the leaf. But, in a compound fruit, an
                    opening may also take place at the junction of any two carpels; and from these
                    considerations the various kinds of dehiscence may be explained. If the line of
                    opening corresponds with the junction of the carpels, the dehiscence is <hi
                    rend="italic">septicidal</hi> (fig. 91); so that where there are dissepiments,
                    these are divided each into their two constituent membranes, and the cells
                    remain closed at the back; or the valves were formerly said to be alternate with
                    the dissepiments, or to have their margins turned inwards. If the opening is by
                    the dorsal suture of each carpel, the dehiscence is <hi rend="italic"
                    >loculicidal</hi> (fig. 86 and 88); so that here the dissepiments do not divide
                    into two portions, but the cells are opened at the back, or the dissepiments
                    were said to be opposite to the valves, or the valves to bear septa in their
                    middle. In some plants the cells remain closed, and separate in that state from
                    the axis, which is then an extension of the peduncle (fig. 92). In others the
                    placentas separate from the dissepiments and adhere to the axis, while the cells
                    open, and, with the dissepiments, separate from it (fig. 93). When the
                    dissepiments adhere to the axis, but separate from the back of the valves or
                    carpels, the dehiscence is said to be <hi rend="italic">septifrage</hi> (fig.
                    94). When a dehiscence, instead of being vertical or longitudinal, takes place
                    across the cells, it is called <hi rend="italic">transverse</hi> (fig. 95), as
                    <hi rend="italic">Anagallis.</hi></p>
                <p>The shape of the pericarp may be <hi rend="italic">spherical,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">ovate,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lenticular</hi> (like a lens),
                    <hi rend="italic">or prismatical,</hi> which terms are easily understood. It may
                    be <hi rend="italic">acute,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">obtuse,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">lobed.</hi> When the fruit is inferior it is often crowned by the
                    teeth of the calyx; and these teeth in many <hi rend="italic">Compositoe,</hi>
                    as we have already explained, are represented by a series of hairs called a <hi
                    rend="italic">pappus,</hi> which is either (fig. 96) <hi rend="italic"
                    >pilose,</hi> when each hair is simple, or <hi rend="italic">plumose</hi> (fig.
                    97), when each hair presents on each side a series of finer hairs, arranged like
                    the wings of a feather. In <hi rend="italic">Valeriana</hi> (fig· 98) the limb
                    of the calyx is at first rolled up so as to form a circular ring on the top of
                    the ovary, but afterwards (fig. 99) expands and elongates, and constitutes a
                    true plumose pappus. When the tube of the calyx is filled by the seed, the
                    pappus is said to be <hi rend="italic">sessile</hi> (fig. 97); but when it is
                    much attenuated at the apex beyond the seed, a kind of stalk or stipes is formed
                    to the pappus, and it is termed <hi rend="italic">stipitate</hi> (fig. 96), but
                    between these there are some states that tend to weaken these as characters.</p>
                <p>Fruits have been classified in several ways, and have received various
                    designations. From what we have already said of the ovarium, we trust the
                    following division may be easily understood. A fruit is either simple, multiple,
                    compound, or aggregated.</p>
                <p>It is <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> when it is the maturation of a single
                    carpellary leaf. Fruits of this class may be either <hi rend="italic"
                    >indehiscent</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dehiscent. Of</hi> the former is, 1. the
                    <hi rend="italic">caryopsis,</hi> where the pericarp is very thin and
                    membranous, ańd so closely united to the solitary seed as not to be
                    distinguished as a separate body, as in the wheat and barley (Plate CXIII. fig.
                    100): 2. an <hi rend="italic">utricle</hi> is similar to the caryopsis, the
                    pericarp being membranous, but it has no adherence with the seed: 3. an <hi
                    rend="italic">achenium</hi> is also one-seeded, but here (fig. 101) the <hi
                    rend="italic">pericarp</hi> is hard and bony, as well as distinct from the
                    proper covering of the seed, as in the <hi rend="italic">Compositoe</hi> (these
                    three are often confounded): 4. a <hi rend="italic">samara</hi> (fig. 102) is a
                    coriaceous, membranous, very compressed, few-seeded, indehiscent fruit, that is
                    often prolonged laterally or at the apex into wings or appendages, but this kind
                    does not perhaps exist in nature in an uncombined state: 5. a <hi rend="italic"
                    >drupe</hi> is a fleshy nut inclosing a putamen, as the cherry and peach: 6. a
                    <hi rend="italic">nut (nux),</hi> in its strictest sense, as now adopted by
                    Richard and De Candolle, differs slightly from a drupe; it contains a putamen,
                    but the sarcocarp (then called <hi rend="italic">naucum)</hi> is coriaceous
                    instead of being fleshy. The dry dehiscent fruits are, 7. the <hi rend="italic"
                    >follicle</hi> (fig. 103), or a carpel dehiscing by the ventral, and having no
                    dorsal suture: 8. the <hi rend="italic">legume</hi> (fig. 104), having both
                    ventral and dorsal sutures, by either of which, or by both or neither, it may
                    dehisce; rarely the sides fall off, leaving nothing but the sutures, which then
                    form a kind of frame called <hi rend="italic">replum.</hi> The legume is,
                    strictly speaking, unilocular, but in some plants appears bilocular, from an
                    inflexion of the ventral suture (fig. 105). In some instances it is separated
                    into several parts by horizontal partitions (fig. 106) arising out of the
                    placenta, or by contractions of the legume itself, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hippocrepis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Scorpiurus</hi> (fig. 107), at which it
                    falls into pieces, when it is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >lomentacceous.</hi></p>
                <p>A fruit is <hi rend="italic">multiple</hi> when the ovarium is apocarpous. It has
                    more than one style, and is formed of more than one carpellary leaf in the same
                    flower. The carpels may be either at a distance from each other or slightly
                    connected, but the endocarp does not separate from the epicarp to form
                    dissepiments. Few individual names have been given to this kind, botanists
                    having usually contented themselves with saying that it is <hi rend="italic"
                    >composed of achenia, drupes,</hi> &amp;c. according to the structure of each
                    individual carpel. When these are arranged upon or round a real or imaginary
                    axis, the fruit has been by some called, 9. <hi rend="italic">etoerion;</hi> the
                    strawberry (fig. 108), bramble, ranunculus, anona, and peony, are examples. 10.
                    The <hi rend="italic">pomum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">melonida</hi> also belongs
                    to this class; here the fruit is crowned by the teeth of the calyx, and is
                    formed of several parietal carpella attached to the interior of the tube by the
                    intervention of a usually thick and fleshy expansion of the torus. Of this there
                    are three varieties, lsŕ, When the numerous achenia are attached to the slightly
                    fleshy calyx, the fruit is a <hi rend="italic">hip</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >cynarrhodon</hi> (fig. 109), as the rose. 2d, When the calyx of the hip does
                    not become <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733700" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3700-0049"/>
                    fleshy, as in the agrimony, the fruit is called <hi rend="italic">amalthea.</hi>
                    The third variety is the <hi rend="italic">apple</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >pomum</hi> (Plate CXIII. fig. 87), in which there is but one longitudinal
                    series of carpels attached to a very fleshy calyx, and so enlarged as to appear
                    to meet in the axis of the fruit. A pomum, then, at first sight seems to be the
                    maturation of one inferior plurilocular, instead of several parietal ovaria.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">compound</hi> fruit is derived from a syncarpous ovarium, and
                    is formed by the union of several carpellary leaves. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ranunculus,</hi> and other plants with apocarpous ovaries, more than one series
                    of carpella are often matured. This, however, happens rarely among the
                    syncarpous, but it sometimes occurs; thus, in <hi rend="italic">Nicoiana
                    multivalvis,</hi> where the fruit is a capsule, two rows of carpellary leaves
                    are united into one pistillum. 11. A capsule (Plate CXIII∙ fig. 89 and 90) is a
                    dry, dehiscent pericarp, usually many-celled; but may, by the placentae being
                    parietal, or by the disappearance of the dissepiments, be occasionally
                    one-celled. 12. When a capsule opens transversely, it is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">pyxidium</hi> (fig. 95). 13. When a capsule bursts into achenia,
                    it is termed a <hi rend="italic">di-, tri-,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >polahenium.</hi> 14. When the tube of the calyx adheres to one of this last
                    kind, the fruit is called <hi rend="italic">cremocarpium</hi> (fig. 92), as in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Umbelliferoe</hi>; and each of the two constituent parts
                    («) a <hi rend="italic">mericarpium.</hi> 15. When a capsule is composed of <hi
                    rend="italic">cocci,</hi> or cells that open elastically by a membranous spring
                    placed at the bottom, it sometimes has got the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >elaterium</hi> or <hi rend="italic">regma,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Euphorbia.</hi> 16. A <hi rend="italic">siliqua</hi> when long and narrow (fig.
                    110), and <hi rend="italic">silicula</hi> when so short as to be almost as broad
                    as long (fig. IlD, is a dry pericarp formed of four carpels, the placentae of
                    which are parietal: moreover, the stigmas and placentae of an opposite pair of
                    these carpels are abortive, so that the carpels themselves represent valves,
                    while the two other intermediate carpels are contracted, and project, from the
                    inner side of each placenta, a membrane, which unites at the centre of the fruit
                    to the corresponding opposite membrane, the four membranes being ultimately
                    united into one dissepimental membranous expansion. <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> In common language, then, a siliqua or silicula may be defined to be a
                    dry, dehiscent, two-valved fruit, in which the seeds are attached to placentae
                    situated at the sutures of the valves, and which is usually divided into two
                    loculi or cells by a false dissepiment or prolongation of the placentae, that is
                    parallel to the valves. After the valves have fallen, the placentae often
                    remain, with or without the dissepiment or septum, in the form of a replum. 17.
                    When two samara are applied to each other so closely that there appears but one
                    (fig. 115), as in the ash and elm (the compound nature of the fruit, however,
                    being still evident from the double stigma even when one of the cells is
                    abortive), the fruit is still commonly called a <hi rend="italic">samara·</hi>
                    but in <hi rend="italic">Acer,</hi> where the constituent parts are readily
                    distinguished, the fruit is said to consist of two <hi rend="italic">samaroid
                    carpels.</hi> 18. A <hi rend="italic">carcerulus</hi> (fig. 116) is dry and
                    indehiscent, with several cells and seeds, as the lime tree. 19. A <hi
                    rend="italic">gland</hi> is a dry, bony, indehiscent, one-celled and one-seeded
                    fruit, but always the result of an ovarium with several cells and several seeds.
                    The pericarp unites closely to the seed, and is inclosed more or less in a sort
                    of involucrum. This term is sometimes restricted to the case where the
                    involucrum or cup is coriaceous and scaly, as in the acorn; and when it is
                    foliaceous, as in the hazel, it is called a <hi rend="italic">nucula.</hi> Many
                    botanists apply to both of these the name <hi rend="italic">nut</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">nux.</hi> When the involucrum is entirely wanting, and the fruit
                    is borne on a fleshy support, it has been termed<note anchored="true"

                    tetraspermous or four-sided, and appears to be quadrilocular; and each division,
                    resembling a distinct achenium, is placed around the slender base of the style;
                    in reality, however, it is a bilocular fruit, each cell being divided by a
                    spurious dissepiment into two, each one seeded, that in general easily separate
                    from each other. 21. In a <hi rend="italic">sarcobase</hi> (fig. 119) the ovary
                    is syncarpous, or of one pistillum; but all the carpels appear distinct, and are
                    borne on the fleshy base of the compound style, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ochnaceae.</hi> 22. A <hi rend="italic">nuculanium</hi> is a fleshy fruit, not
                    adherent to the tube of the calyx, and including several distinct putamcns or
                    nucules. 23. An <hi rend="italic">osteocarpium</hi> is a superior fleshy fruit,
                    with several cells, the sarcocarp being bony. 24. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >balausta</hi> is a somewhat coriaceous, plurilocular, polyspermous, inferior
                    fruit, adherent with the calyx and crowned with its teeth, as in the pomegranate
                    and myrtle. 25. A <hi rend="italic">berry (bacca)</hi> is a succulent fruit,
                    with a membranous pericarp, the seeds of which lose their adhesion when ripe,
                    and he loose in pulp, as the gooseberry or grape (fig. 120). 26. The <hi
                    rend="italic">orange</hi> or <hi rend="italic">hes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >peridium</hi> is a multilocular succulent fruit, similar to a berry, but having
                    the epicarp, sarcocarp, and endocarp well defined, and forming a leathery
                    pericarp. The loculi or cells are filled with pulpy bags or vesicles, which are
                    mere cellular extensions of the sides of the carpella. 27. A <hi rend="italic"
                    >pepo</hi> or <hi rend="italic">peponida</hi> is a fleshy inferior fruit, either
                    indehiscent or bursting irregularly, and consisting of about three carpels, each
                    of which is divided into two loculi by its placentiferous margin (Plate CXIII.
                    fig. 82) being so introflexed as to reach the dorsal suture. The sides of the
                    carpel, and even sometimes the introflexed portion, usually disappear in the
                    ripe fruit; so that at first sight it would be said to bc, and has been so
                    described, a one-celled, fleshy, indehiscent fruit, with parietal placentas that
                    send out sometimes false dissepiments towards the axis (fig. 121), as the
                    cucumber and gourd. We do not agree with Richard in calling the fruit of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nymphaea</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Nuphar</hi> a peponida. In
                    these there is in fact an apocarpus ovarium (fig. 122), each carpel being merely
                    attached by its back to an expansion of the torus, which soon decays, leaving
                    the carpels distinct from each other. The torus also surrounding the styles and
                    the stigmas, makes the whole assume the false appearance of one pistillum; and
                    that part of each carpel which is directed towards the axis of the fruit is the
                    placenta,-and not a dissepiment. There is, therefore, little or no difference
                    between the <hi rend="italic">Nymplioeaceae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nelumbo-naceae,</hi> except that the carpels of the latter are monospermous.
                    The fruit of <hi rend="italic">Hydrocharideoe</hi> resembles in some degree a
                    peponida; it is one-celled, and the placentas are truly parietal, but project
                    from the false dissepiments towards the axis, appearing sometimes as if a
                    many-celled fruit.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Aggregated</hi> fruits are formed out of several flowers. 28.
                    An <hi rend="italic">amentum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">catkin</hi> exists in
                    those plants to which there is no floral envelope; but in place of it there is a
                    membranous bractea situated below each pistillum, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salix</hi> or willow. 29. When the bractea of an amentum becomes extremely
                    small, and the carpellary leaf is a large indurated scale, open at all periods
                    of its growth, and containing naked seeds, we have a <hi rend="italic">cone</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">strobilus</hi> (fig. 123), as in the pine tribe; and when
                    this is much re-duced<pb break="no" facs="nls:193733713"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-3713-0050"/> in size, and the scales firmly cohere, it is
                    called a <hi rend="italic">galbulum</hi> (fig. 124), as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thuja.</hi> The term <hi rend="italic">cone</hi> is also often applied to the
                    fruit of some <hi rend="italic">Proteaccae;</hi> but in these there is a
                    perianth, and the indurated scales are real bracteas, and it may be sufficient
                    to say of their flowers that they are aggregated. 30. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >sorosus</hi> (fig. 125) is when several fruits (Z&gt;) are united together into
                    one body by the intervention and combination of their respective fleshy and
                    highly developed floral envelopes («), as in the mulberry and pine-apple. 31.
                    The <hi rend="italic">syconus or fig</hi> is when the fruit is composed of many
                    small drupes or achenia, collected on the interior of a fleshy and succulent
                    receptacle formed by the hollow dilated apex of the peduncle. Lach of the
                    achenia belongs to a distinct floret, and therefore, when the fig is expanded
                    into a nearly flat disc, as in <hi rend="italic">Dorstenia</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> it resembles the receptacle of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Composites,</hi> and is therefore scarcely entitled to be considered as a
                    peculiar fruit.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Placenta.</hi></p>
                <p>Having thus given a rapid sketch of the different kinds of fruits, we must now
                    revert to the carpel, of which they are composed; and we would again recall to
                    the recollection of our readers, that this is a modification of a folded leaf,
                    towards the margins of which, arising from the extremity of the nerves, are
                    placed the seeds. The parts to which these are attached must therefore always be
                    two (however closely they may be approximated) in each carpel; they are
                    immediately connected with the style, and usually of a different texture from
                    the rest of the cell; and, as has been explained while describing the ovarium,
                    they are generally called <hi rend="italic">placentoe,</hi> though by some
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">trophosperms.</hi> In a solitary carpel the
                    placenta is usually at the ventral suture, but, by the margins being
                    occasionally introflexed, may be either in the centre of the fruit, or even at
                    the dorsal suture; and therefore, in a plurilocular pericarp, it may be either
                    at the axis of the fruit, or in the middle of each cell, or, when each cell is
                    spuriously bilocular, may be even at the dorsal sutures; a one-celled pericarp,
                    that is formed from a syncarpous ovary, must however have the placentas strictly
                    parietal, and placed at the margins of each carpel. A plurilocular pericarp may
                    present an anomalous appearance by abortion. Thus there may be a central
                    placenta by the disappearance of the sides of the carpels, or the placenta may
                    be parietal (or rather at the dorsal suture), by the abortion of the sides and
                    introflexed margins. On the other hand, an unilocular fruit may appear bi-or
                    multilocular, by the placenta projecting membranous expansions or spurious
                    dissepiments, all which must be carefully studied while pronouncing on the
                    affinities of different plants.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the placenta presents small prolongations, to which the seeds are
                    fixed, and which are <hi rend="italic">termed funiculi</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >podosperms</hi> (fig. 127, a). They are very evident in leguminous plants (fig.
                    104), in <hi rend="italic">Cruciferoe</hi> (fig. 110), and many others. In some
                    they are very short and thick, but are in others slender and filiform. When the
                    placenta or the funiculus expands at its point of attachment to the seed into a
                    cup-shaped body of greater or less dimensions, this is termed an <hi
                    rend="italic">arillus.</hi> In the nutmeg (fig. 126) this arillus is red and
                    fleshy, and cut unequally, and is called a mace. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Euonymus</hi> it covers the seed nearly all round (fig. 127); in <hi
                    rend="italic">Polygala</hi> it constitutes a little crown scarcely visible, at
                    the base of the seed. But arillae must not be confounded with integument of the
                    seed. Thus the apparent appendage of the seed in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nepenthes</hi> (fig. 128), and the fleshy covering in the jasmine, are actually
                    portions of the testa. An arillus is never developed till after the impregnation
                    of the ovulum.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Seed.</hi></p>
                <p>The fruit is formed of two parts, the pericarp and the seed. What we have already
                    gone over belongs to the former; we now proceed to the latter.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">seed</hi> is that part of a perfect fruit which is found in
                    the internal part of the pericarp, attached to the placenta, or to its process,
                    the funiculus. Every seed arises from a fecundated ovule, and therefore a naked
                    seed can only be said to exist in those rare cases in which we have found a
                    naked ovulum. Its essential character is to include an organized body, which,
                    under favourable circumstances, is developed, and becomes a plant similar to
                    that from which the seed was obtained. This body is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >∖∖∖C embryo.</hi></p>
                <p>The position of the seed is of equal importance with that of the ovule; but as
                    the terms are the same, we will not here repeat them.</p>
                <p>In the ripe seed, what was the base of the ovulum be- ∣ comes the base of the
                    seed, and is called the <hi rend="italic">hilum</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >umbilicus;</hi> the expansion of the raphe at the base of the nucleus becomes
                    the <hi rend="italic">chalaza;</hi> and the foramen is then called the <hi
                    rend="italic">micropyle</hi> (fig. 129, «). The <hi rend="italic">testa</hi>
                    (fig. 130, <hi rend="italic">a)</hi> or primine sac sometimes disappears, and in
                    others becomes thick; the <hi rend="italic">tegmen</hi> (fig. 130, 6) becomes
                    usually incorporated with the testa, although it also in some plants disappears,
                    and the two are generally known under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >episperm.</hi> De Candolle has, without considering the ovule, but only
                    regarding the ripe seed, followed Richard, and viewed the episperm as but one
                    coat, the outer surface of which he has termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >spermoderm,</hi> the inner, the <hi rend="italic">endopleura,</hi> and the
                    intermediate portion, chiefly constituted by the spreading vessels of the raphe,
                    the <hi rend="italic">mesosperm.</hi> But the terms testa, tegmen, and raphe,
                    are much less exceptionable, as they exhibit a relation to the structure of the
                    ovulum. In some plants, as we have already said, the testa is fleshy; in others
                    it is attenuated (fig. 128) into a long process, both of which may be mistaken
                    for an arillus if proper attention be not paid. In the cotton-plant the whole
                    surface is covered with hair-like expansions, when the seed is said to be wrapt
                    in wool; or such hairs may be merely placed at one or both ends, when they
                    constitute a <hi rend="italic">coma.</hi> In some plants there are tumours on
                    the testa, near the hilum, or at its opposite end, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >strophi-oloe</hi> or <hi rend="italic">carunculae</hi> (fig. 131), the precise
                    nature of which is unknown; but in some instances they appear to be dilatations
                    of the chalaza, and in other cases they seem caused by a diseased state of the
                    lips of the foramen or micropyle.</p>
                <p>After impregnation, the nucleus undergoes great changes. The embryonic sac
                    increases rapidly in every way, and often pushes back the cellular tissue or
                    parenchyma of the nucleus, until this latter is reduced to a thin pellicle or
                    membrane, and is ultimately filled with nothing but the embryo; in which case
                    the membrane or sac itself either disappears entirely, or becomes incorporated
                    with the parenchyma of the nucleus; and such plants are said to be destitute of
                    <hi rend="italic">albumen.</hi> In others, however, numerous globules are
                    deposited on the inside of the sac, and these by their agglomeration constitute
                    the <hi rend="italic">endosperm</hi> (fig. 130, c), inclosed in which is the
                    embryo (fig. 130, d’). But the almost complete destruction of the parenchyma of
                    the nucleus, and great development of the embryonic sac, does not always take
                    place: for in some plants the sac is only enlarged sufficiently to contain the
                    embryo, and the parenchyma is to be observed (fig. 130, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e)</hi> in the ripe seed filled with globules of a starchy substance, and is
                    thus converted into a body similar to the endosperm; but, from its different
                    situation and mode of formation, is called by another name in order to
                    distinguish it, viz. the <hi rend="italic">perisperm.</hi> In a few plants both
                    the endosperm and perisperm may be traced, as in the water-lily<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193733726" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3726-0051"/>. We adopt these terms in
                    conformity with Brongniart; but we must observe that systematic writers use
                    these words, as well as albumen, promiscuously. In common language these are
                    applied to that body which is to be sometimes found between the embryo and the
                    coats of the seed, and whose cellular substance is totally different from the
                    organized embryo; but when botanists discovered, as in the water-lily, in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Scitamineae, Piperaceae,</hi> and some other tribes (fig.
                    132), not only the albumen, but a second body more immediately surrounding the
                    embryo, they gave this the name of <hi rend="italic">vitellus</hi> (Brown), or
                    <hi rend="italic">sac to the embryo</hi> (Lindley). Brown, however, afterwards
                    showed that the vitellus was a kind of albumen, and that two kinds might exist
                    in the same plant; and more lately Brongniart has suggested the propriety of
                    employing expressions for each. Perhaps, on the whole, the term albumen, so
                    generally adopted, might be used promiscuously for whichever is developed, and
                    when it is necessary to distinguish both, to employ the terms endosperm and
                    perisperm. We object to the use of the phrases vitellus, and sac to the embryo,
                    because in many instances the albumen is entirely formed of this supposed sac or
                    vitellus, and that if these words are to be adopted, they ought to be so
                    constantly, and not in those cases only where both parts of the albumen are
                    visible.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We have already
                    stated Mirbel’s view of the structure of the ovulum, and said that he has
                    pointed out five distinct periods of development. In the first, the ovulum is
                    scarcely perceptible, being a small pulpy conical substance, without a foramen.
                    In the second, the exostome and endostome open, and they are to be perceived
                    dilating insensibly until they have attained their maximum. I he primine and
                    secundine are manifest, as is also the tercine; but this only puts on the
                    appearance of a round or conical cellular mass, of which the apex protrudes
                    beyond the secundine. In the third period the primine and secundine, united
                    together, increase much in size, have their double orifice closed, and
                    consequently conceal the tercine, which becomes a membranous bag. In the fourth
                    period the quartine arises from the internal surface of the nucleus, and the
                    quintine is elongated into a narrow utricle attached by the one extremity to the
                    point corresponding to the chalaza, and by the other to that near to the
                    endostome. This is the period in which the ovule passes into the state of a
                    seed. In the fifth period the quintine expands, the embryo exhibits the
                    cotyledons as wellf “L <hi rend="superscript"> e ra</hi> ð <hi

                    apparently different, are in reality much the same as those of Brongniart, the
                    quartine corresponding to the parenchyma of the embryo, and the quintine to the
                    embryonic sac.</p></note></p>
                <p>The nature of the albumen is of great importance: it is <hi rend="italic"
                    >farinaceous</hi> in the grasses; <hi rend="italic">coriaceous</hi> and almost
                    <hi rend="italic">car-tilagrnous</hi> in many umbelliferae; <hi rend="italic"
                    >ruminated</hi> when it is wrinkled by reason of prolongations of the coat of
                    the seed into the folds of the albumen, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annonaceae;</hi> fleshy in most of the <hi rend="italic">Euphorbiaceae;
                    horny,</hi> as in the coffee-bean; or thin and membranous, as in many <hi
                    rend="italic">Labiarae.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">embryo,</hi> as we have already said, is that organized
                    body existing in the perfect seed after fecundation, which is destined to become
                    a plant similar in all respects to the parent. It may either have or be without
                    an albumen. When the albumen is present, and the embryo is applied to a point on
                    its surface, it is said to be <hi rend="italic">external (exterior) ∙,</hi> or
                    if rolled round it, is <hi rend="italic">periph eric.</hi> If shut up within the
                    albumen, it is said to be <hi rend="italic">inclosed (inclusus),</hi> and then
                    may be either in the centre of the albumen <hi rend="italic">(centralis),</hi>
                    or not in the centre <hi rend="italic">(eccentricus).</hi> Usually there is but
                    one embryo in each seed; but plants occur in which there are more than one, as
                    the <hi rend="italic">Allium fragrans,</hi> mistletoe (fig. 133), &amp;c.</p>
                <p>As the embryo is already organized in the seed, and becomes a plant by mere
                    development, so all the parts of the future plant must exist in it, although in
                    a mere rudimentary state. It must, therefore, contain the rudiments of the root,
                    of the stem, and of the leaves.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Radicle.</hi> This is the rudiment of the root (fig. 134, <hi
                    rend="italic">a),</hi> and by germination becomes a root. Such may either happen
                    by the mere elongation of the exposed radicle, or by its bursting through a
                    peculiar envelope, and protruding the root from within. Plants which have this
                    cover to the radicle are termed <hi rend="italic">endorhizoe</hi> (fig. 135, <hi
                    rend="italic">a),</hi> and those which have none <hi rend="italic"
                    >exorhizoe.</hi> Moreover, with very few exceptions, and which are generally
                    attended with other peculiarities, all exogenous plants are Exorhizae, and the
                    endogenous, Endorhizae; so that the radicle indicates the future structure of
                    the stem. The radicle is usually quite distinct from the albumen; but in <hi
                    rend="italic">Cycadeae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Coniferoe</hi> there is an
                    organic connection between them. Hence Richard has raised these orders to a
                    distinct class, and called them <hi rend="italic">synorhizoe.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">neck</hi> or <hi rend="italic">collum</hi> is the line of
                    separation between the radicle and the portion above it.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Plumule</hi> (fig. 134, <hi rend="italic">c),</hi> is what
                    is destined to become the stem, and is therefore a rudimentary leaf-bud. It is
                    by some divided into the <hi rend="italic">cauliculus,</hi> or the portion
                    between the radicle and the cotyledons, and the <hi rend="italic">gemmule,</hi>
                    or that which is situated above the cotyledons. If, however, our idea of the
                    plumule be correct, the cauliculus corresponds to the neck or collum, while the
                    gemmule is all that constitutes the true plumule. The plumule is often
                    undistinguishable from the cotyledons, as in most of the exogenous plants that
                    have albumen; while it is pretty evident in all exogenae without albumen. Among
                    the endogenae the plumule is frequently rolled up in the cotyledon, and is not
                    observable till after germination.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">cotyledons</hi> (fig. 134, <hi rend="italic">b)</hi> are
                    the primordial leaves of the plant; and as the plumule corresponds to a leafbud,
                    so the cotyledons must be lateral, and situated at its base. We have already
                    observed that in exogenae the leaves towards the bottom of the plant have a
                    tendency to be opposite, and in endogenae alternate. In the embryo, then, where
                    there can be but few leaves, we may naturally expect this disposition to be
                    exact; and in fact it is so, exogenae having opposite or verticillate
                    cotyledons, and endogenae alternate. In the former case they are usually two in
                    number, whence exogenous plants are also called <hi rend="italic"
                    >dicoyledonous;</hi> but sometimes there are more than two, as in the pine.
                    These, however, being in a whorl, are mere modifications of the opposite
                    cotyledons; and it has not been thought necessary to distinguish them from the
                    dicoyledonous. When the cotyledons alternate, it is obvious that one only can be
                    present at the base of the plumule; hence endogenous plants are called <hi
                    rend="italic">monocotyledonous.</hi> In some of these the first leaf of the
                    plumule is at the same time slightly developed, whence botanists have supposed
                    that some endogenae have two cotyledons. Their alternating with each other will,
                    however, completely distinguish them from the dicoyledonous plants. Sometimes
                    the two cotyledons of the exogenae are consolidated into one piece, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Lecythus;</hi> in other plants, in which the leaves are reduced to
                    mere scales, the cotyledons are also in a reduced state, and scarcely
                    perceptible; but we have no right to infer, as some have done, that the embryo
                    has none at all, or is acotyledonous. The cotyledons are erect, and placed close
                    to each other, containing between them the plumule; they may be <hi
                    rend="italic">fleshy</hi> or <hi rend="italic">foliaceous, narrow</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">semicylindrical,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">broad</hi> and <pb

                    or <hi rend="italic">epigeous,</hi> when, by an elongation of the collum, they
                    rise out of the ground during that process, as in the bean.</p>
                <p>Having thus explained these parts, we have to notice the direction of the embryo.
                    It may be <hi rend="italic">straight</hi> or <hi rend="italic">curved.</hi> The
                    radicle is the <hi rend="italic">base</hi> of the embryo, and the summit of the
                    cotyledon the <hi rend="italic">apex.</hi> Now, as the hilum is the base of the
                    seed, so, when the radicle points towards the hilum, the embryo has the same
                    direction as the seed, and is said to be <hi rend="italic">homotropous,</hi> and
                    if at the same time it be straight, <hi rend="italic">orthotropous;</hi> and
                    when the cotyledons point to the hilum, it is inverted, or is called <hi
                    rend="italic">antitropous.</hi> When it assumes a horizontal direction, or lies
                    across the seed, and has not the same direction with it, it is <hi rend="italic"
                    >heterotropous.</hi> And, lastly, in a curved seed, both extremities of the
                    embryo may be turned towards the hilum, and it has been then termed <hi
                    rend="italic">amphitropous</hi> (fig. 140); but this is a modification of the
                    antitropous. It has been now discovered that the radicle, or base of the embryo,
                    is always situated at the foramen of the ovule or micropyle of the seed, and
                    that the other or cotyledonary extremity as invariably is directed towards the
                    chalaza. If, then, the nucleus of the ovule have a contrary direction to the
                    ovule itself, or if the micropyle be near the hilum, the embryo is homotropous;
                    but if the nucleus be erect, or the micropyle be at the apex of the seed, it is
                    antitropous; and if the micropyle be at the side of the seed, it is
                    heterotropous. In a curved seed, where the micropyle and chalaza are brought
                    nearly into contact, we have the amphitropous embryo.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mirbel takes notice of an anomaly in the <hi

                    from the unequal development of the parts of the ovule. Here the primine sac or
                    testa, in consequence of an extraordinary increase on the extensible side of the
                    ovule, and a gradual contraction of the opposite one, has by degrees the
                    exostome turned towards the chalaza, so that at last, as in other curved seeds,
                    the two extremities coalesce; but the extensible side of the secundine, and even
                    of the tercine or nucleus, soon ceases to increase with the corresponding side
                    of the primine; so that the embryo, of which the radicle remained close to the
                    summit of the internal envelopes, becomes stationary with the endostome, whilst
                    the exostome has pursued it course and does not stop till it reaches the base of
                    the ovule.</p></note></p>
                <p>The position of the hilum in regard to the radicle, or, as one may say, the
                    direction of the embryo with respect to the seed, is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">spermic</hi> direction of the embryo, and is usually of great
                    importance in defining most natural groups. Thus, in the horse-chestnut, where
                    there are two seeds in each cell, of which the one is erect and the other
                    inverted, or rather resupinate, the spermic direction of the embryo is the same
                    in each. But in some tribes, as the <hi rend="italic">Proteaceae,</hi> the
                    situation of the hilum on the seed appears to be variable; in which case we must
                    resort to the <hi rend="italic">pericarpic</hi> direction of the embryo, or its
                    direction relatively to the fruit; and then, when it has the same direction as
                    the fruit, it is <hi rend="italic">erect,</hi> or the radicle is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">inferior;</hi> and when it has an opposite direction, it is <hi
                    rend="italic">inverted,</hi> or the radicle is superior.</p>
                <p>In a curved embryo, the relative position of the radicle and cotyledons is of
                    great importance. Upon this De Candolle has founded his divisions of the
                    cruciferae. When the radicle is so bent that it touches the back of one of the
                    cotyledons, it is said to be <hi rend="italic">dorsal,</hi> or the cotyledons
                    <hi rend="italic">incumbent</hi> (fig. 137). When it is applied to the edge or
                    cleft of the cotyledons it is <hi rend="italic">lateral,</hi> or the cotyledons
                    are <hi rend="italic">adcumbent</hi> (fig. 138). The same terms are analogically
                    applied, even when the radicle is very slightly bent, but where, by a
                    continuation of the bend, it might touch the back or edge of the cotyledons, as
                    in the genus <hi rend="italic">Polygonum.</hi><hi rend="italic">Arrangement of
                    the Organs of Peproduction.</hi></p>
                <p>All the organs of reproduction being modified leaves, it might be expected that
                    their relative position must follow the same law; but whatever be the causes of
                    aberration, we know that such is seldom the case. Although the number of the
                    parts of each verticil, as the calyx, corolla, &amp;c. be usually the same as
                    that of the leaves of the plant, yet every sixth real leaf is placed under the
                    first in a quinary spiral, while in the flower the general rule is, that the
                    sixth, or the first petal, is placed between the first and the second leaf of
                    the spiral, or, in other words, the petals usually alternate with the sepals. In
                    the same way the stamina alternate with the petals, or are opposite to the
                    divisions of the calyx; and, lastly, the carpels alternate with the stamina, and
                    are opposite to the petals. Such is the general disposition when the parts of
                    the flower are definite and present; and even although at times there be a
                    multiplicity of stamina and styles, these arise from two or more rows of the
                    staminary and carpellary leaves being developed, and can scarcely be said to
                    affect the rule; and hence this is called the <hi rend="italic">normal
                    arrangement,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">symmetrical number.</hi> But
                    exceptions nevertheless do occur. Thus petals have been found placed before
                    sepals, stamens before the petals, or carpels before the stamens, as well as
                    various combinations of the opposite with the alternating system; but no plant
                    is, we believe, known in which all the parts are opposite. One of the most
                    remarkable states is where the calyx and corolla do alternate, while the carpels
                    are placed opposite to the sepals, and alternate with the petals. Brown, upon
                    whom no irregularity of structure, even the most trivial, is lost, has, from
                    these anomalies, suggested that the full or <hi rend="italic">complete
                    number</hi> of parts in both the stamina and the carpels is equal to that of the
                    divisions of the calyx and corolla taken conjointly. In the monocotyledonous
                    plants the complete number is the most prevalent, while it is rare among the
                    dicoyledonous. The full number may, however, be seen in decandrous and
                    octandrous plants. Most of the leguminosae exhibit the complete number of
                    stamens, but all the pistilla are abortive but one. Many of the genera that have
                    the symmetrical number exhibit sometimes glands, and sometimes imperfect stamens
                    between the perfect ones, which tend to show the extreme accuracy of Mr Brown’s
                    suggestion. In distinguishing genera, or even orders, it is often of importance
                    to examine whether the arrangement be normal or not.</p>
                <p>But there is another point worthy of consideration, and that is the relative
                    'position of the parts of the calyx to the axis of inflorescence, or to the
                    subtending bractea. That part which is next the bractea is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">anterior</hi> or <hi rend="italic">inferior,</hi> while the
                    opposite portion is <hi rend="italic">superior</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >posterior.</hi> Now, one of the segments of the calyx is usually posterior, and
                    a petal anterior; but in a very few groups of plants this position is reversed.
                    When the symmetrical arrangement takes place, one of the sepals is, we believe,
                    always superior, and it is evident that one of the carpels must be therefore
                    anterior; and when the complete number is to be observed, one carpel must be
                    also anterior, whatever be the situation of the sepals. But what is remarkable
                    is, that though all the carpels be reduced by abortion to unity, the solitary
                    simple pistillum that is left is the one which was inferior; so that in every
                    possible case where the pistils are reduced to one carpel, that one is situated
                    next the bractea, and consequently has its placentiferous margin, which is next
                    the axis of the flower, superior.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733752" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3752-0053"/>
                <p>The examination, then, of a simple solitary pistillum will thus, although we may
                    have before us no more than a flower without the bractea, determine the anterior
                    and posterior situation of the lobes of the calyx or sepals. In the same way,
                    when the division of the flower is quinary, and the carpels are reduced to two,
                    the one is usually anterior, and the other posterior; or the solitary carpel
                    being anterior, the addition to it is posterior. The only exception to this with
                    which Mr Brown (who first laid any stress upon it) appears to be acquainted, was
                    in some genera of <hi rend="italic">Dilleniacece.</hi> Martius, and following
                    him Lindley, have distinguished <hi rend="italic">Gentianeae</hi> from their
                    allies by the two carpels being placed right and left, and not anterior and
                    posterior; but perhaps these able naturalists have not taken into due
                    consideration the nature of the inflorescence and the consequent position of the
                    bracteas. At present, therefore, we do not consider that tribe as an exception.
                    In <hi rend="italic">Dilleniaceae</hi> even, if we understand rightly the
                    structure of the order, the apparent exceptions are caused by peculiarities upon
                    which it were improper here to enter, nay even imprudent, for no one in Europe
                    has had the same opportunities of studying the group as the distinguished
                    naturalist to whom we have alluded.</p>
                <p>With regard to the number of parts in each whorl of the flowers, the symmetrical
                    number is <hi rend="italic">five</hi> among the dicoyledonous, or sometimes <hi
                    rend="italic">four,</hi> while in the monocotyledonous it is <hi rend="italic"
                    >three.</hi> When, however, we consider that, on the one hand, there may be a
                    reduction of parts, by the sepals, petals, stamina, and carpels, being much
                    subject to abortion and union, and, on the other, an excess, either by
                    multiplication, by more series than one of the same kind being developed, or by
                    the combination of several flowers into one, we may easily conceive how few
                    plants belong either to pentandria pentagynia, or to pentandria mono-gynia with
                    a five-celled fruit.</p>
                <p>Some botanists have supposed that the calyx and corolla form only one envelope;
                    but this question seemed put to rest till the complete number of stamina and
                    styles were found each equal to the conjunct number of both the floral
                    coverings, when we have seen it revived. But we would suggest to those who may
                    be inclined to adopt such an opinion, the difficulty of the case when petals are
                    placed before the sepals. If these formed one envelope, then we must suppose the
                    alternating petals abortive, and the apparent one a transformed stamen; and this
                    supposition might be true if we <hi rend="italic">never</hi> found a real stamen
                    also opposite to the sepal and petal; but the <hi rend="italic">Berberideoe</hi>
                    form at once an exception. We are aware that such a difficulty might be partly
                    overcome by viewing the calyx of the <hi rend="italic">Berberideae</hi> as a
                    series of bracteolae, so that we should have but one floral covering, and thus
                    approach them to the <hi rend="italic">Laurineae;</hi> for, by the abortion of
                    some stamens, there is nothing to prevent the others being opposite to the
                    petal, provided the petals were not also opposite to the sepals. But we do not
                    recollect that any one has placed the <hi rend="italic">Eerberideoe</hi> among
                    the monochlamydeae; and as for the theory in general, it has been permitted by
                    common consent to be now almost forgotten.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Dunal of Montpellier on the floral organs. This distinguished botanist considers
                    that all the parts of a flower in its perfect state may be referred to three
                    systems, which are respectively composed of several verticils or series in the
                    following order, the divisions of each verticil constantly alternating with
                    those of the preceding verticil. I. <hi rend="italic">Calycinαl system,</hi> and
                    always sterile. Of this there are three verticils, the first being sometimes
                    called exterior sepals; the second is often termed by botanists an outer calyx;
                    the third is the calyx of authors, and within its segments, and opposite to
                    them, and often adhering with them, are an equal number of scales or <hi
                    rend="italic">lepals</hi> analogous to those in the next system, but which form
                    only a part of this the third verticil; and these scales cover the whole inside
                    of the calyx in many achlamydeae. ÏI. <hi rend="italic">Mak reproductive
                    system,</hi> or androeceum. This is formed of two ranks, an exterior and
                    interior. Of the former, the first verticil furnishes the petals, in the axils
                    of which are found scales or lepals, but both only form one series; the second
                    verticil is of an equal number of parts, and alternate with them. The inner
                    androeceum has also two verticils. III. <hi rend="italic">Female reproductive
                    system,</hi> or gynoeceum, consists likewise of two verticils, the first of
                    which usually constitutes the fruit, and consequently has its divisions opposite
                    to those of the calyx or third verticil of the calycinal system. Thus, the whole
                    parts of the flower consist of nine series or verticils. The lepals or stamens
                    found in the axils of the petals or first verticil of the exterior androeceum,
                    as well as the real stamens, are often separated into several, or, as Dunal
                    terms them, <hi rend="italic">choristate,</hi> as in the almond. The fleshy
                    disoid torus found in some plants he supposes to arise from the abortion of the
                    inner androeceum; a perigynous ring or disc, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Santalaceae,</hi> he supposes to be formed by the union of the lepals and
                    filaments of the outer androeceum. We shall not here enter into a discussion on
                    the merits of this theory, which it is difficult to understand without a
                    reference to Μ. Dunal’s figures; but shall merely observe that it is exceedingly
                    ingenious, and, if properly substantiated, may explain several anomalies in the
                    structure of flowers hitherto involved in considerable obscurity.</p></note><hi
                    rend="italic">CELLULAR PLANTS.</hi></p>
                <p>Having now at length explained the reproductive organs of vascular plants, we
                    cannot pass over the <hi rend="italic">cellular.</hi> In all these, as we have
                    already said, there are no spiral vessels; and if, as we imagine, such are
                    essential to the formation of a fecundating pollen, and of an embryo, we shall
                    have no difficulty of denying to the whole class a real seed. Some botanists
                    have insisted on the presence of male and female flowers; but if these do exist,
                    they are in so very modified a state, so small, and so obscure, that all
                    cellular plants have been invariably termed <hi rend="italic">cryptogamous</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">agaìnous,</hi> in opposition to vascular plants, or those
                    with spiral vessels in which there are flowers, and hence called <hi
                    rend="italic">phanerogamous</hi> or <hi rend="italic">phaenogamous,</hi> from
                    their sexes being evident and well formed. From the imperfection of the pollen
                    and ovula (allowing such to exist) no embryo is formed, and thus cellulares are
                    by some called <hi rend="italic">ar-hizae</hi> (without a radicle), and by
                    others <hi rend="italic">acotyledonous</hi> (without cotyledons); both of these
                    terms, however, from their allusion to an embryo, are, in our opinion, subject
                    to criticism, so that those at one time adopted by Richard, of <hi rend="italic"
                    >embryonatoe</hi> (with sexes, seeds, and embryo), and <hi rend="italic"
                    >exem-bryonatae</hi> (without sexes, without seeds, and without an embryo), for
                    the two grand divisions of vegetables, are more strictly correct. But if
                    cellular plants have no seeds, how are they reproduced? Linnaeus has laid down
                    the rule <hi rend="italic">omne vivum ex oνo;</hi> but at that time the
                    anatomical structure and physiology of the ovum was not so well understood; and
                    there does not seem to be any doubt in the present day, that where spiral
                    vessels are not present, a new individual may be formed by mere dilatation of
                    some portion of the parent plant suited to the purpose, remotely similar to the
                    multiplication of polypi in the animal kingdom, or even to spurious leaf-buds
                    among vegetables. The portions thus capable of expansion have been by some
                    termed <hi rend="italic">seeds,</hi> from a general resemblance to true seeds,
                    but are strictly called <hi rend="italic">sporules.</hi> These sporules appear
                    to give rise to a plant, in many cases, by elongating at some one point that
                    seems to be only determined by contingent circumstances. In the ductulose
                    cellular plants (we allude chiefly to those ferns with a rhizoma, for these
                    alone have been examined with sufficient care) the sporule elongates into what
                    at first has the appearance of a short club-shaped body (fig. 141) with two or
                    three transverse darker coloured streaks. This, then, by degrees expands into a
                    flat cellular and somewhat folia- <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733765"

                    radicular fibres from its margin; and these being now capable of deriving
                    immediate nourishment from the earth, the body of the sporule disappears. This
                    flat substance appears by elongation to become the rhizoma; for soon after it is
                    fixed to the ground, it emits, from a point on its upper surface (fig. 143), a
                    thread, which is afterwards the stipes and the leafy part of the plant. Mosses
                    germinate nearly in the same wav; the clavate, and as it articulated, body
                    arises from the’sporule, and then elongates, brançhes, and forms the radicular
                    portion, from some part of which the stem (as it is called) is projected,
                    bearing the leaves (See <hi rend="italic">Phascum serratum,</hi> fig. 144). Many
                    <hi rend="italic">Hepatica</hi> germinate as the mosses. <hi rend="italic"

                    mosses, and these fibres afterwards more or less unite together. Most lichens
                    germinate like the ferns, the dilated filament becoming the frond. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Fungi</hi> have not been well observed in this respect; but it
                    seems probable that, in the greater number, the whole mass is formed by the mere
                    expansion of the sporule. How in all these orders the sporules are formed from
                    the cells of the parent plant, and how they are endowed with the power of
                    expansion, is a difficulty not easily solved; but this, as well as the
                    investigation of the vivifying principle of the pollen on the embryo in vascular
                    vegetables, is a subject purely physiological, and does not fall within our
                    limits. We shall, however, merely state the only analogy, and it is a distant
                    one, we can trace between these. Sporules are brought into life by coming into
                    contact with external moisture, while the granules of pollen may be viewed as
                    sporules that require to be fully shaped and fostered by the juices in the
                    interior of the embryonic sac.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Equisetaceae.—</hi> The stems, and often the principal
                    branches, of this tribe, are terminated by an ovate or conical <hi rend="italic"
                    >spike,</hi> or rather raceme (fig. 145), composed of several verticillated
                    scales (fig. 146), which are pedicellate, peltate, and angular. From the under
                    side of these scales several wedge-shaped <hi rend="italic">involucra</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">indusia</hi> project downwards, and burst longitudinally on
                    the side next the pedicel, and discharge a multitude of globules. These globules
                    (fig. 147), when seen under the microscope, consist of a central green compact
                    spherical body, furnished at its base with four elongated clavate filaments,
                    slightly united by pairs of an elastic nature, so that when moist they twist
                    spirally round the central portion, but when dry unrol and expand themselves,
                    bearing on them many minute granules. The use of these parts is unknown. Hedwig
                    supposed the central body to be a pistillum, and that each pair of elastic
                    filaments formed one stamen, whose pollen was the granules. Brongniart, tracing
                    in these plants a general resemblance to <hi rend="italic">Conifera</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyca-dea,</hi> presumes that the central body is a naked ovulum,
                    and the filaments four grains of poilen united in pairs to its base. But
                    although we admit either of these theories, we cannot regard the male organs as
                    perfect; and the uniform structure of the supposed pistil or ovule militates
                    against both hypotheses. Perhaps the central body may be viewed as a short seta
                    or receptacle, analogous to that found in Ferns; the clavate filaments would
                    then supply the place of a theca and annulus, while the minute granules would be
                    sporules. This view is probable, if we consider each globule with the filaments
                    as the result of a transformed frond.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Filices.—</hi> The organs of reproduction, commonly called
                    <hi rend="italic">tŉe fructification,</hi> of ferns, arise from veins either on
                    the under surface of the frond, or at its margin. In some genera the frond, or a
                    part of it, becomes deformed, and seems entirely covered by these organs. Each
                    cluster of organs is called a <hi rend="italic">sorus</hi> (fig. 148 and 149),
                    and is sometimes protected by a membrane termed an <hi rend="italic"
                    >involucre</hi> or <hi rend="italic">indusium</hi> (as in fig. 148), which is
                    always attached to the veins. This indusium is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >plane</hi> when it lies flat upon the sorus; or <hi rend="italic">peltate</hi>
                    when more or less circular, but depressed in its centre so as to form a kind of
                    small pillar in the middle of the sorus; or <hi rend="italic">reniform</hi> when
                    it is the half of a peltate involucre, and thus resembling a half circle,
                    attached by its centre on the one side of the sorus. It is <hi rend="italic"
                    >squamiform or scale-like when</hi> it has the appearance of the scales of the
                    frond. It may be <hi rend="italic">continuous</hi> when the involucra of several
                    sori are united into one uninterrupted line, and is <hi rend="italic"
                    >single</hi> or <hi rend="italic">double</hi> according as it extends from the
                    vein on one or on both sides of the sorus. Thus a peltate involucrum is double,
                    and consists of two reniform ones. An involucrum is usually <hi rend="italic"
                    >superior,</hi> but is sometimes <hi rend="italic">inferior,</hi> or placed
                    under the sorus, and surrounds it. It may either open outward <hi rend="italic"
                    >{exterius dehiscens)</hi> in an opposite direction to the midrib, or inwards
                    <hi rend="italic">(interius dehiscens)</hi> towards the midrib; and when it is
                    inferior, may burst from the apex into <hi rend="italic">lacinia</hi> or into
                    two <hi rend="italic">valves,</hi> or the upper part may disappear, leaving the
                    lower cup-shaped <hi rend="italic">(involucrum pateriforme).</hi> Sometimes the
                    part of the vein to which the reproductive organs are attached is projected from
                    the frond into the sorus, and is then called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >receptacle.</hi> The sori may be fixed to the middle of a vein, or at its
                    bifurcation, or at its extremity. They are <hi rend="italic">round,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">linear,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">reniform, distinct</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">confluent,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">continuous.</hi> They consist
                    of groups of <hi rend="italic">capsules;</hi> these, called more properly <hi
                    rend="italic">theca</hi> (fig. 149), are either pedicellate, with the stalk
                    passing round them in the form of an elastic ring or <hi rend="italic"
                    >annulus,</hi> or are sessile, and usually destitute of such a ring; the former
                    are called <hi rend="italic">annulata,</hi> the latter <hi rend="italic"
                    >exannu-latae.</hi> These thecae either burst open irregularly, or into two
                    valves, or on the opposite side from the ring (fig. 150) when it is present. The
                    sporules seem arranged without order in the interior. The sori may be considered
                    as a group of fronds, the stalk of the theca as a modified stipes, the annulus
                    as the midrib or rachis, and the theca itself as the transformed frondose
                    portion. This highly probable view was first, we believe, suggested by Mr
                    Lindley. Hedwig and others, who have wished to discover sexual organs among
                    ferns, have been much puzzled, each having a different opinion, though none
                    seems as yet worthy of notice.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Marsiliacea.—</hi> The fructification is situated at or very
                    near the root or rhizoma; in one plant along the petiole of the frond or leaf.
                    It consists of a somewhat globular <hi rend="italic">involucrum</hi> (fig. 151
                    and 152), of a leathery or membranous texture. This, unlike the ferns, does not
                    open, and is probably composed of a transformed frond, the veins of which give
                    rise to one or more partitions; hence the involucrum appears to have sometimes
                    several cells. Attached to the veins or partitions are small bodies, apparently
                    of two different kinds. Of these, in <hi rend="italic">Marsilea</hi> (fig. 152),
                    the one (fig. 153, <hi rend="italic">a)</hi> is an oval-stalked theca,
                    containing corpuscles, some large and roundish, others minute and angular. The
                    other kind are very small bags filled with minute granules, and attached (fig.
                    153, <hi rend="italic">b),</hi> several together, to the stalk of the theca. The
                    theca, by the sexualists, has been considered a pistillum, and the bags as
                    anthers. In <hi rend="italic">Pilularia</hi> the structure is much the same,
                    only the supposed anthers occupy the upper portion of the involucrum, and the
                    thecae the lower. In <hi rend="italic">Salvinia</hi> the anthers consist of
                    grains, attached by long threads to a central column; in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Azolla</hi> they are angular, and inserted upon a central body that occupies
                    the upper half of the involucre, while the lower half is filled with a turbid
                    fluid, and the thecae are placed within a different involucrum.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Lycopodiaceae.</hi> Here the organs of reproduction are
                    axillary or in spikes, and are composed of roundish <hi rend="italic"
                    >cap-</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193733778" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3778-0055"/><hi
                    rend="italic">suies</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ihecae,</hi> that are from one to
                    three celled, and one to three valved, or indehiscent; the thecae are usually of
                    two kinds, the one (fig. 154) containing a minute pulverulent matter (fig. 155,
                    and magnified, fig. 156), and placed towards the upper ends of the shoots; the
                    other (fig. 157) containing granules or corpuscles (fig. 157, a), of a much
                    larger size, and situated on the lower parts of the shoots. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Isoetes,</hi> where the leaves are all radical, the outer leaves contain in
                    their axils the granular, the inner the pulverulent organs. The pulverulent have
                    been called by some <hi rend="italic">anthers;</hi> the granular, <hi
                    rend="italic">pistilla.</hi> The latter certainly do germinate, but Willdenow
                    asserts that the former do so likewise. Gaertner also supposes both to contain
                    seeds or sporules, and that there is no difference of sex.</p>
                <p>5.∙ <hi rend="italic">Musci.</hi> Here the organs are likewise of two kinds; the
                    one, termed by Hedwig and many of his followers <hi rend="italic">anthers,</hi>
                    being cylindrical or fusiform stalked bags (fig. 158), that contain a
                    pulverulent matter mixed with others that are empty and jointed; the other, <hi
                    rend="italic">capsules</hi> or <hi rend="italic">theceε</hi> (fig. 159, 160,
                    161, Ì62). These latter, when young, are seated on a <hi rend="italic"
                    >receptacle,</hi> which, from its being occasionally provided at the base with
                    several small leaves, called a <hi rend="italic">perichcetium,</hi> may be
                    viewed as a deformed termination of the stem or branch. This theca is protected
                    by a more or less membranous substance, called a <hi rend="italic">calyptra</hi>
                    (fig. 160 <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> 163 5), loose from the theca, but attached
                    around its base to the receptacle (fig. 161 <hi rend="italic">a)</hi>; the
                    calyptra has by some been considered a <hi rend="italic">style.</hi> The capsule
                    or theca, at first green and small, soon begins to swell, and becomes attenuated
                    at the base (fig. 160 <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> 163 &lt;?), into a <hi
                    rend="italic">pedicel,</hi> called a <hi rend="italic">seta,</hi> which is often
                    of considerable length; but in two genera, <hi rend="italic">Sphagnum</hi> (fig.
                    168) and <hi rend="italic">Androea</hi> (fig. 161), is entirely wanting. By this
                    attenuation of the theca, and formation of a seta, and by the increasing
                    magnitude of the theca itself, the calyptra is torn from its attachment to the
                    receptacle, and may be soon perceived resting on the upper part of the theca
                    (fig. 160). When this in maturity is split up on the one side (fig. 160), it is
                    said to be <hi rend="italic">dimidiate,</hi> and if entire, or with several
                    short clefts (fig. 164), <hi rend="italic">mitriform;</hi> in some, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Splachnum</hi> and its affinities, it remains entire for a
                    considerable period, but afterwards splits and appears dimidiate, when it is
                    difficult to say under which it ought to be arranged; but, notwithstanding, the
                    nature of the calyptra is now acknowledged by all to be a good natural generic
                    distinction. The surface of the calyptra may be <hi rend="italic">smooth,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">striated,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sulcate
                    {furrowed),</hi> and may be <hi rend="italic">glabrous,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">clothed</hi> with hairs. In some polytricha there is in addition
                    an outer hairy calyptra, but this is formed of abortive leaves entangled
                    together, and scarcely attached to the inner and true one. Upon the removal or
                    fall of the calyptra, the theca presents itself, sometimes <hi rend="italic"
                    >globose,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ovate,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >oblong.</hi> In some it is <hi rend="italic">straight;</hi> in others, the one
                    side is longer than the other, so that the theca inclines to one side, and is
                    <hi rend="italic">drooping</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cernuous,</hi> which must
                    not be confounded with a <hi rend="italic">pendulous</hi> theca, caused by a
                    curvation of the extremity of the seta. In a cernuous theca, the shorter or
                    under side, instead of being uniformly contracted and smooth like the upper, has
                    sometimes the contraction at one point at its base, and the protuberance thus
                    caused is then called a <hi rend="italic">struma.</hi> In all but <hi
                    rend="italic">Androea,</hi> which has four valves (fig. 161), the theca is
                    entire. Between the seta and the theca is often a fleshy expansion called <hi
                    rend="italic">apophysis</hi> (fig. 159 <hi rend="italic">a),</hi> this always
                    containing, at least when young, a pulpy mass, but no sporules, and being a mere
                    dilatation of the top of the seta. The theca usually opens (fig. 162)
                    horizontally near its apex; the upper part is called an <hi rend="italic"
                    >operculum</hi> or lid (fig. 162 a): in some genera, however, this lid does( not
                    separate from the theca (fig. 161 <hi rend="italic">b),</hi> and does not even
                    show any indication of the suture. The operculum is of various shapes, but the
                    terms applied are common to other plants. “The <hi rend="italic">stoma,</hi> or
                    mouth of the theca, is either naked, as in <hi rend="italic">Gymnostomum</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Hedwigia</hi> (fig. 162); or generally furnished with a
                    series of cilia called <hi rend="italic">teeth (dentes),</hi> which may be
                    either in a single series, as in <hi rend="italic">Splachnum, Grimmia,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Dicranum</hi> (fig. 165); or in a compound or double series
                    (fig. 166), as in <hi rend="italic">Hooheria, Hypnum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eryum.</hi> In all mosses which possess a <hi rend="italic">peristomium,</hi>
                    it arises from the surface of the stoma, or springs from it within the margin
                    and a little below the summit of the theca. In the latter case the teeth are
                    generally more or less connected by a membrane, which not unfrequently rises to
                    a level with the stoma, or even above it. Sometimes all vestiges of the teeth
                    then disappear, thus presenting the aspect of a truly membranaceous peristome,
                    as is seen in <hi rend="italic">Hiphgscium</hi> (fig. 167) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lep-tostomum;</hi> and in such as have a double peristome of regular teeth, the
                    inner one is formed by this membrane, split into a fixed number of attenuated
                    segments. Sometimes, though rarely, the stoma is furnished with a dense
                    horizontal <hi rend="italic">epiphragma,</hi> not accompanied with teeth (as is
                    the case with the <hi rend="italic">epiphragma</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polytrichum),</hi> an instance of which occurs in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lycllia;</hi> or, what is still more curious, is supplied with a pencil of fine
                    capillary ciliae, as is exemplified in <hi rend="italic">Dawsoniay"</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Arn. and Grev. in <hi
                    rend="italic">Mem. Wem. Soc.</hi> vol. iv. p. 121.</p></note> The number of
                    teeth is always some multiple of four. Outside of the teeth, and between the
                    edge of the theca and the operculum, is to be observed in some plants an elastic
                    ring or <hi rend="italic">annulus</hi> (fig. 165 <hi rend="italic">a),</hi> the
                    presence or absence of which, however, does not appear to be of great
                    importance. “Within the theca (fig. 168 and 169), and attached to its sides and
                    base by a cellular pulp intermingled with very slender filaments, is placed a
                    membrane which forms a complete lining. Proceeding from the stoma or mouth
                    downwards, it is continued to the base, when it is reflected upwards, forming a
                    central column, till on a level with the mouth of the theca. This part has been
                    generally denominated a <hi rend="italic">columella</hi> (fig. 161, <hi
                    rend="italic">c),</hi> and is very different from the placenta in cotyledonous
                    plants, to which it has been sometimes compared. A bag is thus formed between
                    the columella, and that part of the same organ which lines the theca, in which
                    the sporulae are situated. The whole is closed by a very subtile membranous
                    expansion, stretching between the summit of the lining and the columella, which
                    (although in <hi rend="italic">Gymnostomum</hi> it is often of a stronger
                    texture), by the maturing of the theca, and separation of the operculum,
                    lacerates, and in most instances becomes evanescent. On the open apex of the
                    columella is fixed another membrane, more or less of a conical form, and of a
                    somewhat different texture and colour, which by age often shrinks to the
                    appearance of a mere lid to its orifice. Sometimes it is more rigid (as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Splachnum, Tayloria,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gymnostomum.
                    P)onianum),</hi> and is then not unfrequently called an exserted columella. It
                    also in some cases adheres closely to the summit of the interior of the
                    operculum (as in <hi rend="italic">Gymnostomum Heimii,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Hypnum dendroides),</hi> which it raises or depresses according to
                    the degree of dryness or humidity to which it is exposed. It is this part which
                    we conceive to be the stigma of Palisot de Beauvois, but which we propose to
                    designate by the more appropriate name of <hi rend="italic">opercular
                    membrane.’</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    agree; but he, in addition, supposes that the cellular substance of this dilated
                    apex separates in the form of sporulcs, an hypothesis started by Richard,<note

                    this, however, there are, we conceive, many grand objections. As to the supposed
                    anthers, whether the contained powder be imperfect pollen, or, as others say, a
                    second kind of sporules, too little is yet known to render them even of use for
                    the characters of genera. Meese asserts he saw them germinate like sporules; and
                    Dr Roth presumes them to be analogous to the gemmae, or buds of other plants
                    formed by a superabundance of juices.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Hepaticae.—</hi> The reproductive organs are here of several
                    kinds, but bear the strongest resemblance to those of the mosses. The theca is,
                    however, destitute of an operculum. In <hi rend="italic">Jungermannia</hi> (fig·
                    170) it splits into four longitudinal valves, and is supported by a delicate
                    membranous peduncle or <hi rend="italic">seta</hi> (a) arising from the frond;
                    the whole, when very young, is moreover protected by a delicate <hi
                    rend="italic">calyptra (b)</hi>; but this does not loosen its attachment to the
                    receptacle or portion of the frond, but splits at the apex to permit the
                    elongation of the seta. This calyptra is placed within another (fig. c) either
                    single or double cover, Jess delicate, and more of the texture of the frond,
                    which may be termed a <hi rend="italic">volva,but</hi> is generally, though very
                    improperly, called a <hi rend="italic">calyx;</hi> and this, which is of
                    different forms, however insufficient for a generic distinction, is admirably
                    suited for specific characters. When the theca bursts, the sporules are found to
                    be intermixed with elastic spiral filaments or <hi rend="italic">elateres</hi>
                    (fig. 170, cř). But besides the theca, minute spherical cellular bodies have
                    been discovered in many species; and these are supported by short stalks, and
                    have been by some termed <hi rend="italic">anthers. Monoclea</hi> (fig. 171)
                    bears a very great resemblance to jungermannia; the <hi rend="italic">volva</hi>
                    is however less distinct, but the <hi rend="italic">calyptra {corolla</hi> of
                    some) is considerably elongated («), and tubular. The theca is borne by a seta
                    (ó); it does not burst into four valves, but splits up on one side (c), and
                    presents a central filiform body (¢Z), called a columella, about which are the
                    sporules, mixed with <hi rend="italic">elateres</hi> (fig. 172). In <hi
                    rend="italic">Targionia,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">volva</hi> arises from the
                    under side of the frond, and of a texture between membranous and coriaceous,
                    marked by a vertical prominent line, by which it separates into two valves:
                    within this are several slender bodies, supposed by some to be anthers; and one
                    spherical, covered by a calyptra, which bursts vertically. Within this, again,
                    is the theca, upon so very short a stalk as not to be, when mature, protruded
                    beyond the volva. The theca appears to burst irregularly, has no columella, and
                    the sporules are mixed with elateres. In <hi rend="italic">Marchantia</hi> (fig.
                    173), the volva (here called usually a <hi rend="italic">common receptacle)</hi>
                    is peltate <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> and on a stalk; it is either flat or
                    conical, and bears on its under surface, not one calyptra, as in the other
                    genera we have noticed, but several, each of which (fig. 174, <hi rend="italic"
                    >a),</hi> bursting at its apex, that is, the point nearest the frond, discloses
                    a theca <hi rend="italic">(b),</hi> which opens by eight short teeth or valves,
                    united below, and contains sporules and elateres. Other peltate volvas or
                    receptacles, however, occur, having merely oblong bodies imbedded vertically in
                    the disk, and conjectured to be anthers; and besides these there are sometimes
                    little open cups, sessile on the upper surface of the frond, that contain minute
                    <hi rend="italic">gemmae. Eimbriaria</hi> differs so very slightly from <hi
                    rend="italic">Marchantia,</hi> that we may pass it over. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anthoce-ros</hi> (fig. 175) there appears to be no volva; the calyptra (often
                    called a <hi rend="italic">calyx)</hi> arises <hi rend="italic">{a)</hi> from
                    the frond, and is tubular; the theca, supported by a stalk or seta, is linear,
                    and splits <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> into two valves exhibiting a central
                    columella (c), to which the sporules are attached by means of very short
                    straight filaments (fig. 176). There arc no elateres. The structure of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sphoerocarpus</hi> is involved in some doubt. We have never had
                    the opportunity of analysing good specimens, but the following seems, from a
                    comparison of the different results of other botanists, to approach nearly to
                    the truth. The whole upper surface of the frond is covered with ellipsoidal
                    volvas (called in this genus <hi rend="italic">follicles</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">calyces).</hi> These are truncated and perforated at the apex;
                    they are said by some to split into two valves, but this arises from such
                    botanists having only looked at Micheli’s figure, in which they are represented
                    cut open by the knife. The volva contains at the bottom a very few linear
                    bodies, the supposed anthers, and one other, the theca, which becomes swollen
                    and spherical, and filled with sporules, destitute of elateres, according to
                    Micheli, though others of less note state that they are present; the calyptra,
                    if present, is closely attached to the theca, and only indicated by a small
                    point at its extremity. <hi rend="italic">Piccia</hi> (fig. 177) has small
                    excavations in the frond (fig. 178), in which the volva, often scarcely
                    perceptible, rests, containing the theca and calyptra, similar to that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sphoerocarpus:</hi> the sporules are unmixed with elateres. There
                    is thus among the <hi rend="italic">Hepaticae</hi> such a variety among the
                    organs of reproduction, that no common character is almost to be derived. “The
                    most remarkable point of structure in these plants is the spiral filament, as it
                    is called, lying among the sporules within the theca. This consists of a single
                    fibre, or of two, twisted spirally in opposite directions, so as to cross each
                    other, and contained within a very delicate transparent perishable tube. They
                    have a strong elastic force, and have been supposed to be destined to aid in the
                    dispersion of the sporules; a most inadequate end for so curious and unusual an
                    apparatus.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lmdl. <hi
                    rend="italic">Introd. Nat. Syst.</hi> p. 325.</p></note></p>
                <p>7. In the <hi rend="italic">Algoe,</hi> the sporules, sometimes named granules,
                    are variously situated. In some they are contained in distinct capsules or <hi
                    rend="italic">thecae</hi> (fig. 179); in others, in what are termed <hi
                    rend="italic">tubercles</hi> or <hi rend="italic">conceptacula</hi> (fig. 180),
                    which are either free or imbedded in the frond, or in a leafy process arising
                    from it; or a multitude of these may be collected close together, into what is
                    then called a <hi rend="italic">common receptacle</hi> (fig. 181); and these
                    receptacles in some assume the form of a pod (siZigwa). The sporules or <hi
                    rend="italic">granules</hi> are also often naked, and immersed in the frond
                    (fig. 182); or very rarely external, and surrounded by an open involucre (fig.
                    183). Sporules with and without a covering (theca or tubercle) frequently exist
                    in the same species, but usually in different individuals. Some genera are
                    tubular, and have the sporular matter scattered or arranged in some determinate
                    manner in their interior (fig. 184); others are gelatinous (fig. 185), either
                    wholly or portions of them, containing naked sporules, which are sometimes mixed
                    with pellucid filaments, and sometimes arranged so as to form moniliform or
                    beaded threads (fig. 186). We, along with Agardh, unite to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Algoe</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Cha-raceae</hi> of authors; and in these there
                    are two kinds of organs (fig. 1S7). The one (fig. 188) is a <hi rend="italic"
                    >nucule, capsule,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">theca,</hi> sessile, oval, solitary,
                    and unilocular, of two membranes, of which the outer is remarkably thin and
                    transparent, and is terminated by five teeth. The inner one is opaque, and of a
                    thicker texture, and is formed of five narrow valves twisted spirally; the
                    interior is filled with minute granules, but whether these be distinct
                    sporules,, or only parts of one large disintegrated sporule, is not yet
                    determined; but each nucleus, on germinating, has been observed to give <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193733804" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3804-0057"/> rise to only one
                    plant. The second kind of organs has been termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >globules.</hi> Of these the external tunic is very pellucid and indehiscent;
                    the inner seems formed of thin triangular scales, composed of radiating tubes,
                    inclosing a coloured, spherical, pulverulent matter, and the interior of the
                    globule is filled with a multitude of long, simple, crowded filaments, that are
                    diaphonous, and marked with transverse striae, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oscillatoria</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lyngbya.</hi> These filaments appear to
                    be attached to the central portion of the inside of each scale. Smith has
                    arranged <hi rend="italic">Chara</hi> in monandria monogynia, conceiving the
                    globule to be an anther, and the tubercle a germen, and the five teeth a
                    five-lobed stigma; but the filaments of the supposed anther show the absurdity
                    of such an hypothesis. Walroth asserts that the globules germinate.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Lichens.—</hi> The organs of reproduction (see fig. 189 and
                    190) arc chiefly of one kind, termed <hi rend="italic">apothecia</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">shields,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">partial receptacles.</hi> These
                    arc formed by nuclei of the medullary substance usually bursting through the
                    cortical portion, which is often raised up, and forms a cup or border round the
                    nucleus; the <hi rend="italic">sporules</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gongyl(e</hi>
                    are contained in thecae or small membranous tubes, either simple, or composed of
                    several placed end to end: these thecae in some lie free in the nucleus, but in
                    others are previously collected into other cases, termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >asci.</hi> The portion of the nucleus in which the thecae are inserted, by
                    exposure to the air becomes usually harder, and of ä somewhat cartilaginous
                    nature, and then often separates from the apothecia. It is called <hi
                    rend="italic">nucleus proligerus</hi> if the whole of the nucleus becomes so,
                    but <hi rend="italic">lamina proligera</hi> (fig., 191) is applied when only the
                    upper stratum contains the thecae. The apothecia are either sessile on the
                    thallus, or connected with it by a narrow neck or stalk called <hi rend="italic"
                    >podetizιm.</hi> The podetia are in some species cupshaped at the apex, and,
                    instead of one, bear several apothecia on the margin. This cup is then termed a
                    <hi rend="italic">scypha,</hi> and the lichens <hi rend="italic"
                    >scyphiĵerozrs</hi> (fig. 192). When the apothecia are long and linear, they are
                    by some called <hi rend="italic">lirelloe;</hi> and even a round apothecium may
                    be formed by the plaiting or convolution of a lirclla. In a few genera the <hi
                    rend="italic">nu∙ cleus proligerus</hi> is not protruded beyond the thallus, but
                    is contained within it, merely presenting a small opening or <hi rend="italic"
                    >ostiole</hi> (fig. 193, 194). Independent of the apothecium, there are other
                    parts which appear to have the power of reproduction. These are called <hi
                    rend="italic">soredia</hi> when they contain a mass of free pulverulent bodies,
                    usually of a whitish colour, that are scattered over various portions of the
                    thallus; and <hi rend="italic">pulvinuli</hi> when they resemble spongy or
                    amorphous excrescences.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Fungi.—</hi> This tribe borders on the lichens so very
                    closely, as tha't part of both have been separated into a distinct order called
                    <hi rend="italic">Hypoxyla,</hi> for which, however, there does not seem to be
                    any necessity. Indeed Agardh remarks of many fungi, that if they had a thallus,
                    they would be lichens. We have already said of them, that the whole plant may be
                    considered as a mass of reproductive matter; and we shall therefore give as
                    short a sketch of them as possible; but, on account of their diversity of
                    structure, we shall be obliged to take them by groups. Brongniart regards the
                    fungi as a class, and divides them into orders; but we are rather inclined to
                    view them as one order, and w&gt;ll take Brongniart’s sections, with a slight
                    change of names, as sub-orders.</p>
                <p>1. The first of these, and most nearly related to the lichens, are the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hypoxula.</hi> Here the sporules are immersed m a hard and
                    ligneous <hi rend="italic">receptaclc</hi> or <hi rend="italic">peridium,</hi>
                    which opens more or less regularly. Of these there are three tribes. 1. In the
                    Spliaeriaceae (fig. 195) there is a terminal pore or cleft, by which the thecae
                    escape in the form of a mucilage (fig. 196): 2. In Phacidiaceae (fig. 197 and
                    198) there are several clefts or valves, and the thecae remain fixed: 3. In
                    Cytisporeae their orifice is round, but the sporulcs appear naked, and to have
                    no thecae.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Agaricodeoe.</hi> Here the whole plant is somewhat fleshy or
                    corky, and called a receptacle. ∙ It is partly covered by a membrane that bears
                    the sporules, which are rarely naked, and scattered on it, but usually inclosed
                    in membranous thecae, and inserted in it. There arc three distinct tribes. 1.
                    The Agaracineae (fig. 199) have the membrane distinct, and limited to a
                    particular part of the plant, with the sporules almost always inclosed in
                    thecae, a sub-tribc of which, Clavaricae, has straight, club-shaped, simple, or
                    branched receptacles, with the membrane covering nearly the whole; another, the
                    Agari-ceae, have a <hi rend="italic">pileus,</hi> the lower surface of which
                    contains the sporuliferous membrane constituting <hi rend="italic">lamelloe</hi>
                    or gills in <hi rend="italic">Agaricus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tubes</hi> in
                    <hi rend="italic">Boletus;</hi> and the Helvellaceae have a pileus, with the
                    membrane on its upper surface. 2. The Tremellineae are soft and gelatinous, and
                    of an irregular shape; they have no thecae, and the sporules are either
                    scattered on the surface of the membrane, or issue from below it. 3. In the
                    Clethrineae (fig. 200) the sporules are mixed with a mucilaginous substance (the
                    sporuliferous membrane), either inclosed in the cells, or on the surface of the
                    plant which arises from a volva.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Lgcoperdace(e.</hi> Here the naked sporules, at least when
                    young, are inclosed in firm, or vesicular, or filamentous thecae, that arc again
                    included in the interior of a peridium of a fleshy or membranous nature. 1.
                    Sclcrotincae (fig. 201 and 202). This tribe has the peridium indehiscent, and
                    filled with a compact cellular substance or agglutinated thecae, in which arc
                    the sporules very indistinct. 2. Angiogastri (fig. 203 and 204). Here the
                    peridium, which opens sometimes by means of an operculum, incloses one or more
                    secondary peridia or peridiola (or thecae, but by no means of a membranous
                    nature, as in many other fungi) filled with sporules. 3. Lycoperdi-ncae (fig.
                    205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211), where the peridium is usually pedicellated
                    and of a determinate shape, opening regularly, and inclosing the sporules, which
                    soon burst from the thecae, having the appearance of numerous filaments mixed
                    with the sporules. 4. Fuligineae (fig. 212, 213), in which the peridium is
                    sessile, irregular, readily decaying or crumbling into dust. The thecae are
                    filamentous, few in number, and, as in the last, soon losing their sporules,
                    which appear mixed with them.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Mucedines.</hi> In these there is no peridium, while the
                    sporules are naked, and supported by filaments more or less branched and
                    interwoven, in which it is probable they had been at some period contained in
                    all the species. There are five tribes. 1. Isaricae (fig. 214 and 215), where
                    the filaments are united one with another in a regular and constant manner, and
                    have the sporules scattered on their surface. 2. Byssaceae (fig. 216, 217, 218),
                    where the filaments are distinct, though often entangled, opaque, without
                    joints, and exhibiting the sporules on their exterior; or jointed, the joints
                    breaking off and forming thecae containing sporules. In some genera of this
                    tribe no sporules have been yet discovered, which has induced some distinguished
                    botanists to suspect several of them to be imperfect states of other plants. 3.
                    Mucedineae (fig. 219, 220, 221). Here the filaments are distinct or loosely
                    entangled, transparent, fugacious, and often articulated; and the sporules are
                    included in the ultimate joints of the filaments, or in small lateral branches,
                    which afterwards separate, or even in the interior of the filaments, without
                    joints, from which they quickly escape, and appear scattered on their surface.
                    4. Mucorineae (Plate CXVI. fig. 222, 223). The filaments here are transparent,
                    jointed, fugacious, and inflated at their extremity into a membranous<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193733817" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3817-0058"/> vesicle,
                    inclosing the sporules. 5. Phyllerineae (224). Here the filaments are simple,
                    without joints, and contain sporules which do not readily escape; they form
                    tufts on the surface of living leaves, and not dead ones, as in most fungi.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Uredaceae.</hi> In these the thecae or sporidia are formed
                    of short, continuous, or articulated filaments, which are either free, or
                    supported on a very short and simple stalk, thus scarcely exhibiting the least
                    trace of the filaments observable in the last sub-order. These sporidia spring
                    from under the epidermis or its surface, of either living or dead plants, and
                    are frequently surrounded by a false peridium, formed by the development of the
                    epidermis, or supported on a fleshy or fibrous base, produced by the thickening
                    of the parenchyma of the plant, upon which it is a parasite. There are four
                    tribes. 1. Stilbosporineae (fig. 225), where the sporidia are articulated, and
                    arise from dead plants. 2. Bactrideae. Here the sporidia are simple or
                    unilocular, opaque, fixed or scattered, inclosing numerous extremely slender
                    sporules, which escape towards maturity. This tribe, however, is scarcely either
                    well understood or defined, and perhaps belongs to some other suborder. 3.
                    Fusideae (fig. 226, 227), in which the sporidia are not jointed, arc
                    indehiscent, and spring from the epidermis of dead vegetables. 4. Uredineae
                    (fig. 228), where the sporidia are developed under the surface of the epidermis
                    of living plants.</p>
                <p>We have not given the above as a defined arrangement of fungi, but with the view
                    of exhibiting the structure of each of the tribes into which it seems advisable,
                    with some slight alterations, that this extensive order be divided. Much
                    difficulty is often created to the student of these plants, by the diversity of
                    terms to apparently the same thing. Thus, sporidia and taccae each mean sporule
                    cases; and, on the other hand, sporidia and sporules seem confounded. Hence in
                    one tribe it is said, “though they are called sporidia, it rarely happens that
                    the microscope is able to detect the included sporules; the student therefore
                    must expect the sporidia to appear without sporules.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Grev. <hi rend="italic">Flor. Ed.</hi> p.
                    xxv.</p></note> But we ourselves are by no means sure that in any instance do
                    the sporules exist without taccae. They may be at one time included in
                    filaments, which serve them for thecae, and must be viewed as filamentous thecae
                    more or less united to each other end to end; or they may be contained in the
                    cells of the plant, the cellules thus being taccae; or the taccae may be so
                    collected as to form a membrane ;—but we do not conceive the apparently naked
                    sporules of some species to be any proof of the original absence in them of
                    sporule cases. In this way we think, also, the whole order may be considered in
                    two ways, either as elementary or as compound bodies; the former including such
                    as have no receptacle, and the whole plant constituted of filamentous thecae;
                    and the latter with a receptacle, in which light the peridium of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hypoxyla</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lycoperdaceae</hi> must be
                    regarded. In studying the epiphyllous tribes with the intention of describing
                    them, much attention ought to be paid, although almost entirely hitherto
                    neglected, to the structure of the vegetable upon which the parasite grows; for
                    colours, of great importance in discriminating the larger fungi, may be much
                    influenced by the action of the juices of the plant on which it is formed, and
                    can be here of little use; and even the shape of the peridium, and sorus or
                    cluster of plants, must depend on the texture of the leaf from under the
                    epidermis of which it springs, and through which it bursts. Parasitical fungi
                    may thus, by growing on different plants, assume very different aspects both in
                    colour and form; and one cannot too much reprobate the manner in which at
                    present many eminent mycologists describe as distinct species every different
                    appearance that presents itself, withoutpreviously making themselves masters of
                    the numerous laws by which cryptogamie plants are caused to vary.</p>
                <p>We thus close what we had to say on Glossology. We have been more particular than
                    we at first intended, in this department of botany; but it was absolutely
                    necessary to give a lengthened view of the formation of the different parts, as
                    well as the names applied respectively to each. For the Linnaean or artificial
                    system such was not requisite; but the great difficulty as well as beauty of the
                    natural system is to view plants analogically,—to consider them, not in their
                    modified, but in their primitive state,—not in the imperfect state in which they
                    appear to our eyes, but in that in which we should see them if fully developed;
                    thus enabling us to exert our minds, and to trace affinities, of which the mere
                    practical botanist can have no conception.</p>
                <p>Ĳ._PHYTOGRAPHY.</p>
                <p>Under the head of Phytography, the first thing we have to notice is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nomenclature.</hi></p>
                <p>The necessity of some universally received name to each plant, and of some laws
                    on the subject, has been acknowledged by every one who has made botany a study.
                    Without such, every country would give a peculiar name, and the pursuit would
                    thus become extremely intricate. This alone gives zoology and botany great
                    advantages over mineralogy, in which not only is there no classification of
                    genera and species according to the Linnaean rules, but every species receives a
                    name according to the fancy of the describer, whether or not it has already
                    received one from others.</p>
                <p>To obviate such inconveniences, it was at first in use to give to a plant the
                    common name by which it was known in Greece and Italy; but as the knowledge of
                    vegetables extended, this was found to be almost impracticable, both because new
                    plants unknown to the ancients were discovered, and because, from the prodigious
                    number, no person could recollect them all. When, therefore, some resemblance
                    between each other was observed, botanists began to say that one was a <hi
                    rend="italic">second genus</hi> or kind of such a plant, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >kali alterum genus,</hi> or that it was a <hi rend="italic">smaller,</hi> or a
                    <hi rend="italic">yellow flowered</hi> kind, as circumstances might be; and as
                    the number of species augmented, these distinguishing phrases were of necessity
                    made longer, so that, as we find sometimes in Plukenet, a name might consist of
                    twenty words. The inability of the memory to recollect them struck Linnaeus
                    forcibly, till at length he proposed that the name of every plant should consist
                    of two words; the one analogous to the name of a family among mankind, the other
                    to the baptismal name of an individual; the former he called the generic, the
                    last the specific. This ingenious method has bccn termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Linnaean nomenclature,</hi> and has bccn admitted by almost all botanists ever
                    since it was first published in 1753. By it, not only is the memory aided, and
                    enabled to retain the names of many thousands of plants; but, by the same
                    generic name being applied to such as have a certain affinity with each other,
                    that name must suggest to the mind a relationship of which we could not
                    otherwise have an idea. Two inconveniences, nodoubt, attend this method; first,
                    it holds out, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733830" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3830-0059"/>
                    from its simplicity, a temptation to a young botanist to acquire merely the
                    names of plants, without knowing any thing of their character; secondly, from
                    every botanist not viewing the affinity of a plant in the same way, it often
                    happens that the same individual has been placed in different genera, and
                    consequently may have possibly received four or five different generic names.
                    Various plans have been proposed to remove these difficulties; but they have
                    been each, one after another, abandoned.</p>
                <p>With regard to what is a species or genus, an order or a class, perhaps no two
                    botanists of the present day are at one; and our limits do not permit us to
                    investigate this point with the attention that some may think it merits. All
                    that nature presents to our eyes consists of <hi rend="italic">individuals;</hi>
                    but when we assert that one individual is the same, or so similar to another
                    that we think them the same, we give way to our own thoughts, for others may
                    form a different opinion. At the same time many resemblances are so striking as
                    to be obvious to almost all; and when these are confirmed by their seed
                    producing others bearing the same resemblance, we have the idea of what is
                    termed a species. A <hi rend="italic">species,</hi> therefore, is a collection
                    of all those individuals which have a greater resemblance between themselves
                    than to other plants, and which may by fecundation, one by another, produce
                    fertile individuals, which in their turn reproduce others; and by reversing this
                    procedure, we may infer that all these have arisen at one time from one
                    individual. <hi rend="italic">Varieties,</hi> again, are departures from the
                    common appearance of the species, and may arise from the seed growing in
                    different climates, subjected to greater or less humidity or heat; or various
                    other causes may be assigned, some of which seem even to produce a permanent
                    effect on the plant, so that after several generations scarcely one seed will
                    reproduce the type of the species. Some botanists most unadvisedly have amused
                    themselves of late years by raising these to the rank of species; but “this
                    eternal splitting of hairs is the bane of natural history, is unworthy of
                    science, and its advocates will one day have to lament that they stood sponsors
                    to such a spurious and equivocal offspring. One tithe of the sagacity they
                    discover in the infinitesimal division of species, directed to other points,
                    would pile up a mountain of knowledge for future use, and immortalize their own
                    names, which, under this present puerile system, will perish with the ephemeral
                    names they are imposing upon undistinguishable things.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>For long it was considered that a <hi rend="italic">hybrid,</hi> or cross between
                    two species, could not reproduce a plant, or rather, we ought to say, perfect a
                    seed capable of vegetation; and this test was considered of importance as to the
                    limit of species. But it is now supposed to be of little or no use; the hybrid
                    Pelargoniums, or cape-geraniums, perfecting seed, and multiplying as easily as
                    the parent plants. These plants ought never to be acknowledged by botanical
                    writers. They are contrary to nature, and ought not to be received into any
                    system of nature. They are only fit to amuse the eye and taste of the vulgar and
                    uninitiated. And even if a florist wishes to gain any credit, it were well that
                    he sedulously observed from what the hybrid was obtained; and instead of giving
                    to it an absurd name, as is too often the case, or even a name as if it were a
                    species, he ought to give one that is compounded of those of the two parents.
                    Linnaeus, however, laid it down as a maxim, that no hybrid produced perfect
                    seed; and he supported this by many proofs. Those naturalists, therefore, who
                    still adhere to this law, are forced to draw the conclusion, that the supposed
                    hybrid Pelargoniums and heaths are mere cross variations of varieties of one
                    species; but whichever be the true theory (and we ourselves, if our
                    physiological ideas on the subject be correct, can sec no cause why a perfecting
                    hybrid may not be formed between any two plants which have the same anatomical
                    structure of anthers and pistilla), whether these be hybrids or variations, no
                    one has any right to expect space to be occupied by them in a botanical
                    treatise. In so far only as they tend to improve our knowledge of anatomy and
                    physiology, the man of science has to do with them.</p>
                <p>Having formed some conception of a species, we may define a <hi rend="italic"
                    >genus</hi> to be a collection of those species which have among themselves a
                    more striking resemblance in their organs, than they have to the organs of
                    others; it therefore bears the same relation towards species as a species does
                    towards individuals. But as it is impossible for all the species of a genus to
                    agree in every organ, so a selection must be made from those that may be
                    considered of more importance than others. But no certain rule can be laid down,
                    farther than that the organs of reproduction being found least liable to
                    variation, are those alone admitted into a generic character. In some genera the
                    stamens, in others the petals, calyx, pistilla, or the fruit, are found to be
                    most convenient for the character; but upon the relative value of these, even in
                    the same genus, different opinions are frequently entertained. A genus may
                    therefore be limited by one in a different way from that adopted by another; and
                    hence we cannot be surprised to find that one botanist places a species in one
                    genus, others in another, according as each thinks it suits best with the
                    collective character. A genus may be also divided into sections, according to
                    some difference of structure in its organs; so that when this difference has
                    been thought of importance, other botanists have raised each of the sections to
                    be a new genus. Thus every day we find that plants, though still retaining their
                    specific names,being married, as it were, into another house, receive new
                    generic appellations. Such is no doubt of great disadvantage to the science, but
                    is unavoidable, from the increasing number of known plants. Nor does it appear
                    that the number of genera is increased in proportion to the discovery of new
                    species. Thus Linnaeus, by distributing 7540 species in 1260 genera, ranked on
                    an average only six to each; but, notwithstanding the modern subdivisions in the
                    catalogue of Persoon in 1807, there are about ten to each, and this only
                    contains the phanerogamous vegetables; and in Steudel’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nomenclator Eotanicus,</hi> published in 1821-24, there are of the
                    phanerogamous 3376 genera, and 39,684 species, or about eleven to each; and if
                    we add to these 557 genera, and 10,965 species of cryptogamia, we shall have an
                    average of upwards of thirteen to each genus.</p>
                <p>What has been said of genera is applicable to natural families or <hi
                    rend="italic">orders,</hi> these containing such genera as have a great
                    resemblance to each other, and are either so closely connected that they cannot
                    be removed, or are separated into groups only for the greater convenience of
                    study. When, however, two or more of these orders bear a closer affinity
                    respectively to each other than to the others to which they are also allied, it
                    has been found useful to term them tribes of one order; but it is then difficult
                    to distinguish between a compound order of this kind and a class. The number of
                    genera in each order is of no importance. There may be hundreds, and there may
                    be but one, solitary but forming a connection between other orders. In general,
                    however, from the consideration that nature forms one continuous chain, we may
                    expect<pb break="no" facs="nls:193733843" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3843-0060"/> that
                    links remain to be discovered between such isolated genera and the others; and
                    indeed, if the whole of nature were laid open to us, we might infer,
                    notwithstanding all our present labours, that the machinery of orders and genera
                    will be found entirely artificial, and existing only in our own conceptions. Not
                    that it is of no value; for it is of the greatest use, to enable us to bring
                    together in our mind plants resembling each other; and therefore that system
                    must be preferred which tends most to this end.</p>
                <p>When several natural orders are collected together, having many similarities of
                    structure and appearance, they form what are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >classes.</hi> But very little has hitherto been done as to giving us a
                    knowledge of these. The <hi rend="italic">Geraniaceae</hi> (as defined by S.
                    Hilaire), <hi rend="italic">Butaceae</hi> (as collected by Ad. Jussieu), <hi
                    rend="italic">Tiliaceae,</hi> and some others, may be adduced as examples. But
                    in botanical systems, where the order must be placed in a linear series, and
                    cannot be described, each at their several points of connection, classes, unless
                    in one or two instances, have been diregarded, and merely the constituent orders
                    themselves introduced.</p>
                <p>As it is essential to natural history that the nomenclature be universal, so it
                    is indispensable that the names be written in some language adopted by all
                    nations. The Greek has been rejected for many reasons, but particularly that the
                    letters are so very different from those now used in the civilized world. To the
                    Latin there are no objections; on the contrary, until within these very few
                    years, it was the general language among scientific and learned men. The names,
                    therefore, as well as the terms of the science of botany, are written in that
                    language; and when such names and terms are translated to give them a more
                    modern appearance, it appears advisable to adhere as much as possible to the
                    Latin words by giving them an English termination. This however is often, but
                    improperly, departed from. In framing names there is a maxim that is deservedly
                    recognized, that they ought to be according to the rules of general grammar.
                    Thus, if the name denotes a property, as thorny-fruited, it is not permitted to
                    derive half of it from the Greek, while the other is Latin; <hi rend="italic"
                    >aculeatocarpa</hi> cannot therefore be retained, but may be changed into <hi
                    rend="italic">acanthocarpa.</hi></p>
                <p>Priority of names must be strictly attended to, or, if names be changed, this
                    must not be done in an arbitrary manner, and without good reasons. But while all
                    agree to this, a difficulty is sometimes started as to what ought to give
                    priority. And here we ought to observe that no manuscript one need be adopted.
                    Farther, no mere name, though published, is of any consequence, unless
                    accompanied by a sufficient character by which the plant may be recognized by
                    others. Names, therefore, in a gardener’s catalogue, are of no more importance
                    than manuscript names, although, when made known to botanists by a distribution
                    of specimens, politeness sometimes admits them; but the mere circulation of
                    living plants among horticulturists and florists, not botanists, is not even
                    entitled to this courtesy. Printed names, accompanying collections of dried
                    plants, are always adopted by those who receive them; but it seems doubtful how
                    far such might claim priority, if they were to be first described by others who
                    had not an opportunity of seeing them. It haá been argued that plates, without
                    written characters, whether of genera or species, are sufficient to give a
                    priority of name. But this cannot be admitted by the rules of common sense. In
                    those few cases in which the figures of the plant are accompanied with admirably
                    exact and minute dissections, this is sometimes permitted; but it even then
                    appears questionable, plates not being intended to characterize a species, but
                    as auxiliaries to the character. A character may be sufficient without a plate,
                    but a plate is of no use without a character.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Generic</hi> names, giving the idea of a group, have been ∣ by
                    all permitted to stand first, and then the specific name. <hi rend="superscript"
                    > 1</hi> For the same reason they ought to be substantives; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mirabilis, Gloriosa,</hi> and some others, being adjectives, may therefore be
                    changed. No name ought to be allowed that gives a false idea of the character of
                    the genus; but, on the other hand, such names are always to be preferred as
                    express this character in a precise way; and as it is extremely difficult to
                    express the whole character, the most remarkable points ought to be chosen as
                    contrasted with other allied genera; care being taken that they apply to all the
                    species of the genus. No generic name ought to be derived from the names of
                    places; a few such, however, though faulty, have been admitted. Metaphorical
                    names, derived from ancient history and mythology, have been sometimes bestowed
                    on plants; but great care must then be taken that the allusioń is perfect.
                    Linnaeus has succeeded very happily in one or two instances, particularly in
                    that of Andromeda, his reasons for so naming which we shall give in the author’s
                    own words, from the <hi rend="italic">Flora Lapponica.</hi> Comparing her with
                    the plant in question, he says, “virgo haec lectissima pulcherrimaque collo
                    superbit alto et vividissimo <hi rend="italic">(pedunculus),</hi> cujus facies
                    roseis suis labellis <hi rend="italic">(corolla)</hi> vel optimum veneris fucum

                <p>The ancients were in the habit of giving plants the names of persons, and this
                    custom has been retained; but care must be taken to select those celebrated in
                    the science, or as having paid great attention to some branch of it. Thus their
                    names will be engraved on our memory so long as the plants are known; and this
                    honour has been therefore considered as one of the greatest that can be
                    conferred on a naturalist. But this is liable to abuse, particularly when
                    princes and others of rank are concerned; plants being often named after
                    persons, who never in any way contributed to the advance of the study. To one
                    person no more than one genus must be dedicated, however great be their
                    services, for if this were to be allowed confusion would soon prevail; thus <hi
                    rend="italic">Lessertia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Deles-seria</hi> cannot both
                    remain. As a similarity of sound between two generic names is attended with bad
                    effects, so it ought not to be tolerated, even in the case where we wish to
                    honour a friend. Thus <hi rend="italic">Belis</hi> cannot be suffered, there
                    being a <hi rend="italic">Bellis;</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">Cryphoea,</hi> on
                    account of a previous <hi rend="italic">Cryphia;</hi> so neither can <hi
                    rend="italic">Esclischoltzia,</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">Koniga,</hi> there
                    being already an <hi rend="italic">Elsholtzia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Koenigia.</hi> When a person has different names, that must be preferred which
                    is best known; but when such is pre-occupied, another may be selected. Great
                    care ought to be taken to preserve rigidly the spelling of names, whatever be
                    the pronunciation. Thus <hi rend="italic">Czackia</hi> ought not to be written
                    <hi rend="italic">Tschatshia,</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">Grahamia, Grcemia;</hi>
                    nor even is <hi rend="italic">Brunonia</hi> strictly admissible, although this
                    alteration was made because there <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733856"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-3856-0061"/> was another Browne, to whom was dedicated the
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Brownea.</hi> Though by following this rule names be
                    often given not entirely according with the genius of the Latin tongue; yet the
                    end being to perpetuate a particular individual, if the proper orthography were
                    not kept up, a pretext would soon be given for changing the name.</p>
                <p>When it is found necessary to divide a genus into two or more, the old name ought
                    to be retained for the group which includes the greater number of species, or to
                    that for which the genus was originally constituted. The last is preferable, but
                    <hi rend="italic">Erica</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ixia</hi> both form
                    exceptions, on account of the great inconvenience of changing the names of so
                    many, when only one would remain unaltered.</p>
                <p>As to generic names derived from the vernacular appellations of plants, botanists
                    are not yet agreed. Linnaeus, and others after him, wish to refuse all such,
                    although they admit that they may be employed specifically: yet having laid down
                    the rule, the genera <hi rend="italic">Thea·, Coffea, Ginrho,</hi> &amp;c. are
                    almost universally admitted by them; and therefore, in the present day, these
                    and similar ones are generally adopted if their sound be not too barbarous.
                    Sehrc-ber, following the maxims of Linnaeus, altered nearly all Aublet’s names
                    for the Guiana plants, which De Candolle and others now restore. However little
                    desirable it may be to give these names, yet when once given and recognized, it
                    can serve no good purpose, but lead to confusion, to change them.</p>
                <p>The older botanists were in the practice of marking allied genera by analogous
                    names, but with a change of termination; thus <hi rend="italic">Valeriana,
                    Valerianella; Limonium, Li-moniastrum; Bellis, Bellidoides:</hi> all so similar
                    were rejected by Linnaeus, who allowed of comparative terms among species alone.
                    As to the termination <hi rend="italic">oides,</hi> it ought undoubtedly to be
                    laid aside, being an adjective; but the same reason does not apply with equal
                    force to the two other instances; and although we would prefer not to employ
                    them in framing a name, we would hesitate about making a change if already given
                    by others. An anagram, or transposition of the letters of an existing name, is
                    quite contemptible and undignified, and can on no account be permitted. Hence
                    <hi rend="italic">Galphimia,</hi> made by Cavanilles, and derived from <hi
                    rend="italic">Malpighia,</hi> is quite unsuitable: in the same way Cassini has
                    amused himself, to the detriment of the science, by splitting <hi rend="italic"
                    >Filago</hi> into as many genera as he could form anagrams of that word, <hi
                    rend="italic">Filago, Gifola, īfloga, Logfia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oftiga,</hi> than which nothing can be more absurd.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Specific</hi> names are less difficult to establish than the
                    generic, because they are meant to apply to an individual, and not collectively;
                    and the chief consideration is not to give one already applied in the genus, or
                    one that has no relation to the plant itself. Almost no change ought therefore
                    to be tolerated, unless when one of these rules be broken through. Thus <hi
                    rend="italic">Astragalus Monopessulanus,</hi> though found not at Montpellier
                    alone, but throughout all the south of Europe, and even in the western parts of
                    Asia, cannot be altered, because it is actually found at Montpellier; and the
                    name even tends to record the fact of its having been first observed there. But
                    <hi rend="italic">Potentilla Monspeliaca</hi> is a manifest absurdity, being a
                    native of North America, and merits a change; thus also <hi rend="italic">Scilla
                    Peruviana</hi> is inadmissible, being a native of Portugal. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lunaria annua</hi> may also in the same way be changed to <hi rend="italic">L.
                    biennis,</hi> the plant being not annual, but biennial. There are some
                    botanists, however, who even dislike a change for these reasons; contending,
                    that while in the human race the name George, or <hi rend="italic">Τιωξγος,</hi>
                    is not applied only to one who is a husbandman, so neither among plants ought we
                    to care what be the name, provided it suffice to distinguish the species; but
                    this is inept, for the above is not a specific name, nor even that of a variety
                    or variation» but the appellative of an individual.</p>
                <p>In general the names derived from countries ought to be given with great
                    circumspection; and from want of due consideration on that point, we have
                    accordingly many absurdities. Thus <hi rend="italic">Linum Gallicum</hi> is
                    actually found in all the four quarters of the globe. <hi rend="italic">Ajuga
                    Genevensis, Circoea Lutetiana,</hi> are not found at Geneva or at Paris alone,
                    but throughout the rest of Europe; still they cannot be now altered. <hi
                    rend="italic">Agave Americana</hi> is not the only <hi rend="italic">Agave</hi>
                    found wild in America, for many inhabit also that country. Names taken from
                    stations of plants, as <hi rend="italic">maritimum</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >palustre,</hi> arc frequently good; but such as <hi rend="italic">campestre,
                    alpestre,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">montanum,</hi> being very indefinite, ought
                    to be avoided as much as possible.</p>
                <p>Specific names may be either substantives or adjectives. The former has been
                    usually given when the plant had received a peculiar appellation from old
                    botanists, as <hi rend="italic">Doria, Jacobaea, Farfara;</hi> and then the
                    initial letter must be a capital. A substantive is often used in the genitive
                    case when a reference is made to some other genus, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pomme-reullia cornucopia!,</hi> and then the initial letter is small; or when
                    it is named after some person, as <hi rend="italic">Banunculus Gou-ani,</hi> and
                    then the letter is large. As to adjectives, they must agree in gender with the
                    generic names, and ought to indicate something remarkable in the species. They
                    ought always to commence by a small letter, but of late years botanists have got
                    into a habit of employing a capital when the adjective is derived from the name
                    of a place or person. Adjectives of colour ought to be used sparingly, because
                    the colour of flowers is of very little importance to the species, the same
                    often exhibiting two or more colours. Adjectives of size and qualities are
                    preferable, although these are gradually rendered less applicable by the
                    discovery of new species. Those taken from the agreeable aspect of certain
                    flowers, as <hi rend="italic">pulcher, formosus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >amaenus,</hi> are quite absurd, and ought never to be used. Names after
                    botanists may either be substantives in the genitive case, or have an adjective
                    termination. <hi rend="italic">Lycopodium Hoohen</hi> is an example of the one,
                    <hi rend="italic">Tulipa Celsiana</hi> of the other.</p>
                <p>Specific names may be taken from either Greek or Latin, but they ought to form
                    one word; whence <hi rend="italic">pes-caproe, noli-tangere,</hi> and still
                    worse <hi rend="italic">noli-me-ta7igere,</hi> ought never to have been given;
                    and though some of these from courtesy may be permitted to stand, they arc not
                    to be imitated.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Varieties</hi> are usually indicated by the letters of the
                    Greek alphabet; but when they prove more than usually important, a name is
                    attached to them similar to a specific name, as <hi rend="italic">Crataegus Aria
                    longifolia.</hi> Care ought, however, to be taken never to give such, unless the
                    varieties be nearly as permanent as the species itself. Of late, however, by
                    cultivation, so many varieties have been made, and each offering subvarieties or
                    variations, that it were more dignified for botanical writers to omit them
                    altogether, and hand them over for the amusement of florists and
                    horticulturists.</p>
                <p>By those who study the natural system, the names of families, or <hi
                    rend="italic">orders</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tribes,</hi> must be also
                    attended to. The former have been subjected at different times to different
                    principles. Linnaeus and others, seeking general and characteristical features,
                    as in the <hi rend="italic">Umbelliferae, Cruci-ferae, Legziminosae,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Labiatoe;</hi> and these, if they could be always obtained
                    with accuracy, are preferable to any others. But even to the few that are
                    admitted, exceptions are found; thus, in some <hi rend="italic"
                    >Umbelliferoe</hi> the umbel is so reduced as to appear no longer an umbel; and
                    in some <hi rend="italic">Legurninosae</hi> the fruit resembles a nut. Jussieu
                    and Adanson have therefore usually selected some genus, which is the type of the
                    family, and derived the name from it, as <hi rend="italic">Bosaceae</hi><pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193733869" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3869-0062"/> from the genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Posa;</hi> and this method is now generally adopted. Care,
                    however, must be taken that the genus be not only one of the best known and most
                    numerous in species, but one which is to give an idea of the general aspect and
                    structure. Thus <hi rend="italic">JBixinece</hi> is almost inadmissible, being
                    derived from <hi rend="italic">Bixa,</hi> a genus that rather forms a connecting
                    link between the above order and the <hi rend="italic">Tiliacecε,</hi> and
                    consequently improperly taken as the type. When once the genus is chosen, we
                    must attend to the terminating syllables, for it would not do to adopt simply
                    the plural, as <hi rend="italic">Poses,</hi> without some change. The common way
                    is to form an adjective ending in <hi rend="italic">cece,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">inea∙,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">Tiliaceae, Ericineeε;</hi> those
                    in <hi rend="italic">oideae,</hi> meaning a family <hi rend="italic">analogous
                    to,</hi> and not a family <hi rend="italic">including,</hi> are obviously to be
                    rejected. Sometimes, when a difficulty is experienced in transforming the
                    generic names into an adjective, some old well known name of the principal genus
                    may be taken, as <hi rend="italic">Thymeleoe, Salicariae,</hi> and then the
                    termination may be the mere plural of the substantive.</p>
                <p>When a family is divided into several remarkable groups, these also receive names
                    in the same way as the orders themselves. But a difficulty is often experienced
                    in bestowing names so as not to interfere with that of the family, and therefore
                    a rule has of late been laid down, that the names of orders or families be made
                    adjectives by prolonging the generic name one syllable, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ranunculus, Ranunculaceae,</hi> but that the names of tribes be formed of an
                    adjective without prolongation, as <hi rend="italic">Panunculus,
                    Ranunculece;</hi> and this law is now generally followed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Synonyms.</hi></p>
                <p>If nomenclature be indispensable for communicating our ideas to others, synonyms,
                    or a list of synonyms, are no less necessary for recognizing the name that ought
                    to be preferred to every other, and for reading the works of older writers, or
                    of those who lived before a systematic nomenclature was adopted. By this means
                    we are enabled to have recourse at once to the different authors whom we ought
                    to consult, and from whom we may derive instruction; and without such help we
                    might spend days or weeks in seeking for the information we require, and, after
                    all our labour, would not be able to impart it to others. The number of synonyms
                    quoted must vary much, according to the size of the work. When there is
                    sufficient room, not one ought to be omitted; but if, on the other hand, it be
                    an elementary work within a narrow compass, only the principal synonyms need be
                    brought forward; and under these we of course allude to the fullest
                    descriptions, and best figures, that can be most readily consulted by the
                    readers. A reference to the original describer of the species ought in almost no
                    case to be omitted: thus, Linnaeus, Bieberstien, Gunner, and Pallas, have each
                    of them made a <hi rend="italic">Gentiana ciliata;</hi> and it is important to
                    the reader to know of whom the <hi rend="italic">G. ciliata</hi> is. In quoting
                    synonyms, very little attention is paid to accuracy; and the consequence is that
                    more confusion is created than if all had been omitted. None indeed ought to be
                    cited, unless the writer has the strongest reason for thinking himself correct,
                    otherwise the reference must be made with doubt (?). De Candolle has
                    recommended, and with great propriety, that, in every one which the author has
                    had it in his power to verify by the inspection of an authentic specimen in an
                    herbarium, the sign (!) be placed after the synonym, indicating that such are
                    most worthy of attention, the others being supposed to be taken from
                    descriptions, which, however good, are not to be always confided in. Old
                    figures, being usually executed by artists not botanists, are of little use
                    except to give a very general idea of the plant; and even among modern figures,
                    when there is a difference, as often happens, between them and the description,
                    greater reliance is to be placed on the latter than on the former.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Botanical Style.</hi></p>
                <p>Botanical style is the art of characterizing and describing plants, so that they
                    may be ascertained by others. Before Linnaeus there were no fixed rules, each
                    person adopting what to himself seemed best; but in reforming other points, that
                    distinguished naturalist directed his attention also to this; and although, by
                    following his views, one was restricted to a peculiar form of words, yet the
                    advantages were very readily perceived, inasmuch as his plan put a stop at once
                    to the many vague and insignificant descriptions which were too often indulged
                    in by those of a flowery or poetical genius.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">character</hi> in natural history is that peculiar mark by
                    which one being, or one collection of beings, may be distinguished from all
                    others. When this is employed to distinguish a species, it is said to J)e <hi
                    rend="italic">specific;</hi> when belonging to a genus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >generic;</hi> to an order, <hi rend="italic">ordinal;</hi> and so on. The
                    principal merit of characters is to bring together what can be most easily
                    compared, and therefore such as are found in one and not in another are the
                    best.</p>
                <p>The characters of classes and orders are very different, according as an
                    artificial or a natural arrangement has been adopted. In the former case they
                    are very simple; in the latter, each being as it were one great genus, they must
                    be still more extended than the character of a genus. Adanson and Linnaeus,
                    therefore, thought it impossible to give characters to a natural order; but they
                    erred in seeking one by itself, and not a combination of several. Jussieu made
                    the attempt, and the example or method which he set to others is still called
                    the Jussieuan system, in opposition to the strictly artificial one founded by
                    Linnaeus. It is strange that the latter botanist, when he discovered that
                    natural genera could not be defined in few words, did not apply the same train
                    of thought to natural orders. Had he made the attempt, he must have succeeded,
                    and another wreath would have been added to his crown, which has shed immortal
                    honour on that of another. The characters of orders, when complete, must embrace
                    a full description of all the organs of reproduction found in them; but as this
                    is too long for common use, they are usually presented in a much abridged form.
                    But even an abridged character may often be much shortened, and it is then
                    called by Mr Lindley a diagnosis, comprehending only the distinctive characters
                    of the orders, reduced to their briefest form, and without reference to the
                    anomalies or exceptions which are often met with. For a character in full we may
                    refer to <hi rend="italic">Cruciferce</hi> in De Candolle’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Systema Regni Vegetabilis,</hi> vol. ii. p. 139, which it is unnecessary here
                    to cite. The abridged characters we shall have occasion ourselves to use.</p>
                <p>The characters of <hi rend="italic">genera</hi> vary also according to whether
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> the artificial or the natural system be adopted.
                    Linnaeus, following the former, found the necessity of giving two kinds of
                    character. The one, which he named the <hi rend="italic">essential,</hi>
                    contained no more than what was needful to distinguish the genus from others in
                    the same order. The other, which he termed the <hi rend="italic">natural,</hi>
                    contained a short description of all the parts connected with the flower, and
                    was necessary for the complete understanding of the genus; for without it one
                    could not have the slightest idea of its true form, nature, appearance, or
                    relations; and indeed his <hi rend="italic">Genera Plantarum,</hi> written soon
                    after his return from a visit to Jussieu at Paris, and containing natural
                    characters, seems written in an entirely different spirit from that in which he
                    had executed his <hi rend="italic">Species.</hi> We do not mean that any
                    improper inference should be drawn from this, but merely mention it as a very
                    striking circumstance. In the natural system there is no occasion for these
                    double characters; most of the lengthened character, as given by Linnaeus, being
                    contained in that of the order which includes<pb break="no" facs="nls:193733882"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-3882-0063"/> the genus. But, on the other hand, if a genus
                    have a number of peculiar characters, every one must be mentioned; so that here
                    the generic characters, though not so long as the natural ones of Linnaeus, must
                    almost always be a little longer than his essential characters. To the generic
                    character ought to be added a short account of the fundamental organs, remarks
                    on its natural affinities when necessary, or any of its peculiarities, and the
                    derivation of the name.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">. Specific</hi> characters ought to be the same, whatever be
                    the system; but in general, those who adopt the artificial content themselves
                    with making them, as Linnaeus prescribed, so very short as to contain only the
                    distinctive marks, and on no account to exceed twelve words. Many of those who
                    follow the natural method introduce as many of the peculiarities of the species
                    as they can, so that it may exhibit a very short description. But, perhaps,
                    without limiting ourselves to any particular number of words, it may always be
                    preferable to make the specific characters, <hi rend="italic">or phrases</hi> as
                    they are called, as abridged as possible, without being indistinct, and then,
                    when necessary, to add what may be denominated the natural character or
                    description of the species. In this way it is advisable, as was recommended by
                    Linnaeus, that in the phrase, all that follows the name, when in Latin, should
                    be in the ablative case; that it ought to be strictly comparative, and the more
                    contradictory terms employed in two species the better; that the characters
                    derived from the different organs should follow each other in a certain order,
                    beginning with those that apply to most species of the genus, and ending with
                    such as may be nearly peculiar to itself. There can therefore be no such phrase
                    when there is but one species of a genus. <hi rend="italic">Descriptions</hi>
                    may be either abridged or complete. In the latter case they may contain an
                    account of the root, stem, leaves, inflorescence, calyx, corolla, &amp;c. in the
                    order we have followed under Glossology. When in Latin, the nominative case is
                    to be employed; after a substantive comes the epithets in adjectives or
                    participles; but, for brevity, no connecting verbs arc allowed, unless in very
                    peculiar cases, where they cannot be dispensed with without creating great
                    ambiguity. Μ. de St Hilaire, in a late report given in to the French Institute,
                    on a work by Μ. Moquin on the family of <hi rend="italic">Chenopodiaceae,</hi>
                    seems to think that when the characters of the genus have been given with care,
                    specific descriptions are quite unnecessary. “Après avoir indiqué les caractères
                    de cette tribu, Μ. Moquin décrit en termes techniques les plantes qui la
                    composent. Il trace avec détail les caractères des genres et se borne pour les
                    espèces à de simples phrases. Nous ne pouvons qu’applaudir à cette méthode. Les
                    descriptions spécifiques completes sont fort utiles, sans doute, dans plusieurs
                    circonstances; mais lorsqu’un genre se compose de plantes régulières,—lorsque,
                    dans des dissertations générales, on a soumis leurs organes à un examen
                    scrupuleux,—nous pensons, avec un de nos savans confrères (Μ. de Cassini), qu’il
                    est superflu de redire à peu près autant de fois les mêmes choses qu’on a des
                    espèces à faire connaitre.” To this we subscribe in the case of a monograph, or
                    of a system of plants, because then we have the opportunity of reforming the
                    generic character to our own ideas; but in giving an account of a new or
                    isolated spccics, we do not see that, for the satisfaction of other writers, a
                    detailed description can be uniformly dispensed with.</p>
                <p>With regard to species, the order usually followed is, first the name, then the
                    specific character or phrase, next the synonyms, then the locality or <hi
                    rend="italic">habitat,</hi> the duration of the plant, the time of flowering,
                    &amp;c.; after which the description may be given, with the culture and use;
                    and, lastly, any critical observations that may present themselves.</p>

                <p>The genus belongs to Dodecandria monogynia of Linnaeus, and, like many others
                    referred to it, has no certain number of stamens. This is even more
                    exceptionable than some others, for the stamens are in several species as fiow
                    as four or five, and, therefore, the artificial system entirely fails. In the
                    natural method its place is obviously among the <hi rend="italic"

                    botanists unite it; but from that genus it is distinguished by the persistent
                    petals (in <hi rend="italic">Talinum</hi> deciduous), and ovules attached to the
                    bottom of the ovary by long filiform funiculi (in <hi rend="italic">Talinum</hi>
                    fixed to a central placenta). As a species its nearest affinity is with <hi

                    that the name ought scarcely to be retained. It was “named by Chamisso in honour
                    of Dr Eschscholz, an excellent botanist and entomologist, who accompanied him as
                    a fellow naturalist in the voyage round the world under the command of Kotzebue.
                    It is not, perhaps, generally known that this gentleman is a descendant of John
                    Sigismund Elsholz, a Prussian botanist, author of a Flora Marchica, and after
                    whom Willdenow named the <hi rend="italic">Elshol-</hi><hi rend="italic">zia

                    his name Eschscholz by mistake. The genus is now so well established, that the
                    alteration to another generic name might create unnecessary
                    confusion.”—Hook.</p>

                    plant itself abounds in a juice of this peculiar character, it cannot fail to
                    excite astonishment in the minds of those who are not already aware of the fact,
                    that it nevertheless yields an abundant flour, rendered innocent indeed by the
                    art of man, and thus most extensively employed in lieu of bread throughout a
                    very large portion of South America; and that even to our country it is largely
                    imported, and served up at table, under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tapioca.</hi> “Such is the poisonous nature of the expressed juice of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Manioc,</hi> that it has been known to occasion death in a few
                    minutes. By means of it the Indians destroyed many of their Spanish persecutors.

                    writhed and screamed with the agonies under which he suffered, and fell into
                    convulsions, in which he expired in six minutes. Three hours afterwards the body
                    was opened, but no alteration was found, except that the stomach was shrunk to
                    less than half its natural size; so that it would appear that the fatal
                    principle resides in a volatile substance, which may be dissipated by heat; as,
                    indeed, is satisfactorily proved by the mode of preparing the root for food.</p>
                <p>“By various processes, by bruising between stones, by a coarse rasp, or by a
                    mill, the root of the <hi rend="italic">Manioc</hi> is broken into small pieces,
                    then put into a sack, and subjected to a heavy pressure, by which all the juice
                    is expressed. What remains is <hi rend="italic">Cassada</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Cassava·,</hi> which, if properly dried, is capable of being
                    preserved for a great length of time.</p>
                <p>« In French Guiana, according to Aublet, <hi rend="italic">cassada flour</hi> is
                    made by toasting the grated root over the fire, in which state, if kept from
                    humidity, it will continue good for twenty years.</p>
                <p>“Cassava-cake, or cassava-root, is the <hi rend="italic">meal,</hi> or the
                    grated, expressed, and dried root of the <hi rend="italic">Manioc,</hi> pounded
                    in a mortar, passed through a coarse sieve, and baked on flat circular iron
                    plates fixed in a stove. The particles of meal are united by the heat, and when
                    thoroughly baked in this manner, form cakes, which are sold at the markets, and
                    universally esteemed as a wholesome kind of bread. The Spaniards, when they
                    first discovered the West Indies, found this in general use among the native
                    Indians, who called it <hi rend="italic">Cazabbi,</hi> and by whom it was
                    preferred to every other kind of bread, on account of its easy digestion, the
                    facility with which it was cultivated, and its prodigious increase. Again, in
                    Guiana, <hi rend="italic">Cipipa</hi> is another preparation from this plant,
                    and is the name given to a very fine and white fecula, which, according to
                    Aublet, is derived from the expressed juice of the roots, which is decanted off,
                    and suffered to rest some time, when it deposits an amylaceous substance, which
                    requires repeated washing. I know not whether this is exactly analogous to our
                    <hi rend="italic">Tapioca.</hi> The juice, says Sloane, evaporated over the
                    fire, gives the <hi rend="italic">Tapioca</hi> meal. But Lunan tells us, that,
                    from the roots of the <hi rend="italic">Sweet Cassada, Tapioca</hi> is made in
                    Jamaica, in every respect similar to that imported, which is done by grating
                    them, washing them, and infusing them in water, and evaporating the liquor so as
                    to obtain a sediment like starch, which must be well dried in the sun.</p>
                <p>“The root of the <hi rend="italic">Manioc</hi> is also the basis of several kinds
                    of fermented liquors; and an excellent condiment for seasoning meats, called <hi
                    rend="italic">Cabiou,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Capiou,</hi> is prepared from
                    the juice, and said to sharpen the appetite. The leaves beaten and boiled are
                    eaten after the manner of Spinach, and the fresh root is employed in healing
                    ulcers.</p>
                <p>“From what has been above stated, it will appear that the expression of the juice
                    from the root deprives the latter of its deleterious properties; and that the
                    application of heat to these juices renders the residue also wholesome and
                    nourishing. And whilst cassava-bread is, as Sloane says, in the most general
                    demand of any provision all over the West Indies, and is employed to victual
                    ships, the use of <hi rend="italic">Tapioca</hi> is still more extended, and
                    throughout Europe is largely employed for the same purpose as sago and
                    arrow-root.” (Hook, in <hi rend="italic">Bot. Mag.}</hi></p>

                <p>This, the <hi rend="italic">Papaiv</hi> tree, yields a milky juice; and, as
                    Browne mentions, if water be impregnated with it, it will make all sorts of meat
                    washed in it very tender; but eight or ten minutes steeping will render it so
                    soft that it will drop in pieces from the spit before it is well roasted, or
                    turn to rags in the boiling. If old hogs and poultry be fed upon the leaves and
                    fruit, however tough the meat they afford might otherwise be, it is thus
                    rendered perfectly tender. Even the vapour of the tree serves this purpose;

                <p>As to the manner in which botanical works may be got up, whether as Monographs of
                    Orders or Genera, as Floras of particular countries or districts of a country,
                    as a Hortus, as a Genera Plantarum, a Species Plantarum, or as a Systema
                    Vegetabilium, or as Botanical Plates; though each be subjected to a few rules,
                    yet much is left to the taste of the author. We shall therefore pass them over,
                    and proceed to an <hi rend="italic">Herbarium.</hi></p>
                <p>Descriptions and figures, however exact they may be esteemed by their authors,
                    have so often been found imperfect by others, that some means must be resorted
                    to, that every one may examine for himself the plant treated of. This in a
                    measure may be attained by having access to gardens; but in all our gardens
                    together, perhaps not more than one fourth of the vegetable productions of the
                    globe are cultivated, and of these many have not been made to bear blossoms or
                    fruit, and are therefore useless; nor can they be certainly seen in all states
                    at the very time when we particularly desire them. In a garden, also, the
                    cultivator is seldom an experienced botanist, and we may therefore expect many
                    errors in nomenclature. The name, therefore, so far from assisting us to trace
                    what an author had in view, may tend to puzzle us still more. In a garden,
                    likewise, plants are made as showy as possible, to please the eye, and often
                    depart very much from the type of the species as taken from its original
                    locality. The necessity, then, was soon perceived of preserving specimens of
                    every thing that is described, so that these may be communicated to other
                    botanists, examined by them, and criticised; and as it was impracticable to
                    retain for any length of time specimens in the fresh state, means were devised
                    to extract the juices; and this being accomplished, no alteration could
                    afterwards take place. Such is the origin of an <hi rend="italic"
                    >herbarium,</hi> which is a collection more or less considerable of different
                    plants, dried as carefully as possible, at a time when they were in leaf, in
                    flower, and in fruit; while a separate collection of fruits alone, either dried,
                    or, if they are fleshy, preserved in spirits or salt water, is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">granary.</hi> The mode of drying plants is very simple.</p>
                <p>Paper of an absorbent nature (such as common gray or brown packing paper, or old
                    newspapers) must be procured, about seventeen or eighteen inches long, and
                    twelve broad, and a few strong deal boards of the same size. The specimens may
                    be gathered in a large tin box, or in a basket so covered as to exclude the rays
                    of the sun; and when one cannot soon after proceed to dry them, a little water
                    may be occasionally sprinkled over them to seep them fresh. In order to dry
                    them, take one of the boards and lay a few sheets of paper upon it. The quantity
                    of paper will of course depend on its thickness, and on the nature of the
                    specimens; for when they are full of moisture, more paper is requisite than for
                    more tender or less juicy plants; and when they have thick or knobby stems, or
                    large hard fruits, a still greater quantity must intervene between each layer of
                    plants. Having taken, then, some sheets of paper, spread upon them the plants,
                    so as not to allow the one to overlap the other; and with this precaution
                    several may be laid on the same sheet. It <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733973"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-3973-0070"/> is quite useless to spread out or separate the
                    leaves or flowers with the hand. If the specimen be at all in a fresh state, its
                    natural appearance is best preserved by allowing it to take the position which
                    chance may direct. Above this layer of plants place some sheets of paper, then
                    another layer of plants, and so on till a packet be formed of a foot, or a foot
                    and a half high. When a considerable number of woody plants is in the packet, a
                    few thin boards may be interspersed, to prevent the more delicate plants
                    sustaining injury; this will also flatten the coarse ones more easily. On the
                    top of the packet another board is to be placed, and on it a large weight or dry
                    stone when such can be procured, so as to press the plants, and make them give
                    out their juices to the paper. The weight need scarcely be less than 50 lbs.;
                    and if the plants have thick or woody stems, even 80 lbs. or 100 lbs. may be
                    applied. In travelling, it is impossible to carry about large stones or weights,
                    in which case the plants may be pressed by means of two or three leather belts
                    passing round the packet, and pulled extremely tight. When plants have been
                    subjected to pressure for twenty-four or forty-eight hours, the weight may be
                    taken off, and the paper will be found to have absorbed a considerable portion
                    of moisture from the plants. It must therefore be now removed, and the specimens
                    laid on dry paper, and subjected to the same process as before. This must be
                    repeated until the plants are dry. It may be less troublesome were the sheets,
                    upon which the plants immediately rest, laid down in a dry situation for a few
                    hours with the plants on them. The moisture will quickly evaporate, and the
                    sheet, without disturbing the plants, may be laid upon a layer of dry paper. The
                    wet paper, when thoroughly dried, can be used as often as one chooses. When the
                    specimens are dry, which may be easily ascertained by their stiffness, or not
                    curling up when in a dry situation, they may be packed up (of small ones, fifty
                    or sixty specimens on a sheet), in very little space; only one sheet of paper is
                    then requisite between each layer of plants. Specimens must be gathered, when
                    possible, in dry weather. They ought to be both in flower and in fruit, the
                    latter being obviously as useful as the former to the scientific botanist; and
                    not less than from twelve or fifteen specimens of each kind ought to be taken,
                    one specimen proving frequently of little use. Small herbaceous plants, not more
                    than sixteen or seventeen inches high, may be pulled up by the root, and dried
                    entire; and some that are even longer, as grasses and ferns, may be doubled two
                    or three times. Of larger plants, such as shrubs and trees, specimens are to be
                    taken at least sixteen or seventeen inches long; and if the leaves on a plant
                    vary much in shape, a corresponding number of specimens may be dried of each
                    kind. Those plants which are of a very fleshy or succulent nature, as tulips,
                    &amp;c. ought to be plunged (all but the flower) for a few seconds into <hi
                    rend="italic">boiling</hi> water. This deprives them of life; and when the
                    extraneous moisture is allowed to dry off, or wiped away with a towel, they may
                    be dried as other plants. Lichens and fungi may be dried in the common way,
                    although those of the latter tribe seldom makegood specimens. Mosses grow
                    frequently in tufts, and are to be a little separated by the hand before they be
                    pressed. The larger or coarse sea-weeds ought to be plunged in boiling water,
                    and treated as succulent plants. The smaller ones, when one is hurried, may
                    first be partially dried in the open air, in a shady situation, and afterwards
                    subjected to a very gentle pressure, till quite dry, when they may be packed up
                    with the other plants; and, when our time permits, they will be restored to
                    their original form by washing them in cold fresh water. They are then to be
                    neatly spread out on pieces of writing paper, to which most of the species will
                    adhere; after this they are to be pressed, and a little attention must then be
                    paid lest the specimens also adhere to the absorbent paper.</p>
                <p>When a packet so prepared is sent from abroad, it ought to contain at least 100
                    different kinds, or more than 1000 specimens. It may then be placed in a deal
                    box, which is to be well closed, so as to prevent injury from water; and if the
                    box be previously well rubbed or sprinkled within with oil of turpentine, or any
                    other essential oil, the specimens will arrive safe from the depredations of
                    insects. Small fleshy plants and pulpy fruits may be put in a jar of spirits,
                    and forwarded in that state. In the case of fruits, a piece of wire, with a <hi
                    rend="italic">number,</hi> should be attached, so as to correspond to the dried
                    specimen of that species.</p>
                <p>When plants are either dried by oursblves or received in that state from others,
                    our next care is to form the <hi rend="italic">herbarium.</hi> For this the
                    specimens are to be either glued down on single sheets of stiff white paper, all
                    of an uniform size, or, as the glue attracts insects and prevents afterwards a
                    perfect analysis of the specimen, others prefer attaching them by means of cross
                    bands. Either of these modes will enable us to keep our herbarium in order; but,
                    without assistance, so much time is spent in the fixing them down, that most
                    botanists now keep the plants loose within sheets of paper of a softer texture.
                    This enables us quickly to dispose of our specimens in the collection; and when
                    turned over carefully, very little damage is afterwards sustained. No more than
                    one species ought to occupy a sheet; but ow ing to receiving the same plant from
                    different authors and different countries, we must often devote several sheets
                    to one species. Each specimen ought to have a label indicating the locality, the
                    name of the donor, when gathered, or any peculiarities about it; and every sheet
                    ought to have attached to it the name of the plant. All the species of a genus
                    may either be separated from those of another, by being placed within a sheet of
                    strong paper marked on the outside with the name of the genus, or by a thin
                    piece of pasteboard, according to the taste of the possessor.</p>
                <p>As to the order in which genera are to be arranged, the alphabetical is the
                    worst, and the Linnaean system next. The best is according to some one of the
                    variations of the natural method, it is of little importance which, provided one
                    adheres to it so much that he can by association go to the order without having
                    constant recourse to a catalogue.</p>
                <p>When it is necessary to analyse a dried plant, we may expose the flower or fruit
                    to the steam of boiling water, or those that are of a less delicate nature we
                    may detach, and allow to remain in warm water until the parts we are to examine
                    be so softened that we may easily dissect them under the microscope. Much
                    practice, address, and even knowledge of the structure of plants, is however
                    necessary, so that no appearance exhibited on dissection may fail to make some
                    impression on us. Every thing must be observed and theorised on as we proceed.
                    And we may here remark, that the best instrument for this purpose, at a moderate
                    price, is <hi rend="italic">Ellis'’s single and aquatic microscope,</hi> which
                    is furnished by Jones (Holborn, London), with five lenses, two of which are
                    reflectors, for three guineas.</p>
                <p>Ill—TAXONOMY.</p>
                <p>As we have already stated, taxonomy is that branch of botany which has for its
                    object the combination of all our observations on plants, so as to form a system
                    or classification.</p>
                <p>When science was in its infancy, and when few plants' were observed, they were
                    described or treated without any particular arrangement; or if some method was
                    adopted, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733986" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3986-0071"/> it
                    was merely empirical, and of little use to others. Theophrastus, Dioscorides,
                    and Pliny, who respectively treated of vegetables, may therefore now be justly
                    rejected as systematists; and we may pass on to a much more modern date, when
                    the characters began to be derived from the organization of plants; for it was
                    only then that botany became a science. But as the organs of plants were various
                    in number, so also were the systems, some botanists giving a preference to one,
                    others to another; some laying chief dependence on the roots, some on the stems,
                    others on the leaves, and others on the inflorescence. Conrad Gessner, born at
                    Zurich in 1516, was the first who demonstrated that the characters drawn from
                    the flowers and fruit were most to be depended on, as these were the most
                    permanent and unchangeable parts of a plant; he also pointed out that certain
                    groups possessed particular characters in common. His work was published in
                    1541. It does not appear that he gave any preference to one organ more than to
                    another as the basis of a system. Caesalpinus, born in 1519, at Arezzo in
                    Tuscany, was a follower of Gessner, and may be said to have been the first who
                    actually invented a system. He set out by distinguishing vegetables into trees
                    and herbs; with the former arranging shrubs, and with the latter suffruticoe
                    plants. He next divided each of these, the first into two classes, the last into
                    thirteen, according to the fruit and situation of the embryo (which he termed
                    corculum) in the seed. This system, therefore, being a primary approximation to
                    a natural method, will render him ever memorable.</p>
                <p>In 1680 Morison published the second volume of his <hi rend="italic">Historia
                    Plantarum.</hi> In this work a new system is offered, but some of the eighteen
                    classes contained in the second and third volumes possess no genuine distinctive
                    characters. His sections or secondary divisions are 108 in number, and are taken
                    from the figure and substance of the fruit, the number of seeds, sepals, and
                    petals, the figure of the root, the direction of the stem, the colour of the
                    flower, the place of growth, and one from the medical virtues of some of the
                    plants that compose it.</p>
                <p>Ray proposed his method to the world in 1682. It was founded similarly to
                    Morison’s, and divided originally into twenty-five classes. But this he
                    afterwards carefully corrected and improved at different times, so that the plan
                    of arrangement which at present bears the name of that author is entirely
                    different from what first appeared. It now was made to consist of thirty-five
                    classes, the distinguishing marks of some of which were derived from the habit
                    or external appearance; of others, from the greater or less degree of perfection
                    of the plants, from their place of growth, the number of seeds, fruits, petals,
                    or sepals to each flower, or from the nature of the fruit or inflorescence. They
                    were as follow:—I. Herbs. 1. Submarinae or seaplants, including Zoophytes and
                    Corals: 2.Fungi: 3.Musci, including Hepaticae and Lichens: 4. Capillares or
                    ferns: 5. Apetalae or apetalous plants, comprehending, among other anomalies,
                    the genus Equisetum: 6. Planipetalae, or those with semiflosculose compound
                    flowers, corresponding to the Cichoraceae of Jussieu: 7. Discoideae, containing
                    such of the Corymbiferae of Jussieu as have a pappus: 8. Capi-tatae,
                    corresponding principally to the Cynarocephalae of Jussieu, but more extensive,
                    and including all plants with tubular flowers that are collected into a sealy
                    involucrum: 9. Corymbiferae, similar to those of modern botanists, but limited
                    to the species without a pappus: 10. Gymno-mo-nospermae, or such as were
                    supposed to have one naked seed; to this belongs <hi rend="italic"
                    >Valeriana</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Arnιeria,</hi> and, by some unhappy
                    chance, <hi rend="italic">Thalictrum:</hi> 11. Umbelliferae: 12. Stellatae,
                    corresponding to one of the sections of Rubiaceae: 11. Asperifoliae: 14.
                    Verticillatae, or the Labiatae of Jussieu, andDidynamia angiospermia of
                    Linnaeus: 15. Polyspermae, or those with many apparently naked seeds, as <hi

                    assemblage: 16. Pomiferae, the fruit of which resembled an apple, and among
                    these the gourds and passion-flowers: 17. Bacciferae, or every herb with a
                    berry, whether a potato or asparagus: 18. Multisiliquae, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">Aquilegia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sedum,</hi> that had a fruit
                    of apparently several pods: 19. Di-tripetalae, containing principally <hi
                    rend="italic">Tillandsia,</hi> but seemingly not understood by Ray himself: 21.
                    Tetrapetalae, with either a long or a short pod, not however confined to the
                    Cruciferae of Jussieu, but comprehending <hi rend="italic">Veronica, Euphorbia,
                    Plantago,</hi> &amp;c.: 22. Papilionaceae or Leguminosae, including <hi

                    enumerated <hi rend="italic">Erythra· a, Apocynum, Oxalis,</hi> &amp;c.; but
                    indeed the 19th, the 23d, and the present classes, are much confused by the
                    author: 25. Bulbosae, and their allies, including a great part of the
                    monocotyledones, as Liliaceae, Asphodeleae, Orcliidcae, or ĩrideae: 26.
                    Graminifo-hae, comprehending the Grasses, Cyperaceae, and Junceae:</p>
                <p>27. Anomalae, or those herbs, <hi rend="italic">ŭsNymphoea, Piper,
                    αηdPoly-gala,</hi> that were not reducible to any of these. II. Trees.</p>
                <p>28. Arundinaceae, including the palms: 29. Juliferae, called also Apetalae,
                    containing those in which the fruit is separated from the staminiferous flower;
                    under which Ray ranked the Amentaceae and Coniferae, the Elm, the Mulberry,
                    &amp;c.: 30. Aggregatae, or trees with the flower and fruit collected together
                    into one mass, as the Fig: 31. Um-bilicatae, with an inferior, fleshy, or pulpy
                    fruit; a heterogeneous set: 32.Non-umbilicatae, or those where the flower
                    adhered to the bottom of the fruit; these are again divided into Pruniferae,
                    Bacciferae, and Pomiferae: 33. Vascu-liferae, or trees with a dry fruit: 34.
                    Siliquosae, or trees or shrubs bearing a legume, follicle, or any of such
                    elongated fruits: 35. Anomalae, or such as are not referable to any of the
                    above. Most authors only enumerate thirty-three classes, by omitting the 24th
                    and 30th, but which nevertheless form a part of his arrangement. Ray gives, in
                    addition, more lengthened characters of several of these, but it is quite
                    unnecessary here to notice them. His principal division into herbs and trees is
                    extremely faulty, and separates plants otherwise very closely allied. His
                    method, however, being a great approximation to a natural one, deserves much
                    praise, and we believe that it was the opinion of the late Sir J. E. Smith, who
                    was well qualified to judge, that Ray as a botanist was eclipsed by few but
                    Linnaeus.</p>
                <p>To pass over several of an inferior note, we come now ' to Tournefort. This
                    distinguished individual was born aG Aix in Provence in 1656. He was professor
                    of botany at the Jardin des Plantes of Paris, and was sent in 1700 by Louis XIV.
                    to the Levant. He travelled through Greece, and surveyed the borders of the
                    Black Sea and the islands of the Archipelago, and returned to Paris, where he
                    published an interesting account of his expedition. But before he set out, he
                    had already exposed his new system of arranging plants in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Institutiones Pei Herbariae,</hi> illustrated by many plates, and containing a
                    description of 688 genera and 10,146 species; and it is difficult to say whether
                    he deserves most honour for his new classification, or for the attempt to
                    characterize the genera and species.</p>
                <p>The method of Tournefort is composed of twenty-two classes, of which the
                    characters are derived, lsŕ, from the consistence and size of the stem, thus
                    dividing vegetables into herbs or suffruticoe plants and shrubs, or trees; in
                    which respect his system is subject to the same fault as that of Ray,
                    notwithstanding Rivinus, an intervening botanist, had demonstrated the absurdity
                    of such a division: 2d, From the presence or absence of the corolla: 3<hi

                <p>In the 3d class, the term anomalous means irregular, but not labiate; in the
                    11th, irregular but not papilionaceous. A liliaceous flower, as the 9th class,
                    he afterwards explains to be a regular corolla of six or three petals, or even a
                    monopetalous one with six divisions, but always having a fruit of three cells.
                    The 16th contains the ferns; the 17th the other cryptogamia, which he says were
                    commonly denied both flower and fruit. Such were the twenty-two classes
                    established by Tournefort. Each of them contains sections, of which there are in
                    all 122; and though at first sight it may appear simple and easy of reference,
                    it still presents considerable difficulties, from many of the characters being
                    merely negative, and others by no means decisive.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Artificial System.</hi></p>
                <p>The systems we have already noticed, whether of Caesalpinus, Morison, Ray, or
                    Tournefort, were all of them more or less attempts at a natural classification;
                    and such being the case, their great error was in selecting any one particular
                    part, and not an assemblage, as the ground of division. This, indeed, is the
                    grand difference between a natural and artificial method. The latter has merely
                    in view the knowledge of the names of plants; and its only use being, therefore,
                    to afford an easy means of discovering the name in books, by as slight an
                    inspection of the plant as possible, every one may have an arrangement of his
                    own, and there can be no fixed rule, for the system is purely artificial. The
                    natural method is not solely for the finding out the names of plants; its grand
                    object is to exhibit, along with the name, the relation which one plant bears to
                    another, and to class them, as near as we can, in the order they would stand
                    with regard to each other in the grand book of nature. To be correct, it ought
                    to be founded on the immutable laws of nature herself, and not on the will of
                    man. But although these two are grounded so differently, they ought not to be
                    viewed as in opposition to each other. “No person, surely, who has published a
                    natural system, without knowing all the plants in the world, will suppose that
                    he has removed every present obstacle, much less anticipated every future
                    obscurity, so that no insuperable difficulty can occur to the investigator of
                    plants by such a system; neither can any artificial system claim such
                    perfection: but they may combine their powers, and co-operate in instruction.
                    The one may trace an outline, which the other may correct and fill up. The first
                    may propose, and the second elucidate; the former may educate and improve the
                    memory and observation for the use of the latter. When they oppose each other,

                <p>“About the end of the seventeenth century, and the beginning of the eighteenth,
                    the necessity of some botanical system, of arrangement as well as nomenclature,
                    by which the cultivators of this pleasing science might understand each other,
                    became every day more apparent. Nor was there any deficiency of zeal among the
                    leaders and professors of this science. Systems, and branches of systems, sprung
                    up over the whole of this ample field, each aspiring to eminence and distinction
                    above its neighbours. Many of these, like the tares that fell by the way side,
                    soon withered for want of root; others, like the <hi rend="italic">herba
                    impia</hi> of the old herbalists, strove to overtop and stifle their parents;
                    and all armed themselves plentifully with thorns of offence, as well as defence,
                    by which they hoped finally to prevail over their numerous competitors. This
                    state of scientific warfare did not, in the meanwhile, much promote the actual
                    knowledge of plants, though it prepared the way for a final distribution of the
                    numerous acquisitions which were daily making by the more humble, though not
                    less useful, tribe of collectors and discoverers. The success of the Linnaean
                    artificial system is not altogether, perhaps, to be attributed to its simplicity
                    and facility, nor even to the peculiar attention it commanded by its connection
                    with the striking phenomenon, brought into view at the same time, of the sexes
                    of plants. The insufficiency, or at least the nearly equal merits, of the many
                    other similar schemes that had been proposed, began to be most strongly felt
                    just at the time when the great progress and success of practical botany
                    rendered the necessity of a popular system most imperious. While the cause of
                    system was pending, some of the greatest cultivators of science were obliged to
                    have recourse to alphabetical arrangement. This was the case with Dillenius, the
                    man who alone, at the time when LinnaeuS visited England, was found by him
                    attentive to, or capable of understanding, the sound principles of generic
                    distinction.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>Linnaeus was born in the province of Smaland, in Sweden, on the 23d May, 1707.
                    His father wished him to study divinity, but he himself preferred the open air
                    and the gathering of plants. His parent then thought of making him a shoemaker,
                    and in this might have succeeded, had not Rothmann, the provincial physician at
                    Wexicae, interfered, and persuaded him to permit his son to study medicine; and
                    had such not happened, Linnaeus’ genius <pb break="no" facs="nls:193734012"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-4012-0073"/> might have been for ever suppressed. After
                    experiencing many hardships, and living in great poverty, the young naturalist
                    got into favour with Celsius, the professor of divinity at Upsal; and by his
                    exertions, and those of Rudbeck, succeeded in obtaining permission to make a
                    journey through Lapland at the expense of the academy. On his return he
                    published the <hi rend="italic">Flora Lapponica.</hi> In a few years his fame
                    increased; and, having travelled into Holland and England, he was appointed
                    professor of botany at Upsal after Rudbeck’s death, and from time to time
                    honours were showered upon him. His great merit consists in having constituted
                    the genera on better principles, given proper generic and specific names,
                    introduced a better glossology, described species more accurately and according
                    to certain rules, and invented a new system, founded upon the sexes of plants,
                    unquestionably the best and most simple of all the artificial systems attempted
                    either before or since.</p>
                <p>The basis of the Linnaean distribution of plants rests almost entirely on the
                    male organs or stamens; and where no sexes could be distinguished, the proposer
                    of it termed the plants Cryptogamous, and the class including such, the
                    twenty-fourth of his arrangement, Cryptogamia. Among the first twenty-three
                    classes, or phanerogamous vegetables, some have the flowers hermaphrodite or
                    containing both sexes; others again have them separate, or are diclinous. To the
                    former belong twenty classes, to the latter three. Again, hermaphrodite or
                    bisexual flowers may have the stamens either free from the pistillum or united
                    to it, and hence another division; but as only one class belongs to the last,
                    there are nineteen to the first. These nineteen are further divisible, according
                    as the stamens are free from each other or united together. The former may be
                    equal or unequal in length; and those again which are equal may be either
                    definite or indefinite in number. Upon these considerations Linnaeus founded his
                    classification, which we will presently exhibit, not indeed precisely as it was
                    left by Linnaeus, but as it is now to be found in most of our modern works.
                    While we admit slight changes upon it, the plan or method is unaltered; and it
                    would be as preposterous <hi rend="italic">to</hi> say that what is now adopted
                    is not the system of Linnaeus, as it would be to assert that the various
                    sketches of the natural system, whether as given by Browne, by De Candolle, by
                    Richard, by Agardh, by Rudolphi, by Hooker, Don, or Lindley, are not variations
                    of the method of Jussieu. All the natural classifications now in use are
                    assuredly founded on that of Jussieu, and differ from each other in a very
                    slight manner, either in the greater subdivisions of the orders, or in the mode
                    of following each other, upon which no two botanists can possibly be agreed;
                    and, in the same way, the artificial system, whether or not we adopt the changes
                    recommended by Smith, or by Withering, or by Sprengel and others, being
                    decidedly grounded on his principles, is that of Linnaeus. It is as follows

                <p>Although we have prefixed sections to the above, that the method may be
                    understood more readily, yet we must remark that such a plan is liable to
                    errors. Thus some of the fifth class have the anthers united, as in the
                    nineteenth; and the tenth has frequently an inequality in the length of the
                    stamens; but these are not the faults of the system, some of which will be
                    traced out in the sequel.</p>
                <p>In the first thirteen classes, the characters of the orders or subdivisions of
                    the classes are derived from the number of the styles or female organs, the
                    names Monogynia, Digynia, Trigynia, &amp;c. indicating respectively one, two,
                    three, &amp;c. styles.</p>
                <p>In the fourteenth class, or Didynamia, Linnaeus took his ordinal characters from
                    the structure of the fruit. When this is formed of four akenia situated at the
                    bottom of the calyx, so as to resemble naked seeds, he called the order
                    Gymnospermia; and when the fruit was a capsule containing several seeds, he
                    termed the group Angiospermia. Tetradynamia presents also two orders, the one
                    with a silicule, the other with a siliqua; and hence they were called
                    Siliculosae and Siliquosae. A third order has been added, by Sprengel, for such
                    as have an indehiscent fruit, and De Candolle has proposed to subdivide the
                    class according to the relative position of the cotyledons and radicle. The
                    sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth classes being according to the union of
                    the filaments, the number of stamens is made to serve as a character for the
                    orders.</p>
                <p>In Syngenesia, where the anthers are united, and there are almost constantly five
                    stamens, other means were resorted to. Some florets were observed to be
                    bisexual, others with stamens or pistils only. In reference, therefore, to the
                    twenty-third class, Linnaeus gave to each of the orders the name Polygamia',
                    with another epithet to mark their respective peculiarities. The first he terms
                    Polygamia acqualis, all the florets being equally fertile and bisexual; the
                    second Polygamia superflua, where the florets of the disc are bisexual, but
                    those of the circumference or <pb break="no" facs="nls:193734025"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-4025-0074"/> ray female, both producing perfect seed: the
                    third Polygamia frustranea, having the florets of the disc bisexual and fertile,
                    but those of the ray sterile, from either the total absence of a pistil, or the
                    imperfection of the stigmata. In the second order the florets of the ray were
                    only superfluous, here they are totally useless. The fourth, or Polygamia
                    necessaria, has the florets of the disc bisexual, but sterile on account of the
                    imperfection of the stigmas: those of the ray, however, containing only
                    pistilla, are fertilized by the pollen of the former. They are thus necessary
                    for the continuation of the species, and hence the name. The fifth, Polygamia
                    segregata, has all the florets bisexual, but each of them contained an involucre
                    peculiar to itself; the whole, as in the other orders, being collected within a
                    common involucre. To these Linnaeus added a sixth, Polygamia monogamia, wherein
                    the flowers were not collected in a common involucrum; but this has now been
                    transferred to Pentandria monogynia.</p>
                <p>In Gynandria the orders are taken from the number of the stamens. Monoecia and
                    Dioecia, including plants that are monandrous, diandrous, monodelphous, or
                    gynandrous, have the names of the orders, as Monandria, Decandria, Gynandria,
                    taken from some of the preceding classes. The twenty-third class, or Polygamia,
                    containing plants with bisexual and unisexual flowers mixed either on the same
                    or distinct individuals, has in consequence been divided into three orders:
                    Monoecia, in which the flowers arc bisexual and unisexual on the same
                    individual; Dioecia, when one bears the bisexual and another the unisexual
                    blossoms of both kinds; andTrioecia, where one has the bisexual, another the
                    male, and a third the female flowers.</p>
                <p>Cryptogamia was originally divided by Linnaeus into four orders, Ferns, Mosses,
                    Algae, and Fungi; but so little was then known about the structure and limits of
                    these, that it is now generally agreed to adopt nearly the same divisions as are
                    employed in the natural method.</p>

                    arranging plants, according to that which is generally termed the Sexual System,
                    than it excited considerable attention. His elegant and instructive <hi
                    rend="italic">Flora Lapponica</hi> could not be perused by the philosopher or
                    the physician, without leading its readers occasionally aside, from the
                    immediate objects of their inquiry, into the paths of botanical speculation, and
                    awakening in many a curiosity, hitherto dormant, on such subjects. But the scope
                    of that limited Flora is by no means sufficient to show either the necessity or
                    the advantages of any mode of arrangement. Linnaeus may be said to have grasped
                    the botanical sceptre, when, in the year 1753, he published the first edition of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Species Plantarum;</hi> and the commencement of his reign
                    must be dated from that period. The application of his system to universal
                    practice, in this compendious distribution of all the known vegetables of the
                    globe; his didactic precision; his concise, clear, and certain style of
                    discrimination; his vast erudition displayed in synonyms; and, perhaps as much
                    as any thing else, the fortunate invention of trivial or specific names, by
                    which his nomenclature became as evidently commodious, and indeed necessarily
                    popular, as any part of his performance; all these causes co-operated to
                    establish his authority. An immediate impulse was given to practical botany. The
                    vegetable productions of various countries and districts were marshalled in due
                    array, so as to be accessible and useful. A common language was established
                    throughout the world of science; a common stock of knowledge and experience
                    began to accumulate, which has ever since been increasing, and can now never be
                    lost. Of these partial Floras to which we allude, those of Lapland and Sweden,
                    the productions of Linnaeus himself, were the models of most of the rest, and
                    have never, on the whole, been excelled.</p>
                <p>“Hence arose the Linnaean school of botany, which,; though founded in Sweden,
                    extended itself through Hol- <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> land, Germany, and
                    more or less perfectly in other parts of Europe, though not without impediments
                    of which we are hereafter to speak. In Britain it was firmly established, by the
                    influence of some of the most able pupils of Linnaeus, and strengthened at
                    length by the acquisition of his literary remains. But these are adventitious
                    supports. The strength of philosophical, like political, authority, is in public
                    opinion, and the cement of its power is public good.</p>
                <p>“As we proceed to trace the practical influence of the Linnaean system, or rather
                    of the facility which it afforded in botanical studies, it will be useful at the
                    same time to observe the effects of adventitious circumstances, which render
                    botany almost a different sort of study in different parts of the habitable
                    globe.</p>
                <p>“In those northern ungenial climates, where the intellect of man indeed has
                    flourished in its highest perfection, but where the productions of nature are
                    comparatively sparingly bestowed, her laws have been most investigated and best
                    understood. The appetite of her pupils was whetted by their danger of
                    starvation, and the scantiness of her supplies trained them in habits of
                    economy, and of the most acute observation. The more obvious natural productions
                    of such climates are soon understood and exhausted. But this very cause led
                    Linnaeus to so minute a scrutiny of Swedish insects, as had never been
                    undertaken before in any country; in consequence of which a new world, as it
                    were, opened to his contemplation; and the great Reaumur declared that Sweden
                    was richer in this department than all the rest of the globe. Such indeed was
                    its appearance, because it had been more carefully examined. When the ardour and
                    acuteness of the pupils of the Linnaean school first sought matter of employment
                    for their talents, some few had the means of visiting distant and
                    scarcely-explored countries. But this could not be the lot of many. The greater
                    part were confined to their native soil; and it is remarkable that those who are
                    longest so confined have displayed in the sequel the greatest abilities, and
                    have rendered the greatest services to science, independently of the accidents
                    which made the labours of others imperfect or abortive. Such men as Ehrhart and
                    Swartz were not to be satisfied with the general productions of the fields or
                    gardens to which they had access. They had no resource but in the recondite
                    mysteries of cryptogamie botany in the first instance. To these they directed
                    their microscopic eyes and more discriminating minds with the happiest success.
                    When they had derived from hence an ample harvest, Ehrhart, limited in
                    circumstances and opportunities, hindered moreover perhaps, in some degree, by a
                    singularity and independence of character, not always favourable to worldly
                    prosperity, opened to himself a new path. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193734038" xml:id="kp-eb0705-4038-0075"/> native trees of the north,
                    and especially the hardy shrubs and arborescent plants of the gardens, had not,
                    as he judiciously discovered, received that correct attention, even from his
                    master Linnaeus, which was requisite to make them clearly understood.
                    Difficulties attending the study of these plants, the various seasons in which
                    they require to be repeatedly scrutinized, and the obscurity or minuteness of
                    the parts on which their differences depend, were by no means calculated to
                    deter this laborious and accurate inquirer. He submitted the supposed varieties
                    of the shrubbery, the kitchen garden, and even of the parterre, to the same
                    rigorous examination, and, for the most part, with the happiest success. His
                    discoveries have not received the notice they deserve, for his communications
                    were deformed with asperity and pedantry; and he did not always keep in mind’the
                    concise and sober principles of definition, which his preceptor had both taught
                    and practised, and to which he owed so large a share of his well-merited fame.
                    Ehrhart died prematurely, but his name ought to be cherished among those whose
                    talents have advanced science, and who loved nature, for her own sake, with the
                    most perfect disinterestedness.</p>
                <p>“The fate of Swartz has been far more propitious to himself and to the literary
                    world. Having thrown more light upon the cryptogamie productions of Sweden and
                    Lapland than they had previously received, and which has only been exceeded by
                    the more recent discoveries of the unrivalled Wahlenberg, he undertook a
                    botanical investigation of the West Indies. Carrying with him, to this promising
                    field of inquiry, so great a store of zeal and practical experience, his harvest
                    was such as might well have been anticipated. Whole tribes of vegetables, which
                    the half-learned or half-experienced botanist, or the superficial gatherer of
                    simples or flowers, had totally overlooked, now first became known to mankind.
                    Tropical climates were now found to be as rich as the chill forests and dells of
                    the north, in the various beautiful tribes of mosses; and the blue mountains of
                    Jamaica rivalled its most fertile groves and savannahs in the beauty, variety,
                    and singularity of their vegetable stores.</p>
                <p>. “Nor must we pass over unnoticed the discoveries of another illustrious
                    disciple of Linnaeus, the celebrated Thunberg, who has now<note anchored="true"

                    a century.</p></note> for many years filled the professional chair of his
                    master, with credit to himself, and advantage to every branch of natural
                    science. The rare opportunity of examining the plants of Japan, and of studying
                    at leisure the numerous and beautiful productions of the Cape of Good Hope, as
                    well as of some parts of India, have thrown in the way of Professor Thunberg a
                    greater number of genera, if not species of plants, than has fallen to the lot
                    of most learned botanists; except only those who have gone round the world, or
                    beheld the novel scenes of New Holland. These treasures he has contemplated and
                    illustrated with great advantage, so far as he has confined himself to practical
                    botany. We lament that he ever stepped aside to attempt any reformation of an
                    artificial system. It is painful to complain of the well-meant though mistaken
                    endeavours of so amiable and candid a veteran in our favourite science; but what
                    we conceive to be the interests of that science must form our apology. We cannot
                    but be convinced, and the experience of others is on our side, that discarding
                    those principles of the Linnaean system which are derived from the <hi
                    rend="italic">situation</hi> of the several organs of impregnation, and making
                    <hi rend="italic">number</hi> paramount, has the most pernicious and
                    inconvenient effect in most respects, without being advan tageous in any. This
                    measure neither renders the system more easy nor more natural, but for the most
                    part the reverse of both. We have elsewhere observed <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Introduction to Botany,</hi> 3d ed. p. 358), that the amentaceous plants are
                    of all others most uncertain in the number of their stamens, of which Linnaeus
                    could not but be aware. ‘ Even the species of the same genus, as well as
                    individuals of each species, differ among themselves. How unwise and
                    unscientific then is it, to take as a primary mark of discrimination, what
                    nature has evidently made of less consequence here than in any other case I’
                    When such plants are, in the first place, set apart and distinguished by their
                    monoecious or dioecious structure, which is liable to so little objection or
                    difficulty, their uncertainty with respect to the secondary character is of
                    little moment; their genera being few, and the orders of each class widely
                    constructed as to number of stamens. Linnaeus, doubtless, would have been glad
                    to have preserved, if possible, the uniformity and simplicity of his plan; but
                    if he found it impracticable, who shall correct him? Such an attempt is too like
                    the entomological scheme of the otherwise ingenious and able Fabricius. The
                    great preceptor having arranged the larger tribes of animals by the organs with
                    which they take their various food, and which are therefore accommodated to
                    their several wants, and indicative of even their mental as well as
                    constitutional characters, Fabricius his pupil would necessarily extend this
                    system to insects. But nothing can be more misapplied. Feeding is not the
                    business of perfect insects. Many of them never eat at all, the business of
                    their existence through the whole of their perfect state being the propagation
                    of their species. Hence the organs of their mouth lead to no natural
                    distinctions, and the characters deduced therefrom prove, moreover, so
                    difficult, that it is notorious they could not generally be applied to practice
                    by Fabricius himself, he having, in the common course of his studies, been
                    chiefly regulated by the external appearance of the insects he described. This
                    external appearance, depending on the form and texture of their wings, and the
                    shape of their own peculiar organs, the <hi rend="italic">antennae,</hi> affords
                    in fact the easiest, as well as the most natural, clue to their arrangement and
                    discrimination.</p>
                <p>“As we presume to criticise the systematic errors of great practical observers,
                    it cannot but occur to our recollection how very few persons have excelled in
                    both these departments. Ray, Linnaeus, and perhaps Tournefort, may be allowed
                    this distinction. We can scarcely add a fourth name to this brief catalogue. The
                    most excellent practical botanists of the Linnaean school have been such as
                    hardly bestowed a thought on the framing of systems. Such was the distinguished
                    Solander, who rivalled his preceptor in acuteness of discrimination, and even in
                    precision and elegance of definition. Such is another eminent man, more
                    extensively conversant with plants, more accurate in distinguishing, and more
                    ready in recollecting them, than almost any other person with whom we have
                    associated. Yet we have heard this great botanist de’ clare, that however he
                    might confide in his own judgment with regard to a species, or a genus of
                    plants, he pretended to form no opinion of classes and orders. Men of so much
                    experience know too much, to be satisfied with their acquirements, or to draw
                    extensive conclusions from what they think insufficient premises. Others, with a
                    quarter of their knowledge, find no difficulty in building systems, and proceed
                    with great alacrity, till they find themselves encumbered with their own
                    rubbish; happy <pb break="no" facs="nls:193734051" xml:id="kp-eb0705-4051-0076"
                    /> if their doubts and uncertainties will afford them a tolerable screen or
                    shelter I But we here anticipate remarks which will come with more propriety
                    hereafter. We return from the consideration of the labours of particular
                    botanists, to that of the diversities of nature and circumstance.</p>
                <p>“While it is remarked that, in the cold regions of the north, the skill of the
                    deep and learned botanist is chiefly exercised on the minute and intricate
                    cryptogamie tribes, we are not to infer that nature is not everywhere rich in
                    beauty and variety. Mosses and lichens afford inexhaustible amusement and
                    admiration to the curious inquirer, nor are more gorgeous productions entirely
                    wanting. Even Lapland boasts her <hi rend="italic">Pedicularis Sceptrum,</hi>
                    never seen alive out of her limits; and Siberia offers her own beautiful crimson
                    <hi rend="italic">Cypripediurn,</hi> to console for a moment the miserable
                    banished victims of imperial caprice. Kotzebue, though ignorant of botany, did
                    not pass this lovely plant unnoticed, even in the height of his distress. The
                    authoress of the pleasing little novel called <hi rend="italic">Elizabeth,</hi>
                    has represented in a just light the botanic scenery of that otherwise
                    inhospitable country; yet it must be allowed that its rarities are not numerous,
                    except perhaps in those microscopic tribes already mentioned.</p>
                <p>“Let us in imagination traverse the globe, to a country where the very reverse is
                    the case. From the representations or accounts that have been given of New
                    Holland, it seems no very beautiful or picturesque country, such as is likely to
                    form or to inspire a poet. Indeed the dregs of the community which we have
                    poured out upon its shores, must probably subside, and purge themselves, before
                    anything like a poet, or a disinterested lover of nature, can arise from so foul
                    a source. There seems, however, to be no transition of seasons, in the climate
                    itself, to excite hope, or to expand the heart and fancy; like a Siberian or
                    Alpine spring, bursting at once from the icy fetters of a sublime though awful
                    winter. Yet in New Holland all is new and wonderful to the botanist.<note

                    the treasures of which he scattered a charm around the couch of the dying
                    Linnaeus, most resembles that of New Holland. At least these countries agree in
                    the hard, rigid, dwarfish character of their plants. But the Cape has the
                    advantage in general beauty of flowers, as well as in a transition of seasons.

                <p>“The lovely floras of the Alps and the Tropics contend, perhaps most powerfully,
                    for the admiration of a botanist of taste, who is a genuine lover of nature,
                    without which feeling, in some degree of perfection, even botany can but feebly
                    charm. Of one of these the writer can speak from experience, of the other only
                    by report; but he has had frequent opportunities of remarking, that the greatest
                    enthusiasts in the science have been Alpine botanists. The expressions of Haller
                    and Scopoli on this subject go to the heart. The air, the climate, the charms of
                    animal existence in its highest perfection, are associated with our delight in
                    the beauty and profusion of nature. In hot climates, the insupportable languor,
                    the difficulty of bodily exertion, the usual ill health, and the effects of
                    unwholesome instead of salutary fatigue, are described as sufficient to
                    counterbalance even the pleasure which arises from the boundless variety, and
                    infinite beauty, of the creation around. The flowery trees of a tropical forest
                    raise themselves far above the human grasp. They must be felled before we can
                    gather their blossoms. The insidious and mortal reptile twines among their
                    boughs, and the venomous insect stings beneath their shade. We who enjoy the
                    productions of these climates in peace and safety in our gardens, may well
                    acknowledge our obligations to the labour and zeal of those who, by arduous
                    journeys and painful researches, supply us with the riches of every country in
                    succession. We do not indeed enjoy them in perfection, but we can study and
                    investigate at leisure their various beauties and distinctions. We can compare
                    them with our books, and profit by the acuteness of former observers. We can
                    perpetuate, by the help of the pencil or the pen, whatever is novel or curious.
                    We can preserve the plants and flowers themselves for subsequent examination,
                    and return to them again and again in our closet, when winter has fixed his seal
                    on all the instruction and pleasure afforded by the vegetable creation abroad.
                    Yet let not the sedentary botanist exult in his riches, or rejoice too
                    heedlessly in the abundance of his resources. A plant gathered in its native
                    soil, and ascertained by methodical examination, is more impressed on the
                    memory, as well as more dear to the imagination, than many that are acquired
                    with ease, and named by tradition or report. The labours of its acquisition and
                    determination enhance its value, and the accompaniments of delightful scenery,
                    or pleasing society, are recollected, when difficulties and toils are
                    forgotten.</p>
                <p>“The western continent is, with respect to botany, al-. most a world in itself.
                    There exists, indeed, a general affinity between the plants of North America and
                    those of Europe, and many species of the arctic regions are the same in both;
                    but there are few common to the more temperate climates of each. A considerable
                    number, communicated by Kalm to Linnaeus, which the latter considered as
                    identified with certain well-known plants of our quarter of the world, prove, on
                    more accurate examination, to be corresponding but distinct species. Instances
                    occur in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193734064" xml:id="kp-eb0705-4064-0077"/> the
                    genera of <hi rend="italic">Carpinus, Corylus, Quercus,</hi> as well as in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Orchis</hi> tribe, and others. These points of resemblance are
                    found mostly among the vegetable productions of the eastern regions of North
                    America. Mexico and what little we know of the intermediate space, abound with
                    different and peculiar productions. So, in South America, Peru, Guiana, Brazil,
                    &amp;c. have all their appropriate plants, of which we know as yet enough to
                    excite our curiosity, rather than to satisfy it. Whatever has hitherto been
                    given to the world respecting American botany, has had one considerable
                    advantage. Each <hi rend="italic">Flora</hi> has been founded on the knowledge
                    and experience of some one or more persons, long resident, and in a manner
                    naturalized, in the countries illustrated. Those regions commonly comprehended
                    under the name of North America, have afforded materials for the <hi
                    rend="italic">Flora Eoreali-Americana</hi> of Michaux, and the more complete and
                    correct <hi rend="italic">Flora Americae Septentrionalis</hi> of Pursh. Michaux,
                    Wangenheim, and Marshall, have particularly illustrated the trees of those
                    countries. But all these works have been enriched by the communications and
                    assistance of men who had much more extensive and repeated opportunities of
                    observation than their authors, except Mr Marshall, could have. Such are the
                    venerable John Bartram, the Reverend Dr Muhlenberg, Messrs Clayton, Walter,
                    Lyon, &amp;c. The Mexican flora has received, for a long course of years, the
                    attention of the able and learned Mutis, who long corresponded with Linnaeus,
                    and whose countrymen have prepared the sumptuous <hi rend="italic">Flora

                    various seasons, the rich and interesting regions, whose botanical treasures
                    make so splendid and novel an appearance in those volumes. Of those treasures we
                    have still more to learn from the unrivalled Humboldt.<note anchored="true"

                    of South America have been published, particularly illu tive of the Flora of
                    Brazil. Of these, Pohl’s, Martius’, and St Hilaire’s, are the most
                    eminent.</p></note> The French botanist Aublet, after having gained considerable
                    experience in the Mauritius, resided for many years in Cayenne and Guiana, for
                    the purpose of studying the plants of those countries, of which his work, in
                    four quarto volumes, gives so ample a history and representation.</p>
                <p>“All the writers just named have been practical botanists. They have generally
                    excelled in specific discrimination, nor have they neglected the study of
                    generic distinctions. Anv thing further they have scarcely attempted. It is
                    remarkable that they have all followed, not only the Linnaean principles of
                    definition and nomenclature, but the Linnaean artificial system of
                    classification. This same system was chosen by the veteran Jacquin, in his
                    well-known work on West Indian plants, entitled <hi rend="italic">Stirpium
                    Americanarum Historia,</hi> as well as by Browne in his <hi rend="italic"

                    some of Thunberg’ş alterations. We cannot but observe, that in the very
                    department of botany in which he has most signalized himself, and with which he
                    is most philosophically conversant, the <hi rend="italic">Orchideoe,</hi> he
                    totally rejects the ideas of Thunberg.</p>
                <p>“If we now turn our eyes to the oriental world, we shall find that the seeds of
                    Linnaean botany, sown by Koenig, have sprung up and produced, successive
                    harvests among the pious missionaries at Tranquebar, who still continue to
                    interweave a sprig of science, from time to time, among their amaranthine
                    wreaths which are not of this world. India too has long possessed a practical
                    botanist of indefatigable exertion and ardour, who has thrown more light upon
                    its vegetable riches, with the important subject of their qualities and üses,
                    than any one since the days of Rheede and Rumphius. It is scarcely necessary to
                    name Dr Roxburgh, whose recent loss we deeply lament, and whose acquisitions and
                    learned remarks are given to the world by the munificence of the East India
                    Company; in a style which no prince has ever rivalled.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>From the period in which the East India
                    Company saw its sovereignty established in India with some security, it
                    undertook, both for its own interest and that of humanity, as much as it
                    possibly could, the promotion of the study and culture of the vegetables of that
                    vast country. It, in consequence, directed its attention to the establishment of
                    the Botanic Garden of Calcutta; and it was in March 1768, and under the
                    direction of Colonel It. Kydd, that this garden commenced. A correspondence with
                    all the Europeans settled in various parts of India speedily enriched it with
                    some very precious plants, and there were in it about three hundred species when
                    Dr Roxburgh took the superintendence, in .the autumn of 1/93. This botanist
                    obtained new and more active correspondents, and visited personally the coast of
                    Coromandel, and some other provinces of British East India. He succeeded in
                    collecting together 3500 species into the garden, and of this number 1500 were
                    previously unknown, but described by him. Such at least we learn from the
                    catalogue of the garden, printed in 1814, at Serampore, by the care of Dr Carey,
                    the friend of Roxburgh. This catalogue appeared in a very condensed shape; it
                    makes known the botanical name, the Indian appellation, the locality, the time
                    of introduction, and the period of inflorescence and fructification, of each
                    plant; it is terminated by an appendix containing a list of other Indian plants,
                    known to the author, but not then under cultivation. Roxburgh sent from time to
                    time to the Company a great number of drawings and descriptions, and from these
                    a selection was made and published under the direction of Sir Joseph Banks. This
                    splendid work, the <hi rend="italic">Plants of .Coromandel,</hi> gives the
                    history and coloured figure of 300 of the most beautiful or most useful of the
                    Indian vegetables. But the very magnificence of this work placed limits to it,
                    and therefore Dr Roxburgh projected a Flora of the East under a more simple
                    form; unfortunately, however, his health forced him to leave India and return
                    home in 1814. His <hi rend="italic">Indian Flora</hi> was nevertheless not lost
                    to science; Dr Carey published two volumes of it at Serampore, and added to
                    those described by Roxburgh, such as were more lately discovered, both by
                    himself and by Dr Wallich, Jack, and other botanists of British India. This only
                    contains the first five classes of Linnaeus.</p><p>After the death of Roxburgh,
                    the management of the garden of Calcutta was intrusted to Dr Wallich, whose
                    talents and activity, under the auspices of the Company, have raised the
                    establishment to a high degree of prosperity. -More than three hundred persons
                    are employed in the garden, so that the naturalisation of useful objects, and
                    preservation for study of the rare productions of the différent parts of India,
                    are equally attended to. Many assistants traverse the country at the expense of
                    the Company, and.with unwearied zeal continue to enrich the garden and the
                    herbarium. Dr Wallich himself travelled in 1820 throughout Nepaul, which,
                    situated at the foot of the great mountains of Himalaya, presents a vegetation
                    of a very different nature from that pf Bengal-Since then, notwithstanding the
                    severe disorders brought on by fatigue and the climate, he has visited Penang,
                    Singapore, the kingdom of Ava, and several other parts of India; in addition, he
                    sent collectors into various districts to which he could not go in person; so
                    that, by these different means, a very considerable number of vegetables has
                    been amassed. Descriptions of several of these have been given in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Prodromus Flora Nepadensis</hi> of Don, and in other publications
                    of a more general nature published in Europe. Walli¢h himself, as has been said,
                    inserted many of his discoveries into the <hi rend="italic">Flora Indica,</hi>
                    and has besides commenced two other works for the purpose of making them better
                    known. The one is the <hi rend="italic">Tentamen Florae Nepal ensis
                    illitstratae,</hi> wļhich presents a detailed description and a lithographic
                    figure of the principal plants of that country. Two numbers have appeared, each
                    of twenty-five plates; which, in addition to their botanical interest, deserve
                    to be noticed, as being the first attempts at lithographic botanical plates in
                    India, and executed by <pb corresp="kp-eb0705-4077-0078" xml:id="pbn778"/>
                    native draughtsmen. The other work by Dr Wallich, much more splendid than the
                    preceding, is destined to present the history and coloured figures of the rarer
                    plants of Asia. This, the <hi rend="italic">Plantoe Asiaticae rariores,</hi>
                    will form three volumes.</p><p>Besides, Roxburgh and Wallich, there are others
                    who have been patronized by the Company. Koenig, Heyne, Carey, Patrick Russel,
                    Rottier, Klein, Wight, Jack, Finlayson, &amp;c. have traversed different parts
                    of India with the view of studying its vegetation. For about half a century, all
                    the collections of dried plants have been transmitted to England, and preserved
                    in the Company’s museum; and the immensity of these materials has made the
                    Directors perceive that they would be useless without the co-operation of many
                    naturalists. By a decision remarkable for its liberality, the Court of Directors
                    has, therefore, lately given instructions to Dr Wallich, at present in London,
                    to distribute these precious collections among the principal botanists of the
                    present day; and the East India Company has thus acquired the most honourable
                    claims on the gratitude of the men of science of every country. But if the
                    thanks of naturalists be due to the Company in the first place, they are
                    scarcely less so to Dr Wallich, who superintends the operation. Far from
                    profiting by his situation to reserve for himself the publication of so much
                    riches, he merely wishes to distribute them among others in the manner which he
                    conceives most useful for the progress of natural history. His time in England,
                    which he has a right to devote to his private affairs, and his valuable notes,
                    are wholly at the service of others.</p></note> That enthusiastic admirer of
                    nature, Colonel Hardwicke, and the learned<pb corresp="pbn778"
                    facs="nls:193734077" xml:id="kp-eb0705-4077-0078"/> botanist Dr Francis
                    Buchanan, have also contributed greatly to increase our knowledge of Indian
                    botany. The latter has enjoyed the advantage of investigating, for the first
                    time, the remote and singular country of Nepaul, so prolific in beautiful and
                    uncommon plants, that few parts of the world can exceed it; and yet meeting, in
                    several points, not only the floras of the lower regions and islands of India,
                    but those of Japan, China, and even Siberia. The only systematic work on East
                    Indian plants, is the <hi rend="italic">Flora lndica</hi> of Burmann, which is
                    classed according to the Linnaean artificial method. We cannot but wish that it
                    were more worthy of the system or the subject; yet, as a first attempt, it
                    deserves our thanks. In speaking of Indian botany, shall we withhold our homage
                    from that great and sublime genius Sir William Jones, who honoured this study
                    with his cultivation, and, like every thing else that he touched, refined,
                    elevated, and elucidated it? No man was ever more truly sensible of the charms
                    of this innocent and elegant pursuit; and whenever he adverted to it, all the
                    luminous illustrations of learning, and even the magical graces of poetry,
                    flowed from his pen.</p>
                <p>“But we must extend our view beyond the utmost bounds of India, and, of the then
                    discovered world, to trace the steps of those adventurous circumnavigators who
                    sought out, not only new plants, but new countries, for botanical examination.
                    The names of Banks and Solander have, for nearly half a century, been in every
                    body’s mouth. Their taste, their knowledge, their liberality, have diffused a
                    charm and a popularity over all their pursuits; and those who never heard of
                    botany before, have learned to consider it with respect and admiration, as the
                    object to which a man of rank, riches, and talents, devoted his life and his
                    fortune; who, while he added, every season, something of novelty and beauty to
                    our gardens, gave the bread-fruit to the West Indies, and was ever on the watch
                    to prompt or to further any scheme of public advantage.<note anchored="true"

                    associated the names of the learned Forsters, father and son, of Sparrmann, and
                    of Menzies, who have all accomplished the same perilous course, and enriched
                    their beloved science. The cryptogamie acquisitions of the latter in New Zealand
                    prove him to have attended to that branch of botany with extraordinary success,
                    and at the same time evince the riches of that remote country. Indeed, it
                    appears that any country proves rich, under the inspection of a sufficiently
                    careful investigator. The labours of these botanists have all been conducted
                    according to the principles and classification of Linnaeus. Forster, under
                    Sparrmann’s auspices, has judiciously pointed out, and attempted to remedy,
                    defects which their peculiar opportunities enabled them to discover, but with no
                    invidious aim. They laboured, not to overthrow or undermine a system, which they
                    found on the whole to answer the purpose of readily communicating their
                    discoveries, but to correct and strengthen it for the advantage of those who
                    might come after them. It is much to be lamented that, except the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nova Genera Plantarum,</hi> we have as yet so short and
                    compendious an account of the acquisitions made in their voyage. To the
                    technical history of these, however, the younger Forster has commendably added
                    whatever he could supply of practical utility, and has thus given us all the
                    information within the compass of his means.</p>
                <p>" Long since the voyages of these celebrated naturalists, the same remote
                    countries have been visited, in our own days, by two learned botanists more
                    especially; these are Μ. Labillardière, and Mr Brown, librarian of the Linnaean
                    Society. The former has published an account of the plants of New Holland, in
                    two volumes folio, with fine engravings; the latter has favoured the botanical
                    world with one volume of a most acute and learned <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prodromus</hi> of his discoveries. As his voyage was made at the public
                    expense, we may trust that the government will consider itself as bound to
                    enable him to publish the whole of his acquisitions, in such a manner as to be
                    generally useful. His own accuracy of observation, illustrated by the drawings
                    of the inimitable Bauer, cannot fail to produce such a work as, we will venture
                    to pronounce, has never been equalled. Μ. Labillardière has disposed his book
                    according to the system of Linnaeus; a rare example in France, where any thing
                    not French usually comes but ill recommended. Mr Brown, on the other hand, has
                    written his <hi rend="italic">Prodromus,</hi> at least, on the principles of
                    classification established by the celebrated Jussieu, the great champion of a
                    natural system of his own. On this subject we postpone our remarks for the
                    present. Before we can enter on the subject of natural classification, it is
                    necessary to consider the state and progress of botany, for some years past, in
                    the schools, and among the writers, of Europe.</p>
                <p>“Sweden has continued to maintain her long established rank in the several
                    departments of natural science, nor has· Denmark been behind-hand with her
                    neighbour and ancient rival. The son and successor of the great Linnaeus
                    endeavoured to follow his father’s steps, and was ambitious of not being left
                    very far in the rear; a commendable aim, which his short life, to say nothing of
                    bis talents or experience, disabled him from accomplishing. He completed and
                    gave to the world, the unfinished materials which his father had left, for a
                    supplement to his <hi rend="italic">Species Plantarum</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mantissae;</hi> and having enriched the book with many communications of
                    Thunberg and others, as well as a number of original remarks, he felt a strong
                    desire, not altogether unpardonable, of being thought the principal author of
                    the work. All uncertainty on this subject, wherever other helps fail, is removed
                    by the original manuscript of the <hi rend="italic">Supplementum Plantarum</hi>
                    in our possession. Ehrhart superintended the printing of this work, and made
                    some alterations in the manuscript, traces of which are perceptible in the
                    affected Greek names given to some species of <hi rend="italic">Carex,
                    Mespilus,</hi> &amp;c., as well as in their sesquipedalian specific characters.

                    introduced his own new genera of Mosses; which the younger Linnaeus thought so
                    alarming an innovation, that he ordered the sheet containing these matters to be
                    can- , celled. We are possessed of a copy, which shows the genera in question to
                    be almost all well founded, and what are now, under Hedwig’s sanction, generally
                    received, though by other names. The descriptions of Ehrhart are precise and
                    correct, though his terminology is exceptionable, being full of innovations and
                    crabbed expressions. Two years, almost immediately preceding the death of the
                    younger Linnaeus, were spent by the latter in visiting England, France, and
                    Holland, and were employed to very great advantage, in augmenting his
                    collections of natural productions, as well as his scientific skill. During this
                    tour he attached himself strongly, through the medium of his old friend
                    Solander, to Sir Joseph Banks; and, while in France, he almost planted, or at
                    least greatly advanced, a Linnaean school in that kingdom. He had scarcely
                    resumed his professorial office at home when he was unexpectedly taken off, by
                    an acute disease, in his forty-second year. Of the talents and performances of

                    were laid by Linnaeus, are published regularly. Both are from time to time
                    enriched with botanical communications worthy of the pupils of so illustrious a
                    school. A veteran in botanical science, Professor Retzius, still presides at the
                    university of Lund. The worthy and accurate Afzelius, well known in England, who
                    accomplished a hazardous botanical expedition to Sierra Leone, is the coadjutor
                    of Professor Thunberg; and the difficult subject of Lichens, under the hands of
                    Dr Acharius, has become so vast and so diversified as to be almost a science of
                    itself.</p>
                <p>“Denmark has always possessed some acute and learned botanists, and has, more
                    than most other countries, been supplied with dried specimens of plants, as an
                    article of commerce, from her West or East Indian establishments. Oeder, the

                    continuator, have distinguished themselves; but their fame is inferior to that
                    of the late Professor Vahl, who studied under the celebrated Linnaeus, and is
                    the author of several excellent descriptive works. He undertook no less than a
                    new <hi rend="italic">Species,</hi> or, as he entitled it, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Enumeratio Plantarum;</hi> an admirable performance, cut short by his death at

                    that Afzelius and Retzius, as well as Vahl, in all they have given to the world,
                    have followed the system of their great master. The <hi rend="italic">Flora
                    Danica,</hi> chiefly a collection of plates, with few synonyms and no
                    descriptions, has come forth, from time to time, for above fifty years past, in
                    fasciculi, without any order, and is still incomplete. It was undertaken by
                    royal command, and, in a great measure, at the sovereign’s expense, though
                    regularly sold, except some copies presented to certain distinguished men, as
                    Linnaeus.</p>
                <p>“After the example of Denmark, Sweden, &amp;c. Russia has been desirous of
                    promoting, throughout its vast dependencies, an attention to natural knowledge.
                    Nor was any country ever more fortunate in the possession of an active and
                    intelligent naturalist. The celebrated Pallas successfully devoted a long life
                    to these pursuits, and to the communication of his discoveries and observations.
                    He prompted the Empress Catharine to offer an unlimited sum for the museum,
                    library, and manuscripts of Linnaeus; but, fortunately for their present
                    possessor, the offer was made too late. A <hi rend="italic">Flora Possica,</hi>
                    on the most magnificent scale, was undertaken by Pallas; his imperial mistress
                    proposing to defray the cost of the whole undertaking, not merely for sale, but
                    for gratuitous presentation, on the most princely scale, to all who had any
                    taste or ability to make use of the book. This well-intended munificence was the
                    cause of the ruin of the project. The first half volume was bestowed as the
                    empress intended. But the second part, instead of following the destination of
                    the first, got into the hands of interested people, who defeated the liberal
                    designs of their sovereign, misapplied her money, and by the disgust and
                    disappointment which ensued, prevented the continuance of the work. Those who
                    wished to complete their sets, or to obtain the book at all, were obliged to
                    become clandestine purchasers, buying as a favour, what they ought to have
                    received as a gift; and were, moreover, like the writer of this, often obliged
                    to receive imperfect copies. In like manner the intentions of the great Howard,
                    respecting his book on prisons, were rendered ineffectual by the disgraceful
                    avarice of certain London booksellers, who immediately bought up, and sold at a
                    greatly advanced price, the whole edition, which its benevolent author had
                    destined to be accessible to every body at an unusually cheap rate. These
                    examples, amongst others, show that it is the most difficult thing in the world
                    to employ patronage, as well as gratuitous charity of any kind, to real
                    advantage, except under the guidance of the most rigorous discretion. ‘ All that
                    men of power can do for men of genius,’ says Gray, if we recollect aright, ‘ is
                    to leave them at liberty, or they become like birds in a cage,’ whose song is no
                    longer that of nature and enjoyment. The great and the affluent may foster and
                    encourage science and literature, by their countenance, their attention, and a
                    free, not overwhelming, liberality; but when princes become publishers of books,
                    or directors of academies, they generally do more harm than good. They descend
                    from their station, and lose sight perhaps of their higher and more peculiar
                    duties, which consist in promoting the general prosperity, peace, and liberty of
                    their subjects, under the benign influence of whichţ every art, science, or
                    pursuit, that can be beneficial to mankind, is sure to flourish without much
                    gratuitous assistance.</p>
                <p>“Several of the immediate scholars of the illustrious Swedish naturalist were
                    planted in different parts of Germany. Murray, to whom he intrusted the
                    publication of that compendious volume entitled <hi rend="italic">Systema
                    Vegetabilium,</hi> and who printed two successive editions of the work, was
                    seated as Professor at Gottingen. Giseke was established at Hamburg, and, after
                    the death of Linnaeus, gave to the world such an edition as he was able to
                    compile, from his own notes and those of Fabricius, of the lectures of their
                    late preceptor, on the natural orders of plants. His ideas on this subject
                    Linnaeus himself always considered as too imperfect to be published, except in
                    the form of a sketch or index, at the end of his <hi rend="italic">Genera
                    Plantarum.</hi> The venerable patriarch, Professor Jacquin, still survives at
                    Vienna, where he and his worthy son have enriched botany with a number of
                    splendid and useful works. They have given to the public several labours of the
                    excellent practical botanist Wulfen, and others, which might, but for their
                    encouragement, have been lost. The highly valuable<pb break="no"

                    grasses is conducted on the plan of Jacquin’s works. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Synopsis</hi> of Austrian plants is an excellent <hi rend="italic">Plora,</hi>
                    disposed according to the sexual system; as is the more ample <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tentamen Floroe Gernianiccx</hi> of the celebrated Dr Roth, one of the best
                    practical European botanists, and more deeply versed than most others in
                    cryptogamie lore. The best Linnaean <hi rend="italic">Flora,</hi> as far as it
                    goes, that the world has yet seen, we speak it without any exception, is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Plora Germanica</hi> of Professor Schrader of Gottingen, the first
                    volume of which, comprising the first three classes of the sexual system, was
                    published in 1806. The correct distinctions, well-digested synonyms, and
                    complete descriptions, of this work, are altogether unrivalled. If the whole
                    should be equally well executed, for which the longest life would be scarcely
                    sufficient, it must ever be the standard book of European botany. Its
                    descriptions of grasses are worthy to accompany the exquisite engravings of the
                    same tribe from the hand of Leers, published at Herborn in 1775, which excel
                    every botanical representation which we have yet examined. They will bear, and
                    indeed they require, the application of a magnifying-glass, like the plants
                    themselves. The purchaser of this little volume must however beware of the
                    second edition, the plates of which are good for little or nothing. The name of
                    Schrader has long been distinguished in cryptogamie botany. In this pursuit, the
                    industrious and accurate botanists of Germany, shut out from extensive
                    opportunities of studying exotic plants, have had full scope for their zeal and
                    abilities. In this field the Leipsic school has distinguished itself. Here the
                    great Schreber first began his career with some of the most perfect cryptogamie
                    works, especially on the minute genus <hi rend="italic">Phascum.</hi> Here the
                    same author published his excellent <hi rend="italic">Flora Lipsiensis,</hi> his
                    laborious practical work on Grasses, and finally his improved edition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Genera Plantarum</hi> of his friend Linnaeus. But, above all,
                    Leipsic is famous for being the residence of Hedwig, whose discoveries relative
                    to the fructification and generic characters of Mosses form an era in botanic
                    science. Under the hands of such an observer, that elegant tribe displays itself
                    with a degree of beauty, variety, and singularity, which vies with the most
                    admired herbs and flowers, and confirms the Linnaean doctrine of impregnation,
                    which the more obvious organs of the latter had originally taught. Nor must we,
                    in speaking of cryptogamie plants, neglect here to record the names of Weiss,
                    Weber, Mohr, Schmi-del, Esper, and especially Hoffmann; the plates of the
                    latter, illustrating the Lichen tribe, are models of beauty and correctness. His
                    <hi rend="italic">Flora Germanica</hi> is a most convenient and compendious
                    manual, after the Linnaean system. <hi rend="italic">Fungi</hi> have been
                    studied in Germany with peculiar care and minuteness. The leading systematic
                    author in this obscure tribe, Persoon, was indeed born of Dutch parents, at the
                    Cape of Good Hope; but he studied and published at Göttingen. Two writers of the
                    name of Albertini and Schweiniz have published the most minute and accurate
                    exemplification of this natural order, in an octavo volume, at Leipsic, in the
                    year 1805, comprising the Fungi of the district of Niski in Upper Lausatia. If
                    their figures are less exquisitely finished than Persoon’s, or less elaborately
                    detailed than Schrader’s, their descriptions make ample amends.</p>
                <p>“The German school of botany has for a long period been almost completely
                    Linnaean. This however was not always the case; for, in the earlier part of his
                    career, the learned Swede was attacked more repeatedly and severely from this
                    quarter of the world than from any other; his ridiculous critic Siegesbeck of
                    Petersburg excepted, who would not admit the doctrine of the sexes of plants,
                    because the pollen of one flower may fly upon another, and his purity could not
                    bear the idea of such adultery in nature. Numerous methods of arrangement
                    appeared in Germany, from the pens of Heister, Ludwig, Haller, and others, and
                    even Schreber adopted a system like some of these in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Flora</hi> above mentioned. It would be to no purpose now to criticise these
                    attempts. They cannot rank as natural systems, nor have they the convenience of
                    artificial ones. Part of their principles are derived from Linnaeus, others from
                    Rivinus. Their authors were not extensively conversant with plants, nor trained
                    in any sound principles of generic discrimination or combination. They set off
                    with alacrity, but were soon entangled in their own difficulties, and were left
                    by Linnaeus to answer themselves or each other. We here mention these learned
                    systematics; for learned they were thought by themselves and their pupils,
                    merely because they will scarcely require animadversion when we come to canvass
                    the great question of natural and artificial classification, they having had no
                    distinct ideas of a difference between the two. Hedwig used frequently to lament
                    that his preceptor Ludwig had never perfected his system of arrangement; but
                    from what he has given to the world, we see no great room to suppose that he had
                    any thing very excellent in reserve. Unexecuted projects are magnified in the
                    mists of uncertainty. We have ventured elsewhere, in a biographical account of
                    Hedwig, to remark, that even that ingenious man ‘ did not imbibe, under Ludwig,
                    anything of the true philosophical principles of arrangement, the talents for
                    which are granted to very few, and are scarcely ever of German growth. We mean
                    no invidious reflections on any nation or people. Each has its appropriate
                    merits, and all are useful together in science, like different characters on the
                    theatre of human life.’</p>
                <p>“Germany may well dispense with any laurels obtained by the very secondary merit
                    of speculative schemes of classification, when she can claim the honour of
                    having produced such a practical observer as Gaertner. This indefatigable
                    botanist devoted himself to the investigation of the fruits and seeds of plants.
                    Being eminently skilled in the use of the pencil, he has, like Hedwig,
                    faithfully recorded what he no less acutely detected. The path he struck out for
                    himself, of delineating and describing in detail, with magnified dissections,
                    every part of the seed and seed-vessel of each genus within his reach, had never
                    been explored before in so regular and methodical a manner. Botanists of the
                    Linnaean school are justly censuJ ’ rable for having paid too little attention
                    to the structure of these important parts, in their generic characters. Indeed
                    it may be said, that if they were able to establish good genera without them,
                    and, after the example of their leader, merely preferred the more obvious and
                    distinct organs, when sufficient for their purpose, their conduct was
                    justifiable. If generic principles be natural and certain, it matters not on
                    what parts of the fructification they are founded; nor is the inflorescence, or
                    even the herb or root, rejected by sound philosophers, but because they are
                    found to lead only to unnatural and uncertain characters. -It is therefore
                    extremely to the honour of Linnaeus, Gaertner, and Jussieu, that their
                    conceptions of genera are almost entirely the same. They meet in almost every
                    point, however different the paths by which they pursue their inquiries. Their
                    labours illustrate and confirm each other. Even Tournefort, who conceived so
                    well, on the whole, the distinctions of genera, which he could but ill define,
                    receives new strength from their knowledge, which does not overturn his
                    imperfect performances, but improve them. The accurate student of natural genera
                    cannot fail to perceive, that where Gaertner differs from Linnaeus, which is but
                    in a very few material instances, such as his numerous subdivision of the genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Furnaria,</hi> and his distribution<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193734116" xml:id="kp-eb0705-4116-0081"/> of the compound flowers, it
                    arises from his too intent and exclusive consideration of one part of the
                    fructification, instead of an enlarged and comprehensive view of the whole. In
                    other words, he neglects the Linnaean maxim, that ‘ the genus should give the
                    character, not the character the genus.’ Such at least appears to us the case in
                    <hi rend="italic">Fumaria.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Most modern botanists view the Linnaean genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Fumaria</hi> as a natural order, and have therefore properly
                    adopted Gaertner’s divisions as distinct genera.</p></note> In the syngenesious
                    family, being so very natural in itself, the discrimination of natural genera
                    becomes in consequence so difficult, that Gaertner and Linnaeus may well be
                    excused if they do not entirely agree; and they perhaps may both be satisfied
                    with the honour of having collected materials, and disposed them in different
                    points of view, for the use of some future systematist, who may decide between
                    them. However exact Gaertner may have been in discriminating the parts of seeds,
                    we believe him to have been mistaken in distinguishing the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vitellus</hi> as a separate organ, distinct in functions from the <hi
                    rend="italic">cotyledons.</hi> His readers will also do well, while they profit
                    by his generally excellent principles, not to admit any of his rules as
                    absolute. They may serve as a clue to the intricacies of nature, but they must
                    not overrule her laws. Still less is our great carpologist to be implicitly
                    followed in physiological doctrines or reasonings; witness his feeble and
                    incorrect attack on Hedwig’s opinions, or rather demonstrations, respecting the
                    impregnation of Mosses. His criticisms of Linnaeus are not always marked with
                    that candour which becomes a disinterested lover of truth and nature; nor can we
                    applaud in general his change’s of nomenclature or of terminology, especially
                    when he unphilosophically calls the <hi rend="italic">germen</hi> of Linnaeus
                    the <hi rend="italic">ovarium,</hi> a word long ago rejected, as erroneous when
                    applied to plants.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    last as long as scientific botany is cultivated at all. Botanists can now no
                    longer neglect, except at their own peril, the parts which Gaertner has called
                    into notice, and to the scrutiny of which, directed by his faithful guidance,
                    the physiologist and the systematist must often in future recur.</p>
                <p>“We shall close this part of our subject with the mention of the Berlin school,
                    where Gleditsch, who, in 1740, repelled the attacks of Siegesbeck on Linnaeus,
                    was professor, and published a botanical system, founded on the situation, or
                    insertion, of the stamens; the subordinate divisions being taken from the number
                    of the same parts; so that it is, in the latter respect, a sort of inversion of
                    the Linnaean method. In the former, or the outline of its plan, the system of
                    Gleditsch is in some measure an anticipation of that of Jussieu. Berlin has of
                    late been much distinguished for the study of natural history, and possesses a
                    society of its own, devoted to that pursuit. Its greatest ornament was the late
                    Professor Willdenow, who, if he fell under the lash of the more accurate
                    Afzelius, is entitled to the gratitude of his fellow-labourers, not for
                    theoretical speculations, but for the useful and arduous undertaking of a <hi
                    rend="italic">Species Plantarum,</hi> on the Linnaean plan, being indeed an
                    edition of the same work of Linnaeus, enriched with recent discoveries. This
                    book, left unfinished at the end of the first order of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cryptogamia,</hi> by the death of the editor, wants only a general index to
                    render it sufficiently complete. The <hi rend="italic">Musei, Lichenes,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Pungi,</hi> are systematically treated in the separate works
                    of writers devoted to those particular, and now very extensive, subjects, from
                    whom Willdenow could only have been a compiler. With the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pilices,</hi> which he lived to publish, he was practically conversant. His
                    insertion of the essential generic characters, throughout these volumes, is a
                    useful addition, and has now become necessary in every similar undertaking.</p>
                <p>“Little can be said of Holland in this review of the botanical state of Europe
                    for a few years past. The Leyden garden has always been kept up, especially
                    during the life of the late Professor David Van Royen, with due care and
                    attention: we know little of its fate in the subsequent convulsed state of the
                    country. Botany has long been on the decline at Amsterdam, though we are
                    indebted to that garden for having first received, and afterwards communicated
                    to other countries, such acquisitions of Thunberg in Japan as escaped the perils
                    of importation.</p>
                <p>“The botany of Switzerland may, most commodiously, be considered in the next
                    place. Here, in his native country, the great Haller, after a long residence at
                    Göttingen, was finally established. Its rich and charming <hi rend="italic"
                    >Flora</hi> has been illustrated by his classical pen, with peculiar success.
                    Everybody is conversant with the second edition of his work, published in 1768,
                    in three volumes folio, and entitled <hi rend="italic">Historia Stirpuim
                    Indigenarum Helvetice,</hi> with its inimitable engravings, of the <hi

                    laboured with some attention at the botany of Switzerland, are aware of the
                    superior value, in point of accuracy, of the original edition of the same work,
                    published in 1742, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Enumeratio Methodica
                    Stirpium Helvetice Indigenarum.</hi> This edition is indispensable to those who
                    wish fully to understand the subject, or to appreciate Haller’s transcendent
                    knowledge and abilities. These works are classed after a system of his own,
                    intended to be more consonant with nature than the Linnaean sexual method. We
                    can scarcely say that it is so, on the whole; nor is it, on the other hand,
                    constructed according to any uniformity of plan. The number of the stamens,
                    compared with that of the segments of the corolla, or its petals, regulate the
                    characters of several classes, and these are artificial. Others arc assumed as
                    natural, and are for the most part really so; but their characters are
                    frequently taken from Linnaeus, even from his artificial system, as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cruciatae</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Apetalce.</hi> Lord Bute
                    has well said, that Haller was a Linnaean in disguise. His classification,
                    however, was merely intended to answer his own purpose with respect to the Swiss
                    plants; for he was not a general botanist, nor had he a sufficiently
                    comprehensive view of the subject to form a general system, or even to be aware
                    of the difficulties of such an undertaking. He ought not therefore to be
                    obnoxious to criticism in that view. His method has served for the use of his
                    scholars, as the Linnaean one serves English botanists, by way of a dictionary.
                    Some such is necessary; and those who should begin to decide on the merits of a
                    system, before they know plants, would most assuredly be in danger of appearing
                    more learned to themselves than to others. We cannot exculpate Haller from some
                    degree of prejudice in rejecting real improvements of Linnaeus, which are
                    independent of classification; such as his trivial or specific names, by which
                    every species is spoken of at once, in one word, mostly so contrived as to
                    assist the memory, by an indication of the character, appearance, history, or
                    use, of the plant. What did the great Swiss botanist substitute instead of this
                    contrivance? A series of numbers, bur-thensome to the memory, destitute of
                    information, accommodated to his own book only, and necessarily Hable to <pb

                    the introduction of every newly-discovered species! At the same time that he
                    rejected the luminous nomenclature of his old friend and fellow-student., who
                    had laboured in the most ingenuous terms to deprecate his jealousy, he paid a
                    tacit homage to its merit, by contending that the honour of this invention was
                    due to Rivinus. In this he was not less incorrect than uncandid, the short names
                    of Rivinus being designed as specific characters, for which purpose Haller knew,
                    as well as Linnaeus, that they were unfit. Useful specific characters he himself
                    constructed on the plan of Linnaeus, with some little variation, not always
                    perhaps for the better as to strictness of principle, but often strikingly
                    expressive. Here, as in every thing connected with practical botany, he shines.
                    The most rigid Linnaean, whose soul is not entirely shrivelled up with dry
                    aphorisms and prejudice, must love Haller for his taste and enthusiasm, and the
                    Flora of Switzerland as much for his sake as its own. No wonder that his pupils
                    multiplied, and formed a band of enthusiasts, tenacious of even the
                    imperfections of their master. The line of demarcation is now no longer
                    distinctly drawn between them and the equally zealous scholars of the northern
                    sage. The amiable and lamented Davall strove to profit by the labours of both.
                    The Alpine botanists of France and Italy have served to amalgamate the Swedish
                    and the Helvetian schools. The. Flora of Dauphine by Villars is nearly Linnaean
                    in system; and the principles of the veteran Bellardi of Turin are entirely so,
                    though, in some of his publications, he has been obliged to conform to the
                    method of his preceptor, the venerable Allioni, who, in spite of all
                    remonstrance, had the ambition of forming a system of his own. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Flora Pedemontana</hi> is disposed according to this system; an
                    unnatural and inconvenient jumble of the ideas of Rivinus, Tournefort, and
                    others. This work is also faulty in the neglect of specific definitions, so that
                    its plates and occasional descriptions are alone what render it useful; nor
                    would it, perhaps, be consulted at all, but for the uncommon abundance of rare
                    species. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>“We may glance over the botany of Italy, to whose boundaries we have thus been
                    insensibly led, as the traveller takes a bird’s-eye view of its outstretched
                    plains from the lofty summits of the Alps. We may pass from Turin to Naples
                    without meeting with any school of distinction. The northern states are not
                    without their professors and patrons of botany; nor are their nobles destitute
                    of taste, in various branches of natural knowledge. The names of a Castiglione
                    of Milan, a Durazzo and Dinegro of Genoa, and a Savi of Pisa, deserve to be
                    mentioned with honour, for their knowledge and their zeal. The unfortunate
                    Cyrillo, and his friend Pacifico of Naples, were practical botanists. There is
                    also a rising school, of great promise, at Palermo. But since the time of
                    Scopoli, Italy has contributed little to our stock of information; nor are the
                    latter publications of this eminent man, while he resided at Pavia, commensurate
                    in importance or njerit with those earlier ones, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Flora</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Ento∙ mologia Carniolica,</hi> which have
                    immortalized his name. Scopoli, who at first adopted a system of his own, had
                    the sense and liberality, in his second edition, to resign it in favour of what
                    his maturer experience taught him to prefer, the sexual system of Linnaeus. <hi

                <p>« Spain and Portugal claim our attention; the former for being the channel
                    through which the gardens of Europe have, for some years past, been enriched
                    with many new Mexican and Peruvian plants, and likewise as the theatre of the
                    publication of some important books relative to the botany of those countries.
                    In speaking of American botany, we have mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Flora
                    Peruviana,</hi> the authors of which, Ruiz and Pa von; rank deservedly high for
                    their industry and knowledge. The late Cavanilles, resident at Madrid, has also
                    communicated to the learned world much information, from the same source. Spain
                    seems anxious to redeem her reputation, which suffered so much from the neglect,
                    or rather persecution, of the truly excellent but unfortunate Dombey, who, like
                    many other benefactors of mankind, was allowed to make all his exertions in
                    vain, and finally perished unknown, in the diabolical hands of English
                    slave-dealers at Montserrat. <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> Portugal is most
                    distinguished at home by the labours of a learned bénédictine, Dr Felix Avellar
                    Brotero, author of a <hi rend="italic">Flora Lusita-nica,</hi> disposed after
                    the Linnaean method, reduced entirely to principles of number; and abroad by the
                    valuable work of Father Loureiro, entitled <hi rend="italic">Flora
                    Cochinchi-nensis,</hi> in which the plants of Cochin-China, and of the
                    neighbourhood of Canton, are classed and defined in the Linnaean manner, with
                    valuable descriptions and remarks. It is undoubtedly a disgrace to the
                    possessors of such a country as Brazil, that they have not derived from thence
                    more benefit to the world or to themselves from its natural productions. But
                    they are satisfied with what the bowels of the earth afford, and they neglect
                    its more accessible, though perhaps not less valuable treasures. The jealousy
                    and innumerable restrictions.of their government render what they possess as
                    useless to all the world as to themselves. A genius of the first rank in natural
                    science, as well as in every thing which his capacious mind embraced, has arisen
                    in Portugal, and has been domesticated in the schools of Paris and London, the
                    amiable and learned Correa de Serra. What little impulse has been given to
                    literature in Portugal, and particularly the foundation of a Royal Academy of
                    Sciences, is owing to him; and though his name has chiefly appeared in the ranks
                    of botanical science in an incidental manner, no one possesses more enlarged and
                    accurate views, or more profound knowledge, of the subject.</p>
                <p>“In the extensive, though incomplete, review which we have undertaken of the
                    recent history of botanical science, the individual merits of particular writers
                    have chiefly hitherto been detailed and compared. The most difficult part of our
                    task perhaps still remains, namely, to contrast and appreciate the influence and
                    the merits of two great and rival nations, in the general school of scientific
                    botany; to consider the causes that have led to the particular line which each
                    has taken; and to compare the success, as well as to calculate the probable
                    future consequences, of their respective aims. England and France have, from the
                    time of Ray and Tournefort, been competitors in botanical fame, because each was
                    ambitious of supporting the credit of the great man she had produced. This
                    contest, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Geneva is celebrated at the present day
                    as the residence of Professor De Candolle. This distinguished botanist, in
                    addition to many other works of scarcely inferior merit, published, in 1818 vol.

                    his collections, including what he had amassed for years with a view to publish
                    a Flora of Spain, entirely destroyed, and been obliged himself to take refuge in

                <p>however, as far as it regarded theoretical speculations, has entirely subsided on
                    the part of Ray’s champions. In practical science, likewise, the admirers of Ray
                    and of Tournefort have shaken hands, like those of every other school. On the
                    subject of system, the question is greatly changed; for though a phoenix has
                    arisen from the ashes of Tournefort, its ‘ star-like eyes,’ darting far beyond
                    all former competition, have been met, if not dazzled, by a new light, rising in
                    full glory from the north; a polar star, which has been hailed by all the
                    nations of the earth.</p>
                <p>“The Linnaean system of classification, with all its concomitant advantages of
                    nomenclature, luminous technical definition, and richness of information, was
                    planted, like a fresh and vigorous scion, in the favourable soil of England,
                    already fertilized with accumulations of practical knowledge, about the middle
                    of the last century. If we may pursue the metaphor, the ground was entirely
                    cleared for its reception; for all previous systems had been of confined and
                    local use, the alphabetical index having become the resource of even the most
                    learned, and the pupils of Ray being held to his method of classification rather
                    by their gratitude for his practical instruction, than any other consideration.
                    Accordingly we have, in our own early progress, before they were all, as at
                    present, swept off the stage, found them rather contending for his nomenclature,
                    imperfect as it was, because they were habituated to it, than for his system, of
                    which it was evident they had made little use. Hence the first attempt in
                    England to reduce our plants to Linnaean order, made by Hill, was chiefly a
                    transposition of Ray’s <hi rend="italic">Synopsis</hi> into the Linnaean
                    classes; the original nomenclature being retained, while the specific names of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Species Plantarum</hi> were rejected.</p>
                <p>“Hill’s imperfect performance was superseded by the more classical <hi
                    rend="italic">Flora Anglica</hi> of Hudson, composed under the auspices and
                    advice of the learned and ingenious Stillingfleet, in which the botany of
                    England assumed a most scientific aspect, and with which all the knowledge of
                    Ray was incorporated. At the same time, the principles of theoretical botany,
                    and the philosophical writings of the learned Swede, were studied with no
                    ordinary powers of discrimination and judgment, in a small circle of experienced
                    observers at Norwich. A love of flowers, and a great degree of skill in their
                    cultivation, had been long ago imported into that ancient commercial city, with
                    its worsted manufacture, from Flanders; and out of this taste something like the
                    study of systematic botany had sprung. These pursuits were mostly confined to
                    the humblest of the community, particularly among the then very numerous bodies
                    of journeymen weavers, dyers, and other artisans of a similar description.
                    Towards the middle of the eighteenth century, several of the opulent merchants
                    seem to have acquired, by their intimate connection with Holland, not only the
                    above-mentioned taste for horticulture, but likewise an ambition to be
                    distinguished by their museums of natural curiosities. The former sometimes
                    extended itself, from the flowery parterre and the well-arranged rows of tulips,
                    hyacinths, carnations, and auriculas, into no less formal labyrinths, or perhaps
                    a double pattern of angular or spiral walks, between clipped hedges, exactly
                    alike on each side of a broad gravel walk. Such was the most sublime effort of
                    the art within the compass of our recollection. “Grove” could by no means be
                    said to “nod at grove,” for the perpendicular and well-trimmed structure was
                    incapable of nodding; but that “each alley should have a brother” was an
                    indispensable part of the design. Greenhouses of exotic plants, except oranges
                    and myrtles, were at this time scarcely known; and the writer well recollects
                    having seen, with wonder and admiration, above forty years ago, one of the first
                    African geraniums that ever bloomed in Norwich. If, however, the progress of
                    natural science was slow in this angle of the kingdom, the wealthy
                    manufacturers, become their own merchants, found it necessary to acquire a
                    knowledge of various foreign languages, in order to carry on their wide-extended
                    commerce. In learning French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, and German, they
                    unavoidably acquired many new ideas. Their sons were sent to the continent, and
                    it were hard, indeed, if many of them did not bring home much that was worth
                    learning. The society of the place, aided by some concomitant circumstances, and
                    the adventitious acquisition of two or three men of singular talents and
                    accomplishments, became improved. A happy mixture of literature and taste for
                    many years distinguished this city above its rivals in opulence and commercial
                    prosperity. Such Norwich has been in our memory; and if its splendour be gone
                    by, a taste for mental cultivation, originating in many of the before-mentioned
                    causes, still remains, and is fostered by the novel pursuits of chemistry and
                    natural history, on which some arts of great importance in the manufactory of
                    the place depend for improvement. We trust the reader will pardon this
                    digression from the subject more immediately before us, to which we shall now
                    return.</p>
                <p>“Some of the more learned students of English plants, among the lovers of botany

                    ardour and friendly assistance, the first rudiments of a pursuit that has proved
                    the happiness and the principal object of his life.</p>
                <p>“London became, of course, the focus of this science, as. well as of every other.
                    Of the English universities, Cam- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> bridge most
                    fulfilled its duty, in rendering its public establishments useful to the ends
                    for which they were founded ' and paid. The names of Martyn, both father and
                    son, have long maintained a distinguished rank in botany; and the latter, for
                    many years, has inculcated the true principles of Linnaean science, from the
                    professor’s chair. A botanic garden was established by a private individual, Dr
                    Walker, about the period of which we are speaking. A Linnaean <hi rend="italic"
                    >Flora Cantabrigiensis,</hi> by Mr Relhan, has renewed the celebrity of that
                    field in which Ray had formerly laboured; and there has always existed a little
                    community of Cambridge botanists, though fluctuating and varying, according to
                    circumstances. At Oxford, botany, so vigorously established by Sherard and
                    Dillenius, slept for forty years under the auspices of the elder Professor
                    Sibthorp, at least as to the utility of its public foundations. Yet even there
                    the science had many individual cultivators, and if others were forgotten, the
                    name of a Banks ought to render this school for ever celebrated. The younger
                    Professor Sibthorp well atoned for the supineness of his father and predecessor.
                    He published a <hi rend="italic">Flora Oxoniensis,</hi> and extended his
                    inquiries into the classical scenes of Greece, finally sacrificing his life to
                    his labours, and sealing his love of this engaging study by a posthumous
                    foundation, which provides for the publication of a sumptuous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Flora Graxa,</hi> and the subsequent establishment of a professorship of rural
                    economy. Edinburgh, under the auspices<pb break="no" facs="nls:193734155"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-4155-0084"/> of Professor Hope, became distinguished for the
                    cultivation of botany as a branch of medical education. The physiology of plants
                    was there taught more assiduously than in almost any other university of Europe;
                    and the Linnaean principles were ably enforced and illustrated, not with slavish
                    devotion, but with enlightened discrimination. Nor must the dissenting academy
                    at Warrington be forgotten, where the distinguished circumnavigator Forster, of
                    whom we have already spoken, was settled. Here many young naturalists were
                    trained. The neighbouring family of the Blackburnes, possessed even to this day
                    of one of the oldest and richest botanic gardens in England, have steadily
                    fostered this and other branches of natural knowledge. The same taste has spread
                    to Manchester, Liverpool, and the country around. Westmoreland, Northumberland,
                    and Durham, have their sequestered practical botanists in every rank of life.
                    Scenes celebrated by the correspondents of Ray are still the favourite haunts of
                    these lovers of nature and science, who every day add something to our
                    information, and to the celebrity of other parts of the same neighbourhood.</p>
                <p>“We must now concentrate our attention to the London school, which for about
                    forty years past has maintained a rank superior to most other seats of botanical
                    science; the more so perhaps from its being founded in total disinterestedness,
                    both with respect to authority and emolument. Truth alone, not system, has been
                    the leading object of this school; unbiassed and gratuitous patronage its
                    support; and a genuine love of nature and of knowledge its bond of union, among
                    persons not less distinguished from each other by character and opinion, than by
                    their different pursuits and various ranks of life. The illustrious Banks, from
                    the time when, after his return from his celebrated and adventurous voyage, he
                    devoted himself to the practical cultivation of natural science for the
                    advantage of others, as he had long pursued it for his own pleasure and
                    instruction, has been the head of this school. Here he fixed the amiable and
                    learned Solander, for the remainder of his too short life. The house of this
                    liberal Mecaenas has ever since been, not only open, but in a manner at the
                    entire command of the cultivators and admirers of this and other branches of
                    philosophy; inasmuch as his library and museum have been devoted to their free
                    use; and* his own assistance, encouragement, and information are as much at
                    their service as if his fortune and fame had all along depended on their favour.
                    With such an establishment as this, aided by the perpetual resources of the
                    numerous public and private gardens around, botany might well flourish. The
                    liberal spirit of the leaders of this pursuit gave a tone to the whole. The
                    owners of nurseries, though depending on pecuniary emolument for their support,
                    rivalled each other in disinterested communication. The improvement of the
                    science was the leading object of all. One of this latter description took his
                    rank among the literary teachers of botany. Lee’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introduction</hi> was much approved by Linnaeus, whose system and principles it
                    ably exemplifies, and who became the friend and correspondent of its author.
                    Travelling botanists were dispatched under the patronage of the affluent to
                    enrich our gardens from the Alps, the Cape of Good Hope, and the various parts
                    of America. Every new acquisition was scrutinized, and received its allotted
                    name and distinction from the hand of the correct and classical Solander, who
                    one day was admiring with Collinson, Fothergill, or Pitcairn, the treasures of
                    their respective gardens, and another labouring with the distinguished Ellis, at
                    the more abstruse determination of the intricate family of marine productions,
                    whether sea-weeds, corallines, or shells. His own acquisitions, and those of his
                    friend and patron, in the fairy land of the South Sea Islands, the hazardous
                    shores <hi rend="italic">of New</hi> Holland, or the nearly fatal groves and
                    swamps of Java, were at the same time recorded by his pen, as they were
                    gradually perpetuating by the slow labours of the engraver. To this band of
                    zealous naturalists the younger Linnaeus was for a while associated, as well as
                    the excellent and zealous Broussonet, who, though not unversed in botany,
                    devoted himself most particularly to the more uncommon pursuit of scientific
                    ichthyology.</p>
                <p>“The Banksian school, altogether intent upon practical botany, had adopted the
                    Linnaean system as the most commodious, while it pursued and cultivated the
                    Linnaean principles as the only ones which, by their transcendent excellence,
                    could support the science of botany on <hi rend="italic">a</hi> stable
                    foundation. In these Dr Solander was, of course, well trained; and, having added
                    so wide a range of experience to his theoretical education, few botanists could
                    vie with him, who had, as it were, caught his preceptor’s mantle, and imbibed,
                    by a sort of inspiration, a peculiar talent for concise and clear definition.
                    Abstract principles of classification, or even such outlines of natural
                    arrangement as Linnaeus had promulgated, seem never to have attracted Solander.
                    In following the chain of his ideas, discernible in the materials he has left
                    behind him, one cannot but remark his singular inattention to every thing like
                    botanical affinity, to which the artificial sexual system was, with him,
                    entirely paramount. The genera which, for extemporaneous use, he named with the
                    termination <hi rend="italic">oides,</hi> comparing each with some well-known
                    genus, till a proper appellation could be selected, are seldom thus compared
                    because of any natural affinity, or even any external resemblance, but because
                    they agree with such in their place in the artificial system, or nearly perhaps
                    in technical characters. A great botanist, therefore, it is evident, may exist,
                    without that vaunted erudition in a peculiar line, which some would have us
                    consider as the only road to knowledge and to fame. We allow that this sort of
                    erudition is now, since the attention it has received from Linnaeus, Jussieu,
                    and others, become as indispensable to a good theoretical or philosophical
                    botanist, as is the study of carpology, in consequence of the labours of
                    Gaertner; we only contend that it is possible to know plants extremely well
                    without either.</p>
                <p>“The learned Dryander, less skilled than his predecessor the coadjutor of Sir
                    Joseph Banks, in a practical acquaintance with plants, exceeded him in
                    theoretical lore and ingenious speculation, and far excelled every other man in
                    bibliographic information, as well as in the most precise and fastidious
                    exactness relative to every subject within the wide extent of his various
                    knowledge. He furthered, upon principle, and with unwearied assiduity, every
                    object of the noble establishment to which he was devoted; but, like Solander,
                    he now sleeps with his fathers, and his place is supplied by a genius of British
                    growth, who unites talents with experience, and theoretical skill, in the most
                    eminent degree, with practical knowledge.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Since the death of Sir Joseph, his library and herbarium
                    have been deposited in the British Museum, where Mr Brown, to whom Sir James
                    here alludes, has still the unqualified charge of them.</p></note></p>
                <p>“Although it is almost superfluous to name the most eminent disciples of the
                    London school of botany, it might seem negligent to pass them over without some
                    particular mention. The ardent and ingenious Curtis has left a permanent
                    monument behind him, in the <hi rend="italic">Flora Londinensis,</hi> to say
                    nothing of the popular <hi rend="italic">Botanical Magazine,</hi> continued <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193734168" xml:id="kp-eb0705-4168-0085"/> by his friend Dr
                    Sims. The <hi rend="italic">Flora Scotica</hi> of Lightfoot first offered, in a
                    pleasing and familiar garb, the botanical riches of that part of the island to
                    its southern inhabitants. The lynx-eyed Dickson, so long and faithfully attached
                    to his constant patron, has steadily traced, through all its windings, the
                    obscure path of cryptogamie botany with peculiar success. No more striking
                    instance can be pointed out, to prove how totally the most consummate practical
                    skill, even in the most difficult part of botany, is independent of theoretical
                    learning. Even those who profit by the certain aids supplied by the discoveries
                    of Hedwig, can with difficulty keep pace with this veteran in their pursuits,
                    who, with conscious independence, neglects all those aids.</p>
                <p>“Just at the time when the school, whose history we are endeavouring to trace,
                    had most firmly established its credit and its utility, a great additional
                    weight was given to England, in the scale of natural science, by the acquisition
                    of the entire museum, library, and manuscripts of the great Linnaeus and his
                    son, which came amongst us, by private purchase, in 1784, after the death of the
                    latter. Hence our nomenclature has been corrected, and our knowledge greatly
                    augmented. These collections have necessarily been consulted by most persons
                    about to publish on the subject of natural history, and a reference to them, in
                    doubtful cases, secures a general conformity of sentiment and nomenclature among
                    the botanists of Europe, Asia, and America. We are seldom obliged to waste time
                    in conjecturing what Linnaeus, or the botanists with whom he corresponded,
                    meant, for we have before us their original specimens, named by their own hands.
                    An entire London winter was devoted to the almost daily labour of comparing the
                    Banksian herbarium throughout, with that of Linnaeus, and to a copious
                    interchange of specimens between their respective possessors, who, with the aid
                    of Mr Dryander alone, accomplished this interesting and instructive comparison.
                    Hence the <hi rend="italic">Hortus Kewensis</hi> of the lamented Alton, which
                    was at that period preparing for publication, became much more correct in its
                    names, than it, or any other similar performance, could have been, without this
                    advantage. It could scarcely be expected that Sweden would, unmoved, let the
                    botanical sceptre thus pass from her; but it is much to the honour of the
                    nation, that all her naturalists have ever preserved the most friendly
                    intercourse with us, particularly with the person who deprived them of this
                    treasure. They have not merely pardoned, but publicly sanctioned, the scientific
                    zeal which prompted him to this acquisition, by associating him with all their
                    learned establishments, without any solicitation on his part.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It may not, perhaps, be
                    generally known, that Sir James Smith himself was the purchaser. Since his death
                    it has become the property of the Linnaean Society of London, along with all his
                    private collections and library.</p></note></p>
                <p>“The institution of the Linnaean Society at London in 1788, especially under that
                    name, must be considered as a triumph for Sweden in her turn. By this
                    establishment the intercourse of science is facilitated; essays, which might
                    otherwise have never seen the light, are given to the world; and a general taste
                    for the pleasing study of nature is promoted. Learned and worthy people are thus
                    made acquainted with each other, from the remotest corners of the kingdom, and
                    their information enriches the common stock. The state has given its sanction to
                    this rising establishment. Its publications and its members are spread over the
                    Continent, and other similar institutions have borrowed its name, imitated its
                    plan, and paid respect to its authority. Yet it is not in the name alone of
                    Linnaeus, that the members of this society place their confidence; still less do
                    they bow to that name, or to any other, at the expense of their own right of
                    private judgment. Their transactions are open to the pupils of every school, and
                    the observations of every critic, that have any prospect of being useful to the
                    world. The writer of each communication must, of course, be answerable for the
                    particulars of his own performance, but the society is responsible for each
                    being, on the whole, worthy to be communicated to the public. The possession of
                    the very materials with which Linnaeus worked, his own specimens and notes,
                    enables us very often to correct mistakes, even of that great man, many of which
                    would be unaccountable without the means of thus tracing each to its source. At
                    the same time, the acquisition of materials to which he never had access, tends
                    to improve and augment the history of what he had left imperfect. His language,
                    his definitions and characters, were, for some time, held so sacred, that they
                    were implicitly copied, even though manifestly inapplicable, in some points, to
                    the objects to which they were referred. Synonyms were transcribed from his
                    works by Rose, Hudson, Curtis, and even Gaertner (we assert it on the positive
                    proof of errors of the press, copied in the transcribing), without reference to
                    the original books, to see whether such synonyms, or their accompanying plates,
                    agreed with the plant under consideration. The example of Dr Solander first led
                    the writer of this to avoid such a negligent and unfaithful mode of proceeding;
                    yet he has ever considered as sacred the very words of Linnaeus, where they
                    require no correction. They are become a kind of public property, the current
                    coin of the botanical realm, which ought not, with impunity, to be falsified or
                    adulterated. To them we hope to be pardoned if we apply the words of the
                    poet,</p>

                </lg>
                <p>Of this it is needless to quote examples. We must be every day more and more
                    sensible of the value of the Linnaean style, in proportion as the number of
                    those who can attain it is evidently so very small. By the light of our master
                    alone can the science, which he so greatly advanced and refined, be preserved
                    from barbarism, while long and tedious, loose and feeble, ill-contrasted and
                    barbarously-worded definitions, press upon it from various quarters. New terms
                    are invented to express old ideas; names and characters are changed for the
                    worse, to conceal’the want of new discoveries; and students are often deterred
                    from adopting real improvements, because they know not which guide to
                    prefer.</p>
                <p>“From the combined effects of the various causes which we have endeavoured to
                    trace, the study of botany in England has, for a long period, been almost
                    entirely practical. To determine the particular species intended, in every case,
                    by Linnaeus; to distinguish and to describe new ones; to improve scientific
                    characters, and to correct synonyms; these have been the objects of our writers;
                    and hence many publications of great utility, especially a number of critical
                    and descriptive essays, in the Transactions of the Linnaean Society, not
                    unworthy of the school which gave them birth, have enriched the general stock of
                    knowledge. These are the sound fruits of skill and investigation, the solid
                    advantages of real information, applied to practical use. They are independent
                    of theoretical speculation, and will stand unshaken, amidst any possible changes
                    of system. On such principles the <hi rend="italic">Flora Britannica</hi> has
                    been attempted, and continued as far as the present unsettled state of some of
                    the latter orders, of the last class, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193734181"

                    systematic discrimination, among the Lichens especially, it is hoped will soon
                    be removed. Meanwhile the <hi rend="italic">English Botany</hi> of the same
                    writer, illustrated by Mr Sowerby’s expressive and scientific figures, has
                    finished its course, and formed so nearly complete a body of local botany, as,
                    we believe, no other country has produced. In this the liberal contributions of
                    numerous skilful observers, from the Alpine heights of Scotland to the shores
                    and circumambient ocean of the south, are preserved and recorded; evincing a
                    degree of general inquiry and acuteness, which hardly any nation can rival. The
                    memory of several benefactors to the science, otherwise in danger of passing
                    away, is embalmed in this national work, which serves at once as their botanical
                    testament, and the monument of their fame. Some of our botanists of the present
                    day have thrown great light on several of the most obscure departments of the
                    science; witness Mr Sowerby’s work on <hi rend="italic">English Fungi;</hi> the
                    labours of the learned Bishop of Carlisle on <hi rend="italic">Carices,</hi>

                    likewise, who equally deserve notice, although they be not gifted with the use
                    of the pencil: Mr David Don has contributed much to the page of botany, but who
                    has not heard of Mr Robert Brown, “<hi rend="italic">Botanicoum facile princeps
                    ?”</hi></p></note> Nor shall the contributions of a Winch or an Abbot, a
                    Withering, Knapp, Stackhouse, or Velley, nor the more splendid labours of the
                    indefatigable Lambert, be forgotten. Each, in one way or other, has enlarged the
                    bounds of science, or rendered it easier of access. We cannot, in the compass of
                    our present undertaking, pay the tribute due to every individual, our aim being
                    a general picture of the whole. From what we have said, the zeal with which this
                    lovely science has been cultivated in England, will sufficiently appear. Nor
                    have public lectures or botanic gardens been neglected, in order to render the
                    knowledge of botany as accessible as possible, and to diffuse a taste for its
                    pursuit. The popularity of the study has, at least, kept pace with the means of
                    instruction. The garden and green-house, the woods, fields, and even the
                    concealed treasures of the waters, are now the resource of the young and the
                    elegant, who, in the enjoyment of a new sense as it were, in the retirement of
                    the country, imbibe health, as well as knowledge and taste, at the purest of all
                    sources.</p>
                <p>“France alone now remains to be considered, in order to finish the historical
                    picture which we have undertaken of the state of botanical science in Europe. To
                    do justice to this part of our subject, we must turn our attention to times long
                    since gone by, or we shall scarcely render intelligible the state of affairs at
                    present.</p>
                <p>“The great Tournefort, by the force of his character, his general and particular
                    information, the charms of his pen, and the celebrity which his name gave to his
                    country, through the popularity of his botanical system, was so firmly
                    established, in the ideas of the French, as the <hi rend="italic">Grand
                    Monarque</hi> of botany, that they would have as soon allowed the greatness of
                    Louis XIV. to be questioned, as that of this distinguished philosopher. So
                    beneficial was this partiality, in some respects, that it gave an unprecedented
                    impulse and popularity to the science; so disadvantageous was it in others, that
                    it placed a formidable barrier in the way of all improvement. Vaillant, the able
                    and worthy pupil of Tournefort, has never been forgiven for speaking, on some
                    occasions, too freely of his master’s defects. Hence his own merit has been kept
                    in the back ground. The doctrine of the sexes of plants was discountenanced as
                    long as possible, because it was proved by Vaillant, after having been rejected
                    by Tournefort. Nevertheless, when the good seed of science is once sown, it can
                    hardly be totally suffocated by the impediments of prejudice and ignorant
                    partiality. Practical zeal sprung up by the side of speculative jealousy, and
                    the tares withered, while the profitable plants flourished. Some botanists
                    followed the steps of Tournefort to the Levant, exploring afresh those countries
                    which he has for ever rendered classic ground. Others visited America, which
                    they traversed in different directions. The indefatigable Plumier performed
                    three separate voyages to the western world; and though his discoveries have, in
                    a great measure, suffered shipwreck from tardy and imperfect patronage, as a
                    great part of his collections did by the accidents of nature, yet something of
                    value remains. His <hi rend="italic">Filices</hi> are enough to insure his
                    perpetual remembrance, and his <hi rend="italic">Nova Genera</hi> are the basis
                    of our knowledge of generic differences in West Indian plants. Most of all has
                    been distinguished, among the French botanists who succeeded the times of
                    Tournefort and Vaillant, the family of the Jussieus. One of these investigated
                    the prolific regions of Peru, and discovered some things which no succeeding
                    traveller has gathered. Other branches of this family, besides being eminent in
                    medical science and practice, have pursued the study of botany with no ordinary
                    success, on the most philosophical principles. Of these the most eminent are the
                    celebrated Bernard de Jussieu, the contemporary of the earlier days of Linnaeus;
                    and his nephew Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, the pride and the ruler of systematic
                    botany at present in France. The views and the performances of these great men
                    lead us to a new branch of our subject, which indeed we have had in our
                    contemplation from the beginning of this essay,—the exposition of the principles
                    of a natural scheme of botanical classification, as hinted, and imperfectly
                    sketched, by Linnaeus, and brought to the perfection of a regular system by the
                    Jussieus.</p>
                <p>“Previous to our entering on this detail, and the remarks to which it will give
                    rise, we must conclude all that belongs to the former part of our undertaking,
                    by giving some account of those botanists who have formed and maintained a
                    Linnaean school in France. We must shelter ourselves under the broad banner of
                    truth when we observe that these have, till very lately, been almost the only
                    French botanists that have supplied us with any practical information; and their
                    labours have been useful in proportion as they have commendably shaken off the
                    prejudices of their predecessors. Of this last proposition Duhamel is a witness,
                    though we may perhaps excite some surprise in classing him among Linnaean
                    botanists. FIis preface to his <hi rend="italic">Traité des Arbres</hi>
                    sufficiently shows how fearful he was of being taken for such, and yet how he
                    was held by vulgar prejudice alone, to the nomenclature, or rather the generical
                    opinions of Tournefort. He tells <pb break="no" facs="nls:193734194"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-4194-0087"/> us, while he adopts these, that his judgment went
                    with Linnaeus, whom he follows in all new discoveries. The plan of his book,
                    confined to hardy trees and shrubs, justifies his use of an alphabetical
                    arrangement, in preference to any system, unless he had thought sufficiently
                    well of Tournefort’s to prefer that. But he has prefixed to his work, as a
                    practical method of discovering scientifically what it contained, no other than
                    a sexual classification. His practical botany was so limited, being entirely
                    subservient to his great objects of forest planting and vegetable physiology,
                    that he had no attention to spare for the consideration of methodical systems.
                    Accordingly, he tells us, that some such is necessary for the use of botanists,
                    especially of those who explore the productions of foreign countries; but
                    whether the method of Ray, Tournefort, Boerhaave, Van-Royen, Linnaeus, or
                    Bernard de Jussieu be adopted, is of no importance. Six years before Duhamel’s
                    work came out, Dalibard had published, in 1749, his <hi rend="italic">Elorae
                    Parisiensis Prodromus,</hi> according to the Linnaean system.</p>
                <p>“It has always appeared to the writer of this, from the conversation and writings
                    of French botanists, that the judgment of the learned Le Monnier, and the
                    countenance of his patron the Duke d’Ayen, afterwards Maréchal de Noailles,
                    first established the reputation of Linnaeus in France; not so much possibly for
                    the sake of his system, as his discoveries, his commodious nomenclature, and his
                    clear principles of discrimination. When Le Monnier botanized in Chili, in the
                    company of the astronomers with whom he was associated, he soon found, like Dr
                    Garden in South Carolina, that the classification of Tournefort was no key to
                    the treasury of a new world. He however made his remarks and collections, and
                    studied them subsequently under the auspices of a more comprehensive guide. The
                    Maréchal de Noailles, a great cultivator of exotic trees and shrubs,
                    corresponded with the Swedish naturalist, and endeavoured to recommend him to
                    the notice of the lovers of plants in France. Meantime Gerard and Gouan in the
                    south, both introduced themselves to the illustrious Swede, and promulgated his
                    principles and discoveries, though only the latter adopted his classification.
                    Villars we have already noticed as the author of a Linnaean <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire des Plantes de Dauphine.</hi> He died lately, professor of botany at
                    Strasburg, where he succeeded the very able and philosophical Hermann, one of
                    the truest Linnaeans, who had imbibed all the technical style of the Swedish
                    school, as well as its accuracy of discrimination. We may now safely announce
                    Hermann as the real author, in conjunction perhaps with Baron Born, of that
                    ingenious but bitter satire the <hi rend="italic">monachologia,</hi> in which
                    the several <hi rend="italic">species</hi> of monks are affectedly
                    discriminated, and their manners detailed, like the animals in the Linnaean <hi
                    rend="italic">Systema Naturae.</hi> This ludicrous performance has long since
                    appeared in a not very exact English translation, and was rendered into French
                    by the late M. Broussonet. As we are led again to name this amiable man, too
                    soon lost to his country, after experiencing every vicissitude of revolutionary
                    peril and alarm, we cannot help distinguishing him as one most zealous in the
                    cultivation and diffusion of Linnaean learning, a taste for which he chiefly
                    imbibed in England. He had no indulgence for those prejudices which cramped the
                    talents of his countrymen, and prevented their deriving knowledge from any
                    quarter where it was to be had. He recommended the younger Linnaeus to their
                    personal acquaintance and favour; which service he also rendered, a few years
                    after, to the person who now commemorates his worth, and who will ever remember,
                    with affection and regret, his many virtues, his agreeable converse, and his
                    various and extensive acquirements.</p>
                <p>“The intimacy which subsisted between this enthusiastic naturalist and the
                    distinguished botanist ľHeritier, confirmed, if it did not originally implant,
                    in the mind of the latter, that strong bias which he ever showed for the
                    Linnaean principles of botany. According to these his numerous splendid works
                    are composed. He moreover imbibed, if we mistake not, from the same source, a
                    peculiar preference for uncoloured engravings of plants, instead of the coloured
                    ones which had long been in use. It cannot be denied that the merit of these
                    last is very various, and sometimes very small. They do, nevertheless, present
                    to the mind a more ready idea of each species, than a simple engraving can do,
                    nor is the latter less liable to incorrectness. When plates are taken from the
                    delineations of such exquisite artists as ľHeritier employed, they have a good
                    chance of excellence; but the engravings of Cavanilles, done after miserable
                    drawings, though they deceive the eye by their neat finishing, are really less
                    exact than many a rude outline. Coloured plates, if executed with the uniformity
                    and scientific exactness of Mr Sowerby’s, or the characteristic effect of
                    Jacquin’s, speak to the eye more readily than most engravings. The art of
                    printing in colours, practised formerly in England with small success, was
                    revived at Paris by Bulliard, and is carried to the highest perfection in the
                    recent publications of Redouté and Ventenat, which leave hardly any thing to be
                    wished for, with respect to beauty or exactness. Many of the works of ľHeritier
                    have remained imperfect, in consequence of the political convulsions of his
                    country and his own premature death. The learned and worthy Desfontaines, who
                    travelled in Barbary, has been more fortunate in the completion of his labours.
                    His elegant <hi rend="italic">Flora Atlantica,</hi> in 2 vols. 4to, with finely
                    engraved uncoloured plates, is classed and modelled on the plan of the Linnaean
                    school. Such also is the plan of the works of that distinguished botanist
                    Labillardière, who, besides his account of New Holland plants, has published
                    five elegant <hi rend="italic">decades</hi> of new species from Syria. That
                    scientific horticulturist Μ. Thouin, likewise a most excellent botanist, though
                    he has scarcely written on the subject, is a correct pupil of the Swedish
                    school. His general spirit of liberal communication, and his personal attachment
                    to the younger Linnaeus, led him to enrich the herbarium of the latter with the
                    choicest specimens of Commcrson’s great jcollection, destined otherwise to have
                    remained in almost entire oblivion. A singular fate has attended the discoveries
                    of most of the French voyagers, such as Commerson, Sonnerat, and Dombey, that,
                    from one cause or other, they have scarcely seen the light. So also it has
                    happened to those of Tournefort, Sarrazin, Plumier, and others, whose
                    acquisitions have long slept in the Parisian museums. Happily there seems to
                    have arisen of late a commendable desire to render them useful by publication,
                    and thus many fine plants, known merely by the slight antl unscientific
                    appellations of Tournefort, and therefore never adopted by Linnaeus, have
                    recently been clearly defined, or elegantly delineated. The journeys of Olivier
                    and Michaux towards the east have enriched the Paris gardens, and been the means
                    of restoring several lost Tournefortian plants. We believe however that the
                    English nurseries have proved the most fertile source of augmentation to the
                    French collections, as appears by the pages of all the recent descriptive
                    writers in France.</p>
                <p>“We dare not presume to arrange the indefatigable and very original botanist
                    Lamarck among the Linnaean botanists of his country, but we beg leave to mention
                    him here, as one who has thought for himself, and whose works are the better for
                    that reason. His severe and often petulant criticisms of the Swedish teacher,
                    made him appear more hostile than he really was, to the principles of <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193734207" xml:id="kp-eb0705-4207-0088"/> that great man.
                    Being engaged in the botanical department <hi rend="italic">of the Encyclopédie
                    Méthodique,</hi> he was obliged to conform to an alphabetical arrangement; but
                    he surely might have chosen the scientific generic names for that purpose,
                    instead of barbarous or vernacular ones, which, to foreigners, would have made
                    all the difference, between a commodious and an unintelligible disposition of
                    his work. In the detail of his performance, he has great merit, both with
                    respect to clearing up obscure species, or describing new ones; and he had the
                    advantage of access, on many occasions, to Commerson’s collection. Lamarck’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Flore Françoise</hi> is arranged after a new analytical method of
                    his own. This book however is valuable, independent of its system, as an
                    assemblage of practical knowledge and observation. We have only to regret a
                    wanton and inconvenient change of names, which too often occurs, and which is
                    not always for the better; witness <hi rend="italic">Cheiranthus hortensis,</hi>
                    instead of the long established <hi rend="italic">incanus</hi> of Linnaeus; <hi
                    rend="italic">Melampyrum violaceum,</hi> which is not correct, for <hi
                    rend="italic">nemorosum,</hi> which is strictly so, and which preserves an
                    analogy with the rest of the species.</p>
                <p>“We shall now undertake the consideration of the principles that have been
                    suggested, and the attempts that have been made, respecting a</p>
                <p>NATURAL CLASSIFICATION OF PLANTS.</p>
                <p>“The sexual system of Linnaeus lays no claim to the merit of being a natural
                    arrangement. Its sole aim is to assist us in determining any described plant by
                    analytical examination. The principles on which it is founded are the number,
                    situation, proportion, or connection, of the stamens and pistils, or organs of
                    impregnation. These principles are taken absolutely, with the sole exception of
                    their not being permitted to divide the genera, that is, to place some species
                    of a genus in one part of the system, and others in another, though such may
                    differ in the number, situation, proportion, or connection of their stamens or
                    pistils; those characters being possibly artificial, while the genera are
                    supposed, or intended, according to a fundamental law independent of all
                    systems, to be natural assemblages of species. We need not here explain the mode
                    in which Linnaeus has provided against any inconvenience in practice, resulting
                    from such anomalies of nature herself.</p>
                <p>“But though this popular system of Linnaeus does not profess to be a natural
                    method of classification it is in many paints incidentally so, several of its
                    classes or orders whose characters are founded in situation, proportion, or
                    connection, being more or less perfectly natural assemblages; nor can it be
                    denied that, on the whole, it usually brings together as many groups of natural
                    genera, as occur in most systems that have been promulgated. This fact would be
                    more evident, if the various editors of the system, those who have added new
                    genera to the original ones of Linnaeus, or, in general, those who have any way
                    applied his method to practice, had properly understood it. They would then have
                    perceived that its author had “always natural affinities in view; his aim,
                    however incompletely fulfilled, according to our advanced knowledge, having
                    constantly been, to place genera together in natural affinity or progression, as
                    far as their relationship could be discerned. At the same time he uses an
                    analytical method, at the head of each class in his <hi rend="italic">Systema
                    Vegetabilium,</hi> in which the genera are disposed according to their technical
                    characters. Murray, in compiling the fourteenth edition of that work, has been
                    inadvertent respecting this essential part of its plan. Indeed it is probable
                    that he was not competent to judge of the affinities of the new genera,
                    introduced from the <hi rend="italic">Supplementum,</hi> or from the
                    communication of Jacquin, Thunberg, &amp;c. Yet surely he might have perceived
                    the affinity of <hi rend="italic">Eanhsia</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Protea,</hi>
                    rather than to <hi rend="italic">Ludwigia</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oldrnlandia;</hi> and indeed Linnaeus himself ought to have discovered the
                    relationship of the latter to <hi rend="italic">Hedyotis,</hi> if he did not
                    detect their identity, instead of inserting it between two such strict allies of
                    each other as <hi rend="italic">Ludwigia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ammannia.</hi> To pursue these remarks would be endless. It is hardly necessary
                    to indicate the natural classes or orders of the Linnaean system, such as the
                    <hi rend="italic">Tetradynamia, Didynamia, Diadelphia, Syngenesia;</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Triandria Digynia, Gynandria Diandria, &amp;c.</hi> Except the
                    first-mentioned class, which, if <hi rend="italic">Cleome</hi> be removed, is
                    strictly natural and entire, the others are liable to much criticism. We are
                    almost disposed to allow, what we know not that any one has yet observed, that
                    the system in question is the more faulty in theory, for these classes being so
                    natural as they are. Each order of the <hi rend="italic">Didynamia</hi> presents
                    itself as a natural order, though the character of that class, derived from the
                    proportion of the stamens, serves to exclude several genera of each order, and
                    to send them far back into the second class. If all ideas of natural affinity be
                    discarded from our minds, there is no harm whatever in this; but if the <hi
                    rend="italic">Didynamia</hi> claims any credit, as a class founded in nature,
                    the above anomaly is a defect. So, still more, under the same point of view, is
                    the <hi rend="italic">Diadelphia,</hi> or at least its principal order <hi
                    rend="italic">Decandria,</hi> liable to exception. This order consists entirely
                    of the very natural family of <hi rend="italic">Papilionaceae.</hi> They are
                    characterized as having the ten stamens in two sets. Now it happens that there
                    are many papilionaceous genera, indeed a great number of such have been
                    discovered since Linnaeus wrote, whose ten stamens are all perfectly distinct.
                    These therefore are necessarily referred to the class <hi rend="italic"
                    >Decandria,</hi> and they come not altogether amiss there, because they meet in
                    that class some concomitant genera, which though, like them, leguminous, are
                    less exactly, or scarcely at all, papilionaceous. But the greatest complaint
                    lies against some genera of the <hi rend="italic">Diadelphia Decandria,</hi> for
                    having the stamens all really combined into one set, so as in truth to answer to
                    the technical character of the preceding class <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monadelphia.</hi> There is mostly indeed some indication of a disunion upward,
                    where they, more or less perfectly, form two sets; and some of them are so
                    nearly diadelphous, that their complete union at the bottom may easily be
                    overlooked; others, however, have only a fissure along the upper side of their
                    common tube, without any traces of a separate stamen or stamens. The
                    papilionaceous character of the <hi rend="italic">corolla</hi> therefore, in
                    such cases, is made to overrule that of the particular mode of union among the
                    stamens, and is in itself so clear, as seldom to be attended with any diffi-.
                    culty; but the incorrectness of principle in the system, in the point before us,
                    as being neither professedly natural, nor exactly artificial, cannot be
                    concealed. Part of the objections, to which the sexual system was originally
                    liable, have been obviated. We mean what concerns the last class but one, <hi
                    rend="italic">Polygamia.</hi> Dr Forster observed, in his voyage round the
                    world, that this class was subject to great exception, on account of the trees
                    of tropical climates, so many of which are constantly or occasionally .
                    polygamous; that is, each individual frequently bears some imperfect flowers,
                    male or female, along with its perfect or united ones. Such a circumstance
                    reduces any genus to the class <hi rend="italic">Polygamia;</hi> and.on this
                    principle Mr Hudson, thinking perhaps that he made a great improvement, removed
                    our <hi rend="italic">Ilex Aquifolium,</hi> or Holly, thither, though <hi
                    rend="italic">Pcx</hi> is well placed by Linnaeus in the fourth class. The
                    author of the present essay has ventured to propose a scheme, which is adopted
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Flora Dritannica,</hi> for getting clear of this
                    difficulty. He considers as polygamous such genera only as, besides having that
                    charac <pb break="no" facs="nls:193734220" xml:id="kp-eb0705-4220-0089"/> ter in
                    their organs of impregnation, have a difference of structure in the other parts
                    of their two kinds of flowers. Thus <hi rend="italic">Atriplex</hi> has, in its
                    perfect flowers, a regular spreading calyx, in five equal segments; in the
                    attendant female ones a compressed one, of two leaves, subsequently much
                    enlarged.</p>
                <p>“The genera thus circumstanced are so very few, as far as we have discovered,
                    that possibly the class might, but for the uniformity of the system, be
                    abolished. We cannot indeed tell what future discoveries may be made; and its
                    character, on the above foundation, is sufficiently clear and permanent; for
                    flowers of an essentially different configuration can hardly vary into each
                    other. The orders of the last class of the Linnaean system, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cryptogamia,</hi> are natural, and preserved, all nearly the same, by every
                    systematic projector. The original appendix to this system, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Palmae,</hi> would be a great blemish therein, as an artificial
                    arrangement; for such an arrangement ought to be so formed as to admit every
                    thing, on some principle or other. But this stumbling-block is now removed. The
                    palm tribe were placed thus by themselves, merely till their fructification
                    should be sufficiently known. Now they are found to agree well with some of the
                    established dasses and orders, where they meet with several of their natural
                    allies.</p>
                <p>“Whatever advantages might accrue to the practical study of botany, from the
                    convenience and facility of his artificial system, Linnaeus was from the
                    beginning intent on the discovery of a more philosophical arrangement of plants,
                    or, in other words, the classification of nature. This appears from the 77th
                    aphorism of the very first edition of his <hi rend="italic">Fundamenta
                    Botanica,</hi> published in 1736, where he mentions his design of attempting to
                    trace out fragments of a natural method. In the corresponding section of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophia Botanica,</hi> he, fifteen years afterwards, performed
                    his promise; and the same <hi rend="italic">Fragmenta,</hi> as he modestly
                    called them, were subjoined to the sixth edition of his <hi rend="italic">Genera
                    Plantarum,</hi> the last that ever came from his own hands. The interleaved
                    copies of these works, with bis manuscript notes, evince how assiduously and
                    constantly he laboured at this subject, as long as he lived. He was accustomed
                    to deliver a particular course of lectures upon it, from time to time, to a
                    small and select number of pupils, who were for this purpose domesticated under
                    his roof. What this great botanist has himself given to the world, on the
                    subject under consideration, is indeed nothing more than a skeleton of a system,
                    consisting of mere names or titles of natural orders, amounting in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophia</hi> to sixty-seven, besides an appendix of doubtful
                    genera; and that number is, in the <hi rend="italic">Genera Plantarum,</hi>
                    reduced to fifty-eight.</p>
                <p>“Under the title of each order, the genera which compose it are ranged according
                    to the author’s ideas of their relationship to each other, as appears by some of
                    his manuscript corrections; and some of the orders are subdivided into sections,
                    or parcels of genera more akin to each other than to the rest. He ingeniously
                    avowed, at all times, his inability to define his orders by characters. He
                    conceived that they were more or less connected with each other by several
                    points of affinity, so as to form a map rather than a series. The experienced
                    botanist, who peruses the above-mentioned <hi rend="italic">Fragmenta,</hi> will
                    in most cases readily imbibe the ideas of their author, as to the respective
                    affinities of the genera. In some few instances, as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dumosce,</hi> where he avows his own doubts, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Holeraceae,</hi> where he is unusually paradoxical, it is more difficult to
                    trace the chain of his ideas. Such, however, was all the assistance he thought
                    himself competent to afford. His distinguished pupils, Fabricius and Giseke,
                    fortunately took notes of his lectures on natural orders; and by the care of the
                    latter, to whom Fabricius communicated what he had likewise preserved, their
                    joint acquisitions have been given to the public, in an octavo volume, at
                    Hamburg, in 1792. Nor was this done without the permission of their venerable
                    teacher, who told Giseke by word of mouth, when they took leave of each other,
                    that ‘ as he loved him, he had laboured with pleasure in his service;’ adding,
                    that <hi rend="superscript"> ζ</hi> Giseke was at liberty to publish, whenever
                    he pleased, any thing that he had retained from his own instructions.’</p>
                <p>“Linnaeus, according to a conversation with Giseke, recorded in the preface of
                    the volume edited by the latter, declined to the last any attempt to define in
                    words the characters of his orders. His reason for this appears in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Classes Plantarum,</hi> where he justly remarks, that no certain
                    principles, or key, for any such definition can be proposed, till all the
                    orders, and consequently all the plants, in the world are known. He has,
                    however, so far expressed his opinion, in the work last quoted, as to point out
                    the situation of the seed itself, with respect to other parts, and the situation
                    and direction of its vegetating point, or <hi rend="italic">corculum,</hi> as
                    most likely to lead to a scheme of natural classification. Hence the system of
                    Caesalpinus stood very high in his estimation. He also, in the conversation
                    above mentioned, divides his own orders into three sections, or classes, <hi
                    rend="italic">Monocotyledones,</hi> comprising the first ten orders, with the
                    15th; <hi rend="italic">Dicoylédones</hi> (with two or more cotyledons), the
                    11th to the 54th order inclusive, except the 15th; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acotyledones,</hi> order 55th to 58th, with a hint that the last, or <hi
                    rend="italic">Fungi,</hi> ought perhaps to be altogether excluded. This
                    distribution of plants, by the number or the absence of the cotyledons, or lobes
                    of the seed, is the great hinge of all the professedly natural modes of
                    arrangement that have been attempted.”</p>
                <p>“Linnaeus did not consider it as absolute, for he told Giseke that he knowingly
                    admitted into his eleventh order some*plants that are monocotyledonous, with
                    others that are dicoyledonous. The reason of this was the only secret he kept
                    from his pupil; nor could the latter ever dive into it, though he afterwards
                    endeavoured to learn it from the younger Linnaeus, who knew nothing, neither did
                    he, as Giseke says, much care about the matter.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">“Nymphaea</hi> appears to
                    be the great secret, which the worthy professor told his pupil, that he, or some
                    other person, might chance to find out in ten, twenty, or fifty years, and would
                    then perceive that Linnaeus himself had been aware of it. Accordingly Gaertner
                    and Jussieu have made the same discovery, or rather, fallen into the same
                    mistake, describing <hi rend="italic">Nymphoea</hi> as monocotyledonous, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyamus,</hi> Sm. <hi rend="italic">Eχοt. Bot.</hi> v. i. 59 (their

                    considered both as dicoyledonous, and akin to the <hi rend="italic">Papaveraceae

                <p>The want of any avowed principle of distinction precludes almost all criticism of
                    these orders of Linnaeus as a natural system. They cannot be applied to
                    practice, and might in the present day be passed over in silence. As, however, a
                    very few, and amongst others the late Sir J. E. Smith, considered them as even
                    of more importance than those of Jussieu, an opinion in which we cannot
                    coincide, we shall trace very shortly their names, but omit entirely the notes
                    that usually accompany them, as unphilosophical, and tending but little to
                    benefit the reader.</p>

                <p>It will readily appear that many of these are very artificial, and some of the
                    conjunctions quite improper; but, upon the whole, they exhibit a great
                    resemblance in their external appearance, which Linnaeus himself could not
                    define in words.</p>
                <p>We shall now advert to the French school of Botany; and “here the learned and
                    truly estimable Bernard de Jussieu, the contemporary of Linnaeus in the earlier
                    part of his career, first claims our notice. This great practical botanist, too
                    diffident of his own knowledge, extensive as it was, to be over-anxious to stand
                    forth as a teacher, did not promulgate any scheme of natural arrangement till
                    the year 1759, when the royal botanic garden at Trianon was submitted to his
                    direction. His system was published by his nephew in 1789, at the head of his
                    own work, of which it makes the basis. It appears in the form of a simple list
                    of genera, under the name of each order, without any definition, just like the
                    <hi rend="italic">Fragmenta</hi> of Linnaeus, at the end of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Genera Plantarum.</hi></p>
                <p>“In 1763 a very active and zealous systematic, Μ. Adanson, made himself known to
                    the world, by the publication of his <hi rend="italic">Familles des
                    Plantes.</hi> In this learned and ingenious, though whimsical and pedantic work,
                    the great task of defining natural orders by technical characters is first
                    attempted. His affected orthography and arbitrary nomenclature render it
                    scarcely possible, without disgust, to trace his ideas; which, however, when
                    developed, prove less original than they at first appear. His work is written
                    avowedly to supersede the labours of Linnaeus, against whom, after courting his
                    correspondence, he took some personal displeasure; and yet many of his leading
                    characters are borrowed from the sexual system. The discriminative marks of his
                    fifty-eight families are taken from the following sources: leaves, sex of the
                    flowers, situation of the flowers with respect to the germen, form and situation
                    of the corolla, stamens, germens, and seeds. Every family is divided into
                    several sections, under each of which the genera are, in like manner,
                    synoptically arranged, and discriminated by their leaves, inflorescence, calyx,
                    corolla, stamens, pistil, fruit, and seeds. In the detail of his system, Adanson
                    labours to overset the principle, so much insisted on by Linnaeus and his
                    school, and to which the great names of Conrad Gesner, and Caesalpinus, are
                    chiefly indebted for their botanical fame, that the genera of plants are to be
                    characterized by the parts of fructification alone. The experienced botanist
                    knows that this is often but a dispute of words; Linnaeus having, in arranging
                    the unbelliferous plants, resorted to the inflorescence, under the denomination
                    of a receptacle; see his 45th natural order. But it appears to us that the
                    characters deduced from thence are in themselves faulty, being often uncertain,
                    and not seldom unnatural; and that the plants in question may be better
                    discriminated by their flowers and seeds. Adanson however prefers the
                    inflorescence, even in the <hi rend="italic">Verticillate</hi> of Linnaeus; for
                    no reason, that we can discover, but because Linnaeus has so much better defined
                    the genera of those plants by the <hi rend="italic">calyx</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">corol-</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193734246"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-4246-0091"/><hi rend="italic">la.</hi> It were a needless and
                    ungrateful task to carp at the mistakes of this or any writer on natural
                    classification, with regard to the places allotted for difficult genera, because
                    the human intellect must faulter in unravelling the intricate mysteries of
                    Nature. But surely, when <hi rend="italic">Plantago</hi> is placed with <hi
                    rend="italic">Euddleia</hi> in one section of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jasmineae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Diapensia</hi> with <hi rend="italic"
                    >Callicarpa</hi> in another; when the most natural genus of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lavandula</hi> is divided and widely separated; when <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cassytha</hi> is ranged with <hi rend="italic">Statice, Eriocaulon,</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Proteaceae,</hi> in one place; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geoffroea</hi> with <hi rend="italic">Melia, Phus, Sapindus,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Puta,</hi> in another; we may be allowed to wonder, and to doubt
                    whether we are contemplating a natural or an artificial system. It does not
                    appear that Adanson made many proselytes. He haunted the botanical societies of
                    Paris in our time, without associating with any; nor was his extensive knowledge
                    turned to much practical account. Linnaeus has made but one slight remark, that
                    we can find, in his own copy of the <hi rend="italic">Familles des Plantes,</hi>
                    nor could he study deeply what was undoubtedly very difficult for him to read.
                    He certainly never noticed Adanson’s attacks, unless the satirical sketch of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Botanophili,</hi> at the end of his <hi rend="italic">Pegnum
                    Vegetabile,</hi> (see the beginning of <hi rend="italic">Syst. Veg.</hi> ed.
                    14), be partly aimed at this author. To apply the whole of it to him would be
                    unjust, though much is very characteristic.</p>
                <p>“The study of Botany had never been entirely neglected in France since the days
                    of Tournefort; because one department in the Academy of Sciences was allotted to
                    that and other branches of natural history; and the seats in the academy being
                    pensioned places under government, there was something to be got by an apparent
                    attention to such pursuits. Buffon and his pupils engrossed zoology. Botany was
                    allowed to exist, so far as not to interfere with his honours; but nothing of
                    foreign origin, and above all, nothing Linnaean, dared to lift up its head.
                    Something of true science, and practical knowledge, did nevertheless
                    imperceptibly work its way. Le Monnier, and the Maréchal de Noailles,
                    corresponded, as we have already said, with Linnaeus, and acquired plants from
                    England, of which they dared to speak, and to write, by his names. A most able
                    and scientific botanist and cultivator, Thouin, was established in the Jardin du
                    Roi, who studied the Linnaean system, and even ventured, though secretly, to
                    communicate new plants to the younger Linnaeus when at Paris. Cels, an excellent
                    horticulturist, was unshackled by academic trammels. L’Heritier, Broussonet, and
                    others, came forward. An original letter of Rousseau, the idol of the day, in
                    which lie paid the most flattering homage to botany and to Linnaeus, was
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">Journal de Paris,</hi> and had a wonderful
                    effect on the public mind, and on the conversation of literary circles. In
                    short, a Linnaean party had been, for some time, gaining ground; and every thing
                    was done by party at Paris. The old French school was roused from its slumbers.
                    Of the family of the Jussieus,one individual remained, who, though he venerated
                    the names and the pursuits of his uncles, had never devoted himself to their
                    studies any further than to sit in their professorial chair. He possessed,
                    however, an inherent taste for botany; he had leisure, opulence, and eminent
                    talents; and though his religious principles, and his rather strict devotional
                    habits, might interfere, which they still do, with his credit in certain
                    philosophical circles, and his predilection for animal magnetism might exclude
                    him from the Royal Society of London, yet he has risen above all such obstacles,
                    to the summit of botanical fame and authority in his own country; and his name
                    stands conspicuous, as the leading teacher of a na tural classification of
                    plants. The most indefatigable study for about five years, and the constant
                    assistance and encouragement of numerous pupils and correspondents, enabled
                    Professor Antoine Laurent de Jussieu to publish, in 1789, his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Genera Plantarum secundum ordincs naturales disposita.</hi> This octavo volume
                    was received by acclamation throughout Europe, and hailed as the most learned
                    botanical work that had appeared since the <hi rend="italic">Species
                    Plantarum</hi> of Linnaeus.”</p>
                <p>“The whole preface of Jussieu is a concise and learned review of the physiology
                    and distinctions of plants, more particularly explaining the progress of the
                    author’s ideas and principles of botanical classification. The main end of the
                    whole book, besides defining the characters of all known genera, is to dispose
                    them in a natural series, in various classes and orders, whose technical
                    distinctions are throughout attempted to be fixed and contrasted.”<note

                <p>The first in England who wrote a systematic work according to the natural method
                    of Jussieu, was Mr Brown, the most able botanist of this or any former age; and
                    no one has done so much, in any country, to throw light on its intricacies.
                    Salisbury, Hooker, Don, and Lindley, have respectively contributed their share;
                    but we regret to say, that hitherto, in Britain, from the simplicity of the
                    Linnaean system for enabling one to obtain the name of a plant, and from the
                    want of good elementary works in our language to guide the student, the natural
                    classification, except among a few of the principal botanists, has been very
                    little attended to. Another great desideratum has been a Species Plantarum, or
                    work containing all the known species, arranged in this way: but this is at
                    present attempted by Professor De Candolle of Geneva, and when his <hi
                    rend="italic">Prodromus Systematis Pegni Vegetabilis</hi> is completed, we do
                    not hesitate to state that, notwithstanding a multitude of errors, it will prove
                    to be one of the most valuable works ever presented to the public, and will tend
                    more to establish the method than all the books previously written on the
                    subject.</p>
                <p>“The advantages of such a system,” says Mr Lindley, <hi rend="superscript">
                    α</hi> in applying botany to useful purposes, are immense, especially to medical
                    men, with whose profession the science has always been identified. A knowledge
                    of the properties of one plant is a guide to the practitioner, which enabled him
                    to substitute some other with confidence which is naturally allied to it; and
                    physicians on foreign stations may direct their inquiries, not empirically, but
                    upon fixed principles, into the qualities of the medicinal plants which nature
                    has provided in every region for the alleviation of the maladies peculiar to it.
                    To horticulturists it is not less important: the propagation or cultivation of
                    one plant is usually applicable to all its kindred; the habits of one species in
                    an order will often be those of the rest; many a gardener might have escaped the
                    pain of a poisoned limb, had he been acquainted with the laws of affinity; and
                    finally, the phenomena of grafting, that curious operation, which is one of the
                    grand features of distinction between the animal and vegetable kingdoms, and the
                    success of which is wholly controlled by ties of blood, can only be understood
                    by the student of the natural system.”</p>
                <p>The natural method having in view not the mere naming of plants, which can of
                    itself be interesting to only <hi rend="italic">a&lt;</hi> limited number of
                    individuals, but the classifying them’ according to the groups which nature
                    herself forms, or rather, as nature forms only species, according to the
                    resemblance that one tribe of vegetables bears to another, we must,
                    consequently, conform as much as possible to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193734259"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-4259-0092"/> her laws; and to know these we must first obtain
                    a precise idea of the organization of plants, studying minutely all their parts,
                    and the functions of each. This we have already attempted to elucidate under the
                    head of Glossology. We now come to examine into the relative importance of these
                    organs, in order that we may derive from them a classification according to
                    nature.</p>
                <p>When different seeds taken from the same plant are made to germinate, we have
                    individuals not entirely agreeing in the shape of the leaves, or the height of
                    the stem; from which we may infer that characters derived from these are of the
                    least importance; and consequently, when we form species, we must use such with
                    great caution. But when we rise a step higher, and group species into genera, we
                    find so great a variety in both the stem and leaves, that we are forced to look
                    for characters elsewhere, and thus resort to the different parts of the flower;
                    and all genera are therefore founded on a consideration of these. When, however,
                    we come to examine a genus by itself, we shall find that perhaps none of these
                    parts are sufficiently constant, some species differing from others in the
                    number or shape of the sepals, or petals, or stamens, or pistilla, so that we
                    are obliged to call into action not any particular one, but a combination of the
                    whole. While doing this, it cannot escape our notice that the more external
                    portions, as the calyx, exhibiting more of the foliaceous origin,' are less
                    constant than the petals; and these again less so than the stamens; but the
                    stamens and pistils having least of the structure of the original leaf, are the
                    most uniform; and hence Linnaeus, influenced principally however by these being
                    the true sexual organs, adopted the stamina and pistils as the basis of his
                    system. Now we have already said that, in many natural genera, plants differ
                    from one another only specifically, although there happen to be a difference in
                    the number of parts of the reproductive organs. Number, then, not being at all
                    times sufficient to constitute a genus, can still less be relied on for a higher
                    division. The structure must thus be considered; and this we not only find
                    common to the species of a genus, but even often to different genera so allied
                    in aspect that at first we might consider them all as one great genus; and such
                    a great genus being in fact an order, we are led, while defining it, to place
                    considerable dependence on the structure of the anthers, but more especially on
                    the fruit, the ultimate metamorphosis of the primary leaf. But on comparing
                    together two or more orders otherwise very closely allied, we often perceive
                    very different structures of the fruit; so that, in search of something more
                    fixed, we are compelled to dip still deeper into the economy of the plant, and
                    examine the seed. Here, indeed, we find a great diversity in the external form;
                    but on scrutinizing the interior, particularly the embryo, or the very rudiment
                    of the plant, we find only <hi rend="italic">two</hi> modifications; and each of
                    these, after having opened different seeds, we perceive to be constant to a very
                    great class of plants united together, whether by the structure of the fruit,
                    the number of stamens, or by the flower, or by the anatomy of the stems, or by
                    the leaves. These modifications of the embryo, resting on there being one or two
                    cotyledons, must thus form the groundwork of a natural method: it was already
                    foreseen by Linnaeus, but was demonstrated by Jussieu. We only here allude to
                    those plants in which a seed and embryo exists*; for the very principle we have
                    laid down implies its existence. A primary division, then, pointed out by
                    nature, is therefore obviously into those with flowers and those that have none,
                    or into those which have seeds and an embryo, and such as have neither true
                    seeds nor an embryo.</p>
                <p>First, then, we have a division into Exembryonate and Embryonate vegetables; and,
                    secondly, the Embryonate divides into those with one and those with two
                    cotyledons, which was no sooner fixed than many corresponding differences of
                    structure became perceptible. Thus <hi rend="italic">Monoco-tyledones</hi> show
                    a radicle that projects the root through a covering. The divisions of the flower
                    are ternary; the leaves are curvinerved, primarily alternate or spiral, but
                    indicating a disposition to become opposite at the summit of the plant; the stem
                    is cylindrical, and increasing in diameter from within by an expansion of the
                    vascular fibre. The <hi rend="italic">Dicoylédones·,</hi> on the contrary, have
                    opposite cotyledons; the radicle of the embryo becomes a root by mere
                    development; the division of the flower is usually quinary; the leaves are
                    angulinerved, and primarily opposite or verticillate, with a tendency to become
                    alternate towards the inflorescence; the stem is conical, with a bark, and both
                    increasing by concentric layers, the stem from without, the bark from
                    within.</p>
                <p>Having thus attained primary divisions with important! and constant characters,
                    we are next to proceed to subdi- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> vide these into
                    orders; but in doing this we must observe, that though it be quite possible to
                    group genera into orders, and to place these orders in one of the great
                    divisions above given, it is almost impracticable to place them satisfactorily
                    one after the other so as to constitute a book. Each order is not allied merely
                    to the one that precedes and that which follows it, but approaches more or less
                    to several others. In arranging them, then, in a linear series, all that we can
                    attempt is to place those next each other that have common characters of most
                    value or of greatest number; and as the value and number of these are added to
                    or diminished by the discovery of new plants and modern analyses, we must expect
                    daily changes to take place. In this consists the difficulty of the natural
                    method, when compared with a purely artificial one; but these difficulties are
                    from time to time smoothed down, so that ultimately it will be viewed as the
                    only useful one, while the artificial system will be entirely neglected, except
                    by those whose desires extend no farther than to make out the name of a
                    vegetable.</p>
                <p>Jussieu considered the whole floral envelopes of the Monocotyledones as a calyx,
                    whether coloured or green; and observing that a portion of the Dicoylédones were
                    also destitute of a corolla, he laid hold of this to divide them into two parts,
                    as had been already done by Tournefort: at the same time he separated those with
                    a corolla into one and many-petaled. These sections, however, being artificial,
                    cannot be entirely depended on in practice, many species belonging to a
                    polypetalous order having the corolla abortive; while again, as in the
                    Pentapetaloideae of Ray, several of those also with a polypetalous corolla have
                    the ungues or claws united, so that it is in reality a monopetalous one,
                    although arranged with the other. Linnaeus had already introduced the insertion
                    of the stamens to distinguish his class Icosandria from Polyandria; and this
                    bringing together plants tolerably nearly allied in other respects, Jussieu
                    extended the idea, and having observed that stamens not hypogynous were either
                    perigynous or epigynous, he made use of these three characters to subdivide both
                    the Monocotyledones and each of the sections of the Dicoyledonous plants. Only
                    one of these he found necessary further to divide, in order to separate
                    Syngenesia of Linnaeus from those approximated to them in several other
                    characters, but of a different habit or appearance, and had here recourse to the
                    union or separation of the anthers. These ultimate subdivisions he termed
                    classes, and to the end of them he appended one consisting of such Dicoylédones
                    as had the flowers unisexual, and were therefore principally contained in the
                    21st, 22d, and 23d classes of Linnaeus. We have already seen, in treating of the
                    parts of a flower, that the stamens and corolla have <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193734272" xml:id="kp-eb0705-4272-0093"/> always the same insertion,
                    and that when a corolla is gamopetalous, or, in common language, monopetalous,
                    the cause that unites the petals often also makes part of the filaments adhere
                    to it. Among the monopetalous plants, then, to prevent confusion, Jussieu,
                    instead of saying that the stamens were hypogynous or perigynous, speaks of the
                    insertion of the corolla; and, with these remarks, we may now present the
                    fifteen classes of Jussieu.</p>

                <p>Such was the groundwork of the system which, though in some things artificial,
                    was instantly perceived to bear the palm from all that preceded it; and this,
                    without any alteration, is still adhered to in France by many of the most
                    eminent botanists. Jussieu originally prefixed no names to his classes, and the
                    want of this was much objected to. Those which we have given have been lately
                    proposed by Antoine L. de Jussieu in the <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire des
                    Sciences Naturelles;</hi> and, although not entirely according to the principles
                    of the Greek language, may be adopted as extremely useful, each being so framed
                    as to suggest the structure of the class. Thus the commencement <hi
                    rend="italic">Mono</hi> indicates the Monocotyledones∙ <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epistamina,</hi> &amp;c. having no allusion to a corolla, suggests its absence.
                    <hi rend="italic">Hypocorollae,</hi> and the others, allude to the corolla being
                    of one piece, and not of distinct petals, which last is pointed out by names <hi
                    rend="italic">Epipetalae,</hi> &amp;c. The other parts of the names, epi, peri,
                    and hypo, need no explanation.</p>
                <p>While engaged in the study of plants alone, it is obviously of little consequence
                    whether we begin, as Jussieu did, by the Acotyledones, or by the Dicoylédones;
                    but if we view botany as a sçience that treats of only one of the great kingdoms
                    of nature, and wish to introduce it into a <hi rend="italic">Systema
                    Naturae,</hi> we must bring those portions of each most closely together which
                    are most nearly linked. So that if we commence by Zoology, we must first
                    describe the Mammalia, and end by those of a simpler structure, and then take up
                    the most allied of the Acotyledones, and follow the steps of Jussieu. But if we
                    describe vegetables in the first place, we must begin with the Dicoylédones, and
                    finish with the Acotyledones. When, however, a <hi rend="italic">Systema
                    Vegetabilium</hi> is contemplated without reference to animals, it may perhaps
                    smooth the way to the student if it commences by those more obvious, and, though
                    of more complex formation, yet more simple to be comprehended. On this account
                    De Candolle has reversed the arrangement of Jussieu.</p>
                <p>We have said that in some respects the system of Jussieu is artificial, and
                    therefore his orders need not necessarily follow each other precisely as he has
                    left them. De <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Candolle accordingly divides the
                    Dicoylédones into <hi rend="italic">Thalamiflorae,</hi> or those whose petals
                    are distinct and hypogynous; <hi rend="italic">Calgeifiorae,</hi> having the
                    petals either distinct or united, but always inserted on the calyx; <hi
                    rend="italic">Corolliflorae,</hi> with the petals united, and hypogynous, and
                    bearing the stamens; and <hi rend="italic">Monochlamydeae,</hi> with a simple
                    perianth or perigonium. Moreover, he derives his characters for all these
                    united, not from the cotyledons, but from the structure of the stem, and terms
                    them Exogenae; and in a similar way he calls Monocotyledones by the name of
                    Endogenae, with this alteration, that he supposes the ferns and allied plants,
                    which in another part we have termed Ductulosae, to have the same structure of a
                    stem as the Monocotyledones, and therefore divides the Enclogenae into <hi
                    rend="italic">Phanerogamae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cryptogamae.</hi> The
                    other Acotyledones, named by him <hi rend="italic">Cellulares,</hi> from their
                    entire homogeneity of cellular tissue, conclude the system. Although he has
                    given us an arranged catalogue of the orders in his <hi rend="italic">Theorie
                    Elémentaire,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Second
                    Edition, p∙ 213. (1819).</p></note> which, however, he has considerably altered
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Prodromus,</hi> now publishing, yet he has scarcely
                    exhibited any subdivisions of his principal groups. It may be, however, useful
                    to present the following sketch of his, contrasted as much as possible with that
                    of Jussieu.</p>

                <p>From the above it will be perceived, although some sneer at the natural system,
                    because they do not understand it, and assert that every one has a method of his
                    own, and quote De Candolle’s as extremely distinct from that of Jussieu, that it
                    is in fact founded on, and not differing in any essential point from, that of
                    the Parisian botanist.</p>
                <p>Mr Lindley, in his <hi rend="italic">Introduction to the Natural System of
                    Botany,</hi> has discarded nearly all these subdivisions as empirical, and
                    substituted in their place one derived from the ovulum, being protected by a
                    pericarp, or exposed without any covering to the influence of the pollen. This
                    last is of very great importance, and is worthy of being <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193734285" xml:id="kp-eb0705-4285-0094"/> adopted; but any one who has
                    glanced at his volume must have soon felt the great want of more minute
                    divisions than he has adopted, however artificial they might be; nor do we think
                    that he has compensated for the deficiency by a more judicious disposition of
                    the orders.</p>
                <p>We ourselves shall follow pretty closely that given by De Candolle, because, from
                    his publishing a work containing all the known species arranged according to it,
                    it is almost the only one that can be of use to a student of species. But while
                    we do so, we shall subdivide his groups in the manner recommended by Jussieu;
                    not that they are to be implicitly trusted, but that they may in some measure
                    assist the reader while referring to the orders.</p>
                <p>We must now advert to the orders themselves; and these being great natural
                    genera, in order to obtain characters for them, we must have an intimate
                    knowledge of the structure of the organs of the component genera and species, so
                    as to select such as are common to all, and of the greatest importance.
                    Botanists having seen that the embryo gave most fixed characters for a general
                    division, have looked to it also, and to the structure of the seed, as of great
                    influence in limiting each order individually. This view was altogether omitted
                    by Jussieu at the time the <hi rend="italic">Genera Plantarum</hi> was given to
                    the world, but is now frequently adopted as a criterion, when other and more
                    easily examined points fail. The structure of the fruit we have already said to
                    be useful for defining genera, and consequently must not be passed over while
                    circumscribing an order; nor must the position of the seed be omitted. As to the
                    carpel, the stigma affords few good marks; but the ovarium must be strictly
                    attended to, especially as a contrast to the mature fruit, many plants having
                    two or three cells in the ovarium, and but one by abortion in the fruit. Thus
                    the structure of the ovary is in several of greater importance than that of the
                    fruit. The apocarpous or syncarpous nature of the ovarium, upon which we have
                    already dwelt, must be noticed. The position of the placentae and the ovules has
                    likewise been esteemed of great value. The stamina, whether viewed relatively to
                    their insertion, their adherence, proportional size, or number, and particularly
                    the structure of the anther, and even the pollen, all indicate greater or less
                    affinities in other points.</p>
                <p>The floral envelopes must be considered in all their bearings, and even the
                    inflorescence must not be neglected. The relative position, also, of one part of
                    a flow er to another, whether the number be symmetrical or complete, enables us
                    often to clear up many difficulties. But it is not one of these alone in which
                    we are to confide, but in a combination of them: two orders, differing solely by
                    one character, being too closely allied, had better be united; a <hi
                    rend="italic">clavis analytica,</hi> therefore, such as has been given by Mr
                    Lindley in his introduction, can convey to us almost no idea of the orders, and,
                    besides, has the disadvantage of not exhibiting the anomalies that so frequently
                    occur.</p>
                <p>Having exhausted all the parts of the flower, we may then turn our attention to
                    the leaves; and here we may take advantage of a character that is intimately
                    connected with the habit or external aspect of the order, and is consequently
                    truly natural; we allude to the leaves being opposite or alternate, and with or
                    without stipules. The presence or absence of pellucid dots, exhibiting a
                    peculiar organization in the plant, must be carefully observed. Compound or
                    simple leaves are often of use to enable us to refer a plant to a particular
                    order. The mere shape of leaves is too variable, but the venation, or
                    disposition of the nerves, upon which the shape of the leaf depends, as the
                    fruit does upon the ovary, although hitherto not much attended to, seems in many
                    cases of considerable importance. As to the stem, the external variations, as
                    erect or climbing, square or round, sometimes aid us, but in most orders afford
                    us no assistance. The root has been rarely found of any avail.</p>
                <p>We have again and again stated that we are not to take the characters of orders
                    from any one organ individually, but from several. Each order may thus be
                    expected to possess some points in common with several other orders, and by the
                    number of these, and their value, as found from experience, we are able to trace
                    the affinity between any one, and those that ought to be arranged in its
                    vicinity. When several very important points are nearly the same in four or five
                    different orders, though distinct in many others, a greater approximation is
                    visible between themselves, than any of them exhibits to other orders: this has
                    induced Mr Brown to propose to erect orders into classes of a different kind
                    from those of Jussieu; and he has happily succeeded in accomplishing this in
                    several instances. Very few such classes or aggregate ordershave, however, yet
                    been formed, and therefore we shall not enter into their consideration farther
                    than merely remark that this is, at present, greatly to be desired in the
                    natural method, and that, when it shall be accomplished, and the whole
                    distributed among a few great compound orders, we may be able to do away
                    entirely with even the slight remains we now must admit into it, of an
                    artificial or empirical arrangement.</p>
                <p>It is now time that we proceed to enumerate and lay down the characters of the
                    orders themselves. Jussieu constituted a hundred, and subjoined a list of many
                    genera, either so little known, or so ill defined, that he could not refer them.
                    By degrees, however, as light was thrown upon them, some were entered into know
                    n orders, while others exhibited the necessity of constructing additional ones.
                    In his <hi rend="italic">Theorie Elémentaire,</hi> in 1819, De Candolle
                    enumerates 161 orders, but has since admitted many new ones in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Prodromus.</hi> Richard, in 1828, describes 162, but omits a few
                    which he considered not well understood. Rudolphi, in 1830, gives 276; and about
                    the same time Mr Lindley has 272. Both Rudolphi and Lindley, however, carry the
                    system of subdivision perhaps to excess; but as our object is here to give a
                    view of the science at the present day, we shall admit almost all of them,
                    arranging, however, the minor ones under a general head, to which, for
                    conciseness, we shall give no character, and which may be viewed, if one
                    pleases, as a class. To as short a definition of the orders as possible we shall
                    annex a few remarks, which we trust may render this department more
                    interesting.</p>

                    surrounding the base of the ovaria. Ovaria 2-5, apocarpous: style none: stigmas
                    sessile, thick, of two lamellae: ovules numerous. Carpels follicular, tipped
                    with the persistent stigmas, opening above by a longitudinal suture. Seeds

                <p>The first suborder is usually divided into four, Clema-tideae, Anemoneae,
                    Ranunculeae, and Helleborineae, distinguished by a combination of the
                    estivation, and position of the seed; but as it appears probable that in the
                    ovarium there is always at least two ovules, so the position of the seed,
                    whether erect or pendulous, must depend entirely on which of the ovules, the
                    upper or lower, becomes abortive. In general terms the Ranunculaceae may be
                    known from other Hypopetalae by having adnate anthers that dehisce
                    longitudinally, by a fruit of several distinct simple carpels, by a horny
                    albumen, exarillate seeds, and exstipulate sheathing leaves.—Acridity,
                    causticity, and poison, are the general characters of this order.</p>
                <p>Order 2. <hi rend="italic">Dilleniacece.</hi> D. C.</p>
                <p>Sepals five, persistent. Corolla of five petals, deciduous, in a single row.
                    Stamens numerous; filaments dilated either at the base or apex. Anthers adnate,
                    introrse, bursting longitudinally. Ovaria definite, more or less distinct, with
                    a terminal style and simple stigma; ovules ascending. Fruit of 2-5 distinct
                    unilocular carpels, or of a similar number cohering together: the carpels are
                    either capsular or baccate, and pointed by the style. Seeds several in each
                    carpel, or only two or one by abortion, surrounded by a pulpy arillus. Testa
                    hard. Embryo straight, minute, at the base of a fleshy albumen.—Leaves
                    alternate, or rarely opposite, without stipules.—Ex. <hi rend="italic">Delima,

                <p>Known by the longitudinally dehiscing anthers, distinct simple carpels, arillate
                    seeds, fleshy albumen, and exstipulate leaves. In some genera, however, there is
                    but one carpel, and in a few others they partially cohere. They are trees or
                    shrubs, or even undershrubs.—They are generally astringent; most have the leaves
                    covered' with asperities, which are sometimes so hard as to permit of their use
                    for polishing.</p>

                    Sepals 2-6, deciduous or persistent. Petals 2-30 (when more than five, in
                    several rows). Stamens indefinite, distinct: anthers adnate, dehiscing
                    longitudinally. Ovaria definite in one verticil, one-celled, ovules suspended.
                    Stigmas sessile. Fruit of distinct carpels. Embryo very small, straight in the
                    base of a fleshy albumen.—Leaves alternate, transparently dotted, coriaceous,

                    Petals 3-27, in several rows. Stamens indefinite, distinct; anthers adnate,
                    long, bursting longitudinally. Ovaries numerous in several rows, one-celled:
                    ovules ascending or suspended: styles short. Fruit of numerous carpels, which
                    are either dehiscent or indehiscent, distinct or partially connate, sometimes
                    samaroid. Embryo minute at the base of a fleshy albumen.—Leaves alternate, not
                    dotted, coriaceous, with deciduous convolute stipules.—Ex. <hi rend="italic"

                <p>These two suborders, scarcely distinguishable from each other but by their
                    leaves, may be characterized by their longitudinally dehiscing anthers,
                    apocarpous ovaria, and stipulate leaves.—The first tribe is aromatic and
                    stimulant; and the <hi rend="italic">Drymis Winteri</hi> yields the winter’s
                    bark, well known for its resemblance to cinnamon. The second is not at all
                    aromatic; but the flowers, which are large, are often strongly odoriferous; they
                    have a bitter tonic taste, but the bark does not seem to possess either tannin
                    or gallic acid. The bark of thς tulip-tree has been said to equal Peruvian
                    bark.</p>

                <p>Sepals 3-4, persistent, often partially cohering. Petals 6, in two rows,
                    coriaceous; estivation valvular. Stamens indefinite (very rarely definite):
                    anthers adnate, extrorse, with a large connectivum. Ovaries usually numerous,
                    separate or sometimes cohering, rarely definite; ovules solitary or several,
                    erect or ascending. Fruit of a number of succulent or dry carpella, that are one
                    or manyseeded, and distinct, or concrete into a fleshy mass. Testa of the seed
                    brittle. Embryo minute at the base of a hard fleshy ruminated albumen.—Trees or
                    shrubs. Leaves alternate, simple, without stipules.—Ex. <hi rend="italic">Anona,

                <p>The apocarpous ovaria, ruminated albumen, and exstipulate leaves, are the general
                    characteristics of this order. •—Almost all possess a powerful aromatic taste
                    and smell; in some the fruit contains much sugary mucilage, and is succulent and
                    eatable; of this kind are the custard-apples, and the celebrated Cherimolia of
                    Peru.</p>
                <p>Order 5. <hi rend="italic">Alenispermaxeoe.</hi> Juss.</p>
                <p>Flowers usually unisexual, and very small. Sepals and petals having the same
                    appearance, in one or several rows; three or four in each row, deciduous.
                    Stamens monadelphous or occasionally free, sometimes opposite to the petals and
                    equal to them in number, sometimes three or four times as many: anthers adnate,
                    extrorse. Ovaria usually numerous, free or slightly united by their inner
                    margin, unilocular. Drupes baccate, one-seeded, oblique, <pb break="no"

                    rarely a multilocular berry, with the cells many-secded. Embryo curved, radicle
                    superior. Albumen none, or in small quantity and fleshy.— Climbing shrubs, with
                    alternate leaves and very minute flowers.—Ex. <hi rend="italic"
                    >JMenispermum∙&gt; Cissampelos.</hi></p>
                <p>The stamens opposite the petals, apocarpous ovaria, minute unisexual flowers, and
                    twining shrubby stems, point out this order.—The root of several species is
                    bitter and tonic, and of some the seeds are narcotic. A few have been used in
                    intermittent fevers. The columbo root, so esteemed for its tonic, antiseptic,
                    and astringent qualities, belongs to the genus <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Order 6. <hi rend="italic">Eerberideoe.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Vent.</hi></p>
                <p>Sepals 3-4-6, deciduous, in a double row, accompanied externally with petaloid
                    scales. Petals equal to the sepals in number and opposite to them, or twice as
                    many; often furnished in the inside with an appendage at tĥe base. Stamens equal
                    in number to the petals and opposite to them: anthers bilocular, the cells
                    opening elastically with a valve from the bottom to the top. Ovarium solitary,

                    short: stigma orbicular. Fruit baccate or capsular, indehiscent. Albumen fleshy
                    or horny. Embryo straight, in the axis of the albumen: radicle pointing to the

                <p>The single simple carpel, stamens opposite to the petals, and the anthers opening
                    by valves, will readily distinguish this from the other Hypopetalae. This kind
                    of anther is of rare occurrence, but equally exists in the Laurineae,
                    ITamamelideae, and Atherospermeae. There are no stipules, the spines being the
                    true leaves, of which the parenchyma has disappeared, and the nerves become
                    indurated: what are commonly called leaves are those formed by the development
                    of the leaf-buds. All are articulated with the petiole, and hence the leaves are
                    in reality compound, although apparently simple. The stamens of many exhibit
                    great irritability.—The berries of some species of <hi rend="italic"

                    saccate at the base, the two inner callous at the apex, where they cohere and
                    inclose the anthers and stigma. Stamens six, diadelphous, opposite the outer
                    petals: anthers of the middle stamens of each parcel two-celled, of the outer
                    ones one-celled. Ovary one-celled: style filiform, stigma with two or more
                    points. Fruit a one-seeded utricle, or a two-valved, two-seeded, indehiscent
                    capsule, or a two-valved, polyspermous stigma. Seeds with an arillus attached to
                    narrow parietal placentas. Albumen fleshy. Embryo nearly straight, minute,

                    two of the others make but one, or that there is in reality here but four
                    stamens, one before each petal. And even Mr Lindley has demonstrated that the
                    inner petals form a corolla, while the outer ought to be viewed as sepals: the
                    deciduous sepals above described would thus be bracteae.—The Fumariaceae are

                <p>Sepals four; two corresponding to the two stigmas are anterior and posterior, and

                    broader, concave at the base, gibbous or spurred. Corolla cruciform. Petals
                    four, alternate with the sepals, nearly equal, deciduous. Stamens six; the two
                    opposite the lateral sepals are solitary, shorter, and occasionally toothed;
                    four in pairs opposite the anterior and posterior sepals, longer, generally
                    free, sometimes connate, or furnished with a tooth on the inside: anthers
                    bilocular, introrse. Torus with several green glands between the petals and the
                    stamens, and ovarium. Ovarium syncarpous, bilocular. Placentae parietal, usually
                    meeting in the middle, and forming a spurious dissepiment. Stigmas two, opposite
                    the placentae, or anterior and posterior. Fruit a siliqua or silicule, rarely
                    one-celled and indehiscent, usually spuriously bilocular, and dehiscing by two
                    valves separating from the placentae; one or many-seeded. Seeds campulitropous,
                    pendulous, attached in a single row by a funiculus to each side of the
                    placentae. Albumen none. Embryo with the radicle folded up on the cotyledons,

                    Mr Lindley and we understand it. Mr Brown gives a different explanation, upon
                    which we have not room to enter.— The general character of the Cruciferae is to
                    possess antiscorbutic and stimulant qualities, with an acrid flavour. They
                    contain much azote, and have therefore, when in a putrescent state, been
                    occasionally used in the manufacture of Prussian blue, when the horns and hoofs

                    Ovarium syncarpous, one or many-celled: style single: stigma simple. Fruit
                    capsular, 3-5-10-valved, one-celled, with parietal placentae in the middle of

                    Embryo either spiral or curved, in the midst of a mealy albumen: radicle at the

                    the petals, or occasionally opposite to them, inserted on the hypogynous disc or
                    torus: anthers bilocular, introrse, closely approximated, or united laterally to
                    each other: filaments dilated, elongated beyond the anthers; two of them, in the
                    irregular flowers, usually with an appendage at the base. Ovary one-celled, with
                    many (rarely one) ovules: style single, usually declinate, with an oblique
                    cucullate stigma. Capsule three-valved, loculicide, or bearing the placenta on
                    the middle of the valves. Embryo straight, erect, in the axis of a fleshy

                    to have five placentae, but that seems contradicted by Brown. The placentae are
                    opposite to the three outer sepals.—The roots of all the species are more or
                    less emetic, and some of them are substituted for Ipecacuanha.</p>

                    Dionoea.</hi></p>
                <p>Some botanists describe the stamens of Droseraceae as perigynous, which, however,
                    we do not think distinctly made out; but were that true, they would approach to
                    the Saxifrageae. As to our second suborder, <hi rend="italic">Parnassia</hi> has
                    been referred by Lindley, as was already suggested by Brown, to the Saxifrageae,
                    but by Don to the Hypericineae. Richard, again, who affirms it to be a genuine
                    Droseraceae, places <hi rend="italic">Dionoea</hi> among the Hypericineae; while
                    Lindley retains it, for the time, among the Droseraceae, but pointing out an
                    affinity with the Sarraceniaceae. But the four stigmas opposite to the placentae
                    in <hi rend="italic">Parnassia</hi> seem to indicate that these are each
                    composed of two half stigmas belonging to different carpels, and consequently
                    that the styles have a tendency to become united, although biful in their upper
                    portion, as in <hi rend="italic">Drosera.</hi> The stigma of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dionoea</hi> may be similarly explained. The syncarpous ovarium is at variance
                    with the Saxifrageae; and, in the Hypericineae, the styles alternating with the
                    margins of the carpels, and the sometimes capitate stigmas, demonstrate that the
                    styles are there free and the stigmas undivided. Hence we have brought them
                    under Droseraceae, from which they chiefly differ by their habit and absence of
                    albumen.—The genus <hi rend="italic">Drosera</hi> is rather acid, slightly
                    acrid, and reputed poisonous to cattle.</p>

                    with the upper and lateral sepals. .Sometimes there are five, the two additional
                    ones being minute, and between the lateral and lower sepals: the lower petal

                    traced, whether they be like the stamens, as is most probable, or, as some

                <p>The affinity between Malvaceae and Caryophyllaceae is very obscure. De Candolle
                    considered the Lineae as a connecting order; but that differs exceedingly from
                    both in the structure of the seed, and, according to St Hilaire, ought to form a

                    Fruit variable, capsular, or indehiscent, usually with five valves and
                    loculicide. Seeds often inclosed in a woolly or pulpy covering; sometimes with a

                <p>These were separated from Malvaceae by Kunth and De Candolle, but again united by
                    St Hilaire: they chiefly differ by the calyx not being decidedly valvate in
                    estivation, and by the polyadelphous stamens.—Like the Malvaceae, they are
                    mucilaginous, and possess no deleterious properties. The dried leaves of <hi

                    sessile, acuminated, bilocular, bursting longitudinally. Torus cup-shaped,
                    ten-plaited. Ovarium five-celled, each cell semibilocular by the inflection of
                    the placentae: style simple: stigma peltate, five-lobed. Capsule of five valves,
                    septifragal; dissepiments obliterated, except at the base. Placentae laminary,
                    inflected, finally becoming loose, and having two or more seeds on each side.
                    Seeds erect or suspended, winged at one extremity: testa coriaceous. Albumen
                    fleshy, thin, or wanting. .Embryo straight, transverse: radicle very small,
                    distant from the hilum: cotyledons flat, very large. —Leaves alternate,

                <p>We again unite these three orders, because we do not find any good marks between
                    them. The albuminous seeds and slender embryo chiefly distinguish Humiricae from
                    Melicae; but in Cedreleae the seeds have albumen and want it, and in this tribe
                    the dehiscence of the capsule is not so constant as one would wish; for in <hi

                    anatropous.—The medical properties of this family are little understood; and to
                    judge by those that are known, they are very dissimilar. Thus the bark of <hi
                    rend="italic">Canella alba</hi> (or false Winter’s bark) is aromatic and

                <p>Calyx small, nearly entire. Petals 4-5, sometimes cohering above, and
                    calyptriform: estivation valvate. Stamens 4-5, opposite to the petals: filaments
                    distinct, or slightly cohering at the base: anthers ovate, versatile. Torus an
                    annular disc, bearing the petals on its exterior, and the stamens on its
                    surface. Ovarium two-celled: ovules in pairs, erect: style one, very short:
                    stigma simple. Berry globose, pulpy, two- (or often by abortion, one-) celled.
                    Seeds 1-4, erect: testa osseous. Albumen horny. Embryo erect: radicle slender:
                    cotyledons lanceolate.— Climbing shrubs. Leaves, lower ones opposite, upper
                    alternate, with racemes opposite to them, which are sometimes abortive, and
                    change into tendrils.—Ex. <hi rend="italic">Cissus, ' Vitis.</hi></p>
                <p>This order approaches closely to the Meliaceae; indeed it is difficult to say to
                    which <hi rend="italic">Leea</hi> ought to be referred, or if it ought not to
                    form a small connecting group. If in that genus we consider the torus to be
                    cup-shaped, bearing the petals on its outside about the middle, we shall have
                    above the insertion of the petals five sessile, adnate, extrorse, anthers; by
                    which view we should have a true member of the Ampelideae: but then the anthers
                    are alternate with the petals, and the plants are not climbing: from Meliaceae
                    it differs rather more. As to <hi rend="italic">Lasianthera,</hi> too little is
                    known of it to decide upon its affinities.—The vine is so well known that we

                <p>All these suborders may be either considered as parts of one order, or as orders
                    belonging to one class. They are allied on the one hand to Caryophylleae and
                    Malvaceae, and on the other to Rutaceae. <hi rend="italic">Ehynchotheca</hi> has
                    no petals, but certainly belongs to the Geraniaceae, although it be difficult to
                    say with which of the above sections it ought to be ranked: the seeds pendulous,
                    albumen fleshy, embryo straight, stamens distinct, and two ovules in each cell,
                    militate against it being placed in Geranicae; and the cohering styles separate
                    it from Lineae and Oxalideae. In Tropaeoleae the stamens may almost be called
                    perigynous.— Geranicae possess an astringent principle, and an aromatic and
                    resinous flavour. The mucilaginous diuretic seeds of Lineae, and the purgative
                    leaves of <hi rend="italic">L. catharticum,</hi> are well known. The fleshy
                    fruit of Tropaeoleae is acrid, and used as a cress. The Oxalideae are acid, and

                <p>De Candolle arranges this next Polygaleae, probably on account of the tendency of
                    the fruit to become unilocular, with parietal placentae. We, however, agree with

                    Flowers usually bisexual. Calyx 4-5-divided: estivation imbricated. Petals as
                    many as the sepals, spreading, or connivent into a kind of tube: estivation
                    twisted. Stamens twice as numerous: filaments arising from scales: anthers

                    solitary: style simple: stigma 4-5-lobed. Fruit of 4-5 indehiscent drupes

                <p>These five may, if one pleases, be viewed as orders belonging to one class. The
                    last of them is the most distinct, and is closely allied to the Ochnaceae. Some
                    few Diosmeae have the stamens perigynous, but the great passage to the
                    Peripetalae is through the Zanthoxyleae, many of which are very closely allied
                    to the Terebinthaceae.—Of the Zygophylleae some are anthelmintic; others are
                    acrid and bitter, and are employed as sudorifics, diaphoretics, or alteratives.
                    Of the Ruteae the common rue is sudorific, anthelmintic, and emmenagogue. The
                    Diosmeae of the Cape are considered antispasmodics; of America, febrifuge: and
                    the root of <hi rend="italic">Dictamnus</hi> was formerly used as a sudorific
                    and vermifuge. Almost all the Zanthoxyleae are aromatic and pungent; some are
                    powerful sudorifics and diaphoretics; of others the bark is bitter. <hi
                    rend="italic">Brucea</hi> contains a poisonous principle called Brucia. The
                    Simarou-beae are all intensely bitter.</p>

                    imbricate or valvular. Petals 5,equal, inserted at the base of the calyx.
                    Stamens twice as many as the petals, inserted with the petals, or somewhat
                    hypogynous: filaments usually arising from a glandular or annular torus (formed
                    by the union of their glandular bases). Ovaria apocarpous, solitary, or several:
                    ovules in pairs, collateral, ascending: styles terminal: stigmas obtuse, usually
                    dilated. Capsules 1-5, dehiscing longitudinally at the ventral suture. Seeds
                    solitary, erect, sometimes with an arillus. Albumen none, or fleshy. Radicle
                    superior, at the opposite extremity from the hilum: cotyledons thick when there
                    is no albumen, foliaceous in those with it.— Trees or shrubs, without resinous

                    to the last it is so closely allied as scarcely to be sometimes distinguishable
                    from it, except by the radicle being at the opposite end from the hilum. When
                    there is but one capsule, as in <hi rend="italic">Connarus</hi> (to which may be
                    united the first section of <hi rend="italic">Ompalobium</hi> of De Candolle),
                    it is opposite the anterior segment of the calyx, as in Leguminosae: when
                    several, as in Cnestis, they alternate. Brown thinks the insertion ought to be
                    described as hypogynous. *</p>

                <p>This order touches upon many others, but it is particularly allied to the almond
                    tribe among the Rosaceae, from which, till lately that Mr Brown pointed it out
                    in the relative positions of the calyx and pistillum, no good character had been
                    discovered to separate them.—This family is among the most important to man,
                    whether as affording objects of beauty, of utility, or of nutriment. The bean,
                    the pea, the vetch,, and the clover tribe belong to it; as do the logwood, the
                    laburnum, indigo, the tamarind, senna, and the acacias. Its general property is
                    to be wholesome; but there are several exceptions. Thus, the seeds of Laburnum
                    and the juice of <hi rend="italic">Coronilla varia</hi> are poisonous. Senna,
                    obtained from several species of <hi rend="italic">Cassia,</hi> is purgative;
                    several other plants are also purgative. The pericarp of some contains much
                    tannin. Several kinds of gums and balsams are got from them. But it would
                    consume pages to enumerate all the uses to which this, one of the most extensive
                    orders in the vegetable kingdom, has been applied.</p>

                    the Neillicae form a passage to the Homalineae: but as for the others, we do not
                    see how they are to be limited <hi rend="italic">inter se.</hi> The true
                    Sanguisorbeae have no petals, few stamens, and definite ovaria; while the
                    Potentilleae ought to have petals, numerous stamens, and numerous carpels: but

                    are well known: the leaves and kernel contain hydrocyanic acid, and arc usually
                    poisonous. The other suborders are in general wholesome: they contain an
                    astringent principle, on account of which some are used as febrifuges: the roots

                <p>Calyx 4-ð-lobed, lobes deciduous. Petals alternate with the lobes, or wanting.
                    Stamens twice as many as the lobes, rarely equal in number to them or thrice as

                    Ovarium adherent with the tube of the calyx, one-celled: ovules 2-4, pendulous
                    from the apex of the cavity: style one, slender: stigma simple. Fruit
                    drupaceous, baccate, or nut-like, one-celled, indehiscent, often winged. Seed
                    solitary (by abortion), pendulous. Albumen none. Radicle superior: cotyledons
                    leafy, usually convolute, sometimes plicate.—Trees or shrubs. Leaves alternate

                <p>Order 69. <hi rend="italic">Melastomaceae.</hi> Juss.</p>
                <p>Calyx with four or five teeth or divisions, which are more or less deep, or are
                    sometimes united and separate from the tube like a lid. Petals equal to the
                    segments of the calyx, perigynous. Stamens equal in number to the petals, and
                    alternate with them, usually with intermediate sterile ones: filaments in
                    estivation bent downwards between the carpels and the calyx: anthers long,
                    two-celled, usually bursting by two terminal pores, sometimes longitudinally.
                    Ovarium with several cells, more or less cohering with the calyx by its angles,
                    but otherwise free: ovules indefinite: style one: stigma simple, entire,

                <p>. Bordering on both the Salicaricae and Myrtaceae, but differing from these and
                    other allied orders in several particulars. The great characteristic of this
                    order is the singular situation of the filaments in estivation.—There are no
                    unwholesome species in this large family, and the succulent fruit of several is
                    eatable and pleasant. They all possess a slight degree of astringency.</p>
                <p>Order 70. <hi rend="italic">Alangicae.</hi> D. C.</p>
                <p>Calyx campanulate, 5-10-toothed, with an annular fleshy disc, or continuation of
                    the torus at the base of the segments. Petals as many as the segments of the
                    calyx, linear, reflexed: estivation twisted. Stamens long, exserted, two or four
                    times as many as the petals: filaments distinct, villous at the base: anthers
                    introrse, two-celled, often sterile. Ovarium globose: style one, subulate:
                    stigma capitate or conical. Berry (balausta) oval, coherent with the tube of the
                    calyx, and somewhat crowned by its limb, fleshy, slightly ribbed, 1-3-celled:
                    endocarp sometimes osseous, and separating from the sarcocarp like a putamen.
                    Seeds solitary, pendulous. Albumen fleshy, brittle. Embryo straight: radicle
                    long, ascending: cotyledons flat, foliaceous.—Trees. Leaves alternate,

                <p>Closely allied to the Melastomaceae, from which they differ in very few
                    particulars. To Myrtaceae they also bear so strong a resemblance, that till
                    lately they were inserted in that order.—The fruit is eatable. The juice of the
                    root is said to be vermifuge and hydragogic; and the root itself, in powder,
                    efficacious against the bite of serpents.</p>

                    two rows, or rarely ten. Ovarium coherent with the tube of the calyx: styles
                    distinct, or united into one: stigmas</p>

                    simple. Placentae in the axis. Fruit dry or fleshy, dehiscent or indehiscent,
                    2-6 or many-celled, or by the obliteration of the dissepiments one-celled. Seeds
                    rarely solitary, or few, usually indefinite. Albumen 0. Embryo straight or

                    monadelphous stamens, opposite or verticillate leaves without dots. 5. <hi

                    a lid or remains closed, monadelphous stamens, and leaves alternate, and not
                    dotted. To the Myrteae we, with Mr Lindley, unite the Granateae, because <hi
                    rend="italic">Punica</hi> or the pomegranate only differs by having its two
                    verticels of carpels developed instead of one, as in plants not in a state of
                    cultivation: the inner series (or those at the bottom of the fruit) have their
                    placentae in the axis; but the outer series, forced to the top of the fruit by
                    the contraction of the mouth of the tube of the calyx, having their placentae in
                    the ovary at the back of the inner carpels, exhibit them in the ripe fruit in a
                    horizontal position on the upper surface of the lower cells.—The dots on the
                    leaves and other parts indicate the presence of a volatile oil, which is
                    aromatic and pungent, and gives the perfume to the cloves of commerce, and to
                    several fruits of this order. The fleshy seeds of the Lecythideae are eatable,

                <p>This family bears so much affinity to the Caryophylleae, and to Illecebreae, that
                    it is difficult to discriminate them. Caryophylleae have, however, no stipules,
                    nor a pyxidium, nor a calyx of two sepals; and the stamens (when few) are
                    opposite to the sepals, and hypogynous. Illecebreae and Sclerantheae, on the
                    other hand, have fertile stamens opposite the sepals, alternating with others
                    that are either fertile or sterile, or with petals, which are sometimes wanting.

                <p>Upon carefully examining these suborders, they will be found to present no
                    difference but the presence or absence of the membranous stipules. These,
                    however, will distinguish the Illecebreae from both the Caryophylleae and
                    Amaranthaceae, and the accessory stamens or petals will separate the
                    Sclerantheae from the Chenopodeae. The Paronychicae, as a whole, form the
                    passage to the Mono-cblamydeae; for what are here termed petals or .abortive
                    stamens, constitute in the Amaranthaceae what are often called processes or
                    teeth between the stamens, nor is there any practical difference between them.

                <p>These two suborders are principally allied by their carpels not being attached to

                <p>We follow De Candolle in not breaking up this large order, each tribe passing
                    imperceptibly into another. It seems to form a central point between several

                    Thus, through Escallonieae it is allied to the Grossu-lariae and Vaccinicae; to

                    though fleshy, is very oily ;.and the embryo is in the centre of the albumen,
                    with the radicle pointing to the hilum. Mr Lindley says, erroneously, that the

                    of the hilum.”— The species of Saxifrageae are astringent; the properties of the

                    ones in each cell, very rarely numerous: style simple or biful: stigmas one, or

                <p>Calyx four-lobed or truncate, with 5-7 callous teeth. Petals inserted on the

                    stamens. Stamens twice as many as the petals; all fertile when the petals bear
                    anthers, half of them (those opposite to the petals) sterile when there are true
                    petals: anthers erect, two-celled, each cell dehiscing longitudinally at the
                    side, either by a valve opening inwards, or by a simple fissure. Ovarium
                    coherent at the base with the tube of the calyx, two-celled: styles two (rarely
                    by accident three). Capsule two-celled, two-valved, 1oculicide. Seeds solitary,
                    pendulous. Embryo straight, in the axis of a fleshy albumen: radicle superior,
                    next the hilum: cotyledons foliaceous, plane, or slightly involute at their
                    base.—Shrubs. Leaves alternate, petiolate, penninerved, with two stipules.
                    Flowers axillary, nearly sessile, fasciculate, usually with bracteas, sometimes

                    to think them‘nearest to Ranunculaceae. Perhaps each flower is made up of two, a
                    structure explained by that of <hi rend="italic">Dampiera</hi> among the

                    must be looked for.—The fundamental organs of this order are usually very
                    poisonous, at all events ought to be looked on with suspicion, although the

                    is in no case hurtful, and is usually a warm and agreeable aromatic. Gum

                    with the Apocyneae and Gentianeae that they were most generally confounded,
                    previous to the separation of the Loganiaceae. <hi rend="italic">Houstonia,</hi>
                    referred still by De Candolle to the Gentianeae, has an inferior (adherent)
                    ovarium, interpetiolar stipules, a bilocular polyspermous capsule, and seeds not
                    winged, and consequently must be arranged here, at the end of the
                    Hedyotideae.—The roots (as in <hi rend="italic">Rubia</hi> or the Madder)
                    sometimes yield an excellent red dye; in others they are acrid, emetic,

                    Peruvian bark) is sometimes bitter, tonic, astringent, and aromatic, and
                    eminently powerful in intermittent fevers. The horny albumen of the <hi

                <p>The position of the anthers in this order, combined with the tube at the base of
                    the style in some of the Campanulaceae, serves to explain the structure of the

                    distinguished by the gynandrous stamens, from those in its vicinity.</p>

                <p>Calyx usually five-lobed (sometimes 3-8-lobed), rarely entire, persistent.

                    cleft, deciduous or marcescent: lobes with a central principal nerve: estivation
                    valvate. Stamens inserted with the corolla, alternating with its lobes, and
                    equal to them in number: anthers two-celled, distinct or cohering, erect,
                    two-celled, bursting longitudinally. Ovarium cohering, wholly or by its lower
                    half, with the tube of the calyx, of two or more carpels: ovules indefinite:
                    style simple: stigma naked, simple, or with as many lobes as cells to the
                    ovarium. Placentae in the axis of the plurilocular, or parietal in the
                    one-celled ovaria. Fruit capsular, one or more celled, loculicidal, dehiscing
                    either by lateral fissures, or by valves at the apex. Seeds indefinite. Embryo
                    straight, in the axis of a fleshy albumen: radicle pointing to the
                    hilum.—Plants, yielding a milky juice. Leaves alternate or rarely opposite,

                <p>Tribe 1. <hi rend="italic">Lobelieoe.</hi> Juss. Odd segment of the calyx
                    anterior: corolla irregular: anthers cohering: pollen ovate, elongated, smooth,
                    marked by a longitudinal furrow: style glabrous, with a fringe of hairs below
                    the stigma. —Ex. <hi rend="italic">Lobelia.</hi></p>
                <p>Tribe 2. <hi rend="italic">Campanuleae.</hi> D. C. Odd segment of the calyx

                <p>The distinguishing characters of these two tribes are perhaps too few to afford
                    ordinal characters. The hairs on the style or under the stigma seem to be
                    intended for the absorption of the vivifying part of the pollen. There is an
                    expansion of the torus (or abortive stamens) at the insertion of the corolla and
                    stamens, and this sometimes not only covers the top of the ovary, but even forms
                    a tube round the style (as in <hi rend="italic">Adenophora).</hi> The cells of
                    the fruit are usually opposite the calycine segments, rarely alternate with
                    them. In the Lobelicae the odd sepal is really anterior, although by a twist in
                    the pedicel it appears posterior.—The milky juice is acrid, and in some cases
                    poisonous.</p>

                <p>Between Monotropeae and Ericeae there is no certain character but in the testa of
                    the seed; the mode by which the anthers dehisce being variable in both, even
                    although we exclude <hi rend="italic">Pyrola,</hi> as has been already done by
                    Don. Ericeae is usually described with indefinite ovules; but <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cy-rilla,</hi> usually referred here, has them solitary in each cell. Between
                    Ericeae and Vaccineae no character can be given, farther than the ovarium free
                    or adherent: the habit of several species in both is the same. Between Ericeae
                    and Epacrideae, again, there is almost nothing but the structure of the anthers
                    and a difference of habit; we therefore consider them all as suborders. As a
                    whole, it is difficult to say what are the affinities. In some points they
                    slightly approach to the Campanulaceae, and in others to the Saxifrageae
                    (Escallonicae and Cunonicae).—Their general properties are astringent and
                    diuretic. The berries of the succulent fruited species are mostly grateful and
                    eatable: the Bilberries, Cranberries, Bearberries, &amp;c. belong to this
                    family. The fruit of the <hi rend="italic">Arbutus unedo</hi> (so called because

                <p>We have now entered upon a group to be distinguished with great difficulty, so
                    much do the orders run into each other; and indeed more than one botanist have
                    suggested that the Rubiaceae, Apocyneae, Loganiaceae, and Gentianeae, may form
                    one class. Gentianeae, however, touches upon Scrophularineae, and this again on
                    various others, so that we scarcely know what limits to impose on the series.
                    <hi rend="italic">Strychnos, Clarissa,</hi> and some others, have been separated
                    by Jussieu as a distinct order, having a simple fruit, and peltate seeds without
                    a coma. To this, perhaps, <hi rend="italic">Gardnera</hi> belongs, having a

                    ecomose seeds, all of which might as well be made orders; besides, we doubt if,
                    by having only one stigma, the ovarium ought' to be ever considered as different
                    from a syncarpous one.— The milk seems still more deleterious than that of the

                    Although we have termed the fruit in all these four-celled, it, however,

                    contain nitrate of potash, which gives a coolness to the beverage in which their
                    leaves are steeped. The roots of others give out a reddish brown dye.</p>

                    the present order thus made more rigorous, we cannot point out a decided

                    is little known.—Upon the whole, the leaves of the Solaneae are narcotic and
                    acrid; those of <hi rend="italic">Verbascum,</hi> however, and probably of the
                    others with an imbricate corolla, are mucilaginous. The roots are usually
                    poisonous. The fruit is also in general very poisonous, although, whether by the
                    effects of cultivation, or some peculiarity in the plants themselves, that of
                    the Love-apple, Tomato, Capsicum, and a few others, are eaten without
                    inconvenience. The tubers formed on the potato-plant are, when boiled, highly
                    alimentary. The dominant property of these vegetables is their stupifying

                <p>After Brown, we unite the Pediculares of Jussieu to the Scrophularineae, the two
                    kinds of dehiscence of the capsule being found sometimes in the same genus.
                    Richard, in 1828, proposed to make use of another character, viz. the direction
                    of the embryo, which he supposes to be orthotropous in the true Scrophularineae,
                    and heterotropous or inverted in the Pediculares or Rhinanthaceae. Mr Lindley
                    has therefore lately availed himself of this structure. But the only genera we
                    can discover with a heterotropous embryo are, <hi rend="italic">Rhinanthus,
                    Melampyrum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pedicularis; Euphrasia</hi> and <hi

                    above three the embryo is minute, while in all the others it occupies a great
                    part of the length of the albumen.—This family presents no great uniformity in
                    its properties; the greater number, nevertheless, containing a principle more or
                    less acrid, purgative in <hi rend="italic">Gra-tiola</hi> and some <hi

                    the one aromatic and stimulant owing to the abundance of the essential oil, the
                    other bitter; and, according as the one or the other predominates, so they are

                    as many, and in two rows, in which case the outer row is almost' always fertile,
                    while such of the inner row as are opposite the inner segments of the perianth
                    are sterile: filaments of the inner row often with glands at their base: anthers
                    2-4 celled, cells opening by a longitudinal persistent valve from the base to
                    the apex, outer row introrse, inner row extrorse. Ovarium single, free or rarely

                    definite.—The use of the mace or arillus, and albumen, of the nutmeg, is well
                    known, as highly aromatic. The bark, however, has an acrid juice, and the fleshy

                <p>We have examined the structure of the seeds of this order, and have come to the
                    same conclusions as Gaertner, Lindley, and Kunth. The nucleus seems quite
                    homogeneous, solid, and fleshy. There is no part in particular that one can
                    describe as albumen, or cotyledons, or radicle; but from the situation of the
                    foramen in the ovule, it may be presumed that the radicle points to the hilum.
                    In those with erect seeds, the raphe is on the outer side of the seed, that is,
                    at the opposite side from the placenta, and therefore we consider them
                    resupinate. —The Gum-resin called Sarcocolla is obtained from several

                <p>The above account of this little-known order we owe to Mr Lindley; and, if his
                    observations be correct, the seed is probably suspended, and the radicle at the
                    opposite extremity from the hilum. On account of the capsule being extremely
                    compressed at the sutures of the valves, it is very difficult to determine
                    whether the margins are not so much introflexed as to meet, and thus form a true
                    dissepiment, and the fruit two-celled, as it has hitherto been described by
                    Gaertner and Lamarck. Gaertner, moreover, describes and figures the seeds of <hi
                    rend="italic">Gyrinops</hi> as ascending. Nothing yet is known of the internal
                    structure of the seed. Mr Brown arranges this order next to, if it do not form
                    part of, Chailletiaceae, <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> and mentions its
                    relation to Thymeleae. The ambiguous kind of capsule, and appendage to the
                    seeds, seem to point out some affinity with Penaeaceae and Polygaleae. If the
                    above description be correct, this order borders very closely on the

                <p>This order is usually arranged among the Monochlamydeae, and next the Urticeae;
                    but if Coriaricae belong to the Thalamiflorae, so ought the Euphorbiaceae, for
                    the petaloid bodies, often in this family reduced to mere glands, are of the
                    same nature in both. The stigmas of many Euphorbiaceae resemble much those of
                    Coriaricae; and perhaps the true place for them in a linear series is between
                    the Coriaricae and Celastrineae.—The plants of this order are acrid, caustic,
                    and poisonous. Their deleterious effects are owing to the milky juice which most
                    of them possess; but they may be deprived of this very easily by means of heat,
                    so that the root of the <hi rend="italic">Ianipha Manioc</hi> becomes a
                    wholesome food. The albumen of the seed contains much fat and sweet oil, but the
                    embryo is acrid and .purgative. It is impossible to give here the various
                    modifications of the properties to be found in this family. They are discussed

                <p>We follow Richard and some others in combining these three. The Ulmaceae,
                    however, from the two-celled ovarium, ought perhaps, as has been done by De
                    Candolle and Duby, to be united to the Amentaceae. Mr Brown says that they
                    should be rejected on account of the pendulous ovules. But then he states
                    Artocarpeae to have the ovules erect. Mr Lindley, however, finds them suspended.
                    We have in several species observed them to be peritropal, and in general
                    attached to a point opposite the base of the style: the radicle is however

                    in the purely staminiferous involucra very numerous, inserted into the bottom of
                    the involucrum, mixed with scales; in the involucra having also pistilla, they
                    are fewer, and arise from its orifice: anthers adnate, two-celled, bursting with
                    a valve that separates from the base to the apex. Ovaria several, usually
                    indefinite: ovule solitary, erect: styles simple, sometimes arising from the
                    side or the base: stigma undivided. Achenia furnished with the persistent
                    styles, become feathery, included within the enlarged tube of the involucre.
                    Seed solitary, erect. Embryo short, at the base of a soft fleshy albumen:
                    radicle inferior.—Trees. Leaves opposite, exstipulate. Flowers axillary,

                <p>The anthers indicate some affinity to the Berberideae and Laurineae. Mr Brown and
                    Mr Lindley consider the involucre a perianth. We have been induced to differ
                    from them only by the analogy subsisting between this order and Monimicae, with
                    which they agree in many very important points; like them they are aromatic.</p>

                <p>Perianth in several narrow divisions, covered by a dilated bractea. Stamen one,
                    hypogynous: anther two-celled, separated by a thick two-lobed connectivum,
                    bursting transversely. Torus a fleshy disc. Ovarium free, one-celled: ovules
                    several, ascending: style scarcely any: stigmas two, three, or four; small,
                    subulate, spreading. Placentas parietal. Fruit capsular, 2-3- or 4-valved,
                    loculicide. Seed usually (by abortion) solitary, suspended from a long
                    funiculus, with a fleshy arillus: testa crustaceous. Embryo in a fleshy albumen:
                    radicle straight, cylindrical, superior: cotyledons flat.—Small trees or shrubs.
                    Leaves simple, alternate, exstipulate. Flowers in axillary clustered
                    catkins.—Ex. <hi rend="italic">Lacistema.</hi></p>
                <p>Martius and Lindley attribute to this a fleshy albumen; St Hilaire and Kunth say
                    there is none. Some authors suppose the perianth to consist only of four pieces,
                    accompanied with one or more bracteae, and the whole surrounded by a large
                    bractea. We, however, are rather inclined to consider the supposed perianth as
                    mere processes from the torus, and consequently this tribe approaches very near
                    to the Chlorantheae. Although all the flowers are bisexual, the upper ones only
                    of the catkin are fertile, whence we have arranged the order among the Dielines,
                    with which it is otherwise most allied.</p>

                    pores, resembling a piece of the most delicate net-work. Each mesh is bounded by
                    straight lines crossing each other at nearly right angles, and the concentric

                <p>The above view of the structure of these plants being nearly that adopted by

                    by Mr Brown, who considers the outer row of our perianth as accessory, and what
                    is here called the outer sterile stamens to be the inner row of the perianth.
                    But this order is closely allied to the Musaceae, and the affinity is confirmed
                    by the supposition of six stamens, although only one be perfect.—The Scitamineae
                    are aromatic, cordial, and stomachic: Ginger, Galangale, and Zedoary are the
                    roots or rhizoma; Cardamoms are the seeds of several species. The Canneae are
                    scarcely or not at all aromatic, and hence the fecula which abounds in the root
                    furnishes a delicate article of food. Arrow-root is obtained from more than one

                <p>Gilliesicae is a singular suborder; and even the view we have taken is neither
                    that of Lindley nor Hooker. They regard our perianth as bracteal or involucral
                    leaves, and the outer row of stamens as the perianth; we consider the whole

                    appears at first sight to consist of only two of the parts, while the others
                    seem external, but in estivation that series is formed of three of them. The
                    outer series of stamens (sterile) has subulate appendages projected outwardly

                    hilum; and if this view be correct, Alismaceae ought to consist of Alismoideae

                <p>We continue to unite these suborders. The difference between the two first is
                    reduced to the structure of the stamens, for the same number and position of the

                    its constituent genera as betwixt either and the true Aroideae. It is·difficult
                    to determine the position of the radicle in <hi rend="italic">Pistia;</hi> but
                    as the inner integument (tegmen) of the seed is pendulous in the ovule, we are
                    forced to suppose that the radicle points to the hilum, although the embryo
                    itself is at the other extremity, a structure very uncommon. What we suppose the
                    chalaza, Mr Lindley, however, describes as an indurated foramen, and

                    >Pistia,</hi> the radicle would be turned away from the hilum; but this

                    The apex of the seed, however, in that genus has a strong depression, or
                    orifice, caused by the separation of the chalaza, and its attachment to the apex
                    of the embryo.—All the Aroideae are acrid; and this principle is sometimes so
                    strong as to render various species very poisonous. The flat underground stems,
                    and the leaves of many, are however harmless, and, when boiled or röasted, are
                    even nutritive.</p>
                <p>Order 195. <hi rend="italic">Potameae.</hi> Juss.</p>
                <p>Flowers bi-or unisexual. Perianth two or four-parted, often deciduous, sometimes
                    wanting. Stamens definite, hypogynous. Ovarium one or more, free, inserted on
                    the receptacle or central spadix.: ovule solitary in each ovarium: style one or
                    none: stigma one, entire or rarely two-or three-parted. Fruit dry, indehiscent,
                    one-celled. Seed solitary, pendulous, or suspended. Albumen 0. Embryo straight
                    or curved, with a lateral cleft for the emission of the plumule: radicle very
                    large, inferior, pointing to the extremity remote from the hilum.—Water plants.
                    Leaves very cellular, with parallel veins. Flowers minute. —Ex. <hi

                <p>The structure of the seed of <hi rend="italic">Zostera</hi> is explained by that
                    of <hi rend="italic">Rnppia,</hi> where the great mass of the embryo is the
                    radicle with a cleft for the emission of the plumule. If we suppose, with
                    Richard, that in no case is the flower of Potameae bisexual, but that even in
                    <hi rend="italic">Potamogeton</hi> the perianth is a four-partite spatha, we
                    shall readily see how closely this order approaches to the Aroideae.—Of little

                <p>Flowers naked, bisexual, bursting through an irregularly lacerated spatha.
                    Stamens hypogynous, definite or indefinite, monadelphous, alternately sterile
                    and shorter. Ovarium free, spuriously two-celled: ovules numerous: styles two or
                    none: stigmas two or three. Placenta forming the dissepiment. Fruit slightly
                    pedicellate, capsular, two-valved, septicide, the valves falling off from the
                    dissepimental placenta. Seeds indefinite, minute.—Herbaceous, branched, floating
                    plants. Leaves capillary or linear, or irregularly lacerated, or minute and
                    imbricated. Flowers minute.—Ex. <hi rend="italic">Podosternum, Lacis,
                    Mniopsis.</hi></p>
                <p>ſhe internal structure of the seed is still unknown. Martius says it is
                    homogeneous; but we may rather compare them with the seeds of such Potameae as
                    consist almost entirely of an immense radicle; and there are many other points
                    of resemblance between the two orders. Mr Lindley arranges Podostemeae between
                    Piperaceae and Callitrichineae (Halorageae).—No properties are known.</p>
                <p>Order 197. <hi rend="italic">Cyperaceae.</hi> Juss.</p>
                <p>Flowers bi-or unisexual, furnished each with a solitary bracteole called a <hi

                    on a common axis. Perianth rarely membranaceous, 2-3-valved, the valves distinct
                    or united: generally entirely wanting. Stamens hypogynous, definite (1-12), with
                    sometimes an additional row of abortive filaments or <hi rend="italic"
                    >setae:</hi> anthers erect, two-celled: ovarium one-celled: ovule one, erect:
                    style single, three-cleft or biful: stigmas undivided, or occasionally biful.
                    Fruit an achenium or nut. Embryo lenticular, seated at the base of a farinaceous
                    albumen, and covered by a very thin membranous projection of it: plumule
                    inconspicuous.—Roots fibrous. Stems often without joints. Sheaths of the leaves
                    entire.—Ex. <hi rend="italic">Cyperus, Scirpus, Scleria, Carex.</hi></p>
                <p>We have slightly altered the character of the order from that usually given; for
                    while we consider <hi rend="italic">Carex</hi> and some others to have a true
                    perianth, we cannot regard the hypogynous setae of authors in the same light,
                    they being more analogous to abortive stamens, and consequently to a corolla.
                    The Cyperaceae are closely allied to the Gramineae.—The herbage of this order
                    contains almost no nutritive principle. The roots of some are succulent, and
                    possess diaphoretic and demulcent properties: those of <hi rend="italic">Cyperus
                    esculentus</hi> are said to be eaten; those of <hi rend="italic">Cyperus
                    longus</hi> are bitter and tonic; those of <hi rend="italic">Cyperus
                    odoratus</hi> have a warm aromatic taste. The <hi rend="italic">Cyperus
                    Papyrus</hi> yielded the paper of the Egyptians. Some species of <hi

                <p>Order 198. <hi rend="italic">Gramineae.</hi> Juss.</p>
                <p>Flowers usually bisexual, sometimes unisexual or polygamous; one, two, or more
                    being seated on a common rachis, which is contained within an involucre, that
                    consists of one or two valves <hi rend="italic">{glumes),</hi> or is rarely
                    wanting; the whole constituting a <hi rend="italic">locusta.</hi> Partial
                    involucre similar to the glun¢es, of two (rarely one) dissimilar valves <hi
                    rend="italic">(glurnellae</hi> or <hi rend="italic">paleae);</hi> outer or lower
                    simple, usually carinate: inner with two nerves or keels, and hence formed of
                    two pieces cohering by their contiguous margins. Lodicule (abortive stamens ?)
                    of two (rarely one) hypogynous minute scales, sometimes wanting. Stamens
                    hypogynous, 1-6, or rarely indefinite: anthers two-celled, versatile: ovarium
                    simple: ovule one: style one, bipartite, rarely simple or tripartite: stigmas
                    plumose or hairy. Pericarp a caryopsis. Albumen farinaceous. Embryo lenticular,
                    external, lying on one side of the albumen near its base.—Culms cylindrical,
                    hollow, jointed. Leaves alternate: sheath split. Locustae of flowers arranged in
                    spikes, racemes, or panicles.—Ex. <hi rend="italic">Panicum, Avena,
                    An-thoxanthum.</hi></p>
                <p>The above, with some slight variations, is the account of the structure of these
                    plants most usually adopted. Some botanists term the partial involucre the
                    perianth, others view the lodicule in that light; perhaps if a perianth be
                    present, it must be looked for in the upper glu-mella alone. Their affinity with
                    Cyperaceae is evident.— This order, whether as furnishing food to man or beast,
                    is one of the most important in the whole vegetable kingdom. Wheat, barley,
                    oats, rice, guinea corn, millet, maize, and the sugar-cane, belong to it. The
                    cuticle contains a large quantity of silex. This abounds so much in the
                    sugarcane, that by the mere using that plant for fuel in the extraction of
                    sugar, the fire-place is soon choked up by large masses of a coarse kind of
                    glass. The siliceous matter of the bamboo is often secreted at the diseased
                    joints, and forms the mineral called Tabasheer. The straw of different grasses
                    is plaited, and made into ladies’ bonnets: that used at Leghorn is the <hi

                    so are merely the involute contracted segments of the deformed frond that bears

                    furnish the materials of which the edible swallows’ nests are composed. It is
                    remarked by Lamaroux that three species of swallow construct edible nests, two
                    of which build at a distance from the sea coast, and use the sea-weed only as a
                    cement for other matters. The nests of the third are consequently most esteemed,

                    of the Mediterranean, and held once a considerable reputation as a vermifuge.
                    The most important medical use, however (omitting minor ones), derived from
                    sea-weeds, is through the medium of Iodine, which may be obtained either from
                    the plants themselves or from kelp. French kelp, according to Sir II. Davy,
                    yields more Iodine than British; and, from some recent experiments made at the
                    Cape of Good Hope by Μ. Ecklon, <hi rend="italic">Laminaria buccinalis</hi> is
                    found to contain more than any European Algae. Iodine is known to be a powerful
                    remedy in cases of goitre. But were the Algae neither <hi rend="superscript">
                    ζ</hi> really serviceable either in supplying the wants, or in administering to
                    the comforts, of mankind’ in any other respect, their character would be
                    redeemed by their usefulness in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193734870"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-4870-0139"/> the arts; and it is highly probable that we shall
                    find ourselves eventually infinitely more indebted to them. One species (and I
                    regret to say that it is not a British one) is invaluable as a glue and varnish
                    to the Chinese. This is the <hi rend="italic">Gracillaria tenax,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fucus tenax</hi> of Turner’s <hi rend="italic">Historia
                    Fucorum.</hi> Though a small plant, the quantity annually imported at Canton
                    from the provinces of Tokien and Tche-kiang is stated by Mr Turner to be about
                    27,000 pounds. It is sold at Canton for 6d. or 8d. per pound, and is used for
                    the purposes to which we apply glue and gum-arabic. The Chinese employ it
                    chiefly in the manufacture of lanterns, to strengthen or varnish the paper, and
                    sometimes to thicken or give a gloss to silks or gauze. In addition to the above
                    account, the substance of which I have extracted from Mr Turner’s work, Mr Neill
                    remarks that <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> it seems probable that this is the
                    principal ingredient in the celebrated gummy matter called Chinchow, or
                    Hai-tsai, in China and Japan. Windows made merely of slips of bamboo, crossed
                    diagonally, have frequently their lozenge-shaped interstices wholly filled with
                    the transparent gluten of the Hai-tsai. ’ On the southern and western coasts of
                    Ireland, our own <hi rend="italic">Chondrus crispus</hi> is converted into size
                    for the use of the house-painters, &amp;c., and, if I be not erroneously
                    informed, is also considered as a culinary article, and enters into the
                    composition of blanc-mange, as well as other dishes. In the manufacture of kelp,
                    however, for the use of the glass-maker and soap-boiler, it is that the Algae
                    take their place among the most useful vegetables. The species most valuable for
                    this purpose are, <hi rend="italic">Fucus vesiculosus, nodosus,</hi> and <hi

                <p>Some Lichens were formerly supposed to grow in water. This is still allowed by
                    Fries, but he denies that they ever fructify there; and he has further observed,
                    that several of what were termed Algae, upon being removed from that element and
                    exposed to the sun, produce shields and become Lichens. “Lichens,” says De
                    Candolle, “present two classes of properties, lsŕ, the dyeing properties, which
                    are developed by different agents, and especially by maceration in urine,
                    properties which are common to all the species, but particularly to such as

                    equally suited to the same purpose. The Orchale or Archill, and Cudbear, of
                    various kinds, are all famed for the dye they give out.</p>

                <p>This order presents many anomalies. Some are wholesome, others extremely
                    poisonous; nor does this diversity of property seem at all connected with their
                    external forms, many most allied in appearance being extremely distinct in their
                    virtues; and the difficulty of distinguishing the two kinds is known by all who
                    have turned their attention to the subject. In this country, therefore, scarcely
                    more than one or two mushrooms are eaten; in France, Italy, and Germany, more
                    are used; and in Russia many are employed which are elsewhere considered as
                    poisonous. Either the climate or the mode of cooking must thus operate in
                    rendering these wholesome. The dry rot is caused by several species of
                    parasitical Fungi, as <hi rend="italic">Polyporus destructor, Merulius
                    vastator</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lacrymans,</hi> &amp;c. The blights in corn,
                    mildew, smut, and ergot, are also Fungi of the same description. Mouldiness,
                    whether in cheese or on books, is also constituted of small parasitical Fungi,
                    and is best prevented by the presence of an essential oil. Amadou or German
                    tinder is prepared from some kinds of <hi rend="italic">Eoletus</hi> (as <hi
                    rend="italic">B. ignarius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fouιentaulus),</hi> and
                    afterwards impregnated with nitre.</p>
                <p>We have now presented an account of all the natural orders of plants acknowledged
                    up to the present time; and, on studying their characters, we are forced to draw
                    the following conclusions. 1. That the difference between an ovarium free, or
                    adherent with the tube of the calyx, is weakened by many genera, as by comparing
                    the Loaseae with the allied family of Turneraceae, and by the genera of
                    Dipsaceae, in which the ovarium is adherent at the apex and not below. 2. The
                    difference between hypogynous and perigynous stamens is often imperceptible,
                    this depending on the greater or less expansion of the torus: the same may be
                    said of the epigynous and gynandrous insertions. 3. Loculicide or septicide
                    dehiscence of the fruit depends only on the greater or less adhesion of the
                    sides, or of the middle of the valves; both, in certain states,-being liable, to
                    dehisce. 4. The parietal placenta is merely that modification of the other kind
                    in which the introflexed margin of the valves is little apparent. 5. Petals may
                    be accidentally more or less combined by their margins into a gamopetalous
                    corolla, or maybe entirely absent; so that there is no limit between
                    gamopetalous, polypetalous, and apetalous orders. 6. Stamens may be more or less
                    combined, or distinct. 7. Stamens may become abortive, and even change into
                    petals. 8. St Hilaire has shown that there are many ambiguous states in the
                    relative positions of the radicle of the embryo and the hilum of the seed.</p>
                <p>Thus the great characters for defining natural orders are impaired. To none in
                    particular can we trust at all times; and it is only by a combination of several
                    tolerably constant ones that, in the present state of our knowledge, we can
                    attain that most desirable end of botanical classification, the natural
                    approximation of genera. (u. u.)</p>
