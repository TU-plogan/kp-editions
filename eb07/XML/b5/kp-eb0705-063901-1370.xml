                    of the Argentine republic or united provinces of the Rio de la Plata, is
                    situated in the province of Buenos Ayres, on the southern margin of the river
                    Plata, in South America. This province is bounded on the north by the province
                    of Sante Fè and the rivers Parana and La Plata, on the east by the La Plata and
                    the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by the province of Santa Fè and the Indian
                    territory, and on the south by the country of the Indians. This latter boundary,
                    previous to 1822, was formed by the river Salado. The greatest diameter of the
                    province, then consisting of about 200 miles, extended from the mouth of the
                    Salado, at the bay of Samborombon, in south latitude 36°, in a north-westerly
                    direction, to the Arroyo en Medio, which separates it from Santa Fĕ, in south
                    latitude 33. 20.; the breadth of the province was estimated at about 70 miles;
                    and the area included about 1518 square leagues.</p>
                <p>In 1740 an imaginary line was drawn across the continent, in about 35° of south
                    latitude, to the south of which the Indians were understood to confine
                    themselves, and various forts were constructed for the defence of this frontier;
                    but these limits appear to have been little respected by either party, since the
                    Indians have been in the frequent practice of making incursions into the
                    frontier provinces, and plundering their inhabitants, or interrupting the
                    commercial intercourse maintained between the capital and the interior provinces
                    situated along the eastern base of the Andes. The inhabitants of the provinces,
                    and especially those of Buenos Ayres, have been gradually extending their <hi
                    rend="italic">estancias</hi> or breeding farms into the territory of the Indians
                    south of the river Salado, and more especially on the sea-coast of the Atlantic.
                    To render these possessions more secure, and to extend the jurisdiction of the
                    government of Buenos Ayres, an attempt was made in 1822 to obtain, by purchase
                    from the Indians, the cession of an extensive tract of land situated to the
                    south of the Salado. The principal Indian caziques having assembled to meet the
                    commissioner from the government of Buenos Ayres, consented to sell their lands,
                    but were so exorbitant in their demands that the negociation failed, partly
                    through the influence exercised by those tribes residing near the Andes and in
                    Chili, who were less immediately interested in the sale of these lands. The
                    failure of these laudable endeavours to accompliśh this object by amicable means
                    has led to consequences injurious not only to the Indians, but to the
                    industrious inhabitants of the province of Buenos Ayres. Both parties have had
                    recourse to arms. The Indians have made repeated irruptions into the possessions
                    of the latter, carrying off great quantities of cattle, and committing other
                    atrocities. The government of Buenos Ayres, on the other hand, has sent various
                    expeditions into their country; built fortresses; and established military posts
                    at Laguna Blanca, Cruz de Guerra, Federa-cion, and other places, on an advanced
                    frontier, extending nearly to the 38th degree of south latitude, and formed in
                    part by the insulated ranges of mountains known by the names of Las Sierras del
                    Volcan, del Tandil, and de la Ventana. Along the coast of the Atlantic they
                    possess establishments still farther to the south; the foundation of a new city,
                    called New Buenos Ayres, was laid in 1827, in an eligible situation to the north
                    of the mouth of the river Colorado, which enters the Atlantic in latitude 39.
                    40. S.; and they have long possessed a fortress and agricultural settlement near
                    the mouth of the Rio Negro de Patagones, called El Carmen de Patagones, with
                    which Buenos Ayres has hitherto communicated only by sea; but measures have been
                    taken to establish a more direct communication by land with these dependencies.
                    It is evidently the intention of the government of Buenos Ayres to extend their
                    frontiers to one or other of these rivers; an undertaking of great importance,
                    as it will not only afford protection to the numerous industrious settlers
                    established to the south of Buenos Ayres, by forming a defensible and
                    well-defined frontier, but will open up an extensive line of water communication
                    with the interior, and facilitate the conveyance of the valuable agricultural
                    products of the fertile provinces which extend along the eastern base of the
                    Andes.</p>
                <p>This extensive territory, south of the river Salado, which has in'this manner
                    been added to the province of Buenos Ayres, possesses a fine climate and very
                    fertile soil. It is considered as still better adapted for agricultural purposes
                    than that around Buenos Ayres, especially for the cultivation of wheat, which is
                    produced there in great abundance, and with more certainty than at the latter
                    place. The number of <hi rend="italic">estancias</hi> already formed in this
                    territory is very considerable, having reached the Sierras del Volcan and
                    Tandil, and they are yearly augmenting in number and importance; only requiring
                    the fostering care of a paternal government, and protection from the incursions
                    of the Indians, to insure their prosperity. Now that the civil dissensions have
                    terminated, it is expected that the inhabitants of the provinces which are in
                    contact with the Indian territory to the south will unite in the important
                    undertaking of forming a well-arranged frontier, connected by fortifications;
                    previously obtaining the consent of the Indians by purchase and other
                    conciliatory means, before having recourse to the force of arms.</p>
                <p>The whole extent of the province of Buenos Ayres forms one continuous and
                    unbroken plain, of great fertility, and covered with perpetual verdure.
                    Proceeding from the city upwards along the margin of the river Plata, the ground
                    is somewhat more elevated than the surrounding country; but to the westward the
                    same level surface extends across the Pampas, until it reaches the confines of
                    the province of Cordova, where the country gradually rises in elevation as it
                    approaches the base of the mountainous range of Cordova. To the south and
                    south-east the country presents the same monotonous appearance, unless where
                    interrupted by some inconsiderable elevations near the origin of the river
                    Salado, and farther south by the insulated range of mountains already mentioned,
                    called Tandil, Volcan, and La Ventana.</p>
                <p>Throughout this territory, especially towards the south, and in the vicinity of
                    the river Salado, there is a considerable<pb break="no" facs="nls:193741383"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-1383-0640"/> number of lakes, to many of which that river
                    forms an outlet. Some of these are very shallow, and are ' only filled with
                    water during the rainy season, at which times also considerable tracts of
                    country become so much inundated that they cannot be passed except on horseback.
                    On the approach of summer, and when exposed to the powerful influence of the
                    sun, the evaporation is so great that these inundations and many of the lakes
                    disappear, leaving the country in a very dry and parched condition, and very
                    deficient in the necessary supplies of water.</p>
                <p>To this great equality of surface may be attributed the very few rivers, even of
                    moderate size, which are to be found in such an extent of country. They are in
                    general easily forded, unless when swelled by long-continued rains. The small
                    river called Riachuelo, or the Narrow River, which joins the river Plata about a
                    mile to the south of the city of Buenos Ayres, affords a good example of their
                    size. Near its mouth it is not above thirty yards in breadth, and has a depth of
                    water not exceeding two fathoms; consequently it does not admit even
                    moderate-sized vessels, but affords an excellent haven for small vessels and
                    lighters, employed in the landing of goods and the embarkation of produce.</p>
                <p>The Rio Salado, which is the largest of these rivers, rises on the confines of
                    the Pampas to the south of the fort of Melincue; runs in a south-easterly
                    direction, being connected in its course with a considerable number of lakes;
                    and enters the Atlantic at the Ensenada de Samborombon, near the mouth of the
                    river Plata. At twelve leagues from its mouth it is about 600 feet in breadth,
                    and so deep that passengers require to be ferried over. The importance of this
                    river was unknown until the late war with the Brazils, when, in consequence of
                    the strict blockade of the port of Buenos Ayres by the Brazilian squadron, all
                    access to the country by the ordinary channels was cut off. The inhabitants were
                    compelled by necessity to find out other avenues by which to communicate with
                    the sea; and as, on examination, the mouth of the river Salado was found to be
                    well adapted for the admission of shipping, it became during the war the
                    principal rendezvous for the Argentine privateers, their prizes, and other
                    vessels; a circumstance which for a time gave a new aspect to that part of the
                    country. But much inconvenience was experienced in carrying on the traffic thus
                    created, from the want of good roads. The discovery of so good a port for small
                    vessels at the entrance of the river Plata will, however, prove of importance to
                    this part of the country, when the population has been augmented, and greater
                    advances have been made in agricultural industry, for which the district in
                    question is peculiarly well adapted. A number of small rivers rise in the hilly
                    country near the Sierras del Volcan and Tandil, and run into the Atlantic.</p>
                <p>Ί he Ensenada de Barragon, distant about thirty-six miles to the south-east of
                    Buenos Ayres, forms a safe and commodious anchorage for shipping, which is well
                    protected from the prevailing winds; but it is not much frequented except by
                    vessels engaged in the mule trade, or requiring to be careened. The province
                    contains various thriving and populous towns and villages, among which may be
                    enumerated San Jose de Flores, San Isidro, Quil-ιnes, Las Conchas, Luxan,
                    Chascomus, San Pedro, San Nicoas de los Arroyos, and others. The latter, San
                    Nicoas, which is situated at the north-western extremity of the province, on the
                    margin of the river Parana, is likely to become a commercial station of much
                    importance, from its vicinity to the Rio Tercero, and its favourable position
                    for communication with the provinces of Cordova and of Cuyo.</p>
                <p>The level surface which so uniformly characterizes the whole' province of Buenos
                    Ayres affords little scope for variety in its vegetable productions; still the
                    aspect of the country is marked by many striking peculiarities. Dif-. ferent
                    kinds of clover and other leguminous plants, intermixed with grasses, constitute
                    the great mass of the vegetation; give to the country its verdant appearance;
                    and form an inexhaustible source of nutriment, not only to the deer and Other
                    wild animals which are so abundant, but to the numerous herds of cattle and
                    horses which may be seen grazing in all directions.</p>
                <p>The country is naturally destitute of wood, and, with the exception of an
                    occasional natural copse of the <hi rend="italic">tala</hi> shrub, of very
                    inconsiderable height, nothing resembling trees is to be seen. The ombu <hi
                    rend="italic">(Phytolacca dioeca),</hi> however, sometimes makes its appearance,
                    to diversify the scene and relieve its monotony. Trees of this kind generally
                    point out to the traveller the site of some habitation, near which they are
                    usually planted; since, from the great rapidity of their growth, they soon
                    become conspicuous at a distance, and afford a grateful shade to the inhabitants
                    diu ’ ing the hot season of the year. They are otherwise very useless, on
                    account of the spongy nature of the trunk, which is so soft that it has
                    sometimes been used as wadding for artillery during the wars which prevailed in
                    the country.</p>
                <p>In the more cultivated districts of the province, and especially in the
                    neighbourhood of the city, numerous plantations are met with of peach trees,
                    which are cultivated for fire-wood, and form a very profitable investment of
                    land and capital, as they grow with great luxuriance, and may be cut down every
                    four years; so that by dividing a plantation equally, a fourth part may be cut
                    down yearly, which is sure to meet with a ready sale, being the principal
                    fire-wood used in Buenos Ayres. The fruit, which is produced in great abundance
                    in such plantations, is applied to no useful purpose except the feeding of pigs
                    and poultry.</p>
                <p>The immense forests of thistles which spring up at certain seasons of the year
                    tend more to diversify the scenery of this country than any other cause. These
                    consist of two species, well known in Europe, but principally of the cardoon
                    (<hi rend="italic">Cynara</hi><hi rend="italic">Cardunculv s'y</hi> and have
                    both in all probability been introduced from Europe. Having met with a soil and
                    climate congenial to their nature, they have extended themselves over an immense
                    tract of country, in some directions upwards of one hundred miles; and they are
                    in such abundance, and so vigorous in their growth, as to exceed in height the
                    tallest man mounted on horseback, and to form an apparently impenetrable thicket
                    on each side of the road. This scene may be witnessed in its greatest perfection
                    during the early months of summer, more especially in November; and contrasted
                    with the same country during the winter season, when the whole has disappeared
                    from the surface of the earth, it conveys to the mind a striking instance of the
                    luxuriant vegetation of the country. When young and tender, these thistles
                    constitute a favourite article of food for cattle, which form numerous and
                    devious paths in the thickets when in search of food at a later period of the
                    season. Along these they are easily traced by the practised eye of the <hi
                    rend="italic">gaucho</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> who fearlessly
                    rides along, his body and limbs being protected from injury by means of a
                    portion of dried bullock’s hide, judiciously placed before him, and extending a
                    little way on each side of the horse. These thickets have on some occasions been
                    used as a place of concealment by such as lay in wait to attack the unwary
                    traveller, and have occasionally been employed in aid of military operations
                    during the civil dissensions which have so frequently prevailed in these
                    countries since their separation<pb break="no" facs="nls:193741396"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-1396-0641"/> from the dominion of Spain. In autumn the same
                    scenery assumes a desolate appearance, as the thistles are then withered and
                    drooping, and become so dry, that if by any accident they catch fire, and a
                    breeze of wind prevails, the conflagration spreads with such rapidity in all
                    directions as occasionally to destroy much agricultural produce, and great
                    numbers of cattle and other animals who are unable to escape. In the
                    neighbourhood of the city at this season they are cut down in great quantities,
                    and sold for the purpose of heating ovens. The florets of this thistle are in
                    common use in the country for the purpose of coagulating milk, which they
                    accomplish in the same manner as rennet. A quantity of these florets is tied up
                    in a rag and stirred about in warm milk for a few minutes. This thistle is also
                    used as a vegetable at table. The tender footstalks of the leaves, and the young
                    stems, when boiled and the outer skin removed, have the flavour of
                    artichokes.</p>
                <p>Deer are so abundant in those parts of the country which are least inhabited,
                    that some hundreds may occasionally be seen at the same time along the horizon;
                    but they are not much molested, as their flesh is of little value in a country
                    where good beef is so abundant. The <hi rend="italic">bisea-clios</hi> are very
                    numerous in the province of Buenos Ayres. This animal resembles a rabbit in
                    appearance and habit, but is somewhat larger. Biscachos burrow in the ground,
                    and have numerous openings to their subterranean abodes, where they remain
                    concealed during the day-time; but they sally out at night and devour-great
                    quantities of grass, corn, and green crops. Their holes, which are numerous, and
                    covered over with grass and herbage, are dangerous to those riding on horseback,
                    and occasionally give rise to accidents. They may be seen in considerable
                    numbers at the mouths of their holes about sunset, and are caught in traps, or
                    by inundating their dwellings, which obliges them to issue out, when they are
                    easily killed. Their flesh is considered as good eating. Various species of
                    armadillos are found in the provinces, where they are distinguished by the names
                    of <hi rend="italic">quirquincho, mataco,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >mulito.</hi> T hey are easily caught when found sleeping in the sun, and are
                    much prized as an article of food when roasted in their shell. The <hi
                    rend="italic">zοτrino,</hi> which is not unfrequently met with, is about the
                    size of a rabbit, of a chestnut colour, and marked on each side by two white
                    lines. Its appearance is handsome, but when attacked or molested it ejects with
                    considerable force a liquid possessing an odour so intolerable, that its
                    vicinity is dreaded by man, and every animal who has once experienced its
                    effects. This serves it as a powerful means of defence against every enemy. If
                    caught and suspended by the tail, it is deprived of the power of emitting this
                    fluid, which is contained in a bag at the root of the tail.</p>
                <p>The South American ostrich or <hi rend="italic">nandu</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >{Struthio</hi><hi rend="italic">Phea)</hi> is met with in considerable
                    abundance on the Pampas, usually in coveys of twenty or thirty in number,
                    gliding rapidly along the plain. These birds are hunted by the natives on
                    horseback at full speed, and are caught by means of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >holas,</hi> formed of three balls or round stones, covered with hide, and
                    united to one common centre by thongs, each a fathom in length. After acquiring
                    an impetus by whirling them round the head, the <hi rend="italic">gauchos</hi>
                    throw them with such dexterity that the bird seldom escapes. The young are
                    easily domesticated, but become troublesome from their propensity to swallow
                    money, or any thing metallic which they can find. Their food in the natural
                    state consists of seeds, herbs, and insects. When young, their flesh is
                    considered as palatable. They lay a number of eggs in one nest, which is lined
                    with dry grass, and not always in very concealed situations. They seem to have
                    an exact knowledge of the number of their eggs, as any attempt to diminish or
                    increase their number, or even to handle them, inevitably leads to the
                    destruction of the whole, and the desertion of the nest. As a proof of their
                    provident care for their young brood, it is affirmed that the parents roll
                    several eggs to a little distance from their nest, and break the shell, so that
                    they become filled with maggots and insects, which supply suitable food for
                    their young brood on coming forth. The male bird takes charge of rearing the
                    young brood, which he performs with great attention. When two male ostriches
                    thus employed meet each other, they fight for the supremac} <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>, the victor in the combat usually carrying off the
                    two broods.</p>
                <p>The country abounds in game of various descriptions, especially wild ducks,
                    pigeons, partridges, and quails: the latter are so stupid as to allow themselves
                    to be caught with little trouble, by means of a noose fastened to the end of a
                    cane; or by riding round them in the form of a circle, they may be gradually
                    approached so close as to be killed by the stroke of the rider’s whip. They are
                    exceedingly abundant, and being easily caught, are much used as an article of
                    food. On the banks of the rivers and lakes are found great abundance of
                    water-fowl; and in moist places a bird closely resembling the lapwing of Europe
                    in appearance and habit, but having a spine of nearly an inch long projecting
                    forward from each shoulder, and serving it as a powerful weapon of offence.
                    Venomous reptiles are rarely or never met with in this province; and the
                    inhabitants are exempt from the annoyance of those numerous insects which abound
                    so much in the provinces farther to the north. Mosquitos, however, occasionally
                    occur at certain seasons of the year, and in low damp situations. Fleas are also
                    abundant where sufficient attention has not been paid to ventilation and
                    cleanliness.</p>
                <p>Bones of the megatherion, and other extinct animals, have been discovered in the
                    alluvial soil of the province of Buenos Ayres. One of the most perfect specimens
                    of the bones of this animal was found on the banks of the river Luxan, fifteen
                    leagues from Buenos Ayres, when forming some excavations, in the year 1789. It
                    was removed entire to Spain, and is now in the cabinet at Madrid. More recently
                    a tooth of the same animal was discovered near Areco, about sixteen leagues
                    farther west; and only a few years ago various bones of a similar description
                    were found near Los Desmochados, on the south side of the river Tercero. Three
                    skeletons of the mastodon were recently discovered to the south of the river
                    Salado, by Mr Woodbine Parish, his Britannic majesty’s late consul-general at
                    Buenos Ayres; and one of these skeletons, in nearly a complete state, has lately
                    been brought to England by that gentleman. The circumstance of these organic
                    remains having been found in a shell somewhat resembling that of the tortoise,
                    gives much additional interest to this discovery. Occurrences such as these lead
                    to the conclusion that in former times these tribes of animals have existed in
                    considerable numbers on these alluvial plains; and many similar discoveries may
                    be anticipated in future.</p>
                <p>The mineral productions of this country possess very little interest. A rock or a
                    stone is scarcely anywhere to be seen throughout the province. Some gypsum has
                    been found in the neighbourhood of Buenos Ayres, and lime in several parts of
                    the country. Such stones as are required for paving the streets, or in building,
                    are brought from the island of Martin Garcia, at the mouth of the Uruguay, or as
                    ballast from Europe. Many of the lakes to the south of Buenos Ayres are strongly
                    impregnated with salt, and hence is derived the name and quality of the water of
                    the river Salado. Salt, however, exists in greatest abundance and purity at Las
                    Lagunas de las Salinas, situated in lat. 37. 0. S. in a south-west direction
                    from the city, and not <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741409"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-1409-0642"/><hi rend="italic">far</hi> distant from the
                    mountains called La Sierra de la Ventana. At these lakes, when the evaporation
                    has been considerable, salt is procured in great quantities; and to obtain
                    supplies of this article, considerable numbers of Indians and Creoles are
                    attracted at certain periods; but owing to the distance and expense of
                    land-carriage, little of it reaches Buenos Ayres, as it can be obtained cheaper
                    from England, and of a superior quality.</p>
                <p>The climate of Buenos Ayres, as its name indicates, is excellent and salubrious,
                    being by its situation equally removed from the extremes of heat and cold. In
                    general, the atmosphere is clear and the sky unclouded.</p>

                    the freezing point, and thin crusts of ice were formed on the shallow pools
                    around the city. The mean temperature of 1822 was 62° ∙30 of Fahrenheit, and the
                    mean height of the barometer for eleven months 29-67 inches, showing the
                    elevation of the city above the level of the sea to be about 300 feet. The north
                    and north-east winds, especially the former, which sweep over the low and wooded
                    country of Entre Rios and the other districts extending along the margins of the
                    rivers Parana, Uruguay, and their tributaries, are generally loaded with
                    moisture, and succeeded by heavy rains. When the winds have prevailed for some
                    time, and before the rains fall, the atmosphere generally becomes so clear and
                    transparent that objects may be seen distinctly at a great distance. During its
                    continuance the moisture of the atmosphere materially affects the health and
                    feelings of the inhabitants. The <hi rend="italic">pamperos,</hi> or south-west
                    winds, which traverse a comparatively dry tract of country, are by far the most
                    agreeable and wholesome which prevail in this country; and from this quarter the
                    winds sometimes blow with very great violence. During the summer months a
                    refreshing breeze arises periodically every evening from the river to the
                    eastward, and is evidently produced by causes similar to those which operate in
                    equatorial regions. Storms of thunder and lightning occasionally prevail at
                    Buenos Ayres, and are sometimes very violent and terrific. A remarkable change,
                    indeed, has of late taken place in the climate of Buenos Ayres, for since 1829
                    it has rained so very little as materially to disappoint the hopes of the
                    husbandman and the breeder of cattle. In the early part of 1832 the drought had
                    reached to such a height as to convert the whole province into one continued
                    bleak and dreary desert, and to produce phenomena which had never before been
                    witnessed even by the old est inhabitants. On some recent occasions such densi
                    clouds of dust have been raised by the winds, as to obscurt the rays of the sun
                    completely at mid-day, and envelop« the inhabitants in almost total darkness.
                    When the rain: at length commenced in March, the water in its passage through
                    the air intermingled so completely with the dusl suspended in the clouds through
                    which it fell, as to descend in the form of showers of mud, and on some
                    occasions gave to the white exterior of the houses the appearance of having been
                    plastered over with earth. Many flocks of sheep were smothered on these
                    occasions by the dust, in a similar manner as in the snow-storms which occur in
                    the mountains of Scotland.</p>
                <p>As an evidence of the healthiness of this climate may be adduced the frequent
                    instances of longevity which occur. Epidemic diseases are of rare occurrence,
                    and there are few complaints arising from local causes. Consumption, pulmonary
                    affections, and inflammatory complaints, are those which principally prevail. In
                    the country the inhabitants enjoy almost uninterrupted good health. The ravages
                    of small-pox, formerly very destructive in this country, have been arrested by
                    the introduction of vaccination, for which an institution has been established
                    under the direction of Dr Segurola, whose exertions in the cause of humanity are
                    well known and appreciated by his countrymen. The benefits of this institution
                    have been widely extended all over these provinces, and vaccination ha⅛ been
                    introduced to a considerable extent among the Indians to the south.</p>
                <p>The city of Buenos Ayres, or, as it was formerly caked, Nuestra Señora de Buenos
                    Ayres, was founded in 1535, by’ Don Pedro de Mendoza, and so named in
                    consequence o the great salubrity and purity of the air. It is situated on the
                    southern margin of the river Plata, on a rising groun elevated about thirty-five
                    feet above the surface of' t <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> river, and in long.
                    58. 23. 34. W. and lat. 34. 36. 29. ∙ from Greenwich. It is distant· ten leagues
                    from Colonia, situated on the Banda Oriental, at the opposite side o the river,
                    and seventy-two leagues from Cape Santa ria, at the mouth of the river
                    Plata.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741422" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1422-0643"/>
                <p>The city is seen to advantage from the river, its site being somewhat more
                    elevated than the surrounding country. It occupies a considerable extent of
                    ground, being in its longest diameter, which runs parallel with the river, about
                    two miles, and in breadth about a mile and a half. All the streets cross at
                    right angles, and at regular intervals of about 150 yards from each other; and
                    they are of moderate breadth, with pavement on each side, and hollow in the
                    middle. They were formerly very ill kept, and with numerous <hi rend="italic"
                    >pantanos</hi> or quagmires, especially near the outskirts of the town; but
                    since the establishment of an efficient and well-regulated police in 1821, these
                    defects have in a great measure been removed, and the streets well cleaned. Most
                    of the principal streets have been well paved and lighted. They have all been
                    systematically named, and the houses are regularly numbered. A street patrol has
                    been formed, whose duty it is to repress irregularities, which were formerly so
                    frequent, and to preserve order and tranquillity. It is only in the more central
                    parts of the city that the houses are built adjoining to each other, so that the
                    four sides of the square form a continuous line of houses, no access being
                    obtained to the interior of the square excepting through the houses. Formerly
                    they were almost all flat roofed, with a parapet before and behind, and
                    afforded, by means of these <hi rend="italic">azoteas,</hi> a ready
                    communication between the inhabitants of the square, without their persons being
                    exposed to the view of those passing along the streets. From this circumstance
                    originated that singular and efficient mode of defensive warfare which was first
                    practised in Buenos Ayres, and has recently developed itself so successfully in
                    Europe; every successive square of buildings thus forming a formidable line of
                    defence to the entrance of an invading force, and the defenders being able to
                    take aim at the assailants with little exposure of their bodies. Hence the very
                    unequal contest, and the great loss of life, which attended the attempt of the
                    British troops under General Whitelocke to take the city by storm. More recently
                    the form of the houses has been somewhat altered, by the addition of <hi
                    rend="italic">altos</hi> or upper stories, balconies, and various other
                    architectural improvements. The houses were formerly all built of mud; but one
                    of the jesuits introduced the practice of employing bricks and lime, which is
                    that now generally in use, excepting in the houses of the lower classes towards
                    the outskirts of the city. The walls formed of brick and lime are plastered
                    outside with stucco or cerhent, and whitened.</p>
                <p>The entrance to every house is by a large massive gate, which leads to a square
                    court or <hi rend="italic">patio,</hi> round which are situated the various
                    apartments with which it communicates. It is usually paved with brick, and has
                    generally formed underneath a large cistern or <hi rend="italic">algive,</hi> in
                    which the rain water is collected from the court and tops of the houses, and
                    preserved for the use of the family. The sides of the court and front of the
                    balconies are frequently ornamented with vines or other climbing and odoriferous
                    plants. I he air plants (<hi rend="italic">Tillandsia),</hi> of which several
                    very beautiful kinds are natives of this country, are also used to ornament
                    dwelling-houses; and when in flower they have a very brilliant appearance, and
                    excite additional interest from the peculiarities of their nature, requiring no
                    other nourishment than what they receive from the atmosphere, 2nd demanding no
                    further care than that of attaching them to the iron railings of the
                    windows.</p>
                <p>That part of the house which is situated on each side of the entrance is commonly
                    used for shops or warehouses, and those apartments communicating with the court
                    as public rooms, the bed rooms being situated in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >altos,</hi> or around a second court or <hi rend="italic">patio,</hi> to which
                    there is a passage leading from the first. Beyond these are situated the
                    servants’ apartments, the kitchen, offices, stable, and sometimes a small
                    garden.</p>
                <p>The windows, which look into the court or the street, are large, occupying nearly
                    the whole height of the apartment, and are secured from intrusion by
                    perpendicular bars of iron, fitted in a frame so as to occupy its whole extent;
                    a precaution necessary to secure the interior of the houses, as it is customary
                    to throw open the casements to admit the cool air of the mornings and evenings;
                    while the seats inside form the usual resort of the female inmates during their
                    hours of relaxation, and when disposed to see and be seen by those passing
                    along.</p>
                <p>The interior of the houses is much better calculated for the warm season of
                    summer than for the winter. The apartments are large and spacious, but somewhat
                    gloomy, from the deficiency of windows and ornaments, the walls being generally
                    white-washed; while the floors are formed of tiljes, bricks, or more recently of
                    wood. They are damp and cold in winter, from the defective ventilation and the
                    want of chimneys, against which strong prejudices long existed. The only
                    substitute used was a large <hi rend="italic">brasero</hi> or chafing-dish, of a
                    circular form, placed in a wooden frame on the floor, and filled with burning
                    charcoal, round which the inmates assembled; but unless the doors were kept a
                    little open to allow the escape of the noxious air which was generated, it
                    proved most injurious to the health of those exposed to its influence. The
                    example of the English, who introduced chimneys into their houses, and the
                    superior comfort and healthiness which they enjoy in consequence, has materially
                    tended to remove the existing prejudices; and consequently the houses of the
                    natives are now also, for the most part, provided with chimneys. The interior
                    arrangement of their houses has also been greatly improved in other respects;
                    and they are now commonly, furnished in the English or French style, and in
                    every respect are more comfortable than formerly.</p>
                <p>There are about ten public squares or <hi rend="italic">plazas</hi> in the city
                    of Buenos Ayres, some of which are of small dimensions, and principally in use
                    as market-places. The largest, which is of considerable size, is situated
                    opposite to the fort, and is divided into two unequal parts by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Alcova,</hi> a long building extending from one side to the other,
                    and containing a range of small shops, with a corridor on each side, affording
                    shelter to the public and the market people. That part of the square which is
                    next to the fort is used as the principal public market. The other division,
                    which is by far the largest, and is named Plaza de la Victoria, forms the
                    principal parade for exercising troops, and. for the celebration of religious
                    and national festivals. In its centre is placed a pyramid to commemorate the
                    revolution, having an emblematic figure at each of its four corners, indicative
                    of Justice, Science, Liberty, and America, the whole being inclosed by a light
                    railing. On the west side of the plaza, opposite to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alcova,</hi> is situated the town-house or <hi rend="italic">Cabildo,</hi> a
                    large and fine edifice, in which are held the different courts of justice, the
                    meetings of the municipality, the police establishment, and the various offices
                    belonging to these departments.</p>
                <p>The cathedral is situated on <hi rend="superscript"> x</hi> the south side of the
                    plaza, and, although not finished according to the original design, it occupies
                    an extensive space of ground. It possesses considerable claims to architectural
                    beauty, and its interior is adorned with somelarge scriptural pain tings. Ί he
                    other churches, which principally merit attention for their architecture and
                    extent, are those of San Francisco, La Merced, Santo Domingo, and San Nicoas;
                    besides which there are various churches, in all about fifteen, throughout the
                    city. The university, which is situated in the vicinity of the principal square,
                    was built by and for the use of the Jesuits when established in the country, and
                    is one of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741435" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1435-0644"
                    />most substantial public buildings in the city. Within these few years an
                    episcopal chapel has been built by the British residents, forming a new and
                    interesting object in this part of the world. _</p>
                <p>The theatre, which is much frequented both by natives and foreigners, is of mean
                    exterior appearance, but of considerable size. Besides the Spanish plays and
                    farces performed here, there are frequent Italian operas, which are generally
                    well represented, and seem very congenial to the public taste. A mint has been
                    recently formed in Buenos Ayres, and is situated in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Consulado,</hi> near the plaza. The machinery has been erected under the able
                    superintendence of Mr Miers, and is so complete in all its details as to be
                    highly creditable to all concerned. The political state of this country since
                    its completion has, however, been such as to prevent this establishment from
                    being used for its original purposes.</p>
                <p>The post-office is under the charge of a director, and is managed with
                    regularity, but is very defective in some of its details. The mails are conveyed
                    by riders on horseback, and with considerable dispatch and regularity; being
                    sent weekly to Chili by way of San Luis and Mendoza, and to Bolivia by the route
                    of Cordova, Tucuman, and Salta. On the arrival of letters from any place, a list
                    is made out of the whole; and any one applying for the letters receives them on
                    paying the postage; a practice which often leads to the loss of letters, and
                    other numerous inconveniencies.</p>
                <p>The fort, which is opposite the <hi rend="italic">Alcova,</hi> is situated on the
                    banks of the river Plata, and in front of the centre of the city. It is built of
                    stone, and is of considerable strength, being well mounted with cannon, but can
                    never be of much importance as a fortification, since no vessel of war can
                    approach within gunshot of it; and the cannon are therefore only useful for
                    firing salutes. It has a small garrison, and contains apartments for the
                    president and his ministers, and the various public offices connected with the
                    government.</p>
                <p>In the neighbourhood of the fort there was recently a pier or wharf, used for
                    landing passengers. It was built of stone and earth, the former brought from
                    Martin Garcia, and cost the Spanish government half a million of dollars; but it
                    was of so little use even in landing from boats, except when the river was full,
                    that it has been allowed to fall into decay, and has now almost wholly
                    disappeared. The usual mode of landing goods and passengers is by carts with
                    high wheels, which are in constant attendance; and sometimes, when the river is
                    low, they have to proceed a quarter of a mile into the water before reaching the
                    boat, owing to the shallowness of the river.</p>
                <p>The level space which intervenes between the margin of the river and the more
                    elevated ground on which the city is placed, rises very little above the level
                    of the river. At the end nearest the fort is situated the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alameda,</hi> or public promenade, along which are planted rows of Lombardy
                    poplars. To this place the citizens resort in the evenings and on holidays; but,
                    as a place of recreation, it is very inadequate to the wants of so large and
                    populous a city. Various improvements are now, however, in progress, and a
                    subscription has been raised by the inhabitants to inclose the whole with a
                    handsome iron railing. The banks of the river to a considerable extent, where
                    they are covered with green sward, arc usually occupied by females employed in
                    washing and drying their clothes; and numerous parties of bathers may be seen
                    during the summer months enjoying the refreshing influence of rhe waters of the
                    river. The further extremity of this track often presents a busy and animated
                    scene, being the resort, on their arrival and departure, of the numerous troops
                    of waggons which carry on the traffic with the interior provinces. On the rising
                    ground in this neigh bourhood is situated the British Protestant cemetery.
                    Proceeding to the south-east along the margin of the river, the Riachuelo
                    presents itself, having a circular basin at its mouth, in which are received
                    small vessels and lighters; and in its neighbourhood are situated the <hi
                    rend="italic">Saladeros,</hi> and other establishments for slaughtering cattle,
                    and preparing for exportation the various productions of the country. Before
                    reaching this rivulet, the elevated bank on which the city stands has
                    terminated.</p>
                <p>The markets are abundantly supplied with provisions, such as beef, mutton, pork,
                    poultry, and game of various kinds, and so moderate in price, that excellent
                    beef and mutton may be purchased at one halfpenny per pound; and pork, veal, and
                    lamb, at from one penny to three halfpence per pound. Fish are also obtained in
                    great abundance, at a moderate price and of good quality. They are necessarily
                    all fresh-water fish, and consist principally of <hi rend="italic">Coe
                    pexerrey</hi> or king’s fish, the <hi rend="italic">dorado,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">hagre,</hi><hi rend="italic">lisa,</hi> and a variety of others.
                    Vegetables are good and plentiful, but expensive, excepting pumpkins and Indian
                    corn, both of which are cheap, and much used for culinary purposes. Fruit, with
                    some exceptions, is not obtained in such variety, or of so good a quality, as
                    the climate is calculated to produce if its cultivation were more carefully
                    attended to. Melons, musk-melons, <hi rend="italic">sandias</hi> or
                    water-melons, oranges, lemons, figs, pomegranates, and quinces, are the best and
                    most abundant. Peaches are in immense abundance, but of inferior quality, as
                    their cultivation is but little attended to. Potatoes do not seem to thrive in
                    so tenacious a soil, and are often imported from England. All the vegetables and
                    fruit produced here, with few exceptions, appear very susceptible of
                    improvement, and many additional kinds will be introduced as industry advances.
                    The vine answers very well, but has hitherto been cultivated only in gardens to
                    a very limited extent. Milk is carried about in jars by boys on horseback, and
                    is expensive, considering the abundance and cheapness of cows; but the dairy has
                    been little attended to in this country, excepting by the foreigners settled
                    there, who almost monopolize the manufacture of butter and cheese, which they
                    sell at high prices. Bread is also an expensive article of consumption.</p>
                <p>Water for culinary and domestic purposes forms an expensive article of
                    housekeeping, as every family which has not in the house a cistern of rain water
                    is obliged to purchase water from the river Plata, brought in carts to all parts
                    of the city, and sold at about threepence a barrel of four gallons. The carts
                    formerly employed for this purpose were of a large and clumsy construction, but
                    they have been greatly improved of late by the foreigners settled there, some of
                    whom have engaged in this lucrative occupation. The water obtained in this
                    country from wells, which are necessarily very deep, is of an inferior quality,
                    and unfit for washing or other domestic purposes, in consequence of being
                    impregnated with saline or calcareous matter from the subsoil or <hi
                    rend="italic">tosea</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> consequently a plentiful supply
                    of good water is a great desideratum m this city. An attempt was made in 1824 to
                    obtain supplies of this necessary article by boring, and an engineer was brought
                    from England with the requisite machinery for this purpose. It was tried
                    principally at the <hi rend="italic">Retirο,</hi> the most elevated ground in
                    the vicinity of the city; but after penetrating a hundred and seventy-five feet
                    into the earth, and expending considerable sums of money, t∙ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ιe</hi> undertaking was abandoned, because, much to the
                    disappointment of the government and the inhabitants, no water had been
                    obtained. It does not, however, appear so very difficult an undertaking to
                    obtain a plentiful supply °fθ <hi rend="superscript"> x</hi> ' cellent water
                    from the river, which is only distant a few hundred yards from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Petiro,</hi> where a large resewoir might be formed, and the city
                    supplied by means of p <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> P <hi rend="superscript">

                    this source. The water might be conveyed by a canal or tunnel to the base of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Retiro,</hi> which is not forty feet above it in level, and
                    raised by means of machinery similar to that which is employed in mines for
                    emptying them of water.</p>
                <p>Fuel is also an expensive article of consumption in Buenos Ayres, the coal used
                    there being brought from England, and fire-wood from Entre Rios and the islands
                    of the Parana and Uruguay. Considerable supplies, however, are furnished by
                    means of the peach trees, which are cultivated very generally in the
                    neighbourhood.</p>
                <p>All vessels coming to Buenos Ayres, excepting those of a small draught of water,
                    usually anchor in the outer roads, distant about eight or nine miles from the
                    shore, where there is upwards of three fathoms of water. In this situation they
                    usually embark and disembark their cargoes by means of lighters; but when
                    unloaded and waiting for cargoes, they generally come into the inner roads,
                    distant only about two miles from the shore, where the water is much shallower.
                    In neither of these situations are they well protected from the storms blowing
                    from the eastward; but the most violent winds which prevail here are the <hi
                    rend="italic">pamperos</hi> from the westward, and during these the shipping is
                    sufficiently sheltered by the land.</p>
                <p>The river Plata throughout its whole extent, as if to compensate for its great
                    breadth, is extremely shallow, and requires very careful navigation even for
                    vessels of moderate size. The direction of the winds, when strong or long
                    continued, very much influences the quantity of water contained in the river:
                    thus, when they blow from the eastward up the river, the flow of the water
                    downwards is so much impeded, that it accumulates greatly, and the level rises.
                    A remarkable instance of this occurred in 1820, when, during a violent gale of
                    wind from the east, which drove upwards of twenty vessels on shore, the tract of
                    land situated along the margin of the river was overflowed and covered with the
                    cargoes and remains of the wrecked vessels. On the contrary, after
                    long-continued and violent <hi rend="italic">pamperos</hi> or westerly winds,
                    the flow of the waters of the river is so much accelerated as to leave its
                    channel comparatively empty; an occurrence which has been frequently observed.
                    On one occasion, during the British expedition against Buenos Ayres, this took
                    place to such an extent that many of the vessels were grounded, and one was left
                    in such shallow water as to have been actually boarded and taken possession of
                    by a party of <hi rend="italic">gauchos</hi> on horseback; and in the first
                    volume of the <hi rend="italic">Naval Chronicle</hi> a still more remarkable
                    occurrence of this kind is recorded. “In 1793 the waters of this river were
                    forced, in the month of April, by a most violent current of wind, to the
                    distance of ten leagues, so that the neighbouring plains were entirely
                    inundated, and the bed of the river left dry. Ships which had been sunk in the
                    river for upwards of thirty years were uncovered, and, among others, an English
                    vessel which was cast away in the year 1762. Several persons repaired to the bed
                    of the river, where they could walk about without wetting their feet, and
                    returned laden with silver and other riches which had been long buried under the
                    water. This phenomenon continued three days, at the end of which the wind
                    ceased, and the water returned with great violence to its natural bed.” Such an
                    occurrence, although apparently somewhat exaggerated, may to a certain extent be
                    accounted for by the inconsiderable depth of water which prevails throughout the
                    greater part of this river, and the great extent of surface exposed to the
                    influence of the wind.</p>
                <p>The breeding and rearing of cattle constitutes by far the most important and
                    extensive branch of agricultural industry in this province, which, in all
                    directions excepting in the immediate vicinity of the city, is covered with <hi
                    rend="italic">estancias</hi> or breeding farms, which are considered as the most
                    profitable investments of capital, the increase of stock being so rapid under
                    ordinary circumstances as amply to repay the labour and expense of these
                    establishments. The number of cattle which formerly existed in this country
                    almost exceeds belief. Before the revolution they were often killed merely for
                    the sake of their hides, and were generally purchased at a dollar each. But
                    since that time their value has greatly increased, owing to the increased demand
                    for exportation, and the diminution of numbers occasioned by the political
                    occurrences which took place subsequent to that period; but even at present
                    their number is very considerable, and they are sold at from five to eight or
                    ten dollars each. The size of the <hi rend="italic">estancias</hi> is sometimes
                    very considerable, comprising many square leagues; and the number of cattle on
                    the largest may vary from twenty to forty or fifty thousand. Every proprietor
                    can easily distinguish his own cattle and horses by a mark branded on each of
                    them; the period of the year when the young animals are collected to undergo
                    this operation being a time of festivity and enjoyment. At each <hi
                    rend="italic">estancia,</hi> after stated intervals, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >rodeo</hi> is held, when all the cattle are collected together and examined,
                    and those which have strayed from the neighbouring estates are driven back by
                    the <hi rend="italic">peons</hi> or farm servants, who attend on such occasions
                    from the surrounding <hi rend="italic">estancias,</hi> and the animals are thus
                    prevented from straying too far. They are remarkably fond of salt, and sometimes
                    travel great distances to feed on this substance at the lakes and other places
                    where it abounds. It is a common observation, that the flesh of those cattle and
                    sheep who feed in districts where salt abounds is much more savoury than any
                    other; and every circumstance tends to prove that salt powerfully assists the
                    process of digestion in these animals, as well as in the. human species. In
                    consequence of the diminution which bad taken place in the number of cattle, a
                    law was enacted prohibiting the slaughter of cows, so as to encourage by every
                    possible means the increase of this staple article of produce.</p>
                <p>Horses.are likewise very abundant. They are from fourteen to sixteen hands high,
                    hardy, and capable of undergoing a great deal of fatigue in the performance of
                    long journeys. Their usual pace, which is a canter or gallop, is very easy,
                    and-causes little fatigue to the traveller. Their price varies from four or five
                    dollars to eighteen or twenty, according to the quality and demand; but they
                    have occasionally been purchased in large quantities, for the use of the
                    government, at three dollars or twelve shillings each. The large Flemish or dray
                    horse has recently been introduced into the country, with the view of employing
                    it in the traffic with the interior. A great prejudice exists here against using
                    mares for the saddle; and such is the ridicule excited among the natives by
                    their use, that only some foreigners have as yet ventured to introduce the
                    custom. They are only useful for breeding and treading out corn, and may be
                    purchased at half a dollar or two shillings each. They are often bartered or
                    sold to the Indians, who use them as their principal article of food, and prefer
                    their flesh to any other. This practice has exercised a remarkable influence on
                    the mode of warfare which these tribes have carried on against the Creoles,
                    giving them a mobility in all their operations which cannot be attained by any
                    other means. Provided with a herd of mares, which on such occasions form their
                    only food, they can advance or retreat with great celerity, and thereby evade a
                    rencontre with their opponents. The late Colonel Rauch, however, followed their
                    example, when in command of the frontier, by feeding his soldiers on mares’
                    flesh while on service, and thereby gained the desired superiority which
                    discipline afforded, over his uncivilized opponents.</p>

                <p>The number of mules reared in this province is inconsiderable compared with that
                    in the interior provinces, where the ground is harder, and better suited for the
                    rearing of mules for exportation to Bolivia, and for the use of the mountainous
                    districts. Sheep were formerly valued only for their wool, and were purchased
                    for about threepence each; their flesh was seldom used for food, but was
                    frequently dried and used as fuel in the burning of bricks; and there is still a
                    law extant, prohibiting the practice of .driving the sheep alive into the
                    brick-kilns to save the trouble of previously killing them. They are now more
                    valuable, both as an article of food, and for their wool and skins, which are
                    exported. Endeavours have already been made to improve the quality of the wool
                    by the introduction of Merino sheep. The price of sheep varies from half a
                    dollar to a dollar each.</p>
                <p>As the breeding of cattle has principally occupied the attention of the
                    inhabitants of this country, comparatively little attention has hitherto been
                    paid to the other branches of agriculture. Wheat is only cultivated to a small
                    extent, and in quantity quite insufficient to supply the demands of the
                    inhabitants. This is owing principally to the frequent failure of wheaten crops,
                    which in dull and moist weather are liable to blight, and during other years to
                    total loss from the long continuance of dry weather. In future this branch of
                    agriculture will probably be principally confined to the country south of the
                    river Salado, where the soil and climate are much better adapted to the
                    production of wheat than nearer Buenos Ayres. In the former district the soil
                    consists of a stratum of black mould, several feet in thickness, under wduch is
                    a bed of clay, resting on sand and gravel, where water is usually found. In the
                    latter it consists of a chalky yet productive mould, unmixed with stones, but
                    resting on a stratum of <hi rend="italic">tosea,</hi> consisting of hardened
                    clay and lime, which is usually situated from ten to thirty yards beneath the
                    surface. Barley and maize are cultivated with success; the latter being produced
                    in great abundance, and extensively used as an article of food. The great influx
                    of intelligent foreigners into the province has introduced many branches of
                    agriculture previously unknown, and materially contributed towards developing
                    the natural resources of the country. The introduction of timber and forest
                    trees into the province as an article of culture has excited much attention; and
                    efforts are making to form plantations, which will greatly beautify the country,
                    and eventually supply the inhabitants with timber, which at present is brought
                    from a great distance, and is very expensive.</p>
                <p>The fences or inclosures used in this country consist, in the neighbourhood of
                    the city and the more cultivated districts, of the <hi rend="italic">tuna
                    (Cactus Peruvianus)</hi> and American aloe <hi rend="italic">(Agave
                    Americana),</hi> which grow with rapidity and luxuriance, especially the latter,
                    whose tall, flowering stem rises up to the height of twenty-five or thirty feet
                    in the course of one year, and strikingly evinces the strength of vegetation in
                    this climate. It is considered objectionable as a fence, as its large sheathing
                    leaves afford shelter to numerous small animals, which destroy the produce of
                    the fields inclosed. In the more remote districts ditching has been found to be
                    the only kind of inclosure suited to the country, the earth which is excavated
                    forming a raised embankment on the inside. Some of the foreigners settled in the
                    country have improved this mode of fencing, by planting rows of the <hi
                    rend="italic">tala</hi> shrub along these embankments.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the long and extensive intercourse which has been maintained
                    between the inhabitants of Buenos Ayres and the numerous foreigners established
                    in their country, they have been deeply impressed with the importance of an
                    increase in their numbers, having had ample experience of their greater industry
                    and superior attainments in agriculture and the arts. The authorities, fully
                    participating in these feelings, took effectual measures to encourage, by every
                    means in their power, the ingress into the country of industrious artisans and
                    agricultural labourers from Europe. Accordingly, on the 13th April 1824, and
                    19th January 1825, decrees were issued by the government, appointing a committee
                    of emigration, who were provided with the necessary funds and instructions to
                    enable them to carry forward this important undertaking. This committee
                    consisted of citizens, and foreigners resident and possessing fixed property in
                    the country, so proportioned as duly to represent the interests of all parties
                    concerned. They were directed to take effectual measures to make known to the
                    industrious classes in Europe the inducements held out to them to emigrate to
                    Buenos Ayres, and to employ agents in Europe in furtherance of the undertaking.
                    They were authorized to pay a sum not exceeding one hundred dollars, or twenty
                    pounds sterling, as passage-money for each adult arriving in the country; to
                    provide such as required assistance on their arrival, with food and lodgings for
                    fifteen days, during which time they were allowed to seek for employment, and,
                    if unsuccessful at the expiry of that period, the committee were charged with
                    the duty of finding employment for them, and of regulating the contracts and
                    agreements entered into by mutual consent with their employers, in such a manner
                    as to secure the rights and privileges of each party during its continuance, and
                    to provide for the repayment of the expenses incurred by the committee, by means
                    of a well-regulated system of gradual instalments. It was likewise enacted, that
                    emigrants completing the terms of their respective engagements to the
                    satisfaction of the committee, were entitled to a preference in the renting of
                    the state lands, each portion of land not being of less extent than sixty acres,
                    but greater in proportion to the fitness and means of each. Under such
                    circumstances, deserving individuals were authorized to receive from the funds
                    of the committee a loan of three hundred dollars, or sixty pounds sterling, on
                    which a per centage was to be paid annually, and the whole repaid by instalments
                    at stated but convenient periods; all such occupiers of land having the right of
                    possession of the legal value of the lands, of all the improvements effected,
                    and to negociate or transfer them, as also to become the purchasers of such
                    lands in preference to every other competitor, when authorized by law to be
                    sold. The emigi’ants were to enjoy the protection and guarantee of the laws of
                    the country, the security of persons and property, and the enjoyment of all
                    rights and privileges possessed by the natives; exemption from all taxes and
                    contributions not imposed on the rest of the community; and exemption during a
                    certain period from all civil and military services, unless voluntary, together
                    with the free exercise of their religion.</p>
                <p>These judicious regulations were speedily carried into effect by the committee,
                    in the preparation of the Recoleta, a large and spacious convent in the vicinity
                    of the city, for the reception of emigrants and their families on their arrival,
                    and by the active circulation, in Great Britain, France, and Germany, of these
                    regulations. The efficacy of these measures was soon afterwards evinced by the
                    numbers who resorted from these countries to Buenos Ayres. The following table
                    will show the progress made in this undertaking during the interval between the
                    time of its enactment and November 1826, when all further arrivals of emigrants
                    were prevented by the war with Brazil. It shows the amount of monies advanced to
                    the emigrants by the committee, and the extent of the repayments whic had been
                    made, up to April 1828; and the results are highly <pb break="no"

                <p>The subsequent proceedings of the committee are of little interest, the
                    continuance of the war, and the other political circumstances of the country,
                    having prevented any renewal of their exertions. On the 20th of August 1830, the
                    committee was abolished, and their proceedings brought to a conclusion, by a
                    decree of that period, the existing authorities disapproving of those political
                    principles which originally gave rise to its formation. They affirm that
                    experience has proved to their satisfaction, that the method hitherto pursued
                    with the agricultural emigrants in this country has not been productive of that
                    advantage to the country or to the emigrants themselves which was at first
                    anticipated. It has therefore been determined that any subsequent endeavours to
                    encourage emigration by the government shall be conducted on different
                    principles from those formerly pursued.</p>
                <p>The efforts to promote emigration to this country were not, however, entirely
                    confined to the government of Buenos Ayres, but were participated in by two
                    emigration associations connected with Great Britain. The one formed in London
                    under the direction of Mr Barber Beaumont, and named the Rio de la Plata
                    Agricultural Association, sent out emigrants on various occasions to the number
                    of more than six hundred persons, and incurred considerable expense; but it
                    completely failed in accomplishing the principal objects of its institution, the
                    formation of an extensive agricultural establishment in the country. This
                    failure has been attributed by some of those engaged in the undertaking, but
                    evidently on insufficient grounds, to the bad faith, apathy, and want of
                    co-operation on the part of the authorities of Buenos Ayres; and it may with
                    much greater justice be ascribed to the precipitation and mismanagement of those
                    intrusted with the affairs of the association. The emigrants, injudiciously
                    selected, were hurried from Great Britain before they had provided efficient or
                    responsible agents in the country, or had made the necessary arrangements for
                    their reception; the consequence was, that the greater number were kept in a
                    state of idleness and inactivity at Buenos Ayres for many months after their
                    arrival, during which time they became acquainted with the country and its
                    inhabitants, and formed connections tending to divert them from fulfilling their
                    engagements to the association, so that only a few of them ever reached their
                    final destination. The greater part of their operations were carried on during
                    the war with Brazil, when every obstacle was thrown in the way of their success;
                    and the principal agricultural establishment which they formed was in the
                    province of Entre Rios, where the authorities of Buenos Ayres exercised no
                    influence or control, more especially during the war. The Committee of
                    Emigration advanced, in aid of these emigrants, 26,802 dollars, or L.5025. 7s.
                    3d. sterling, no part of which appears ever to have been repaid. But although
                    this undertaking proved a complete failure in as far as the interests of the
                    shareholders were concerned, yet the emigrants had no cause of complaint, since
                    all those inclined to be industrious found plenty of employment and good wages.
                    Some of them entered on board the privateers and into the naval service of
                    Buenos Ayres during the war with Brazil, and greatly distinguished themselves
                    during their various combats with the Brazilian squadron.</p>
                <p>The other association was of a very different character. It was formed by the
                    Messrs Robertsons, British merchants settled in Buenos Ayres, and in connection
                    with some of the natives possessing influence and capital. They purchased some
                    adjoining properties at Monte Grande, situated about fifteen miles south-west of
                    the city. The emigrants were selected with great care from among the intelligent
                    and experienced farmers of the south of Scotland, and were conveyed to the new
                    colony with their families, domestic and farm servants, and all the requisite
                    implements of husbandry. The property, which contained upwards of fifteen
                    thousand acres, was divided into nearly equal portions, and distributed among
                    the principal farmers by lot, a part having been reserved for the formation of a
                    projected village, and for some other purposes connected with the establishment;
                    and a comfortable brick house and offices were built at each farm for the
                    accommodation of the emigrants.</p>
                <p>In April 1828, when the colony had been in existence three years, and had the
                    fairest prospect of ultimate success, it presented a very interesting
                    appearance. It had already attracted the attention of the most intelligent
                    citizens of Buenos Ayres, and of the inhabitants around it. The farmers had made
                    considerable progress in bringing under culture the lands which had been
                    apportioned to them, and which they found almost in a state of nature. While
                    introducing the Scottish system of farming, they judiciously adopted those
                    agricultural practices of the country which were found best suited to the soil
                    and climate, and with the most decided advantage. Two thousand and fourteen
                    acres had then been inclosed with well-made ditches, and planted with young
                    hedges formed of <hi rend="italic">tala,</hi> a thorny shrub, natural to the
                    country, which, on trial, had been found well calculated for this purpose. Four
                    hundred and thirty-nine acres had been planted with forest and fruit trees, in
                    addition <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741487" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1487-0648"/>to
                    the <hi rend="italic">tala</hi> thicket, which they found in existence; and-they
                    had abundant crops of maize or Indian corn, but had failed in their attempts to
                    cultivate wheat. The dairy had proved a very lucrative branch of industry, the
                    colonists having in their possession two thousand seven hundred and fifty-seven
                    head of black cattle, principally milch cows. They made considerable quantities
                    of butter and cheese, which, on account of its excellent quality, was quickly
                    sold in the city at high prices.</p>
                <p>Some of the original emigrants had left the colony, but had been replaced by
                    others of the party of Beaumont; and the colony then consisted of one hundred
                    and fifty-three men, eighty-eight women, and eighty-seven children, in all three
                    hundred and twenty-six Scotch; and a hundred and eighty-eight natives of the
                    country were employed in their various domestic and agricultural occupations,
                    with which they had become familiarized. A Presbyterian chapel had been erected,
                    and a clergyman brought from Scotland, who, besides his clerical duties,
                    superintended the education of the children of the colony. The improvements
                    which they had introduced into the agricultural practices of the country were
                    numerous and important; but it may suffice to state one or two instances to
                    evince the advantages arising from their zeal and intelligence. During the first
                    year of their settlement one of their number lost some of his crop, in
                    consequence of the dried thistles in the neighbourhood taking fire and extending
                    its ravages to his fields. The conflagration, however, was speedily
                    extinguished, and prevented from extending itself farther, by the strenuous and
                    united efforts of all the colonists. But to prevent a similar occurrence in
                    future, and to clear their lands from suchrintruders, one of their number
                    invented an instrument which with little expense and trouble speedily
                    accomplished this object. The wheels, axle-tree, and trams of a cart were
                    procured; two perpendicular shafts were made to project downwards from the
                    axle-tree, having the lower extremity armed with scythes; a rotatorymotion was
                    communicated to these scythes by the movement of the wheels of the cart, and
                    they cut across all the young thistles which intervened between the wheels in
                    passing. It was moved by a single horse. When this was done at the proper
                    season, the thistles did not arrive at maturity or bear seed that year, and were
                    thus gradually extinguished. The <hi rend="italic">biscachos</hi> committed
                    great ravages among their corn and green crops, and were therefore rooted out of
                    the colony by the following means. By the common consent of the colonists, the
                    whole of their burrows, which are generally found crowded together in certain
                    localities, were firmly closed up with earth; and the same operation was
                    repeated daily for some time, where new holes were formed, until these animals
                    were either driven from the district, or perished in their burrows from
                    excessive labour and deficient food; for they are timid, and only venture out to
                    feed during the night time.</p>
                <p>Since the above period, however, the Scottish colony at Monte Grande has
                    experienced various vicissitudes tending to retard its progress. During the
                    civil war which prevailed in the province in 1829, the whole of their live stock
                    was swept away by the combatants; but the colonists having assiduously
                    cultivated their fields when their neighbours had suspended their agricultural
                    operations in consequence of the disturbed state of the country, they sold their
                    produce at high prices, the people being almost entirely dependent on them for
                    some articles, and thereby more than counterbalanced the losses they had
                    otherwise sustained. Subsequently they have experienced, in common with all the
                    rest of the province, the fatal consequences of the longcontinued drought which
                    has almost ever since prevailed, and against which no foresight or industry
                    could provide. From these and other causes the original establishment has been
                    broken up; and the farms are now held on a different tenure by several of the
                    original farmers, who have, in some instances, been joined by their friends and
                    relatives from Scotland.</p>
                <p>Artizans in considerable numbers have likewise resorted from Europe to this
                    province, and, when industrious, they have almost uniformly improved their
                    circumstances. They have plenty of employment, and, as well as the agricultural
                    labourers, receive high wages. These inducements, the abundance and cheapness of
                    living, and the protection of person, property, and religion, which is enjoyed
                    at Buenos Ayres, only require to be better and more generally known in Europe to
                    induce a considerable portion of its redundant population to remove to a country
                    possessing so fine a climate, with such great natural and social advantages.</p>
                <p>Emigrants from Great Britain have even greater inducements than others to settle
                    in this country, as, besides the security and privileges insured to all
                    foreigners settling among them by the established laws of the country, they are
                    especially protected by a treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, concluded
                    on the 2d February 1825, between his Britannic majesty and the supreme
                    authorities of the united provinces of the Rio de la Plata. This treaty
                    guarantees a reciprocal freedom of commerce and navigation; security of person
                    and property, even in the event of a rupture between the two countries; the
                    right of possessing and disposing of property of all kinds by will or otherwise;
                    exemption from all compulsory military services by sea or land, and from all
                    forced loans or military exactions; the enjoyment of perfect liberty of
                    conscience, with the free exercise of religion; and the right of building
                    churches or chapels, with the previous consent of the government, and of forming
                    burial-places for their own use. į.British capital to a considerable amount has
                    already been invested in the purchase of property in this country, and in the
                    formation of <hi rend="italic">estancias</hi> and other establishments; and
                    emigrants from Great Britain are received with the best and most friendly
                    feelings on the part of the inhabitants, the more intelligent part of whom are
                    strongly impressed with the conviction, that the future prosperity of their
                    country will mainly depend on the augmented number of industrious emigrants from
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>Such emigrants as possess capital, and resort to Buenos Ayres for the purpose of
                    engaging in the breeding of cattle or in agriculture, will find valuable
                    properties which may be purchased at moderate prices. The value, however, varies
                    considerably according to situation and other circumstances. The sale of public
                    lands has been prohibited for some years past, in consequence of the extensive
                    alienation of state lands which formerly took place, ata time when the price
                    obtained was very inconsiderable, and altogether inadequate to their real value.
                    The law of <hi rend="italic">emphyteusis</hi> was therefore passed, which
                    prohibits the further sale of public lands until the country shall be relieved
                    from the debts and other obligations contracted by the government, and its
                    revenue otherwise well regulated; it being anticipated that, as the government
                    becomes more permanent and efficient, and the population more numerous and
                    industrious, the increased value of these lands will not only suffice to relieve
                    the country of these encumbrances, but will furnish a permanent revenue, so as
                    to enable the government to lessen the custom-house duties and other taxes. This
                    law has been considered as favourable to emigrants and natives desirous of
                    forming <hi rend="italic">estancias</hi> or farms, by its preventing the
                    accumulation of large tracts of land in the han s of capitalists, who might
                    exercise an undue or caρ∏cio <hi rend="superscript"> us</hi> influence over such
                    settlers, or retain their lands in an un productive state; and by enabling
                    settlers at once to employ all their capital in the improvement of the proper y
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741500" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1500-0649"/> they occupy,
                    instead of sinking a large portion of it in the purchase of land.</p>
                <p>These regulations enable the authorities to dispose of the public lands on leases
                    of not less than eight years, at an annual quitrent, estimated at about eighty
                    dollars, or L.16 sterling, for every square league of land; the precise sum,
                    however, is fixed by a jury of the neighbouring proprietors, on a survey and
                    measurement being made at the public expense, under the direction of the
                    topographical board; it being necessary in granting leases, or in the transfer
                    of property, to have their limits determined by such means, to render these
                    transactions legal. To the leases of public lands are annexed the following
                    conditions, namely, that all improvements made on the lands during the lease
                    shall belong to the lessee, be transferable to his heirs or successors, and paid
                    for according to valuation, by government, or by his successor, in the event of
                    his leaving the land at the end of the lease; and that, in the event of the
                    property being sold by the government, the lessee shall have a preferable right
                    to become the purch’aser over every other person. To render such leases valid,
                    if for an <hi rend="italic">estancia,</hi> the tenant is required within two
                    years to have on the property at least a hundred head of cattle, the requisite
                    number of horses, a hut or dwelling-house, and a <hi rend="italic">corral</hi>
                    or inclosure for the cattle, for every square league of land so occupied. At the
                    termination of the lease, if desirous of continuing in possession, a renewal of
                    the lease may be obtained on an increase of rent proportioned to the augmented
                    value of land, as determined by a jury.</p>
                <p>The promulgation of this law was followed by many applications for lands, and
                    numerous <hi rend="italic">estancias</hi> have accordingly been formed.
                    Endeavours have been made by influential individuals possessing capital, and
                    desirous of obtaining entire possession of some of these lands, to have this law
                    rescinded, but hitherto without success, or any probability of such a change; as
                    the general impression among the influential inhabitants of Buenos Ayres is
                    favourable to the permanency of a measure so much calculated to maintain the
                    credit and respectability of the country and of government.</p>
                <p>From its advantageous position, Buenos Ayres seems destined to become the great
                    emporium of commerce in this part of South America, being situated near the
                    confluence of the rivers Parana and Uruguay, where they unite to form the Rio de
                    la Plata. An easy communication is thereby afforded with those extensive and
                    important countries through which these mighty rivers and their numerous
                    tributaries flow. The Parana, which is considered the parent stream, may be
                    navigated without impediment as far as the island of Apipe, distant fifteen
                    hundred miles from the mouth of the river Plata, at Cape Santa Maria. The river
                    Paraguay, of equal importance, may be ascended nearly as far as the Laguna de
                    los Xarayes, and conveys vessels of considerable size to Assumption, the capital
                    of Paraguay, in which country vessels of three hundred tons have been built, and
                    afterwards employed in foreign voyages. The large and important rivers Pilcomayo
                    and Vermejo flow into the Paraguay, and extend the communication by water within
                    a short distance of the centre of Bolivia, traversing in their course the
                    provinces of Salta and Gran Chaco. Farther south the fertile provinces of
                    Tucuman and Sant Iago del Estero communicate with the Parana by means of the
                    Salado, which unites with it at Santa Fě; and the river Tercero may be rendered
                    available, at an inconsiderable expense, in improving the communication with the
                    provinces of Cordova and of Cuyo, situated near the Andes.</p>
                <p>1he Uruguay, in connection with the Rio Negro, and other important rivers which
                    unite with it, penetrate far into the interior, and open up an extensive and
                    fertile country to commerce and civilization. Little advantage, however, has
                    hitherto been taken of all these facilities, either by the Spaniards or their
                    successors; and the commerce which is carried on by means of these rivers is as
                    yet very limited. The establishment of steam navigation will powerfully
                    contribute to the extension of industry and civilization throughout these
                    countries, by the certainty and rapidity of communication which will be the
                    consequence. By this means a voyage may be made from Buenos Ayres to Assumption
                    in a fortnight, though under present circumstances it occupies several
                    months.</p>
                <p>The commercial intercourse of Buenos Ayres with the interior has hithertobeen
                    principally carried on by means of mules, and of waggons drawn by six bullocks
                    each. These waggons are of a rude and clumsy construction, being formed entirely
                    of wood, and are secured and strengthened by pieces of hide.. They usually
                    travel in troops of from twelve to twenty in number, for mutual protection and
                    assistance in cases of difficulty. Those which travel from Mendoza or San Juan
                    to the capital, a distance of about nine hundred miles, generally occupy a month
                    in the journey. By means of these waggons a very extensive traffic was formerly
                    carried on from Buenos Ayres for the supply of Upper Peru with European
                    productions, and yerba or Paraguay tea, of which about 2,500,000 pounds were
                    formerly sent every year to Peru, and 1,000,000 pounds to Chili. They travelled
                    by way of Cordova, Tucuman, and Salta, to Jujuy, which is situated on the
                    confines of Bolivia, and distant 1617 miles from Buenos Ayres. But the war of
                    independence greatly interrupted this traffic; and subsequent events having
                    enabled Bolivia to obtain supplies by a cheaper and more direct route, it has
                    nearly ceased, excepting for the consumption of the intervening provinces, the
                    greater part of which will eventually obtain supplies, and an -outlet for their
                    productions, at much less expense, by means of the rivers Vermejo and Salado,
                    which traverse these provinces.</p>
                <p>The commerce of Buenos Ayres, although subject to many and injurious restrictions
                    under the Spanish regime, was very considerable, as Peru obtained many of its
                    supplies by this channel. The average annual trade of this port between 1792 and
                    1796 was as follows:</p>

                <p>The extent and value of the foreign commerce of Buenos Ayres have since become
                    very considerable, having gradually increased in importance since free
                    intercourse has been permitted with other countries. The external wars and civil
                    dissensions in which its inhabitants have been engaged have somewhat retarded
                    its progress, but to a less extent than might have been expected. When its
                    commerce is viewed in relation to the population and resources of the country,
                    its amount far exceeds that of the other New South American states, and shows
                    the great advantages it has derived from a free and unrestricted intercourse
                    with other nations, and the liberal and enlightened principles pursued by the
                    authorities in regulating this intercourse, and encouraging industry and
                    enterprise.</p>
                <p>In 1S21 the number of vessels cleared out at Buenos Ayres were 322, of which 114
                    were British; in 1822 there were 304, of which 167 were British; in 1830 there
                    were 250, of which sixty were British, seventy-one North American, forty-one
                    national, twenty-six Brazilian, and the remainder of various nations. During
                    1821 and the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741513" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1513-0650"
                    />three following years, the number of vessels which arrived at Buenos Ayres
                    laden with goods and produce from Great Britain were a hundred and twenty-eight,
                    a hundred and thirty-three, a hundred and thirteen, and a hundred and ten; but
                    during 1831 only forty-four British vessels with cargoes arrived at Buenos
                    Ayres, owing to the depressed state of commerce. The trade of Buenos Ayres with
                    Paraguay has been almost entirely suspended during the last twelve years, in
                    consequence of the extraordinary policy pursued by Francia, the ruler of that
                    country; but it will undoubtedly be renewed on a change taking place, as its
                    productions are important and in great demand all over South America, especially
                    the yerba or Paraguay tea, obtained from the <hi rend="italic">Ilex
                    Paraguayensis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the tobacco, which is of superior
                    quality. Valuable timber is also obtained from the same country, with which an
                    extensive commerce was formerly carried on.</p>
                <p>With the exception of Brazil, the commerce of Buenos Ayres is of more importance
                    to Great Britain than that of any other of the new states of South America. The
                    whole exports from Britain to South America and Mexico exclusive of Brazil,
                    during four years ending 1825, amounted to L.12,986,139 sterling; and of this
                    upwards of one third, or L.4,648,451, was sent to the Rio de la Plata. The value
                    of the trade of Great Britain with this country is shown by the following table
                    of exports and imports to Buenos Ayres in each year from 1806, when it was first
                    opened to foreign commerce, to 1830, with the exception of 1808, 1809, 1810,
                    1811, and 1813, the records of which years were destroyed by fire. The
                    diminution during 1826, 1827, and 1828, was owing to the war carried on between
                    Buenos Ayres and Brazil, during which period the port of Buenos Ayres was
                    strictly blockaded by the naval forces of the latter power.</p>

                <p>The commerce of the United States of North America for one year ending 30th
                    September 1826, with Buenos Ayres, amounted to 522,769 dollars, or L.104,553.
                    12s. of imports, and 379,340 dollars, or L.75,868, of exports, of which 222,832
                    dollars consisted of domestic produce, and 155,508 dollars of foreign produce.
                    This trade has, however, greatly extended itself of late years, in consequence
                    of the fatal effects of the civil dissensions and other domestic calamities upon
                    the crops. To supply the necessary wants of the inhabitants, large quantities of
                    flour have been imported from North America, which has greatly tended to
                    impoverish the country. The trade with the United States for flour will no doubt
                    be greatly diminished, or cease altogether, if the republic remains tranquil,
                    and is enabled to attend to agricultural pursuits. In former times considerable
                    quantities of wheat were exported from Buenos Ayres to Brazil.</p>
                <p>The imports into Buenos Ayres consist of manufactured goods from Europe, Asia,
                    and North America; wines and brandies from France, Spain, and Sicily; Rhenish
                    wines from Hamburg; gin from Hamburg, Antwerp, and North America; rum from
                    Brazil and Havannah; ale, porter, salt, coals, iron, flag-stones, and other
                    merchandise, from Great Britain; sugar, rum, and arrack, from the Isle of
                    France, in exchange for mules; rum, rice, and tobacco, from the Havannah, in
                    exchange for jerked beef; flour, pine-boards, planks, and mahogany, from the
                    United States of North America. The following table shows the nature and value
                    of these imports during 1829 and 1830.</p>

                <p>A bank of discounts was established in Buenos Ayres in 1822, with a capital of
                    one million of dollars, which continued to prosper while it remained a private
                    concern, and under the management of those most interested in its prosperity.
                    When the province of Buenos Ayres became engaged, almost single handed, in a
                    contest with the empire of Brazil, the exigencies of the government induced the
                    authorities to use their influence to have it converted into a national bank, of
                    which the government became large shareholders, and acquired great influence in
                    its management. Strenuous efforts were made to extend its operations to the
                    other provinces, but the introduction of its paper currency was so firmly
                    opposed in almost every quarter, that very little has ever gone beyond the
                    province. The fatal consequences of this measure were soon apparent in the great
                    and rapid depreciation of the bank paper; an evil which was increased by every
                    successive issue of paper to supply the wants of the government during the war
                    with Brazil, and during the civil dissensions which have subsequently occurred.
                    From forty-five pence, at which the paper dollar stood before the formation of
                    the national bank, it fell at one time as low as fivepence halfpenny, and,
                    according to the latest accounts, was sevenpence halfpenny per dollar. The
                    interference of the government with this institution, of which they became the
                    principal debtors, has proved ruinous in the extreme to the wealth and
                    prosperity of the inhabitants. An effort was made by the authorities to remedy
                    this great evil, by the imposition of certain extra duties and taxes, from which
                    sources a sinking fund was created to purchase up and extinguish the bank
                    currency; and some progress has already been made in this undertaking, but as
                    yet little compared with the extent of the evil. The bank has thus become so
                    intimately connected with the financial state of the country, that it can now
                    only recover its former credit in proportion as the state is enabled to repay
                    the debts which it has contracted in relation to this establishment.</p>
                <p>The revenue derived by Spain from Buenos Ayres from 1776, when it was formed into
                    a vice-royalty, until 1806, when it was taken by the English, seldom exceeded
                    seven hundred thousand dollars annually; which sum not only comprised the
                    revenue of the provinces of Rio de la Plata, but also that of Upper Peru. It was
                    derived from the alcabala, a duty of from three to five per cent, on all sales
                    and re-sales, tithes, royal fifths of gold and silver, a poll tax on the
                    Indians, sales of papal bulls, tonnage duties, &amp;c. Many of these imposts
                    were very oppressive, and often exacted with great partiality and injustice. But
                    they ceased to be productive on the commencement of the revolution, with the
                    exception of the customs, which were greatly augmented, in consequence of the
                    extensive, trade which ensued. The revenue derived from the custom-house of
                    Buenos Ayres for five years ending 1795 amounted to 1,947,849 dollars, giving an
                    annual average of 389,569 dollars; during 1802 it had increased to 857,702
                    dollars. Various attempts were made by the new government to increase the amount
                    of revenue from this source, by an augmentation of the duties, but with the most
                    injurious consequences to the revenue, as the high duties created so extensive a
                    system of contraband trade, in a country possessing so many facilities for the
                    infraction of the revenue laws, that on some occasions whole cargoes were landed
                    without the payment of any duties.</p>
                <p>In 1821 effectual measures were taken to remedy this evil, by remodelling the
                    custom-house, and establishing a new scale of duties, formed on such moderate
                    and just principles as tended to remove the temptation to further violation of
                    the revenue laws. By the new tariff, the duties imposed on imports were from
                    five to twenty-five per cent.; all duties being abolished on goods transmitted
                    to the interior or received from thence, hides excepted. The beneficial
                    consequences resulting from these regulations were apparent, in the immediate
                    termination of smuggling, and the great increase in the revenue from the
                    custom-house. The stamps and licenses were properly regulated, and extended to
                    public houses. The port duties were continued, but national vessels were
                    exempted. A property tax was imposed on capital, merchants paying annually eight
                    dollars, manufacturers six, breeders of cattle two, farmers one, and all others
                    two dollars for every thousand dollars of property; every one having less than
                    one thousand dollars of capital being exempted from this duty, and, if married,
                    less than two thousand dollars. The alcabala was abolished, and next year the
                    tithes shared the same fate. After the improvements made in 1821, however, the
                    increase of the revenue from the customs and other sources was very remakable.
                    In 1822 and 1823, and subsequently, the amount of these, with sales and rents of
                    public property, has been as follows.</p>

                <p>During the early years of the revolution, the revenue having proved insufficient
                    to meet the expenses of the war of independence, various loans were at different
                    times obtained, and these were allowed to accumulate until 1821, when they were
                    examined and found to amount to about four and a half millions of dollars. This
                    debt was then consolidated, and a sinking fund created for its gradual
                    extinction, which has been in operation cver since. But in the interim a variety
                    of causes gave rise to the accumulation of new debts. During 1824 a loan was
                    contracted in London for one million sterling at six per cent., the contracting
                    price being eighty-five per cent. The value of these bonds fluctuated
                    considerably during the continuance of the Rivadavian administration, the
                    interest having been regularly paid in London when due; but only on one occasion
                    did they fall so low as forty. Since 12th July 1827, however, no interest
                    whatever has been paid, consequently these bonds have fallen in value, having
                    varied from forty to twenty, their present value being about twenty-four per
                    cent. Besides this loan, various other additions have been made to the public
                    debt during the war with Brazil, of which the following statement presents an
                    approximate view.</p>

                <p>To this amount should be added the interest due on the loan contracted in England
                    at six per cent, during the last five years; and also a loan of four millions of
                    current dol- ' lars, amounting, at 7∣d. each, to L.125,000 sterling, which has
                    been raised by subscription in the province during the early part of 1832, to
                    enable the government to pay the expenses incurred by the late civil war. These
                    sums being united to the others, will raise the total amount of the public debt
                    to about four millions sterling.</p>
                <p>With the exception of the loan contracted in London, the whole of the remaining
                    debt is redeemable in the currency of the country, and, in consequence of its
                    great depreciation, could easily be paid off' at the present time. But as this
                    can only be accomplished gradually, the rates of exchange will necessarily rise
                    in proportion to the progress made in the payment of the floating debt, and on
                    the general prosperity of the country. The two sinking funds are still in
                    operation for the extinction of the public debts; the one to redeem the funded
                    debt, the other formed from the new duties imposed for the express purpose of
                    buying up and destroying the bank-notes in circulation, or floating debt, and
                    thereby removing the principal cause of the present depreciation. From 16th
                    November 1829, when this latter sinking fund was first established, to 15th
                    January 1832, it has produced 2,481,323 current dollars, or L.76,29l. 6s. lid.
                    sterling, which has been already applied to the extinction of the paper
                    currency. The revenue, in times of peace, considerably exceeds the necessary
                    public expenditure; and, if tranquillity can be maintained for some years, it
                    will materially contribute to the ultimate payment of the public debt. Besides,
                    the public lands are preserved inviolate as a guarantee to the public creditors;
                    an example which ought undoubtedly to be followed with the public lands of the
                    other provinces, as they have had an equal share .in the good or bad
                    consequences resulting from the war of independence, the war with Brazil, and
                    the civil contentions which have occasionally prevailed in the country, and
                    given rise to the accumulation of these debts, the province of Buenos Ayres
                    having on all these occasions principally contributed the necessary funds. That
                    effectual measures will be adopted to accomplish this very desirable object as
                    soon as circumstances will permit, cannot be doubted, as the authorities and the
                    community are in general strongly impressed with the importance of regaining
                    their credit, both at home and abroad; and it is but doing justice to the
                    national character for good faith in pecuniary matters, to state, that prior to
                    the Brazilian war, and the depreciation of the currency, it was a rare
                    occurrence for any native of the Argentine Provinces engaged in business to
                    become bankrupt, or to fail in the due performance of his pecuniary
                    engagements.</p>
                <p>In 1806, when the city of Buenos Ayres was taken by; the British, its population
                    was estimated at sixty thousand, ι In 1823 a calculation of the population was
                    made from the bills of mortality of the city and country; the proportion of <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> g being assumed as the
                    measure of mortality in the former, and ⅛ in the latter, which gave 81∙136 for
                    the city and 82∙080 for the country. In 1822 and 1823 the proportion of deaths
                    to births was as 100 to 111 in the city, and 100 to 156 in the country, the
                    average of the whole province being 100 to 131. The assertion that a larger
                    proportion of females than of males is born in this country has been disproved
                    by the same returns, which show the births of males to that of females to be 100
                    to 95 in the city, and 100 to 96 in the country. The proportion of deaths under
                    fifteen years of age to that of deaths above this age was 100 to 95 in the city,
                    and 100 to 98 in the country. The following table of marriages, births, and
                    deaths in the city and province of Buenos Ayres during the first six months of
                    1822, indicates the relative proportions<pb break="no" facs="nls:193741566"

                    proportion of the latter were then slaves. Their number has since been
                    considerably diminished, in consequence of the operation of the existing laws
                    for the extinction of slavery.</p>

                <p>The number of negro slaves in the province of Buenos Ayres was never very great;
                    they have seldom been employed in laborious works, but principally in the city
                    as domestic servants, and have generally been treated with great kindness by
                    their masters and mistresses.· The laws which have regulated the relation of
                    master and slave in the Spanish colonies have always been mild and favourable to
                    the latter, and their condition has been improved by the revolution. There is a
                    law in this republic which enables a slave, if dissatisfied with the treatment
                    received from his owner, to insist on being sold, provided he can find a
                    purchaser willing to pay the price given for him, or his full value as
                    ascertained by competent judges; a regulation which exercises a most beneficial
                    influence on the proprietor as well as on the slave. In 1813 it was decreed by
                    the national congress, on the declaration of independence, that all children
                    born of slave parents after that date should be free, consequently the number of
                    slaves has been greatly diminished. During the early part of the revolution
                    several thousands of the male negro slaves were purchased by the government from
                    their owners, to serve as soldiers in the patriot armies, a practice which was
                    discontinued in 1822. From all these causes, the number of negroes who are not
                    yet free cannot now exceed one twelfth or one fifteenth part of the population.
                    By the treaty concluded with Great Britain, all Argentines are prohibited from
                    engaging in the slave trade. Little attention has hitherto been paid to the
                    education or moral training of the free children of slaves; an evil which is now
                    very apparent, and which ought to have been provided for on passing the law to
                    which they owe their freedom.</p>
                <p>The aboriginal tribes of Indians who inhabit the southern part of this continent,
                    east of the Cordillera of the Andes, are very inconsiderable in number, not
                    exceeding 8000, including men, women, and children, according to the most
                    authentic information; but even these have often proved formidable enemies, from
                    their rapid movements and unexpected attacks on the Creoles, who, although more
                    numerous, were often disunited, and without effective means of defence.
                    Occasionally on these incursions they have been augmented by parties of the
                    Araucanian Indians from the shores of the Pacific Ocean, who are closely allied
                    to them in manners and character, use nearly the same language, and are
                    distinguished by the same acuteness and intrepidity which have so long
                    characterized that nation. It is truly satisfactory to find, that of late peace
                    and tranquillity has been maintained with the Indians, and a good understanding
                    established with them, in consequence of the conciliatory and pacific measures
                    recently pursued by the authorities of Buenos Ayres in their intercourse with
                    these tribes, who now resort in greater numbers and with more confidence than
                    formerly, to the capital, where they carry on a traffic with the inhabitants,
                    and behave with more order and decorum than previously. They have evinced some
                    disposition to adopt the customs and habits of civilized life; and in one
                    district on the frontier the Indian population applied to the government for the
                    erection of a Catholic chapel. Such occurrences as these indicate that the
                    present period is favourable for the introduction of schools for the education
                    of their children, and of those institutions which tend to the promotion of
                    order and industry. Instances are not wanting of their aptitude for improvement,
                    and of the great value they attach to the attainment of knowledge; but hitherto
                    no effort has been made to improve their condition; and they have been taught
                    little by the Creoles excepting their vices, a large proportion of those who
                    have hitherto penetrated into their country having been worthless characters, or
                    such as have fled from justice to avoid the punishment of their crimes. A
                    systematic plan for introducing civilization among this people, if pursued with
                    steadiness and good faith, could not fail of success, and in a few years would
                    convert these tribes, from being the scourge and terror of the country, into
                    quiet and industrious neighbours. The further extension of the Argentine
                    republic towards the south would be greatly facilitated by these means, and very
                    extensive and valuable tracts of country acquired by purchase at an expense far
                    inferior to their real value; every circumstance calculated to produce a renewal
                    of hostilities on the part of the Indians would be avoided; confidence and
                    security would be restored; and a new impulse would be given to the industry and
                    enterprise of the country. Hitherto it has been too much the practice to deprive
                    the Indians of their lands by fraud or violence, when the same object might have
                    been more effectually attained by milder means, had good faith and strict
                    justice been observed towards them. The number of foreigners resident in the
                    city and province of Buenos Ayres is estimated at 12,000, of whom one third are
                    British, one third French, and the remainder Germans, Italians, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Great improvements have taken place at Buenos Ayres in all the departments of
                    education. In 1821 a university was founded there by a decree of the government,
                    and an annual grant of ten thousand dollars given for its maintenance; salaries
                    varying from four hundred to one thousand dollars per annum having been assigned
                    to each of the professors. The principal departments of education then and
                    subsequently instituted at this establishment have been Latin, French, and
                    English, drawing, elementary and practical mathematics, logic, moral and natural
                    philosophy, political economy, civil and national law, theory and practice of
                    medicine and surgery, materia medica, chemistry, and natural history; and a
                    commencement has been made in the formation of a national museum. Provision was
                    also made for the education of those destined for the clerical profession.
                    Degrees of law, medicine, and legislature, are conferred at this university. The
                    government of Buenos Ayres made an offer to the provinces to educate at this
                    university, at the public expense, six young men from each province; an offer
                    which, with few exceptions, was gratefully accepted: but one province in
                    particular, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741579" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1579-0655"
                    />Mendoza, not satisfied with this number, solicited permission to send twelve
                    of the youth of that province; a request which was acceded to, much to the
                    satisfaction and advantage of its inhabitants. Numbers of young men have also
                    been sent from Buenos Ayres to different parts of Europe for the improvement of
                    their education.</p>
                <p>Commercial, military, and various other academies and public schools, on improved
                    principles, have been established in the city for the education of the children
                    of the more wealthy classes, and, among these, an infant school particularly
                    merits attention. Upwards of eight schools on the Lancasterian system have been
                    formed for the tuition of the boys of the lower classes, and are supported at
                    the public expense. A school for the education of the children of foreigners has
                    been established by the British residents, and supported by voluntary
                    contributions and other charitable expedients. During 1830 seventy-two boys and
                    seventeen girls were educated at this school.</p>
                <p>In former times the education of females was entirely neglected in this country;
                    but since the country became independent, great advances have been made in this
                    branch of education, more especially in the course of the last nine years,
                    during which time no department of public improvement has made more steady or
                    efficient advances than that of female education. On the 12th of April 1823 an
                    institution called the Society of Beneficence was established under the auspices
                    of the government, and composed of about twenty of the most influential ladies
                    of Buenos Ayres, to whose care was intrusted the direction and superintendence
                    of female education throughout the city and the province. The system of tuition
                    adopted by this society in their schools was that of mutual instruction,
                    introduced by Lancaster, with various improvements recommended by Madame Quignon
                    and others. Besides reading, writing, and arithmetic, they are taught sewing and
                    embroidery in all its departments, and are likewise, in some schools, instructed
                    in the domestic and other duties most suited to their respective stations. In
                    1825 the number of schools was seven, and these contained six hundred children.
                    In 1827 there were eleven schools, seven in the city, with five hundred and
                    eighty-eight scholars, and four in the province, at San Jose de Flores, San
                    Pedro, Chascomus, and San Nicoas, with two hundred and seventy-one scholars; in
                    all eight hundred and fifty-nine female children. At the commencement of 1832
                    the number of schools under the care of the society, in the city and province,
                    amounted to fourteen, new ones having been instituted at Luxan and San Fernando;
                    and the number of females educated altogether amounted to one thousand two
                    hundred and four. The experience acquired has enabled the society to reduce its
                    expenditure to less than one half of the sum incurred in 1825, which was sixteen
                    thousand one hundred and six dollars, and at the same time to double the number
                    of schools and young females educated. A uniform system of education prevails in
                    all these schools; and the mistresses or teachers employed, with the exception
                    of four, have been trained and educated in the schools of the society.</p>
                <p>There is annually a public examination of the scholars attending these schools,
                    about the time of celebrating the festivals in commemoration of independence. On
                    these occasions the needle-work and other productions of the girls are exhibited
                    to the public, and prizes, provided at the expense of the government and the
                    society, distributed to the most deserving. At each festival three other prizes,
                    the one valued at two hundred, and the others at a hundred dollars each,
                    provided by the government, are adjudged by the society to those females who
                    have most distinguished themselves by good moral conduct, industry, and filial
                    affection. These prizes have been distributed annually since the establishment
                    of the society, and have had much influence in improving the moral and
                    industrious habits of the community. The zeal and uniform constancy with which
                    the ladies connected with this institution have discharged the duties intrusted
                    to them reflect the highest credit on their patriotism and active benevolence,
                    and have already conferred important and lasting benefits on their country.</p>
                <p>In 1830 a commission was appointed by the government to investigate the actual
                    state of education in all its various departments throughout the province. An
                    able and judicious report was given in on the 16th March, pointing out numerous
                    defects in the system pursued at the different establishments for education, and
                    suggesting various improvements calculated to render them more efficient, and to
                    place the different departments in greater harmony and accordance with each
                    other, and under a more efficient and responsible superintendence, than
                    heretofore. Primary instruction, consisting of reading, writing, arithmetic,
                    grammar, and the elements of morals and religion, was to be general and
                    obligatory on all the inhabitants. Scientific instruction, consisting of
                    preparatory studies and philosophy, physical and mathematical sciences,
                    medicine, jurisprudence, and theology, was to be optional but gratuitous to all
                    the youth of the country. This report was approved of by the authorities, and is
                    now in course of being carried into practice. These regulations do not apply to
                    any other seminaries of education, excepting those supported at the public
                    expense. No interference, however, has taken place in the department of female
                    education, which still continues under the efficient superintendence of the
                    Society of Beneficence.</p>
                <p>In 1811 a public library was formed in Buenos Ayres ļ by the late Dr Mariano
                    Moreno, one of the most influential persons in effecting the revolution of 1810.
                    At first it contained only 12,000 volumes; but in 1822 it had increased to abput
                    20,000. It has been well selected and regulated, while every convenience and
                    accommodation has been provided for those desirous of consulting the works which
                    it contains. Books of all kinds have free admission into the country on the
                    payment of a small duty, and have of late been imported in considerable
                    quantities from France and England; evincing the increased desire for
                    information which has extended itself over the country. Nothing, however, tends
                    so much to demonstrate the advances made in intellectual pursuits by the
                    inhabitants, as the great activity of the periodical press of Buenos Ayres. The
                    newspapers are numerous, and generally well conducted. They contain much local
                    information connected with statistics and commerce, numerous advertisements, and
                    intelligence from other countries, more especially from the various New South
                    American states. Three daily newspapers are at present published in Buenos
                    Ayres, one of which has existed for eight years. There are various others
                    published once, twice, or three times a week, among which are one in the French
                    and two in the English language; one of the latter, the British Packet, having
                    been published during the last six years. The free and unrestricted liberty of
                    the press was established in 1821, and thereafter exercised in its fullest
                    extent until 1828, when party spirit having become greatly excited, some
                    publications displeasing to the existing authorities made their appearance, and
                    led to the enactment of various restrictions on the freedom of discussion.
                    Trials for offences of the press have in consequence since taken place, and no
                    publications expressing opinions at variance with the policy of the ruling
                    authorities have been allowed to make their appearance, while much difference of
                    opinion has been known to exist. The preceding administration pursued a very
                    dif-ferentpolicy, and imposed no restrictions, but trusted to public opinion for
                    a refutation of any calumnies raised against them. The tranquillity,
                    contentment, and prosperity which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741592"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-1592-0656"/>prevailed at Buenos Ayres previous to 1828, when
                    contrasted with the scenes which have followed, sufficiently demonstrate the
                    great importance of allowing the utmost liberty in the expression of opinions on
                    political matters.</p>
                <p>Among the literary productions which have issued from the press may be enumerated
                    the historical work of Dean Funes, in which are detailed all the events
                    connected with the revolution and the war of independence; some dramatic
                    productions of Varela; and recently there has been published a collection of
                    Buenos-Ayrean poetry, which is highly creditable to the talents and imaginative
                    powers of the inhabitants. Among these the national ode written by the
                    distinguished Don Vicente Lopez, the present minister for foreign affairs,
                    particularly merits distinction. A statistical register was established in 1822,
                    under the auspices of government, and published monthly for several years,
                    containing the most minute and circumstantial statistical details. A literary
                    society was also established, which, during its continuance, published
                    periodically the <hi rend="italic">Abeja Argentina·,</hi> a work containing much
                    scientific and useful information. A topographical society was formed, and the
                    labours of its members have been most useful in fixing the limits of property
                    throughout the province, the greater portion having been scientifically surveyed
                    under its direction. Plans and maps of the various districts have been
                    constructed, and some of them published. The results of the whole, and a general
                    map of the republic, will, it is expected, be soon published under the able
                    auspices and superintendence of the members of this department. No sale or
                    transfer of property can now take place in the province without a previous
                    survey of it being made to the satisfaction of this department.</p>
                <p>Few alterations have been made in the Spanish laws which regulated these
                    countries; and these have been principally for the purpose of rendering them
                    more applicable to the new political condition of the country. Their
                    administration has, however, been much improved; judges have been made
                    independent in the exercise of their functions; and justices of the peace, to
                    take cognizance of all cases in the first instance, have been established in the
                    city and all parts of the provinces, each being resident in the centre of his
                    district for the administration of justice; an institution which has been
                    attended with the most satisfactory results. The administration of justice is
                    still, however, very defective in many respects. The plan of a new system has
                    been prepared by the <hi rend="italic">Camera de Justicia,</hi> which, it is
                    expected, will be adopted; but it is objectionable in as far as it does not
                    admit of <hi rend="italic">viva voce</hi> evidence. All offences committed by
                    the press are decided by the verdict of a jury, but no law has yet been made to
                    regulate the impartial selection of persons qualified to sit on such juried;
                    they have hitherto been chosen by the government, a pow er which appears very
                    liable to abuse. The law of primogeniture does not exist in this country, the
                    property of each parent, on his or her decease, being divided equally among all
                    the children; an additional share, however, may be reserved and bequeathed by
                    the parent to such of the children as may have been most deserving of such a
                    distinction.</p>
                <p>Since the commencement of the revolution this country has been deprived of the
                    services of the Bishop of Buenos Ayres, who was a suffragan of the see of Lima.
                    On that occasion the government assumed to itself the authority of the head of
                    the church, the pope having repeatedly refused to acknowledge their
                    independence, or to interfere in their church affairs; and it authorized an
                    ecclesiastical senate to exercise these functions, which it did until the 23d
                    March 1831, when, in consequence of his holiness having acknowledged the
                    independence of the republic, Dr Don Mariano Medrano was selected from a list of
                    two submitted to him for that purpose on the part of the government, and created
                    Bishop of Aulon and apostolic vicar of the diocese of Buenos Ayres; and he has
                    since been formally recognized as the head of the Catholic church of the
                    Argentine republic. The authority has been transferred to him which had been
                    previously exercised by the ecclesiastical senate under the auspices of
                    government; but this transfer was not accomplished without considerable
                    resistance on the part of that body. The long-continued suspension of all direct
                    connection between his holiness and the church of Buenos Ayres has broken
                    asunder the link which formerly bound them so closely together; and the general
                    diffusion of education and intelligence has produced important changes on the
                    public mind, which will prevent the Catholic church from ever again attaining
                    that ascendency in this country which it once possessed.</p>
                <p>During the early part of the revolution, the Catholic clergy, from their activity
                    and influence over the community, exercised a considerable, and often pernicious
                    influence in the politics of the country, being generally opposed to the
                    introduction of improvements of every kind. It became, therefore, a primary
                    object with the government, in its endeavours to remodel the political
                    institutions of the country, to liberate itself from this source of distraction.
                    Accordingly, most rigorous measures were pursued to introduce extensive reforms
                    in ecclesiastical affairs. A board was named to take possession of the rents of
                    the convents, and to examine the inmates and internal economy of these
                    establishments; all convents were abolished which contained less than sixteen or
                    more than thirty inmates; the retiring members of the suppressed convents were
                    allowed a yearly salary, and permission to proceed to whatever place they might
                    choose; and no friars were allowed to enter the province, without previously
                    obtaining special permission from the government, while every difficulty was at
                    the same time thrown in the way of further seclusion, by restricting the age of
                    profession to twenty-five, and to those obtaining a license from the government.
                    By these means many convents were suppressed, and their chapels converted into
                    parish churches; and, under the new regulations, the service of the church has
                    been performed with an efficiency and splendour previously unknown. The tithes
                    were abolished, and funds provided by the state for the expense of the churches;
                    and the salaries of the dignitaries and other ministers of the Catholic church
                    were judiciously regulated. These measures of reform were carried forward with
                    much vigour, and powerfully aided by the Centinela, a well-conducted periodical,
                    instituted for the express purpose, and which exercised much influence on public
                    opinion. These exertions proved so completely successful, that at the present
                    time not more than one or two convents are in existence at Buenos Ayres, and the
                    greater part of the friars who have not become secular clergy have left the
                    province. Two nunneries still exist in this city, but their inmates do not
                    increase in number; on the contrary, facilities have been afforded to those nuns
                    who were dissatisfied with their life of seclusion, to liberate themselves from
                    their vows, and to leave these establishments; a privilege which has already
                    been taken advantage of in some instances. .</p>
                <p>Since the commencement of the revolution a spirit of toleration has been forming
                    at Buenos Ayres, and becoming stronger in proportion as their intercourse with
                    foreigners became more extended; and it was so much strengthened by those
                    vigorous proceedings of the executive in reforming the ecclesiastical affairs of
                    the country, that at length the government were enabled to establish toleration
                    legally, which had previously existed only by sufferance. In concluding a treaty
                    with Great Britain, on the 2d o February 1825, it was provided that no British
                    subjects resident in the united provinces of the Rio de la 1 l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ata</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193741605"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-1605-0657"/>shall be disturbed, persecuted, or annoyed on
                    account of their religion, but have perfect liberty of conscience and of public
                    worship’; the government reserving the right of formally approving of the
                    formation of all places of public worship. This article of the treaty was
                    sanctioned by all the members of the congress of the United Provinces, including
                    eight of the secular clergy, with only two dissentient voices.</p>
                <p>On the 12th of October of the same year the provincial legislature of Buenos
                    Ayres enacted the following law in favour of religious toleration, which was
                    sanctioned by the government, and has ever since been in operation. “Every
                    individual in the province of Buenos Ayres shall enjoy the inviolable right of
                    worshipping Almighty God in the manner which his conscience may dictate to him;
                    and the exercise of this religious liberty shall only be subject to the
                    regulations which are prescribed by good morals, public order, and the
                    established laws of the country.” That practical toleration fully exists in
                    Buenos Ayres, is proved by the existence there of one Protestant Episcopal
                    church, two Presbyterian chapels, two Sabbath evening schools, and a Bible
                    society.</p>
                <p>Since the administration which accomplished these important changes in the
                    religious institutions of this country ceased to exercise its functions, its
                    successors have relaxed somewhat in the strictness with which the regulations
                    were enforced, and some indications have been given of a desire to restore, in
                    some respects, the exclusive system which formerly prevailed, but fortunately
                    with little prospect of success; for the measures of ecclesiastical reform
                    previously adopted were too efficient, and pursued with too much vigour and
                    success, and the inhabitants have become too intelligent ever again to submit to
                    the religious thraldom to which they were formerly subjected.</p>
                <p>The manners and customs of the inhabitants of Buenos Ayres have undergone many
                    remarkable changes since the country became independent. The general diffusion
                    of education and intelligence, the extensive intercourse maintained by its
                    inhabitants with other nations, and the influence and example of the numerous
                    foreigners who have been temporary or permanent residents among them, have all
                    powerfully contributed to improve their moral, intellectual, and social
                    condition, and to place them in a position more in accordance than formerly with
                    the present state of civilization in other parts of the world. In these respects
                    they have made greater progress than any other of the new states, and exercise
                    an extensive and beneficial influence on the moral and political opinions of
                    their contemporaries all over the South American continent. The natives of
                    Buenos Ayres are active, intelligent, and enterprising, and may be met with in
                    most parts of South America, engaged in commerce, agriculture, and other
                    branches of industry. They arc polite and affable in their manners, sober and
                    temperate in their habits, and possess considerable vivacity and good natural
                    abilities; they are, however, not remarkable for intense application or
                    perseverance, but rather fickle, and prone to novelty, owing perhaps to the
                    circumstance of their having lived in times so fraught with change and
                    innovation; and this tendency is evinced in a variety of ways. They are fond of
                    dress, and set the fashions to the other provinces, where, notwithstanding they
                    arc imitated, they are often held up to ridicule for their attention to external
                    appearances. Being now more occupied than formerly in useful and rational
                    pursuits, they are less addicted than heretofore to gambling and other
                    demoralizing amusements. The diversions of the carnival have been
                    discountenanced; the cruel practice of cock-fighting has lost much of the
                    interest and importance it once possessed; and bull fights have long since been
                    abolished, as tending to brutalize the feelings of the community, and unworthy
                    of a civilized nation.</p>
                <p>The ladies, however, are by far the most interesting part of the community in
                    this city. They possess the black eyes, delicate features, and handsome figures
                    of Spain, and know well how to set off their charms to the greatest advantage,
                    by the neatness and elegance of their attire and the gracefulness of their
                    carriage while on the promenade. They are affable and unassuming in their
                    manners, and possess great vivacity, but tempered with so much suavity of
                    demeanour as tends to diffuse a charm over their society, which is very
                    attractive, especially to foreigners, who are generally well received. Their
                    evening parties, or <hi rend="italic">ter-tulias,</hi> which are exceedingly
                    agreeable, are frequent and well attended; they are diversified by conversation
                    and a variety of amusements, and generally enlivened by music and dancing, in
                    which they excel. The Spanish costume has now nearly become obsolete, and their
                    dresses are generally modelled after the French and English fashions. The ladies
                    of Buenos Ayres have in many instances formed matrimonial alliances with the
                    foreigners settled amongst them, and have, with few exceptions, proved most
                    amiable and exemplary wives. The social and domestic habits of the strangers,
                    especially those from Great Britain, give them in many instances a decided
                    preference over their own countrymen in the estimation of the fair sex of Buenos
                    Ayres, as the latter are much more in the habit of passing their leisure and
                    evening hours in the coffee-houses, or in other society, than in the midst of
                    their own families.</p>
                <p>The peasantry or <hi rend="italic">gauchos</hi> of Buenos Ayres have many
                    remarkable peculiarities in their character, arising from their manner of living
                    and the occupations in which they are principally engaged. They pass the greater
                    part of their time in the open air, and are almost continually on horseback.
                    Their horses are saddled in the morning, and kept in readiness for use during
                    the whole day, as no one. in this country ever thinks of walking even a short
                    distance on foot. They are rather indolent in their domestic habits. They live
                    in rude habitations formed of mud and reeds, possessing very few conveniencies,
                    and only some rude articles of furniture. Their food principally consists of
                    beef, besides which they possess few luxuries; yet seem very happy and well
                    contented with their situation, having few external wants, and enjoying a
                    considerable extent of personal liberty and independence. They are kind and
                    hospitable to strangers, courteous in their manners, and often possess many
                    estimable qualities.</p>
                <p>Crimes of an atrocious nature, such as murder and robbery, rarely occur among
                    them. Such deeds have occasionally been perpetrated during the civil
                    dissensions, but have in almost every instance been committed by deserters from
                    the army, and not by the peasantry of the country. As an evidence of the
                    confidence which is with justice reposed in their honesty, may be adduced the
                    well-known fact, that, until a late period, couriers and others have been in the
                    constant practice of carrying quantities of gold and silver from Chili, Bolivia,
                    and the interior provinces, to Buenos Ayres; and although generally alone and
                    unarmed, very few instances have occurred of their having been robbed or
                    maltreated. Travellers, both natives and foreigners, are continually traversing
                    the country in all directions, and have in general enjoyed the same
                    immunity.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">gauchos</hi> are all trained from their earliest years in
                    the art of horsemanship, and acquire great dexterity in the management of their
                    steeds and in the performance of all the evolutions practised on horseback. The
                    throwing of the noose or <hi rend="italic">lasso,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >bolas,</hi> at full speed, is generally performed with so much precision and
                    certainty, that the animal they are in pursuit of seldom escapes. But to perform
                    these feats in perfection requires mucn practice <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193741618" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1618-0658"/> and early training. It is
                    customary to see little boys employing their mimic <hi rend="italic">lassos</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">bolas</hi> in catching dogs, cats, poultry, and other
                    small animals. In some parts of the country young boys first acquire the art of
                    riding by being mounted on sheep, which are equipped with miniature saddles and
                    bridles, and are rendered docile and easily managed by feeding them occasionally
                    with salt, and otherwise treating them with care and kindness. Parties of boys
                    may occasionally be seen proceeding to or from school mounted on these little
                    chargers, and vying with each other in the performance or races and other
                    equestrian exercises. A <hi rend="italic">gaucho</hi> fully accoutred and
                    mounted on horseback is one of the most independent persons imaginable, as he
                    carries along with him almost every thing requisite to supply his immediate
                    wants. The saddle is not only useful during the day-time, but at night serves
                    all the purposes of a bed, and the majority of the peasantry never use any
                    other. It consists of two portions formed of tanned leather; the largest is
                    spread out on the ground, and the other part serves as a pillow. The <hi
                    rend="italic">jergas</hi> or coarse woollen blankets which are manufactured in
                    the country, and some prepared sheep-skins, which are placed underneath and over
                    the saddle when riding, serve all the purposes of blankets during the night,
                    with the 'addition of the <hi rend="italic">poncho.</hi> When on a journey, or
                    employed at a distance from their habitations, they carry a supply of provisions
                    in a pair of <hi rend="italic">alforjas,</hi> or small woollen bags, and water
                    in a pair of <hi rend="italic">chiβes</hi> or bullock’s horns slung across the
                    saddle. While on horseback they carry the <hi rend="italic">lasso,</hi> coiled
                    up and ready for use, one extremity being attached to an iron ring on one side
                    of the saddle, and the <hi rend="italic">bolas</hi> to the other side; by these
                    means they often supply themselves with game and other articles of food when
                    necessary. The <hi rend="italic">lasso</hi> serves to secure their horses during
                    the night, or they use two small portions of hide attached to each other, which
                    are fastened to the horse’s fore legs, and arc removable at pleasure: this
                    contrivance permits them to feed, but not to stray .to a distance. The Spanish
                    bit or bridle is universally used in this country, and is considered as more
                    secure than any other, giving the rider the most complete command of his horse,
                    and enabling him to perform a variety of evolutions on horseback with great
                    dexterity and precision. Their reins are formed of plaited hide, and variously
                    ornamented; they are lengthened out so as to serve the purposes of a whip and
                    other uses to the rider. The girths of their saddles are formed principally of a
                    network of hide, into the meshes of which the rider can at pleasure entangle the
                    large blunt rowels of his spurs, when requiring to secure a firm seat on his
                    horse on making any unusual or difficult exertion.</p>
                <p>The dress of the <hi rend="italic">gaucho</hi> consists of a short jacket, with
                    breeches or drawers open at the knees. A woollen or leathern belt is worn round
                    the loins, to which they secure a large knife inclosed in a sheath, and a pouch
                    containing tobacco, and the <hi rend="italic">yesquero</hi> or tinder-box,
                    usually formed of the tail of the armadillo. Their feet and legs are protected
                    by <hi rend="italic">bolas de potro,</hi> or boots formed from the skin of the
                    hind legs of the horse or mare, to form which, the skin is cut round in the
                    middle of the thigh, and above the fetlock, and then stripped off; the hair is
                    removed by the knife, and in its moist and pliant state is drawn over the leg
                    and foot, to adapt itself in drying to the shape of the limb, the upper part
                    forming the leg of the boot, the bend at the knee being fitted to the heel, and
                    the lower part covering the foot. They generally wear a handkerchief tied round
                    the head, with the corners hanging down to keep them cool, and to avoid the
                    annoyance of mosquitos in warm weather; over it is worn a small straw hat. The
                    <hi rend="italic">poncho,</hi> which is universally worn as an outer garment, is
                    a most useful and convenient article of dress, especially on horseback, as it
                    covers the whole of the trunk of the body, leaves the arms free, and, when of
                    good quality, throws off the rain. It is composed of a cotton or woollen cloth,
                    woven by the Indians, and is sometimes very handsome, from the tasteful display
                    of the rich colours employed in its formation. Ponchos are from six to eight
                    feet in length, and four or five in breadth, having in the centre a slit
                    sufficient to allow the head to pass through; and they fall down in graceful
                    folds before and behind, being variously ornamented along the edges. The value
                    and richness of the clothing and horse accoutrements of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gauehos</hi> vary considerably, according to the wealth and taste of the
                    individual, some indulging in silver spurs, and various ornaments for their
                    horses of the same metal, but all of them partaking more or less of the same
                    general character.</p>
                <p>It is not intended on this occasion to give an account of the political history
                    of Buenos Ayres, which with more ∣ propriety will merit consideration in the
                    article La Plata; a few observations, however, on this subject are requisite to
                    illustrate the present state of the country.</p>
                <p>During the first years of independence, little progress was made in organizing
                    the government, or in establishing the political institutions of the country on
                    an efficient basis. The measures had recourse to from time to time were more
                    calculated to serve temporary purposes than to produce permanent results. A
                    variety of circumstances conspired to produce disunion and discord among the
                    provinces, the greater part of which were in a state of complete isolation, with
                    separate and independent governments, and by their provincial legislatures
                    enacting laws much more calculated to promote individual and local interests
                    than to favour the general industry and prosperity of the country. From these
                    and other causes they were frequently at variance with each other, and all were
                    more or less inimical to Buenos Ayres, which they viewed with a jealous and
                    invidious eye, on account of its superior wealth, and the greater influence
                    which it exercised in all public affairs. The authorities of Buenos Ayres were
                    implicated in a plan to give a new form to the government, by the introduction
                    of a foreign prince from Europe; but they completely failed in the attempt, not,
                    however, without causing great excitement among the inhabitants, which
                    terminated in civil war at Buenos Ayres and the adjoining provinces. These
                    occurrences, however, interrupted the commerce with the interior, and occasioned
                    great loss of life and property. During the year 1820, when these transactions
                    took place, the changes in the government of Buenos Ayres were frequent, and the
                    authority assumed was in some instances of very ephemeral existence; but this
                    state of affairs was brought to a termination in October of the same year, by
                    the forcible entrance into the city of the party under the direction of Don
                    Martin Rodríguez, who was soon afterwards elected governor of the province of
                    Buenos Ayres.</p>
                <p>Under his auspices was formed an efficient and enlightened administration,
                    composed of individuals well qualified to discharge the important duties
                    intrusted to them, and unobjectionable to all parties, as they had been some
                    time absent in the service of their country, and had taken no part in the
                    political disputes which had previously divided the inhabitants. Don Bernardino
                    Rivadavia, who had been in Europe on a diplomatic mission, and had become
                    conversant with the institutions of those nations farthest advanced in
                    civilization, became the leader of the new executive, and by the activity and
                    energy of his character infused a degree of vigour into all their proceedings,
                    which inspired general confidence, insured the ultimate success which so
                    eminently attended their labours, and conferred important and lasting benefits
                    on their country.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741631" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1631-0659"/>
                <p>The aspect presented by the various provinces at this period offered little
                    prospect of success in any attempt to form an efficient general government by
                    the union of such discordant materials. It was therefore deemed expedient, in
                    the first place, to use every exertion to introduce an improved internal
                    organization into all the provinces, although still in a state of separation,
                    and more especially into the city and province of Buenos Ayres, by far the most
                    important and influential in every point of view, and the best calculated by its
                    example to produce beneficial consequences in all the interior provinces.</p>
                <p>The attention and active energies of the new government of Buenos Ayres were
                    therefore principally directed to remodel and improve the various moral and
                    political institutions of the city and province, and the changes introduced were
                    principally the following :—The provincial legislature was formed of
                    representatives elected by the direct suffrages of the citizens; the persons and
                    property of every one, foreigner as well as native, were rendered inviolable;
                    and no imposts or contributions of any kind were allowed to be imposed, or any
                    of the public funds to be expended, except by authority of the legislature.
                    Publicity was given to all the proceedings of the legislature and of the
                    government; and the public accounts of all the departments were published at
                    stated periods. The imposition and collection of the public revenue were
                    regulated on judicious principles, so as not only to augment the amount of the
                    revenue, but effectually to put an end to the extensive contraband which had
                    previously prevailed. The public expenditure was regulated on the most
                    economical principles. The military officers, and others who had devoted
                    themselves to the service of their country, were rewarded according to their
                    respective merits and services. The debts due by the state were consolidated,
                    and means provided for their gradual extinction. Afterwards, when circumstances
                    had led to the accumulation of new debts, the sale of all public lands was
                    prohibited, and they were preserved as a guarantee for the ultimate payment of
                    the public debts. These lands, however, were not kept in an unproductive state,
                    but rendered available for agricultural purposes by a judicious system of
                    leasing. The administration of justice was also greatly improved, and rendered
                    more efficient. The police and other municipal establishments were remodelled or
                    improved, and rendered much more efficient than previously. Education in all its
                    branches was encouraged and promoted, every facility being afforded to the
                    general diffusion of knowledge. The liberty of the press was established and
                    guaranteed to the community. Various important reforms in the church
                    establishment were satisfactorily accomplished, and the enjoyment of complete
                    religious liberty was established by law. Industry and enterprise were promoted,
                    and every encouragement was given to the ingress of industrious persons from
                    other countries. Savings banks were instituted to assist the industrious in the
                    accumulation of their savings. The formation of roads, bridges, canals, and
                    various other public undertakings of acknowledged utility and importance, was
                    commenced and prosecuted.</p>
                <p>Mueh energy, zeal, and perseverance, were exemplified by the government and their
                    supporters in the prosecution of these beneficent plans for ameliorating the
                    institutions of this country, and in their progress they were powerfully aided
                    by the publicity given to all their transactions, which diffused general
                    confidence; and by the judicious use of the periodical press, public opinion was
                    prepared for the reception of these innovations. Tranquillity prevailed at this
                    period over all the provinces, and a marked improvement took place in the
                    general prosperity or the country, not only in the city where it commenced, but
                    throughout the other provinces, where the example of Buenos Ayres exercised a
                    great and beneficial influence. In these the progress of Buenos Ayres towards
                    improvement was watched with much interest and attention, and the valuable
                    productions of its press were received with the utmost avidity. The patriotic
                    feelings of the inhabitants of the provinces were much excited by these
                    occurrences, and the more intelligent among them directed their attention to the
                    most effectual means of profiting by the example given them by their neighbours;
                    accordingly, in some of the provinces, considerable progress was made in the
                    improvement of their local institutions and government.</p>
                <p>On 1st April 1824 some changes took place in the government. Rodríguez, having
                    completed the legal period of his service as governor, was replaced in that
                    office by General Las Heras. On that occasion Rivadavia, although repeatedly
                    urged to continue his services, retired from office and went to Europe, leaving
                    in the entire charge of the executive government his colleagues Don Manuel Jose
                    Garcia and General Cruz, who, equally zealous and interested in the success of
                    the measures which had been adopted, did not relax in their exertions to give
                    them permanency. The improved state of the provinces, and the desire evinced by
                    them for a general union, indicated the time as propitious to the formation of a
                    general government. The authorities of Buenos Ayres therefore sent commissioners
                    to the various provinces to make the preliminary arrangements; deputies were
                    assembled from all the provinces; and the national constituent congress was
                    formally installed at Buenos Ayres on the 16th December 1824.</p>
                <p>The independence of these provinces had been already acknowledged by the United
                    States of North America and Brazil; but on the 2d February 1825 Great Britain
                    also conferred on them this important act of justice, by concluding with the
                    government of Buenos Ayres a treaty of amity,’ commerce, and navigation, which
                    was approved of and sanctioned by the general constituent congress, and was
                    hailed with general satisfaction, from its connecting them so closely with one
                    of the most powerful European states, and giving the new republic a respectable
                    status among civilized nations. In the arrangement of this treaty much advantage
                    was derived from the liberality and judicious policy pursued by Garcia, then
                    minister for foreign affairs. Their independence was acknowledged by France in
                    1830, and by the Pope in the following year.</p>
                <p>So many innovations in the institutions of Buenos Ayres as those which have been
                    enumerated could scarcely fail to produce opposition on the part of those
                    persons whose interests or prejudices were affected. The clergy in particular,
                    in many instances, made use of the influence they possessed over the prejudices
                    of the people to accomplish this object, and considerably augmented the number
                    in opposition. An attempt was on one occasion made to overturn the
                    administration by violence, and to awaken the religious prejudices of the
                    community by raising the cry that their religion was in danger; but the attempt
                    completely failed. This party did not renew these violent attempts, but still
                    continued their opposition, becoming from various circumstances more numerous
                    and united in their views. During the debates which took place in the national
                    congress, they used their influence to thwart the policy recommended by the
                    government party; and their number being augmented by the accession of many of
                    the provincial deputies, an origin was thus given to the political party which
                    subsequently assumed the name of federal <hi rend="italic">(fédérales).</hi></p>
                <p>A dispute had subsisted during some years between the government of Buenos Ayres
                    and the court of Brazil, in consequence of the occupation of the province of the
                    Banda Oriental by the troops of the latter power; and all <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193741644" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1644-0660"/>the efforts of Buenos Ayres
                    to induce them to retire proved ineffectual. During 1825 General Lavalleja
                    landed with thirty-two resolute followers in the Banda Oriental; and having
                    raised the standard against the Brazilians, he was speedily joined by numbers of
                    his countrymen, and defeated his opponents in various engagements. 1he
                    provincial legislature assembled, and requested that their province might be
                    admitted into the Argentine confederation, which was agreed to by the
                    constituent congress on the 25th October 1825. Upon this ground the emperor of
                    Brazil declared war against Buenos Ayres on the 10th December; an example which
                    was followed, on 3d January ensuing, by the government of Buenos Ayres, with the
                    full concurrence of the congress. About this time Rivadavia returned from
                    Europe, bringing with him from London the ratified British treaty, and was
                    elected president of the Argentine republic on the 7th February 1826 by the
                    constituent congress. The provincial government and legislature were then
                    dissolved, and the duties of the former devolved on the president of the
                    republic.</p>
                <p>After prolonged discussion, the new constitution of the Argentine republic was
                    completed, and subscribed on the 24th of December 1826 by all the members of
                    congress. The form of government agreed upon was the representative republican,
                    with unity of regimen; the representatives being to be chosen by direct
                    suffrages of the citizens, the senators and president by electors chosen by the
                    citizens. Each province was to be under a governor chosen by the president of
                    the republic from three persons elected by the inhabitants, and assisted by a
                    council of administration elected by the citizens. To become legal, the
                    constitution required to be approved of by two thirds of the provinces. The
                    final adoption of this constitution, which was considered by competent judges as
                    well suited to the existing state of the country, was at first postponed, and
                    finally prevented, by the active exertions of the federal party in the
                    provinces, and the increasing difficulties and embarrassments of the general
                    government, occasioned by the continuance of the war with Brazil. But this war
                    had been carried on with a degree of success which rendered it very popular with
                    the people. The contest was principally supported from the resources of Buenos
                    Ayres and the Banda Oriental, as they received little assistance, even in men,
                    from the other provinces; those sent from Mendoza and other places having been
                    either intercepted, or so diminished by desertion, encouraged by the fedcrals,
                    that few ever reached their final destination. The scarcity of funds at the
                    disposal of the executive to carry on the wailed to the conversion of the
                    private bank of discounts, which had previously prospered, into a national bank;
                    an expedient which soon afterwards produced the most fatal consequences to the
                    credit and prosperity of the country, and produced the great depreciation of the
                    currency formerly noticed.</p>
                <p>In April 1827 the government made an effort to terminate the war, by sending
                    Garcia to the court of Brazil to negotiate a treaty of peace under the mediation
                    of the British authorities; but the hopes of the government and of the people
                    were frustrated by Garcia’s deviating so far from his instructions as to agree
                    to cede the Banda Oriental to the emperor. This preliminary convention was
                    disapproved of by the president of the republic and the constituent congress,
                    and consequently was never ratified. Although no blame could with justice be
                    attributed to the executive on this occasion, this transaction led to the
                    cessation of that administration which had been paramount in Buenos Ayres for
                    upwards of six years, and had produced such lasting and beneficial consequences
                    to the country. Rivadavia perceiving that, by continuing in office, he could no
                    longer preserve the honour or consult the permanent interests of his country,
                    voluntarily resigned the presidency on the 27th of June 1827, and his example
                    was followed by all his ministers. All prospect of forming a permanent union of
                    the provinces having now vanished, the congress dissolved itself, and each of
                    the provinces returned to its former state of isolation and self-government.</p>
                <p>On renouncing the presidency, Rivadavia retired into private life, and having
                    since principally resided in Europe, he has on no occasion taken part, either
                    directly or indirectly, in the political transactions of his country. His merits
                    as a practical politician, which are of the highest order, will be long held in
                    grateful remembrance by the more thinking part of his countrymen, and will
                    receive due homage from posterity; and the numerous and important institutions
                    which he established and brought to maturity will serve as lasting monuments of
                    his sound judgment and eminent talents. Had the same influence which proved so
                    beneficial in the only province where his authority was ever fully established,
                    been equally extended to the other provinces, they would by this time have
                    undoubtedly presented an aspect of prosperity and contentment which would have
                    formed a striking contrast to their present desolate condition.</p>
                <p>Those persons who favoured the policy of Rivadavia, and advocated the adoption of
                    the constitution sanctioned by the congress, were called unitarians <hi
                    rend="italic">(unitarios),</hi> and at first comprised a large proportion of the
                    wealth and talents of the country; but subsequently they were joined by many
                    others actuated by less pure and patriotic motives, who, in assuming the name,
                    forgot the principles which originally gave rise to the distinction. The spirit
                    of faction and of individual aggrandisement seems principally to have influenced
                    the subsequent proceedings of both parties, and to have given origin to the
                    numerous evils which have befallen their country.</p>
                <p>On the resignation of Rivadavia, the management of public affairs was intrusted
                    to Dr Don Vicente Lopez; and the provincial legislature having been assembled,
                    Don Manuel Dorrego was afterwards elected governor of the province, and obtained
                    from the other provinces full powers to manage all their foreign relations.
                    Accordingly, under his government the war with Brazil was brought to a
                    satisfactory termination in the latter part of 1828. On the army being withdrawn
                    from the seat of war, many of the principal officers concerted measures to
                    overturn the influence of the federal party in Buenos Ayres and the other
                    provinces. On the 1st of December 1828, a movement was successfully made by
                    General Lavalle in Buenos Ayres, and hostilities commenced with the ex-governor
                    Dorrego. He was defeated and taken prisoner at Navarro on the 9th, and was shot
                    without trial on the 13th by order of Lavalle. This arbitrary act, which cannot
                    be justified on any principle, was productive of the most fatal consequences, by
                    giving to the civil war that sanguinary and vindictive character which it has
                    since maintained. Lavalle became governor of Buenos Ayres, but had to sustain a
                    contest with the federal party under Don Juan Μ. de Rosas, who, possessing great
                    influence with the inhabitants of the country, cut off his supplies, besieged
                    him in the city, and at length obliged him to form a convention on the 24th of
                    August 1829, by which Lavalle consented to relinquish the government of Buenos
                    Ayres, and soon afterwards retired to the Banda Oriental. Gθ∙ neral Paz, an
                    officer distinguished for his public and private virtues, as well as bravery,
                    obtained the entire ascendency in the central province of Cordova, and· was
                    successful in surprising and totally defeating the federal forces opposed to
                    him, on the 25th of February 1830; but he did not, on this occasion, retaliate
                    on his opponents for the great excesses and cruel assassinations they had

                    the adherents of the unitarian party, more especially at La Rioja and
                    Mendoza.</p>
                <p>A period of tranquillity followed the victory of Paz, who thereby obtained for
                    the unitarians the entire ascendency in all the interior provinces; various
                    attempts were made at conciliation, but without success; and at length both
                    parties commenced preparations for the approaching contest. The civil war again
                    commenced in the early part of 1831, with evident advantage to the federal
                    party, who had at their command all the resources of Buenos Ayres, and numerous
                    adherents among the peasantry. An accidental occurrence greatly contributed to
                    increase the influence and power of the federals, and to dispirit their
                    opponents; for on the 10th of May General Paz, while engaged in reconnoitring
                    the positions of his adversaries, was taken prisoner by a small party placed in
                    ambuscade. Soon afterwards General Quiroga carried the war into the provinces of
                    Cuyo and La Rioja, and was successful in all his rencontres with the unitarians.
                    He followed up his advantages, the unitarians retiring from Cordova to the
                    province of Tucuman; and having met each other at Ciudadela, in that province,
                    on the 4th of November, an obstinate and sanguinary battle ensued, in which the
                    unitarians were totally defeated and dispersed. Thirty-nine of the principal
                    officers, who were afterwards taken prisoners, were shot by order of Quiroga,
                    and the remainder escaped into the province of Salta. The war was at length
                    brought to a conclusion on the 4th of December 1831, by means of a convention
                    formed between Quiroga and the authorities of Salta, in which it was expressly
                    provided that all the unitarian officers should be obliged to leave the
                    Argentine Provinces. ‘ Thus has terminated the civil war which prevailed with
                    more or less violence during the last three years; covered these fine provinces
                    with desolation and bloodshed; interrupted the progress of industry in all its
                    branches; paralyzed the commerce with the interior; and greatly diminished the
                    commercial intercourse of Buenos Ayres with other countries. The civil war has
                    not, however, been the only cause of the depressed state of agriculture and
                    commercial industry at Buenos Ayres; the long-continued drought which has
                    prevailed throughout the province during nearly the whole of the last three
                    seasons has been much more fatal in its consequences, as it has occasioned the
                    total failure of the crops, and the destruction of multitudes of cattle, horses,
                    and other stock. The latest intelligence from Buenos Ayres, dated 4th April
                    1832, intimates that this disastrous period had at length happily terminated by
                    copious rains; that tranquillity prevailed in all the provinces; and that, as
                    considerable quantities of produce were coming from the interior, commerce was
                    expected to improve.</p>
                <p>It will require some years of tranquillity and good government to restore Buenos
                    Ayres and the other provinces to their former prosperity; but with a country
                    possessed of so many natural advantages, and a population so elastic and
                    enterprising in their character, that period under ordinary circumstances cannot
                    be far distant. The federal party, who now possess the entire control over all
                    these provinces, will have ample opportunities of proving how far the system of
                    government which they have hitherto advocated is calculated to promote the
                    happiness and prosperity of their country. A treaty of alliance, offensive and
                    defensive, was formed in 1822, between the littoral provinces of Santa Fè,
                    Corrientes, Entre Rios, and Buenos Ayres, the provisions of which, with little
                    interruption, have ever since been maintained. In 1830 this alliance was
                    renewed, each province binding itself to the adoption of the federal system of
                    government. Since the termination of the civil war several of the interior
                    provinces have indicated their desire to unite with these provinces; an example
                    which will probably be soon followed by the remainder. But there are
                    well-founded apprehensions that they will fail in their attempts to establish a
                    federal republic at all similar to that of the United States of North America,
                    which they profess to imitate; all the provinces excepting Buenos Ayres being
                    deficient in population, wealth, intelligence, and the other requisites
                    essential to the establishment of efficient local governments. As an evidence
                    how imperfectly they know their true position and interests, it is sufficient to
                    state that each of the provinces has its own custom-house laws, import and
                    transit duties being imposed on all commodities coming from any of the other
                    provinces. The only prospect of success amidst so many difficulties will be the
                    formation of a greatly modified federation, in which, however unwilling the
                    provinces may be to acknowledge it, the province of Buenos Ayres, from its
                    advantageous position, and its greater wealth and intelligence, must necessarily
                    maintain a decided ascendency over them; and if tranquillity can be preserved,
                    time and experience will eventually convince them of their true interests, and
                    remove the impediments which have hitherto prevented their union. The present
                    institutions of Buenos Ayres have now existed in full operation during a
                    sufficient time to establish themselves in the good opinion and affections of
                    the community; and no apprehension need be entertained of their permanency,
                    especially during the administration of the present governor Rosas, who has much
                    influence in the province; while by his active endeavours to promote education,
                    to encourage industry, and to civilize the Indians, he has merited the
                    confidence and good will of his countrymen.</p>
