                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable

                <p><label type="entry">BUDGELL, <hi rend="smallcaps">Eustace</hi></label>, an
                    ingenious writer, was the son of Gilbert Budgell, doctor of divinity, and was
                    born at St Thomas, near Exeter, about the year 1685. He was educated at Christ
                    Church College, Oxford, from which he removed to the Inner Temple, London; but
                    instead of studying the law, for which his father intended him, he applied to
                    polite literature, kept company with the genteelest persons in town, and in
                    particular contracted a strict intimacy with Mr Addison, who was first cousin to
                    his mother, and who, on his being appointed secretary to Lord Wharton,
                    lord-lieutenant of Ireland, took Budgell with him as one of the clerks of his
                    office. Mr Budgell, who was then about twenty years of age, and had read the
                    classics and the works of the best English, French, and Italian authors, now
                    became concerned with Sir Richard Steele and Mr Addison in writing the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tatler,</hi> as he had soon afterwards a share in writing the <hi
                    rend="italic">Spectator,</hi> where all the papers furnished by him are marked
                    with an X; and when that work was completed, he had likewise a hand in the
                    Guardian, where his performances are marked with an asterisk. He was
                    subsequently made under secretary to Mr Addison, chief secretary to the lords
                    justices of Ireland, and deputy clerk of the council. Soon afterwards he was
                    chosen a member of the Irish parliament; and in 1717, Mr Addison, having become
                    principal secretary of state in England, procured him the place of accountant
                    and comptrollergeneral of the revenue in Ireland. But the next year, the ÌDuke
                    of Bolton being appointed lord-lieutenant, Mr Budgell wrote a lampoon against Mr
                    Webster, his secretary, in which his Grace himself was not spared; and upon all
                    occasions he treated that gentleman with the utmost contempt. This imprudent
                    step became the primary cause of his ruin; for the Duke of Bolton, in support of
                    his secretary, got him removed from the post of accountant-general; upon which,
                    returning to England, he, contrary to the advice of Mr Addison, published his
                    case in a pamphlet. Mr Addison had now resigned the seals, and retired into the
                    country for the sake of his health; Mr Budgell had also lost several other
                    powerful friends, who had been removed by death, particularly the Earl of
                    Sunderland and Lord Halifax. He, however, made several attempts to succeed at
                    court, but was constantly kept back by the Duke of Bolton. In the year 1720 he
                    lost L.20,000 by the South Sea scheme, and afterwards spent L.5000 more in
                    unsuccessful attempts to get into parliament. This completed his ruin. He at
                    length employed himself in writing pamphlets against the ministry, and published
                    many papers in the <hi rend="italic">Craftsman.</hi> In 1733 he began a weekly
                    pamphlet called the <hi rend="italic">Bee,</hi> which he continued for above a
                    hundred numbers, and which is printed in eight volumes 8vo. During the progress
                    of this work occurred the death of Dr Tindal, by whose will Mr Budgell had
                    L.2000 left him; and the world being surprised at such a gift from a man
                    entirely unrelated to him, to the exclusion of the next heir, a nephew, and the
                    continuator of Rapin’s history of England, immediately imputed it to his having
                    made the will himself. Lience the satirist:</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> Let Budgell charge low Grub-street on my quill, </l>
                    <l part="N"> And write whate’ei he please except my will. </l>
                </lg>
                <p>It was thought that he had soine hand in publishing Dr Tindal’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Christianity as old as the Creation</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for he often
                    talked of an additional volume on the subject, but never published it. After the
                    cessation of the <hi rend="italic">Bee,</hi> Mr Budgell became so involved in
                    law-suits, that he was reduced to a very unhappy situation. He was indeed called
                    to the bar, and attended for some time in the courts of law; but finding himself
                    unable to make any progress, and being distressed to the utmost, he determined
                    at length to put an end to his life. Accordingly, in the year 1736, he took a
                    boat at Somerset-stairs, after filling his pockets with stones; ordered the
                    waterman to shoot the bridge; and, whilst the boat was passing under, threw
                    himself into the river. He had several days before been visibly distracted in
                    his mind. Upon his bureau was found a slip of paper, on which were these
                    words:</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> What Cato did, and Addison approv’d, </l>
                    <l part="N"> Cannot be wrong. </l>
                </lg>
                <p>Besides the above works, he wrote a Translation of the Characters of
                    Theophrastus. He was never married, but .left one natural daughter, who
                    afterwards assumed his name, and became an actress in Drury-lane.</p>
