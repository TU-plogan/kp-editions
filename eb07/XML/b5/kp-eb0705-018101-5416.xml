                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BRAHOOICK <hi rend="smallcaps">Mountains</hi></label>, a
                    chain of mountains so called by Colonel Pöttinger, from the Brahooes, who
                    inhabit them. They run along the eastern frontier of Persia, and extend 280
                    miles in length from south-east to north-east, and about 200 miles in their
                    utmost breadth, under latitude 28. N. This range of mountains springs abruptly
                    to a conspicuous height and grandeur, out of the sea at Cape Mowaree, in
                    longitude 66° 58' E. latitude 25° N., whence it assumes a north-easterly
                    direction for ninety miles. It there projects a ridge east by north, the base of
                    which is washed by the river Indus, at the foot of Seh wan. From the separation
                    of this chain, in latitude 25° 45', to that of30°, the primitive body runs due
                    north, now marking the western limits of Sinde, Kutch Gundava, and a part of
                    Sewestan, as it formerly did that of Hindustan. It thence once more regains its
                    original inclination to the north-east, and decreases in elevation so rapidly,
                    that in the course of forty miles it sinks down to a level, and becomes
                    incorporated with the hills inhabited by the Kaufers and by other Afghan tribes.
                    To the westward the Brahooick Mountains are far more complicated. At their
                    emergence from the ocean their breadth does not exceed thirty miles from the one
                    base to the other; but from the latitude of twenty-five and a half degrees, they
                    progressively sweep round to north, north-north-west, north-west, and
                    west-north-west, expanding over several degrees of longitude, and sending forth
                    many collateral chains. The main range stretches away towards the north, to the
                    twenty-eighth degree of north latitude, where it meets the sandy desert about
                    the sixty-fourth degree of east longitude; it afterwards sinks, like the eastern
                    front, to-an equality with the Afghan hills, among which it is lost. This chain
                    of mountains reaches in some parts to a great altitude, and has many peaks
                    covered with snow. (Pottinger’s <hi rend="italic">Travels in Beloochistan and
