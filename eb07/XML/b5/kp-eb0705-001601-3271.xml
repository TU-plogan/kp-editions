                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BORROMEAN <hi rend="smallcaps">Islands</hi></label>. Not far
                    from the south-eastern termination of the Alps there is a lake called Lago di
                    Locarno, or Lago Maggiore, extending above fifty miles in length by five or six
                    in breadth. It contains several islands, amongst which are the Isola Bella and
                    Isola Madre, situated in a large bay towards the west, and designed the
                    Borromean Islands. Towards Switzerland the lake terminates in a canal, which is
                    of much utility for commercial purposes; and near Cesti, which is ten leagues
                    from the city of Milan, it discharges itself into the river Ticino, with a
                    current rapid and dangerous to the navigation of small vessels. The Borromean
                    Islands lie about fifteen miles distant by water from Cesti, and the passage to
                    them displays a succession of curious and interesting objects, some of which are
                    connected with their own history. Amongst these may be mentioned a colossal
                    bronze statue of San Carlo Borromeo, above the small town and port of Arona,
                    which is sixty feet in height, and stands on a pedestal of proportional
                    dimensions. This gigantic image was cast at Milan, and brought hither in pieces.
                    The Borromean Islands are of inconsiderable size, but the artificial decoration
                    they have received has been the admiration of spectators since the middle of the
                    seventeenth century, when both were barren and unprofitable rocks. About this
                    time Vitaliano, Count Borromeo, a nobleman of illustrious descent, and
                    master-general of the ordnance to the king of Spain, resolving on their
                    embellishment, directed that they should be covered with earth from the
                    neighbouring banks of the lake. His injunctions were fulfilled, and, at an
                    immense expense, the islands were converted into two gardens. Isola Madre
                    appears in ten successive terraces, rising one hundred and thirty feet above the
                    level of the water, each regularly decreasing in size from the base to the
                    summit, which is an oblong surface, seventy feet by forty in extent, paved and
                    surrounded by a balustrade. The whole are environed by gigantic marble statues
                    of gods, goddesses, and horses, or other figures: and the walls are clothed with
                    the finest fruit trees and evergreens, many of which belong to the southern
                    climates. There is, besides, a magnificent palace towards the western end of the
                    island, close to the lake, which almost washes its walls. It is built on arches,
                    which are formed into grottoes, with a floor of Mosaic, representing various
                    objects, and decorated also with shell-work and marble. The palace itself
                    contains a profusion of marbles and paintings; and some flower-pieces, executed
                    on marble, have been particularly admired, as also busts and statues. At the
                    angles of the garden, which has a southern exposure, there are two round towers
                    with lofty chambers adorned with red and white marble; and in the vicinity are
                    groves of laurels, orange-trees, lofty cypresses, and other odoriferous plants,
                    rendering it a delightful retreat. But much of the embellishment is lost by the
                    immediate neighbourhood of a miserable hamlet. <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi></p>
                <p>Isola Madre, which is the larger of the islands, is between one and two miles
                    from Isola Bella; it consists of a superstructure of seven terraces, apparently
                    lower, but not less beautiful, than the other. However, it is of equal height in
                    reality, the base being a perpendicular rock, rising considerably out of the
                    water, and on that account not requiring so much covering. Here also there is a
                    palace embellished with paintings and different ornaments; and in the gardens
                    arc groves of citrons, cedar, and orange-trees, besides a summer-house close to
                    the lake. But all the decorations, as before, are necessarily on a limited
                    scale, from the size of the island; and it excites the wonder of the spectator,
                    that in a space thus restricted so much has been done. Pheasants were formerly
                    bred in this island, as they were deterred by the vicinity of the water on all
                    hands from attempting to escape. There were some hydraulic exhibitions in Isola
                    Bella, and large cisterns or reservoirs to preserve them in action. When any
                    foreign prince visited these islands in the night, or resided upon them, they
                    were illuminated with various coloured lights. Their decorations were not only
                    completed at an enormous expense, but to keep them in the same state since 1671,
                    about which time they seem to have been finished, the charge has proved equally
                    great. They are frequently called the “Enchanted Islands.” Keysler, a learned
                    traveller, says, “these two islands can be compared to nothing more properly
                    than two pyramids of sweetmeats, ornamented with green festoons and flowers.”
                    And a later tourist, Coxe, who borrows largely from him, in speaking of the
                    Isola Bella, observes, “if any thing justly gives this island the appellation of
                    enchanted, it is the prospect from the terrace. The gradual diminution of the
                    mountains, from the regions of eternal, snow to the rich plain; the sinuosity of
                    the lake; its varied banks; the bay of Marzozzo, bounded by vast hills; the
                    neighbouring borough of Palanza, and more distant view of Laveno, the numerous
                    villages, the Isola Madre, and another island sprinkled with fishermen’s huts,
                    form a delightful assemblage.”</p>
                <p>These islands, after passing from the family of Borro-mco, appear to have come
                    into possession of the emperor of Germany. More recently, both of them, together
                    with the western coast of the bailliage of Locarno, are said to have been ceded
                    by the empress Maria Theresa to the king of Sardinia, in consideration of the
                    assistance she had derived from him. The whole lake is environed by hills,
                    covered with vineyards, and interspersed with summerhouses; beautiful rows of
                    trees traverse its banks, and the scene is still further embellished by cascades
                    falling from the mountains.</p>
