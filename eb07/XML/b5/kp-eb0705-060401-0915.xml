                <p><label type="entry">BROWNISTS</label>, a religious sect, which sprung out of that
                    of the Puritans towards the close of the sixteenth century. Their leader, Robert
                    Brown, who wrote divers books in their behalf, was a man of good parts and some
                    learning. He was born of a good family in Rutlandshire, and related to the
                    lord-treasurer Burghley. He had been educated at Cambridge, but first published
                    his notions, and began to inveigh openly against the discipline and ceremonies
                    of the church, at Norwich in the year 1580; from which time he underwent divers
                    prosecutions from the bishops, insomuch that he boasted he had been committed to
                    no less than thirty-two prisons, in some of which he could not see his hand at
                    noon-day. At length, with his congregation, he left the kingdom, and settled at
                    Middleburg in Zealand, where they obtained leave of the states to worship God in
                    their own way, and form a church according to their own model; which they had
                    not long done before this handful of men, just delivered from the severities of
                    the bishops, began to differ among themselves, and crumble into so many parties,
                    that Brown their pastor grew weary of his office; and, returning to England in
                    1589, he renounced his principles of separation, was preferred to the rectory of
                    a church in Northamptonshire, and died, after leading a very idle and dissolute
                    life, in 1630.</p>
                <p>The revolt of Brown was attended with the dissolution of the church at
                    Middleburg; but the seeds of Brown-ism which he had sown in England were so far
                    from being destroyed, that Sir Walter Raleigh, in a speech in 1592, computes
                    that no less than twenty thousand persons followed it. The occasion of their
                    separation was not any fault they found with the faith, but only with the
                    discipline and form of government of the other churches in England. They charged
                    corruption equally on the Episcopal form and on that of the Presbyterians, by
                    consistories, classes, and synods; nor would they join with any other reformed
                    church, because they were not assured of the sanctity and regeneration of the
                    members who composed it, on account of the toleration of sinners, with whom they
                    maintained it an impiety to communicate. They condemned the solemn celebration
                    of marriages in the church; maintaining that matrimony being a political
                    contract, the confirmation of it ought to come from the civil magistrate. They
                    would not allow to be baptized any children of such as were not members of the
                    church, or of such as did not take sufficient care of those baptized before.
                    They rejected all forms of prayer, and held that the Lord’s prayer was not to be
                    recited as a prayer, being only given for a rule or model whereon all our
                    prayers are to be formed. The form of church government which they established
                    was democratical. When a church was to be gathered, such as desired to be
                    members of it made a confession and signed a covenant, by which they obliged
                    themselves to walk together in the order of the gospel. The whole power of
                    admitting and excluding members, with the decision of all controversies, was
                    lodged in the brotherhood. The church officers were chosen from among
                    themselves, for preaching the word and taking care of the poor, and separated to
                    their several offices by fasting, prayer, and imposition of hands of some of the
                    brethren. But they did not allow the priesthood to be any distinct order, or to
                    give any indelible character. As the vote of the brotherhood made a man a
                    minister, and gave him authority to preach the word and administer the
                    sacraments among them, so the same power could discharge him from his office,
                    and reduce him to the condition of a mere layman again. And as they maintained
                    that the bounds of a church were defined by the number of those who could meet
                    together in one place, and join in one communion, so the power of these officers
                    was confined within the same limits. The minister or pastor of one church could
                    not administer the Lord’s supper to another, nor baptize the children of any but
                    those of his own society. Any lay brother was allowed the liberty of
                    prophesying, or of giving a word of exhortation to the people; and it was usual
                    for some of them, after sermon, to ask questions, and reason upon the doctrines
                    which had been preached. In a word, every church on the Brownists model is a
                    body corporate, having full power to do every thing which the good of the
                    society requires, without being accountable to any presbytery, synod, assembly,
                    convocation, or other jurisdiction whatever. Most of their discipline has been
                    adopted by the Independents, a party which afterwards arose from among the
                    Brownists. The Jaws were executed with great severity against the Brownists;
                    their books were prohibited by Queen Elizabeth, their P <hi rend="superscript">
                    er</hi> ^ <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> were imprisoned, and many of them were

                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193740928" xml:id="kp-eb0705-0928-0605"/> and settled
                    at Amsterdam, where they formed a church, and chose Mr Johnson for their pastor,
                    and after him Mr Ainsworth, author of the learned commentary on the Pentateuch.
                    Their church flourished near a hundred years.</p>
