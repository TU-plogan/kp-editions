                <p><label type="entry">BORNOU</label>, an extensive kingdom, situatedin the eastern
                    part of interior Africa. With the exception of Houssa, now subject to the sultan
                    of the Fellatahs, it is superior in power and influence to any other state in
                    that quarter of the continent. Major Denham, to whom we are indebted for the
                    only full and authentic description of this country, places it between the 12th
                    and 18th degrees of east longitude, and the 10th and 15th of north latitude,
                    which would form an extent of nearly 400 miles in every direction. His own map
                    and description, however, obliges us to restrict these dimensions to little more
                    than one half. Bornou is bounded on the west by Soudan or Houssa, on the east by
                    the lake Tchad, on the north by the Great Desert, on the south by the kingdoms
                    of Begherme, Loggun, and Mandara.</p>
                <p>The grandest natural feature of this country consists in the lake called the
                    Tchad, one of the largest expanses of fresh water in the world, and well
                    entitled to the appellation of an inland sea. Its limits have not been very
                    precisely ascertained, but cannot fall much short of 200 miles in length and 150
                    in breadth. A remarkable variation, however, takes place, according as the
                    rivers by which it is fed are swelled by the tropical rains, or their channels
                    reduced by the continuance of the dry season. At this period the waters on every
                    side recede, and leave uncovered a tract of many miles in extent, to be again
                    overflowed when the rains have swelled the lake. The inhabitants, however,
                    derive little advantage from the short and preearious interval during which they
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733219" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3219-0012"/> have access
                    to this portion of their territory. There is neither leisure nor opportunity to
                    bring it under regular culture; and the luxuriant fertility derived from the
                    inundation is wasted in producing a rank vegetable growth of grass from ten to
                    twelve feet in height, with impenetrable thickets of trees and underwood. Man
                    scarcely dares to penetrate into these gloomy regions, which are filled by
                    numerous and formidable wild animals, elephants, lions, hyenas, and enormous
                    broods of the serpent species. These creatures, when the inundation comes on,
                    seek refuge in the cultivated and inhabited tracts, where their arrival diffuses
                    consternation and dismay.</p>
                <p>The rivers by which this great expanse of water is fed are the Yeou and the
                    Shary. The former, which enters it from the west, excited great interest on its
                    first discovery, from being considered, or at least suspected, to be a
                    continuation of the Niger of Park. Further observation has completely disproved
                    this supposition, and shown it to be a river of only secondary magnitude. Rising
                    in a range of hills to the south of I4oussa, it flows first north, then eastward
                    through Bornou, till it falls into the Tchad; but it never, unless when swollen
                    by the rains, presents any great body of water. The Shary is a more considerable
                    stream, although its origin and early course are known only by conjecture. After
                    flowing from the south for about forty miles, through the kingdom of Loggun, it
                    enters at the south-eastern extremity of Bornou into the great common
                    receptacle, where it forms a noble stream, half a mile broad, and flows with
                    considerable rapidity.</p>
                <p>The territory of Bornou, extending along the whole western and part of the
                    southern and northern shores of the great lake, is generally level and fertile.
                    The climate, especially from March to the end of June, is oppressively hot,
                    rising sometimes to 105 and 107, and even during most of the night not falling
                    much below 100. In May the wet season commences, with violent storms of thunder
                    and lightning. In the end of June the rivers and lakes begin to overflow, and
                    for several months the rains are almost incessant, accompanied with damp,
                    cloudy, and sultry weather. The inhabitants at this season are severely
                    afflicted with fever and ague, which carry off great numbers of them. In October
                    the rains abate; cool, fresh winds blow from the west and north-west; and for
                    several months the climate is both healthful and agreeable.</p>
                <p>No mention is found of Bornou among the geographers of antiquity, although it may
                    be conjectured that the great lake of Nigritia, placed by Ptolemy in the centre
                    of Africa, was perhaps the Tchad. Edrisi, however, in the twelfth century,
                    describes this country under the appellation of Kuku, which is still borne by
                    its capital. He represents the king as absolute and powerful, with a numerous
                    army and many attendants; the people as martial, though rude; and the merchants
                    as carrying on an active trade and possessing great wealth. Leo, who visited it
                    about two centuries after, gives a description nearly similar. The people are
                    represented as Pagans, and extremely rude, though numerous, and the country well
                    cultivated. The merchants from Barbary supplied the king in his expeditions with
                    arms and horses, while he made an annual expedition to procure slaves to be
                    given in payment.</p>
                <p>No further relations respecting Bornou were communicated to Europe during a very
                    long period; yet it is remarkable that, in the maps of Sanson, Delisle, and
                    others of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, there is found a lake of
                    Bornou, and in some of them a large lake with the name of Guardia, which does
                    not sound very dissimilar to that of Tchad. It is difficult to conjecture the
                    ground upon which these features were delineated; yet their coincidence with
                    those recently discovered seems to show that they were founded upon some
                    information with which we are now unacquainted. D’Anville, however, proceeding
                    upon his rigid principle of admitting no object for which he could not find a
                    positive authority, expunged these names from his map, and has been generally
                    followed by modern geographers.</p>
                <p>When the African Association in 1788 commenced their operations, they early
                    received some information, collected by Mr Lucas at Tripoli, with other
                    particulars related by Ben Ali, a Moorish merchant resident in London. From
                    these sources were derived pretty copious notices, both concerning Bornou and
                    Cassina; the former being described as what it then appears to have been,
                    decidedly the ruling power in the interior of Eastern Africa, all the kingdoms
                    of which it had reduced into a state of vassalage. In arranging these accounts,
                    however, a considerable error was committed as to the position of this country.
                    Mr Lucas had been informed that it was fifty journeys, or about six hundred and
                    fifty miles, south from Fezzan; but his informant added that it was only
                    twenty-five journeys west from the Nile. To meet this statement Major Rennell
                    conceived it necessary to extend the route, not due south as it really was, but
                    south-east, so as to place it in the heart of the desert, seven degrees north
                    and eight degrees east of its real position. Kuku, likewise believed, from the
                    statement of Edrisi, to be a separate kingdom, was placed in the same quarter,
                    still nearer to the Nile; and thus the desert tract to the west of Nubia was
                    filled with countries which, in that quarter, have no existence.</p>
                <p>The expedition sent out by the British government in 1822, under Denham and
                    Clapperton, completely adjusted the geography of this part of the continent. It
                    was discovered that Bornou, instead of being so far removed, as our maps
                    represented, from Houssa and Cassina, was close on their eastern frontier, and
                    formed a continuation of that extensive, fruitful, and finely watered plain,
                    which extends from the mouth of the Senegal across Central Africa. Its relative
                    political circumstances had also undergone, during this interval, a very
                    complete change. Instead of holding all the surrounding states in vassalage, it
                    had been itself completely subjected to the dominion of the Fellatahs, who,
                    after subjugating all Houssa, had invaded Bornou, and committed the most
                    dreadful ravages, destroying its capital and other large cities, and bringing
                    the whole country into a state of entire bondage. There was still, however,
                    among the people a strong spirit of valour and independence. A mere private
                    individual, in the northern province of Kanem, pretending to, and perhaps
                    himself trusting in, a celestial mission, hoisted the green flag of the Prophet,
                    and, under the title of the servant of God, undertook a series of struggles for
                    the deliverance of his country. The Fellatahs appear to have been taken very
                    much by surprise, and, being defeated in successive encounters, were in ten
                    months driven completely out of Bornou. They seem to have now given up all
                    attempts at reconquering it, although a hostile spirit still reigns between the
                    two countries.</p>
                <p>The conqueror, called, from his native province, El Kanemy, having the army
                    wholly devoted to him, might probably have with little difficulty assumed the
                    sovereign power. More moderate, and perhaps more prudent, he drew forth the
                    nearest heir of the ancient sultans, and invested him with all the appearance
                    and pomp of sovereignty; reserving only for himself, under the title of scheik,
                    all its reality. The court of the sultan was established at New Bornou, which
                    was made the capital, instead of the old city, which had been entirely destroyed
                    during the Fellatah invasion; while the scheik, in military state, resides at
                    the city of Kuku or Kouka.</p>
                <p>The Bornouese throne in former times had been elective, at least among the
                    members of the same family; and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733232"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-3232-0013"/>the nobles possessed this and other high
                    privileges: but at present the scheik possesses a power nearly absolute, which
                    he exercises with salutary vigour. Bands of robbers who desolated the country
                    have been nearly extirpated, and travelling and property rendered secure, at
                    least in the interior. Justice within each city is administered, as in other
                    Mussulman countries, by the cadi, with an appeal to the scheik. Murder is
                    punished, on conviction, by delivering the offender to the relatives of the
                    deceased, who dispatch him with clubs. A young thief is buried in the ground up
                    to the head, which being covered with butterand honey, is exposed under the
                    burning sun to the attack of innumerable flies and mosquitoes. Insolvent debtors
                    are rather hardly dealt with. But the scheik’s zeal was peculiarly directed
                    against moral offences, of which conscience and public opinion have been
                    generally considered as the most appropriate guardians. Such were the
                    non-observance of the Mahommedan fasts, upon which severe and relentless
                    penalties were levied. He was also most strict in punishing those failings in
                    the female sex which are elsewhere considered as sufficiently visited by
                    disgrace and exclusion from society. Here not only the most ignominious
                    punishments, but often death itself, awaited them. On one occasion sixty of
                    these unfortunate offenders were brought before him, of whom five were hanged,
                    and four whipt so severely that two afterwards expired; an outrageous virtue,
                    which seems with reason to have been branded as almost diabolical. The most
                    frivolous female offences, as talking too loud, and walking in the street with
                    the face unveiled, were considered as ground of public indictment at this severe
                    bar. Even the spending in courtship or otherwise a larger sum than a man was
                    supposed to be able to afford, gave ground for dragging him before the national
                    tribunal. Major Denham saw one thrown into prison for presenting to his bride
                    two robes or turkadoes, when his station was considered as not authorizing more
                    than one; although he proved that the lady had refused her consent on any other
                    terms; which, however, drew upon her also a severe animadversion.</p>
                <p>The sultan of Bornou is surrounded by a mounted body-guard, who likewise compose
                    his principal nobles and chiefs. Their attire and equipment is the most
                    grotesque and unwieldy, perhaps, to which fashion in any country has given rice.
                    It is indispensable to the chief of rank that he should possess a huge belly,
                    the singular importance attached to which is probably founded on the idea of its
                    being an indication of plenty and luxury; and it is held so essential, that even
                    when high feeding cannot produce the effect, stuffing is employed to give the
                    appearance of it. Again, even in this burning climate, the body is enveloped in
                    successive robes, amounting often to ten or twelve, the number being always
                    considered as indicating the rank of the wearer. The head likewise is inclosed
                    in numerous successive turbans, which are supposed to be rendered more
                    ornamental by leaving only one side of the face uncovered. The sultan studies to
                    be still more protuberant and more loaded with clothing than any of his
                    courtiers. Yet in this attire he and they advance together into the field; but
                    of course they can have no real efficiency in the duties of active warfare. The
                    last sultan had fallen in consequence of the impossibility, caused by his
                    ponderous equipment, of flying with sufficient speed before a victorious
                    enemy.</p>
                <p>The military force of Bornou consists almost entirely in cavalry, amounting to
                    about 30,000, who are mounted on small but active steeds, which, as well as
                    their riders, being cased in iron mail, present a very formidable appearance.
                    They also manage their horses with the utmost skill, and perform all the
                    manoeuvres of the field most rapidly and dexterously. Their only defect is, that
                    when placed in the field against an enemy at all formidable, they can by no
                    impulse be induced to fight. They look on as spectators till the contest issues
                    in victory, when they engage eagerly in pursuit and plunder, in both of which
                    they excel; whilst, in case of defeat, they take to flight with the utmost
                    rapidity. As, however, the cavalry of the armies with which they contend are
                    nearly on a level in point of prowess with themselves, the match is tolerably
                    equal. There are usually on each side about a hundred chiefs, raised to
                    distinction by bodily strength and prowess, who engage in single combats, and
                    display often the most desperate valour. Barca Gana, the scheik’s general, had
                    obtained the reputation of possessing charms that rendered him invulnerable. The
                    main dependence of that prince is upon a body of 9000 spearmen from his native
                    territory of Kanem, who rally round him with the most enthusiastic attachment.
                    Though almost naked, and equipped only with shield and spear, they display a
                    discipline beyond that of almost any other African army. They march by tribes,
                    and keep in front of their line a regular chain of piquets, with sentinels, who
                    every half hour pass the war-cry along it; precautions very rarely employed in
                    barbarian armies. All the sovereigns of Central Africa likewise consider
                    themselves fortunate if they can engage the services of even a small party of
                    Arab caravan followers, who, being brave and armed with muskets, an instrument
                    yet almost unknown in this region, are objects of something like supernatural
                    dread.</p>
                <p>The territory of Bornou is fertile and well watered, yielding large crops even
                    under very imperfect cultivation. The labour is chiefly performed by female
                    slaves, who, at the commencement of the rainy season, scratch rather than turn
                    the ground, and scatter rallier than sow the seed. They are also obliged to
                    watch the growth, in order to guard against numerous animal depredators; a very
                    perilous occupation, in the course of which they are liable to be carried off by
                    the wild beasts, who are roaming about in every direction. The rice and wheat
                    are inferior, and grown in small quantity. The grain which forms the staple food
                    of the people is a species of millet called <hi rend="italic">gussub,</hi> which
                    they form, not into bread, an article here entirely unknown, but into a species
                    of paste, that, by the addition of butter and honey, forms the highest boast of
                    Bornou cookery. Cotton and indigo are also valuable productions, affording the
                    material for the cloths finely dyed with blue stripes, which form the staple
                    fabric of the country. All the domestic animals are reared, and very numerous
                    herds of oxen are possessed, chiefly by an Arab tribe called Shouaas∙ Major
                    Denham reckons 20,000 on the shores of the Tchad, and double that number on the
                    banks of the Shary. The empire, however, is remarkably destitute of the products
                    of horticulture. There is neither a fruit nor a vegetable, except some onions in
                    the vicinity of the large towns, and a very few limes and figs reared with great
                    difficulty in the garden of the scheik.</p>
                <p>The wild animals are very numerous, finding both food and cover in the extensive
                    woody and marshy districts. Lions prowl about in considerable numbers,
                    approaching even the walls of the towns. The Bornouese delight in taming and
                    even making a pet of this noble animal. The scheik, as a special favour, sent
                    Major Denham a present of a young lion, which he very prudently returned,
                    lamenting the want of space for his accommodation. Elephants, in herds of fifty
                    to four hundred, wander over the tract inundated by the Tchad, and are hunted
                    and killed both for the flesh and the ivory. Hyenas also, in huge and formidable
                    bands, invade the cultivated fields, and are with difficulty prevented from
                    penetrating <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733245" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3245-0014"
                    />into the towns. The tall form of the giraffe is not unfrequently seen cropping
                    the leaves of the dense forest. The waters abound with crocodiles and
                    hippopotami, and the flesh of both is valued for food; that of the former,
                    indeed, is described by naturalists as extremely delicate. The country is filled
                    with swarms of bees, which often obstruct the passage of the traveller; and the
                    honey, though only partially collected, forms one of the chief Bornouese
                    delicacies. Antelopes, gazelles, ostriches, and various other quadrupeds and
                    feathered animals, are pursued as game.</p>
                <p>The population of Bornou is calculated by Major Denham at 5,000,000; but,
                    considering its limited extent, and the imperfect state of agriculture, this
                    number must, we think, be considerably exaggerated. The leading people, called
                    Bornouese or Kanowry, present a complete specimen of the negro form and
                    features; having large mouths, thick lips, broad noses, an unmeaning face, but
                    good teeth and high foreheads. The females heighten their want of beauty by a
                    most extensive and injudicious system of puncturing and tattooing. The people
                    are peaceably disposed, friendly and courteous in their manners, and
                    distinguished by a sort of good-natured heaviness. Though endowed with a slender
                    degree of courage, they are resentful, and addicted to petty larcenies. The law
                    allows of polygamy, but the richest have seldom more than two or three wives,
                    and the rest of the community only one. The favourite amusement is wrestling,
                    not performed in person, but viewed as a spectacle while performed by slaves
                    taken in war from the neighbouring nations, particularly the Beghermes and
                    Musgows. The displays of strength made by these men are said to be often very
                    extraordinary. A powerful wrestler sells at a high price, and the masters place
                    extraordinary pride in the performance of their slaves, cheering them during the
                    combat, and, on its successful issue, often presenting them with valuable robes.
                    Even the ladies of Bornou engage occasionally in public contests, where they
                    often throw each other with violence to the ground. Another favourite amusement
                    consists in a rude game bearing some resemblance to chess, played with beans and
                    holes in the sand.</p>
                <p>The Mahommedan religion is universally professed in Bornou, and even with
                    violence and bigotry. Through recommendations brought with them, the English
                    travellers secured good treatment; but, as unbelievers, they were viewed with
                    the deepest horror, and almost as a species of monsters. Even from those who
                    showed at first the most friendly disposition, the disclosure of their creed
                    drew forth deep groans, sometimes screams, and usually arrested all progress to
                    intimacy. A man who had served them for two or three weeks, although he pleaded
                    that it was only under the most extreme necessity, was declared unfit on that
                    ground to be received as a witness in a court of law. There are resident in
                    Bornou a considerable number of <hi rend="italic">figlds</hi> (writers or
                    doctors), who have visited Mecca, and are well skilled in Arabic. It is even an
                    employment to write copies of the Koran, which are sent into Barbary, where they
                    bear a considerable price. Its verses are much used as charms or amulets, in the
                    preparation of which the scheik was understood greatly to excel, gaining almost
                    as many victories by his pen as by his sword. The Bornouese, like other negroes,
                    have songs relating to love or war, some of which are said to possess merit; but
                    their intellectual character in general seems to rank extremely low.</p>
                <p>The pastoral districts of this country are occupied by a tribe called Shouaas,
                    who are accounted Arabs, and speak that language, though they have scarcely any
                    resemblance to those in the north bearing that appellation. They have fine open
                    countenances, with aquiline noses, large eyes, and a complexion of light copper;
                    and they exhibit a strong though improved resemblance to the European gipsies.
                    Their deportment, however, is not very favourably spoken of. They do not want
                    courage, and can furnish the government when necessary with 15,000 horse; but
                    they are arrogant and deceitful, imposing upon the people by the manufacture of
                    charms, and by pretensions to prophecy and fortune-telling. Having thus gained
                    admission into the houses, they not only sell these gifts at a high rate, but
                    embrace opportunities of pilfering. Probably they were observed to disadvantage
                    in the heart of the cities. One of their tribes, called Dugganahs, who were
                    visited in their native tents on the Shary, presented a most pleasing picture of
                    patriarchal simplicity. Their countenances were noble and expressive, and the
                    attachments of kindred and domestic affection were displayed in peculiar force.
                    Another tribe, called the La Salas, almost independent of Bornou, inhabit a
                    number of low islands in the Tchad, covered with rich pasture, and separated
                    from the continent by channels so shallow as to be fordable on horseback. A
                    knowledge of the tracts is however requisite; and those troops who without it
                    attempted to penetrate through them have got entangled in mud, sunk into deep
                    pools, and signally defeated.</p>
                <p>The towns in Bornou are of considerable size, surrounded with walls thirty-five
                    or forty feet in height, and twenty feet in thickness, having at each of the
                    four corners a triple gate, composed of strong planks of wood, with bars of
                    iron. The abodes of the principal inhabitants form an inclosed square, in which
                    are separate houses for each of the wives; whilst the chief himself resides in
                    two or more elevated structures resembling turrets, connected together by
                    terraces. These are well built, of a reddish clay, highly polished, so as to
                    resemble stucco; whilst the interior roof, though composed only of branches, is
                    tastefully constructed. The horns of the antelope and gazelle are employed to
                    fasten together the different parts, and have suspended from them the quiver,
                    spear, and shield of the owner. The ordinary houses are small, being built
                    partly of mud and thatched, partly only of straw or coarse grass mats. Major
                    Denham was accommodated in one of eight feet diameter, having a hole two and a
                    half feet high, by which he crept in and out; but this deficiency of aperture
                    was rendered almost necessary by the crowds of tormenting insects who would
                    otherwise have made good their entrance. Though New Bornou and Kouka were the
                    residences, the one of the sultan and the other of the scheik, neither is equal
                    in magnitude to Angornou, estimated to contain 30,000 inhabitants, who, on
                    market days, are swelled to 80,000 or 100,000. On the Yeou are seen the ruins of
                    Old Bornou and Gambarou, which appear to have been greater and better built
                    cities than any now in the kingdom; but they had been so entirely destroyed by
                    the Fellatahs in their late invasion, that the very site is in a great measure
                    covered with shrubs and vegetation. The vicinity is almost laid waste by the
                    inroads of the Tuaricks; and, indeed, all the kingdoms of Central Africa suffer
                    the disadvantage of having their frontier exposed to the ravages of predatory
                    tribes who occupy the rude and desert borders.</p>
                <p>The English travellers have held out favourable hopes of the commerce which might
                    be opened with Bornou. They observed the increased and increasing demand, among
                    a numerous population, for goods which Britain either does or could produce
                    cheaper than any other country; and these goods were found selling at an advance
                    of 300 per cent, above their price at Tripoli. On the other hand, it must not be
                    forgotten that the route from that city, though the nearest of any from the
                    coast, greatly exceeds a thousand miles, through the most dreary and desolate
                    tracts, amid the domains of numerous predatory tribes.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733258" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3258-0015"/>
                <p>The merchant has to encounter, therefore, not only accumulated hardships, but all
                    the perils of famine, battle, and pestilence. It would be vain, therefore, to
                    expect that any one would conduct such a trade without very high profits. It is
                    at present carried on by merchants, or rather chiefs, each with a large body of
                    armed followers, alike prepared for commerce or war. The European who should
                    engage in such a trade would be obliged to follow this example, and might expect
                    to encounter their enmity and rivalry. It seems doubtful, therefore, how far
                    such a trade could now be carried on by any other than its present channel.</p>
                <p>Amongst the commodities which find a market in Bor-nou are mentioned writing
                    paper, beads, coral, silks and cottons of gaudy patterns, turbans, small
                    carpets, brushes, caftans, and shirts readymade; brass basons tinned, small
                    mirrors, pistols, and other arms ornamented, but cheap. The commodities taken in
                    return are almost exclusively slaves, obtained by purchase or capture; and we
                    fear it will be more difficult than Major Denham supposes to divert the trade
                    from this bad channel. Neither gold nor silver are seemingly to be procured in
                    Bornou. Elephants’ teeth, ostrich feathers, raw hides, musk, indigo, and senna,
                    are mentioned as commodities suited to the market of Europe. <hi
