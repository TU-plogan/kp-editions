                <p><label type="entry">BULL, <hi rend="smallcaps">Dr John</hi></label>, a celebrated
                    musician and composer, was born in Somersetshire about the year 1563. He
                    received his education under Blitheman. In 1586 he was admitted at Oxford to the
                    degree of bachelor of music, having practised in that faculty fourteen years;
                    and in 1592 he was created doctor in the university of Cambridge. In 1591 he was
                    appointed organist of the queen’s chapel, in the room of his master,
                    Blitheman.</p>
                <p>Bull was the first Gresham professor of music, having been appointed to that
                    station on the special recommendation of Queen Elizabeth. But however skilful he
                    might be in his profession, he was not, it seems, able to read his lectures in
                    Latin; and therefore, by a special provision in the ordinances respecting the
                    Gresham professors, made in the year 1597, it is declared, that because Dr Bull
                    was recommended to the office of music professor by the queen’s most excellent
                    majesty, his lectures should be permitted to be altogether English, so long as
                    he should continue music professor there, he being unable to speak Latin.</p>

                <p>Dr Ward, who has given some particulars of Dr Bull, in his Lives of the Gresham
                    Professors, relates, that upon the decease of Queen Elizabeth he became chief
                    organist to King James, and had the honour of entertaining his majesty and
                    Prince Henry at Merchant Tailors’ Hall, with his performance on the organ. The
                    same author states, that, in 1613, Bull quitted England and went to reside in
                    the Netherlands, where he was admitted into the service of the archduke. Wood
                    says that he died at Hamburg; others state that he died at Lubeck.</p>

                    David’s, was born at Wells in 1634, and educated at Exeter College, Oxford. The
                    first benefice he enjoyed was that of St George’s near Bristol, from which he
                    rose successively to be rector of Suddington in Gloucestershire, prebendary of
                    Gloucester, archdeacon of Llandaff, and in 1705 bishop of St David’s. This
                    dignity he enjoyed about four years, and died in 1709. During the usurpation of
                    Cromwell he adhered steadily., though still with great prudence, to the forms of
                    the church of England; and in the reign of James II. preached very strenuously
                    against the errors of popery. He wrote, 1, A Defence of the Nicene Faith; 2,
                    Apostolical Harmony; 3, Primitive Apostolical Tradition; and other works.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bull,</hi> among ecclesiastics, a letter written on
                    parchment, sealed with lead, and issued by order of the pope, from the Roman
                    rota or chancery. It is a kind of apostolical rescript or edict, and is" chiefly
                    in use in matters of justice or grace. If the former be the intention of the
                    bull, the lead is hung by a hempen cord; if the latter, by a silken thread. It
                    is this pendant lead or seal which is, properly speaking, the bull, and which is
                    impressed on one side with the heads of St Peter and St Paul, and on the other
                    with the name of the pope and the year of his pontificate. The bull is written
                    in an old round Gothic’ character, and is divided into five parts, the narrative
                    of the fact, the conception, the clause, the date, and the salutation, in which
                    the pope styles himself <hi rend="italic">servus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >servorum,</hi> or the servant of servants. These instruments, besides the lead
                    appended to them, have a cross, with some texts of Scripture, or a religious
                    motto, on it. Bulls are granted for the consecration of bishops, the promotion
                    to benefices, the celebration of jubilees, and many other purposes.</p>

                    exercise much in vogue among the Spaniards and Portuguese, consisting in a kind
                    of combat of a cavalier or torreador against a wild bull, either on foot or on
                    horseback. This sport the Spaniards received from the Moors, among whom it was
                    celebrated with great pomp. Some think that the Moors might have received the
                    custom from the Romans, and the latter from the Greeks. Dr Plot is of opinion

                    and anathemas against heretics, and all who disturb or oppose the jurisdiction
                    of the holy see. After the reading of the bull, the pope throws a burning torch
                    in the public place, to denote the thunder of this anathema.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Golden</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Bull,</hi> an edict or
                    imperial constitution made by the.Emperor Charles IV., and hence called
                    Caroline, reputed to be the magna charta or the fundamental law of the German
                    empire. It is called <hi rend="italic">golden,</hi> because it has a golden
                    seal, in the form of a pope’s bull, tied with yellow and red cords of silk;
                    while on one side the emperoι is represented sitting on his throne, and on the
                    other the capitol of Rome. Till the publication of the golden bull, the form and
                    ceremony of the election of an emperor were unsettled, and the number of the
                    electors was not fixed. This solemn edict regulated the functions, rights,
                    privileges, and precedence of the electors. The original, which is in Latin, on
                    vellum, is preserved at Francfort. This ordonnance, containing thirty articles
                    or chapters, was approved of by all the princes of the empire.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Silver</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Bulls</hi> were not in
                    so frequent use, though instances of them are to be met with.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Leaden</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Bulls</hi> were sent by
                    the emperors of Constantinople to patriarchs and princes; and they were also
                    used by the grandees of the imperial court, as well as by the kings of France,
                    Sicily, and other countries; and by bishops, patriarchs, and popes. It is to be
                    observed that the leaden bulls of these last had, on one side, the name of the
                    pope or bishop inscribed. According to Polydore Virgil, Pope Stephen III. was
                    the first who used leaden bulls, about the year 772; but instances of them are
                    to be met with as early as the times of Silvester, Leo I., and Gregory the
                    Great. The latter popes, besides their own names, strike the figures of St Peter
                    and St Paul on their bulls, a practice first introduced by Pope Paschal II. But
                    why, in these bulls, the figure of St Paul is on the right, and that of St Peter
                    on the left side, is a question which has occasioned many conjectures and
                    disputes.</p>

                    sons, and were of two sorts, one red and the other green.</p>
