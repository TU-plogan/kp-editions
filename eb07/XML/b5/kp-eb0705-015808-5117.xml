                    distinguished historian, was born at Dundee about the year 1465, being descended
                    of a family which for several generations had possessed the barony of Panbride
                    or Balbride. The orthography of his surname is extremely fluctuating; it is to
                    be found under the various modifications of Boece, Boeth, Boeis, Boys, Boyse,
                    Boyes, Boyis, Boiss, and Boyce. The first of these, we strongly suspect, was
                    never a name belonging to any living man in Scotland: it was formed by the
                    French from the name of the latest Roman classic, and on that account appears to
                    have been adopted by Bellenden in his translation of the history. The real
                    Scotish name is a monosyllable; and we adhere to the orthography of Boyce, as
                    being most common in our own time. He received the first rudiments of learning
                    at Dundee, and completed his course of study in the university of Paris, where
                    he took the degree of B. D. He was appointed a professor of philosophy’· in the
                    College of Montaigu; and in this seminary he became intimately acquainted with
                    Erasmus, who in two epistles has testified his esteem for Boyce’s
                    character.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    by his talents and attainments, when King’s College was founded at Aberdeen by
                    the munificence of William Elphinstone, bishop of the diocese. The papal bull
                    for the erection of a university had been obtained in the year 1494, but the
                    buildings were not sufficiently advanced, nor did the lectures commence, till
                    about the year 1500. It was not without some degree of hesitation that he
                    consented to quit the lettered society of Paris, and to become principal of this
                    new college; but having at length accepted the conditions, he proceeded to
                    Aberdeen, and experienced a kind reception from the canons of the cathedral,
                    several of whom he has commemorated as men of learning. It was a part of his
                    duty as principal to read lectures on divinity. The sub-principal was his friend
                    William Hay, a native of the same county, who had been his fellow-student at
                    Dundee and at Paris, and who at length succeeded him as head of the

                    “Boethius, as president of the university,” says Dr Johnson, “enjoyed a revenue
                    of forty Scottish marks, about two pounds four shillings and sixpence of
                    sterling money. In the present age of trade and taxes, it is difficult even for
                    the imagination so to raise the∙value of money, or so to diminish the demands of
                    life, as to suppose four and forty shillings a year an honourable stipend; yet
                    it was probably equal, not only to the needs, but to the rank of Boethius. The
                    wealth of England was undoubtedly to that of Scotland more than five to one, and
                    it is known that Henry the Eighth, among whose faults avarice was never
                    reckoned, granted to Roger Ascham, as a reward of his learning, a pension of ten
                    pounds a year.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    was not the only preferment which Boyce enjoyed: he was not only principal of
                    King’s College, but was likewise a canon of Aberdeen, and rector of Tyrie in the
                    same county. Under the date of July 14, 1527, we find a “grant to Maister
                    Hector” of an annual pension of fifty pounds, to be paid by the sheriff of
                    Aberdeen out of the king’s casualties. And on the 26th of July 1529 was issued a
                    “precept for a lettre to Mr Hector Boys, professor of theology, of a pension of
                    L.50 Scots yearly, until the king promote him to a benefice of 100 marks Scots
                    of yearly value; the said pension to be paid him by the customers of Aberdeen.”
                    In 1533 and 1534, one half of his pension was however paid by the king’s
                    treasurer, and the other half by the comptroller; and as no payment subsequent
                    to that of Whitsuntide 1534 has been traced in the treasurer’s accompts, he is
                    supposed to have obtained his benefice soon after that period.<note

                    the subsequent title: “Episcoporum Murthlacensium et Aberdonensium per Hectorem

                    rarity, was lately reprinted, for the members of the Bannatyne Club. “Hectoris

                    editae.” Edinb. 1825, 4to. Of the bishops of this diocese the seat was
                    originally at Murthlack, in the county of Banff, but it was afterwards
                    transferred to Aberdeen. His notices of the early prelates are necessarily brief
                    and unsatisfactory, and the most interesting portion of the book is that which
                    relates to his liberal patron Bishop Elphinstone; of whose private history and
                    public services he has given a circumstantial detail, which occupies nearly one
                    third of the volume. Here we likewise find an account of the foundation and
                    constitution of the college, together with some notices of its earliest
                    members.</p>
                <p>His more famous work, the history of Scotland, was published after an interval of
                    five years: “Scotorum His-tonae a prima gentis origine, cum aliarum et rerum et

                    commendatory epistle by Alexander Lyon, precentor of the cathedral of Elgin,
                    bears the fifteenth of March 1527. This edition contains seventeen books.
                    Another edition, containing the eighteenth book and a fragment of the
                    nineteenth, was published by Ferrerius, who has added an appendix of thirty-five

                    the dedication of one of his works to this prelate, he mentions Hector and
                    Arthur Boyce, together with several other scholars of Aberdeen. “Aberdoniis

                <p>The composition of Boyce’s history displays much talent; and if the style does
                    not always reach the standard of ancient purity, it displays a certain vein of
                    elegance, which generally renders it attractive. The author’s love of his native
                    country, and his anxiety to emblazon the heroic deeds of his countrymen, are
                    conspicuous in every part of the work; nor must we leave unnoticed those
                    aspirations after political freedom, by which he was honourably distinguished at
                    a period when the human mind was so generally chained to the earth by the most
                    slavish maxims of submission. It may be recorded as commendation, instead of
                    reproach, that his principles of polity have been represented as no better than
                    those of Buchanan. Boyce’s imagination was however stronger than his judgment:
                    of the extent of the historian’s credulity, his narrative exhibits many
                    unequivocal proofs; and if this circumstance admits of a sufficient excuse from
                    the common propensity of the age in which he lived, his work presents strong
                    indications of another fault, for which it is not so easy to find an apology.
                    According to Bishop Lloyd, he put Fordun’s tales “into the form of an history,
                    and pieced them out with a very good invention, that part in which he chiefly
                    excelled.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lloyd’s <hi

                    rest Veremundus and Campbell, of whose writings not a single vestige is now to
                    be found. In his dedication to the king, he is pleased to state that Veremundus,
                    a Spaniard by birth, was archdeacon of St Andrews, and that he wrote in Latin a
                    history of Scotland from the origin of the nation to the reign of Malcolm the
                    Third, to whom he inscribed his work. According to Bishop Stillingfleet, whose
                    opinion has been adopted by many other writers, these historians never existed
                    except in Boyce’s fertile imagination.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    a strong impression, that the historian’s account of his original materials, if

                    his “elegant style and correct composition, not to add beautiful genius and fine
                    fancy, are conclusive proofs that his understanding could not be

                    final estimate of the literary character of Boece, we must bear in mind, that
                    when scholar-craft, in this country at least, was rare, he was a scholar, and
                    contributed, by reviving ancient learning, to dispel the gloom of the middle
                    ages; and that, while the history of his country existed only in the rude page
                    of the chroniclers who preceded him, or in the fading records of oral tradition,
                    he embodied it in narrative so interesting, and language so beautiful, as to be
                    worthy of a more refined age.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Boyce’s history of Scotland was translated into the Scotish language by John
                    Bellenden, archdeacon of Moray and canon of Ross, of whom we have already
                    presented our readers with a copious notice. While the learned archdeacon was
                    engaged in translating the work into prose, another individual was engaged in
                    the more formidable task of translating it into verse. A copy of this metrical
                    version, containing about 70,000 lines, is preserved in the library of the
                    university of Cambridge: a leaf seems to be wanting at the beginning, and the
                    manuscript has suffered some other mutilations. The name of the versifier does
                    not appear, nor has it been ascertained from any other document; but we learn
                    from the prologue, that his labours, like those of Bellenden, were intended for
                    the benefit of the young monarch. From the concluding lines, it is ascertained
                    that he began his task in April 1531, and concluded it in September 1535. His
                    verses are not distinguished by any considerable degree of energy or elegance,
                    and the writer is chiefly to be commended for his perseverance. The prologue,
                    which is unfortunately mutilated, contains an account of his motives for
                    engaging in this laborious undertaking: it is conducted in the form of a
                    dialogue between the translator and a certain lady, who is probably some
                    allegorical personage. The following is perhaps the most curious passage which
                    it contains.</p>

                    died at Aberdeen, and, according to the most probable conjecture, he had then
