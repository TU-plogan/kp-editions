                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    >Bet-juanas,</hi> a numerous people, or rather race, who occupy an extensive
                    territory in Southern Africa. Their country is bounded on the south by the Cape
                    Colony, on the east by the Caffre territory, on the north by the Makooas, and
                    other tribes bordering on the Portuguese settlement of Mozambique. The western
                    limit is partly unknown, partly composed of extensive deserts.</p>
                <p>Down to the commencement of the present century, this people were entirely
                    unknown to Europeans. Mr Barrow, indeed, in his second journey into the country
                    of the Caffres, obtained some notices respecting them. In 1801, while the
                    settlement laboured under a severe scarcity of cattle, two gentlemen belonging
                    to it, Messrs Truffer and Sommerville, set out on an expedition, with the view
                    of procuring a supply. Having passed, first the Great Karroo or Arid Desert,
                    then the Snowy Mountains, and the territory of the rude Bosjesmans, they arrived
                    at an extensive pastoral plain watered by the ample stream of the Orange river,
                    and inhabited by the Koras or Kora-nas, who appeared considerably superior to
                    any of the other Hottentot tribes. Here they met with a Boshuana, and received
                    from him such accounts as induced them to accompany him to his own country. They
                    soon passed the frontier, and entered on a fertile and finely-watered territory,
                    where, after a few days’ journey, they were surprised to find, in the heart of
                    this rude and unknown region of Africa, what might almost be termed a city. The
                    houses and streets of Lattakoo were built and arranged in a manner decidedly
                    superior to any hitherto seen in the southern districts of this great continent.
                    The king, a venerable old man, received them with kindness, and they became to
                    all the natives objects of friendly curiosity. These people appeared to our
                    travellers not only to have made considerable progress in the arts and in
                    civilization, but to live together in a patriarchal simplicity and harmony,
                    which almost realized the fabled pictures of the golden age.</p>
                <p>Lord Caledon, then governor of the Cape, on receiving this interesting
                    intelligence, determined to follow out the career of discovery thus opened. He
                    dispatched Dr Cowan and Lieutenant Denovan, with a party of twenty, to endeavour
                    to penetrate through the territory of the newly-discovered people, and if
                    possible to reach the coast at Mozambique and Sofala, by which they would throw
                    important light on a very considerable extent of the geography of Africa. The
                    travellers experienced at Lattakoo the same friendly reception as their
                    precursors; they then arrived at the residence of a chief called Makkrakka, who
                    afforded them a still more cordial welcome. A letter was received from them,
                    dated from the residence of this chief, in about 24. south latitude, in which
                    they described the country as increasing in beauty and fertility, and as watered
                    by a noble river flowing to the westward. Makkrakka sent forward his own brother
                    to recommend them to the Wanketzens, the tribe immediately to the northward.
                    Here they met at first with a reception altogether favourable; but this
                    treacherous people, seeing them thrown <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733349"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-3349-0022"/>off their guard, determined upon an attack, for
                    the purpose or seizing all their property. The expedition imprudently separated
                    into three parties, one of which went to bathe, while another remained in charge
                    of the waggons, and a third of the cattle. The natives having attacked
                    successively these three bodies, succeeded too fully in their atrocious design,
                    and entirely cut off the English.</p>
                <p>The government at the Cape did not for some time obtain any intelligence
                    respecting this party, and the first rumour of the disaster arrived by way of
                    Mozambique. No official mission has since been dispatched; yet several
                    travellers, animated by liberal curiosity, or the benevolent desire of
                    communicating to the natives the truths of the gospel, have penetrated even
                    deeper into the interior of this region than those now mentioned. Dr
                    Lichtenstein, after an extensive survey of the country of the Caffres, ventured,
                    not without some apprehension, to Lattakoo, but met with a perfectly friendly
                    reception. Being solicited, however, to give aid with fire-arms in a war against
                    Makkrakka, the traveller, unwilling to involve himself in these interior African
                    contests, wisely took the first opportunity of returning, after gaining,
                    however, a good deal of information. In 1813, the Reverend Mr Campbell, at the
                    request of the Missionary Society, and with a view to promote its objects,
                    ventured on an expedition into this territory. Although the dispositions of the
                    people were not altogether such as he could have wished, he had no personal
                    cause of complaint. Lattakoo was found (a change not uncommon in Africa, and
                    consequent upon a schism among its inhabitants) to have been transported about
                    sixty miles from its former situation. It appeared also diminished in size, not
                    containing above 1500 houses and 8000 inhabitants. Although unable to effect any
                    conversions, he obtained, with some difficulty, permission for missionaries to
                    settle here, and a promise of good treatment. In 1820 he returned and found the
                    establishment in a tolerably flourishing state. The missionaries had neat houses
                    and gardens built for their use, with a chapel capable of containing 400
                    persons, though it was very thinly attended. Mr Campbell penetrated northwards
                    to Mashow, Meribohway, and Kurrechanc, towns larger than Lattakoo, and governed
                    by separate chiefs. Mr Burchell afterwards, in the course of an extensive tour
                    through Southern Africa, penetrated beyond Lattakoo, and westward to
                    Bakarrikarri, on the confines of the Great Desert. We have thus, from a
                    succession of intelligent travellers, very satisfactory information respecting
                    this country, and the tribes by which it is inhabited.</p>
                <p>The Boshuanas are proved, both by their form and language, to belong to the same
                    race with the Caffres; but their persons are less vigorous, and in the male sex
                    less strikingly handsome; yet many of their females possess a great share of
                    beauty. Although they are not on the whole so fine and manly a race, yet they
                    have made a greater progress in the useful and even ornamental arts. Agriculture
                    is carried on with considerable diligence; though, as is too common in barbarous
                    tribes, its labours are devolved entirely on the female sex, who have the
                    additional task of building the houses and fashioning the furniture and dress.
                    The men, on the other hand, take the entire charge of the cattle, which
                    constitutes their chief wealth. ∙ Cultivation is confined to the spaces
                    surrounding their towns, which are built on heights for the purpose of defence;
                    and the cattle are driven out every morning to feed, often at a considerable
                    distance, and brought back at night within the circuit of the inclosures. The
                    habitations are neat and commodious, being encircled with substantial walls of
                    earth or stone; and some parts are moulded into pillars, or other ornamental
                    shapes, and carefully painted. At Kurrechane iron and copper were smelted in
                    large furnaces of clay; and they had well constructed vessels of earthenware for
                    holding their grain and stores. The men are dressed chiefly in skins, often
                    prepared with considerable ingenuity; whilst those of wild animals are thrown
                    over their shoulders for ornament. The ladies of rank wear ample mantles,
                    profusely embellished with beads, rings, and various species of ornaments.
                    Makaitshoah, the beautiful wife of the king of Lattakoo, appeared to Dr
                    Lichtenstein, having her robe trimmed with rich furs, a large bundle of cats
                    tails hanging from the left shoulder, and one arm loaded with no less than
                    seventy-two copper rings; the display of which appeared to be an object of
                    peculiar pride.</p>
                <p>In regard to their political situation, they have kings who rule with a species
                    of patriarchal authority, and chiefly by means of influence and persuasion. When
                    any affair of great importance is to be decided, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >pectso,</hi> or general assembly of the chiefs and warriors, is summoned. These
                    assemblages are carried on in a peculiar, and even extravagant style. The chiefs
                    on their way indulge in strange gestures and gambols. Before entering on
                    deliberation they commonly join in a song, whilst the principal orator often
                    strikes up a dance. Every speech is prefaced by three tremendous howls or yells,
                    sometimes imitating the cries of animals, while several of the attendants dance
                    in unison. As the debate proceeds, the female citizens form an exterior circle,
                    and by loud cheers or derisive laughter express their sense of the observations
                    made by the speakers.</p>
                <p>The distinctions of wealth, and even of rank, are pretty strongly marked in this
                    society; yet they have little influence on the general train of social
                    intercourse. Mateebe, or Mattivi, the chief whom the travellers call king, was
                    seen seated on the ground smoking and exchanging pipes with the most ordinary
                    citizens. He does not interfere in private quarrels, even when they proceed to
                    bloodshed; this is considered to be an affair between individuals. He waits till
                    his arbitration is called for, and then proceeds, often in a very summary
                    manner, executing with his own hand the sentence pronounced.</p>
                <p>A considerable degree of internal union and harmony prevails among these tribes.
                    Their manners, making no pretensions to any high refinement, are neither coarse
                    nor boisterous; their general deportment is frank and cordial, and a kind and
                    friendly spirit towards one another seems to prevail. But the intercourse of
                    different states with each other forms a complete scene of violence and rapine.
                    <hi rend="italic">Commandos,</hi> or forays, to carry off the cattle of their
                    neighbours, and kill all who oppose them, form their most favourite employment.
                    They seem to consider themselves born for this purpose; and the number of cattle
                    which they have carried off, and of men whom they have slain, is through life
                    their highest boast. Dr Lichtenstein even states, that on returning from a
                    successful expedition they celebrate a horrid feast, in which each produces a
                    portion of the flesh of his slaughtered enemy, which he roasts and devours.
                    Towards strangers their behaviour has been generally friendly and hospitable. Mr
                    Campbell’s party were indeed astonished, on arriving at one of the towns, to see
                    the warriors rushing forth to meet them, brandishing their battle-axes, painted
                    red, and dressed in the skins of wild beasts; but this soon proved to be only a
                    form of barbarous welcome. After the first ceremony was over, however, they
                    began actively to beg, and even to pilfer tobacco, a European luxury of which
                    they soon became excessively fond. The missionaries have been always well
                    treated, but have never made much progress in their main object. Engrossed by
                    their tumultuary occupations of pasturage and war, this people seem to have a
                    peculiar apathy towards all spiritual and abstract ideas. They <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193733362" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3362-0023"/>seem also, from Mr Burchell’s
                    observation, to be familiar with all the forms of superstition prevalent among
                    an ignorant people.</p>
                <p>In advancing northwards into the interior, the country seems to improve, becoming
                    more populous, while the people are more industrious, and better skilled in the
                    arts. Mashow, beautifully situated on a hill, was estimated to contain 10,000 or
                    12,000 inhabitants; and it was surrounded by twenty-nine villages, within a
                    circuit of twenty miles of cultivated territory. Kurreehane, still larger and
                    more handsomely built, was supposed to contain 16,000 or 17,000 people.</p>
                <p>This country was exposed in 1823 to a most disastrous invasion, from a predatory
                    and ferocious race called the Mantatees, or “wanderers.” They were in fact a
                    collected multitude of different Caffre tribes, flying before the attack of the
                    Zoolas, who had formed a dominion on the coast of Natal. The invaders were
                    estimated at 40,000 warriors, almost naked, armed with clubs, spears, and
                    battle-axes, and having their legs adorned with numerous brass rings. They
                    succeeded in sacking Kurrechane; and, after being repulsed from another town,
                    advanced upon Lattakoo, where they spread the most deadly consternation; the
                    inhabitants not being possessed of courage sufficient to enable them to face
                    such a formidable attack. They received, however, the aid of a party of Griqua
                    Hottentots, who had learned from Europeans the use of fire-arms; and after an
                    obstinate conflict turned to flight this immense multitude, and obliged them to
                    retreat within the Caffre territory. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e.)</hi></p>
