                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">BUTLER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles</hi></label>, a native
                    of Wycomb, in the county of Bucks, and a master of arts in Magdalen College,
                    Oxford, who published a book entitled “The Principles of Music in singing and
                    setting; with the twofold use thereof, ecclesiastical and civil.” 4to, London,
                    1636. The author of this book was a person of singular learning and ingenuity,
                    which he manifested in sundry other works enumerated by Wood in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aihenae Oxonienses.</hi> Among these is an English Grammar,
                    published in 1633, in which he proposes a scheme of regular orthography, and
                    makes use of characters, some borrowed from the Saxon, and others of his own
                    invention, which it is impossible to represent by means of ordinary types; and
                    of this imagined improvement he appears to have been so fond, that all his
                    tracts are printed in the same manner as his grammar; the consequence of which
                    has been an almost general disgust at every thing he has written. His treatise
                    on the Principles of Music is, however, a very learned, curious, and
                    entertaining book; and, by the help of the advertisement from the printer to the
                    reader, prefixed to it, explaining the powers of the several characters made use
                    of by him, may be read to great advantage, and may also be considered as a
                    judicious supplement to Morley’s introduction.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Butler,</hi><hi rend="italic">Samuel,</hi> a celebrated
                    poet, was the son of a respectable Worcestershire farmer, and was born in 1612.
                    He passed some time at Cambridge, but was never matriculated in that university.
                    Returning to his native country, he lived some years as clerk to a justice of
                    peace, and found sufficient time to apply himself to history., poetry, and
                    painting. Being recommended to Elizabeth, countess of Kent, he enjoyed in her
                    house not only the use of all kinds of books, but the conversation of the
                    illustrious Selden, who often employed Butler to write letters, and translate
                    for him. He lived also some time with Sir Samuel Luke, a gentleman of an ancient
                    family in Bedfordshire, and a famous commander under Oliver Cromwell; and he is
                    supposed at this time to have written, or at least to have planned, his
                    celebrated <hi rend="italic">Hudibras,</hi> and under that character to have
                    ridiculed the knight. The poem itself furnishes this key in the first canto,
                    where Hudibras says</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> 'Tis sung, there is a valiant Mameluke </l>
                    <l part="N"> In foreign land yclep’d — — </l>
                    <l part="N"> To whom we oft have been compar’d </l>

                <p>After the Restoration, Mr Butler was appointed secretary to the Earl of Carbury,
                    lord president of Wales, who appointed him steward of Ludlow Castle when the
                    court was revived there. No one proved a more generous friend to him than the
                    Earl of Dorset and Middlesex, to whom it was owing that the court relished his
                    <hi rend="italic">Hudibras,</hi> He had promises of a good place from the Earl
                    of Clarendon, but they were never accomplished; though the king was so much
                    pleased with the poem as often to quote it pleasantly in conversation. It is
                    indeed said that Charles ordered him the sum of L.3000; but the sum being
                    expressed in figures, somebody through whose hands the order passed reduced it,
                    by cutting off a cypher, to L.300, and though it passed the offices without
                    fees, it proved not sufficient to pay what he then owed; so that Butler was not
                    a shilling the better for the king’s bounty. He died in 1680; and, though he met
                    with many disappointments, he was never reduced to any thing like want, nor did
                    he die in debt. Mr Granger observes, that Butler “stands without a rival in
                    burlesque poetry. His <hi rend="italic">Hudibras”</hi> he adds, “is in its kind
                    almost as great an effort of genius as the <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>
                    itself. It abounds with uncommon learning, new rhymes, and original thoughts.
                    Its images are truly and naturally ridiculous. There are many strokes of
                    temporary satire, and some characters and allusions which cannot be discovered
                    at this distance of time.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Butler,</hi><hi rend="italic">Joseph,</hi> Bishop of Durham,
                    a prelate distinguished by his piety and learning, as well as by the depth and
                    originality of his metaphysical and ethical views, was the youngest son of Mr
                    Thomas Butler, a respectable shopkeeper at Wantage, in Berkshire, where he was
                    born in the year 1692. His father, who was a Presbyterian, observing that he had
                    a strong inclination to learning, sent him from a grammar-school where he had
                    been placed, to an academy in Gloucestershire, in order to qualify him for a
                    dissenting minister; and while there he wrote some remarks on Dr Clarke’s first
                    sermon at Boyle’s lecture. Afterwards, resolving to conform to the established
                    church, he studied at Oriel College, where he contracted an intimate friendship
                    with Mr Edward Talbot, son of the Bishop of Durham, and brother to the lord
                    chancellor, who laid the foundation of his subsequent advancement. Soon after
                    his admission into the university he took orders, and in 1718 he was appointed
                    preacher at the Rolls Chapel. He held this situation for about eight years, when
                    he published a volume of sermons delivered in that chapel, which elevated him to
                    great reputation as a profound and original thinker. The Bishop of Durham
                    bestowed upon him the rectory of Haughton, and afterwards that of Stanhope,
                    where he resided a considerable time, entirely devoted to the duties of his
                    pastoral functions. Through the recommendation of his friend and fellow-student
                    Secker, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, he was in 1733 nominated chaplain
                    to the Lord Chancellor Talbot; and a prebend in the church of Rochester followed
                    this appointment. He now took the degree of LL.D., and in 1736 was appointed
                    clerk of the closet to the queen, whom he attended every day by her majesty’s
                    special command, from seven till nine in the evening. In the same year he
                    published his celebrated work <hi rend="italic">The Analogy of Religion, Natural
                    arid Revealed, to the Constitution and Course of Nature,</hi> which is allowed
                    to be the most original and profound work in any language on the philosophy of
                    religion, and has accordingly placed the author in the first rank of deep and
                    comprehensive thinkers. In 1738 Dr Butler was promoted to the bishopric of
                    Bristol, on the recommendation of Queen Caroline, who had a philosophical taste,
                    and highly esteemed this distinguished philosopher. Two years afterwards he was
                    made Dean of St Paul’s, when he resigned the living of Stanhope. In the year
                    1746 he was appointed clerk of the closet to the king, and in 1750 he obtained
                    his highest preferment, the bishopric of Durham. This rich benefice he, however,
                    enjoyed but a short time; for he died at Bath on the 16th of June 1752. His
                    corpse was interred in the cathedral at Bristol, where there is a monument, with
                    an inscription, erected to his memory. Dr Butler died a bachelor. His profound
                    and comprehensive mind appears sufficiently in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sermons</hi> at the Rolls Chapel, and in his celebrated work on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Analogy of Religion.</hi> An account of his character as a
                    philosopher has been drawn with great ability and discrimination by Sir James
                    Mackintosh, in his Dissertation on the Progress of Ethical Philosophy, prefixed
                    to this work. See vol. i. p. 343.</p>
