                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    learned divine, and one of the original writers of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Biographia Britannica,</hi> was born at London, July 5, 1704, in the parish of
                    St Andrew, Holborn, of which parish his father was minister. At an early age he
                    was sent to Eton School, where he soon distinguished himself by the acuteness of
                    his genius and the studiousness of his disposition. Being superannuated on this
                    foundation, he removed about 1722 to the university of Cambridge; and, for the
                    sake of scholarship, entered himself of Caius College. Here two of the principal
                    objects of his attention were the acquisition of knowledge of the modern
                    languages, and the study of the mathematics, under the famous Professor
                    Sanderson. In May 1727, Mr Broughton, after taking the degree of bachelor of
                    arts, was admitted to deacon’s orders, and in the succeeding year was ordained
                    priest, and proceeded to the degree of Μ. A. At this time he removed from the
                    university to the curacy of Offley in Hertfordshire. In 1739 he was instituted
                    to the rectory of Stepington, otherwise Stibington, in the county of Huntingdon,
                    on the presentation of John duke of Bedford, and was appointed one of that
                    nobleman’s chaplains. Soon afterwards he was chosen reader to the Temple, by
                    which means he became known to Bishop Sherlock, then master of it, and who
                    conceived so high an opinion of our author’s merit, that in 1744 this eminent
                    prelate presented Mr Broughton to the valuable vicarage of Bedminster, near
                    Bristol, together with the chapels of St Mary Redcliff, St Thomas, and Abbot’s
                    Leigh annexed. Some short time afterwards he was collated, by the same patron,
                    to the prebend of Bedminster and Redcliff, in the cathedral of Salisbury. Upon
                    receiving this preferment he removed from London to Bristol, where he married
                    the daughter of Thomas Harris, clerk of that city, by whom he had seven
                    children, six of whom survived him. Here-sided on his living till his death,
                    which happened on the 21st December 1774, in the seventy-first year of his age.
                    He was interred in the church of St Mary Redcliff.</p>
                <p>From the time of Mr Broughton’s quitting the university till he was considerably
                    advanced in life, he was engaged in a variety of publications, of which a list
                    is given in the <hi rend="italic">Biographia Britannica,</hi> second edition.
                    Some little time before his death he composed “a short view of the principles
                    upon which Christian churches require, of their respective clergy, subscription
                    to established articles of religion but this work never appeared in print. He
                    possessed, likewise, no inconsiderable talent for poetry, as is evident from
                    many little fugitive pieces in manuscript, found among his papers; and
                    particularly from two unfinished tragedies, both written at the age of
                    seventeen. He was a great lover of music, particularly the ancient; which
                    introduced him to the knowledge and acquaintance of Mr Handel, whom he furnished
                    with the words for many of his compositions. In his public character Mr
                    Broughton was distinguished by an active zeal for the Christian cause, joined
                    with a moderation of mind. In private life he was devoted to the interests and
                    happiness of his family; and was of a mild, cheerful, and liberal temper. In
                    1778 a posthumous volume of sermons, on select subjects, was published by his
                    son, the Rev. Thomas Broughton, Μ. A. of Wadham College, Oxford.</p>
