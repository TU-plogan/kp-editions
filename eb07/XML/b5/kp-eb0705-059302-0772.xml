                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    Auguste</hi></label>, a distinguished French naturalist, born at Montpellier on
                    the 28tb February 1761. His father was a respectable schoolmaster in that town,
                    who, perceiving the avidity with which he received instruction of every kind,
                    took pains to store his mind with knowledge at an early age. It appears from his
                    writings that he was at first educated for the medical profession. The opinion
                    entertained in the university of the success with which he pursued his studies,
                    was proved by his being appointed to fill a professor’s chair when he was only
                    eighteen years of age. So great, indeed, was the reputation he had acquired,
                    that when he offered himself as candidate a few years afterwards for a seat in
                    the Aca-lemy of Sciences, he was elected a member by an unanimous vote; a
                    circumstance which had hitherto been without example since the foundation of
                    that learned body. Botany seems to have been the science to which be was at
                    first chiefly devoted; and he laboured with much zeal to establish the system of
                    Linnaeus in France. In pursuit of this great object, and with the view of
                    extending his mowledge of the science, he visited Paris, and studied θ <hi

                    1782 an honorary member of the Royal Society. It was also at this period that he
                    published at London his work on <hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> s</hi><hi

                    perpetual secretary to the Society of Agriculture, an office which the intendant
                    Berthier de Sauv⅛n <hi rend="subscript"> v</hi> purposely resigned that it might
                    be filled by Broussonet.</p>
                <p>A life thus dedicated to the pursuits of science was not likely to be chequered
                    by any remarkable vicissitude. But the revolution, which soon broke out in
                    France, and for a long time unhinged all the ordinary relations of society, had
                    already involved in its vortex not only the ambitious and the turbulent spirits
                    of the nation, but also the peaceful votaries of science. In 1789 he was
                    nominated a member of the Electoral College of Paris, an office which required
                    him to serve as magistrate whenever his colleagues were in need of assistance in
                    the exercise of their functions. On the first day when he was called upon this
                    duty, as he was proceeding to the Hotel de Ville, he had the misfortune to see
                    his friend and protector Berthier barbarously murdered by the populace. His own
                    life was frequently exposed to great danger during the tumults that ensued, and
                    when he had the charge of superintending the supply of provisions for the
                    capital. In 1791 he had a seat in the legislative assembly; but, disgusted with
                    politics, he quitted Paris the year following, and repaired to his native city.
                    Persecution followed him in his retreat, and he was glad to effect his escape to
                    Madrid, after encountering many dangers. But though well received and liberally
                    assisted by the literati of that city, the malignity of the French emigrants,
                    who could not. pardon his having held any office under the revolutionary
                    government, still pursued him, and drove him from Spain, and afterwards from
                    Lisbon, where he had sought another asylum. He at last went out as physician to
                    an embassy which the United States sent to the emperor of Morocco. He was
                    furnished with the means of equipping himself by the generous assistance of Sir
                    Joseph Banks, who, informed of his distresses, nobly sent him a credit for
                    L.1000. After residing for some time at Morocco, during which he lost no
                    opportunity of pursuing his favourite science, be obtained from the French
                    directory permission to return to France; and he was appointed by them consul at
                    the Canaries, in which capacity he resided for two years at Teneriffe. On his
                    return in 1797 lie was chosen member of the institute, and was reinstated in his
                    botanical professorship at Montpellier, with the direction of the botanical
                    garden. He was afterwards elected a member of the legislative body, and died of
                    apoplexy on the 27th July 1807. France is indebted to him for the introduction
                    of the Merino sheep and Angola goats.</p>
