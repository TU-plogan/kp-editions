                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">BYZANTIUM</label>, an ancient city of Thrace, situated on the
                    Bosphorus. It was founded, according to Eusebius, about the thirtieth Olympiad,
                    when Tullus Hostilius reigned in Rome. But, according to Diodorus Siculus, the
                    foundations of this metropolis were laid in the time of the Argonauts, by one
                    Bysas, who then reigned in the neighbouring country, and from whom the city was
                    called <hi rend="italic">Pyzantium.</hi> This Bysas, according to Eustathius,
                    arrived in Thrace a little before the Argonauts came into those seas, and
                    settled there with a colony of Megarenses. But Velleius Paterculus ascribes the
                    founding of Byzantium to the Milesians, while Ammianus Marcellinus attributes it
                    to the inhabitants of Attica. Some ancient medals of Byzantium, however, bear
                    the name and head of Bysas, with the prow of a ship on the obverse. The year
                    after the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, Byzantium was reduced into the form
                    of a Roman province. In <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 193 the city took part
                    with Niger against Severus, and was strongly garrisoned by Niger, as being a
                    place of the utmost importance. But it was soon afterwards invested by Severus;
                    and as he was universally hated on account of his cruelty, the inhabitants
                    defended themselves with the greatest resolution. Having been supplied with a
                    great number of warlike machines, most of them invented and built by Periscus, a
                    native of Nicaea, and the greatest engineer of his age, they for a long time
                    baffled all the attempts of the assailants, killed great numbers of them,
                    crushed such as approached the walls with large stones; and when stones began to
                    fail, they discharged the statues of their gods and heroes as missiles against
                    the enemy. But at last they were obliged to submit, through famine, after having
                    been reduced to the necessity of devouring one another. The conqueror put all
                    the magistrates and soldiers to the sword; but he spared the engineer Periscus.
                    Before this siege Byzantium was the greatest, wealthiest, and most populous city
                    of Thrace. It was surrounded by walls of an extraordinary height and breadth,
                    defended by a great number of towers, seven of which were built with such art
                    that the least noise heard in one of them was immediately conveyed to all the
                    rest. Severus, however, no sooner became master of the place, than he commanded
                    it to be laid in ashes. The inhabitants were stripped of all their effects, and
                    publicly sold as slaves, whilst the walls were levelled with the. ground. But
                    from the chronicle of Alexandria we learn, that soon after this terrible
                    catastrophe Severus himself caused a great part of the city to be rebuilt,
                    calling it <hi rend="italic">Antonia,</hi> after his son Caracalla, who assumed
                    the surname of Antoninus. In <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 262, the tyrant
                    Galienus wreaked his fury on the inhabitants of Byzantium. He intended to
                    besiege it, but on his arrival despaired of being able to make himself master of
                    so strong a place. He was, however, admitted next day into the city; and,
                    without any regard to the terms agreed on, he caused the soldiers and all the
                    inhabitants to be put to the sword. Trebellius Pollio says, that not a single
                    person was left alive. What reason there was for such an extraordinary massacre
                    we are nowhere informed. In the wars between the Emperors Licinius and Maximin
                    the city of Byzantium was obliged to submit to the latter, but it was soon
                    afterwards recovered by Licinius. In the year 323, it was taken from Licinius by
                    Constantine the Great, who in 330 enlarged and beautified it, with a design to
                    make it the second, if not the first city in the Roman empire. He began with
                    extending the walls of the ancient city from sea to sea; and whilst some of the
                    workmen were busied in rearing these defences, others were employed in raising
                    within them a great number of stately buildings, amongst which was a palace
                    nowise inferior in extent and magnificence to that of Rome. He built a capital
                    and an amphitheatre, and constructed a circus maximus, several forums, porticos,
                    and public baths. He divided the whole city into fourteen regions or wards, and
                    granted the inhabitants many privileges and immunities. By these means Byzantium
                    became one of the most flourishing and populous cities of the empire. Vast
                    numbers of people flocked thither from Pontus, Thrace, and Asia, as Constantine,
                    by a law enacted <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 330, had decreed that no person
                    who had lands in those countries should be at liberty to dispose of them, or
                    even to leave them to his proper heir at his death, unless such heir had a house
                    in the new city. But however desirous the emperor might be that his city should
                    be filled with people, he did not care that it should be inhabited by any but
                    Christians. He therefore caused the idols, to be pulled down, and the temples to
                    be consecrated to the true God. Besides, he built an incredible number of
                    churches, and caused crosses to be erected in all the squares and publicplaces.
                    ..When most of the buildings were finished, he caused the city to be solemnly
                    dedicated to the Virgin Mary, according to Cedrenus, but according to Eusebius,
                    to the God of Martyrs. At the same time Byzantium was declared equal in rank to
                    Rome; and similar rights, immunities, and privileges were granted to its
                    inhabitants, with those enjoyed by the metropolis. Constantine established a
                    senate and other magistrates, with power and authority equal to those of old
                    Rome; and he took up his residence in the new city, changing its name to <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Constantinople.</hi></p>
