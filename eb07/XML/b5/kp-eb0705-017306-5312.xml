                <p><label type="entry">BRADY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Robert</hi></label>, a physician
                    and historian of the seventeenth century, was born in the county of Norfolk, and
                    admitted into Caius College, Cambridge, in 1643. He took his degree of bachelor
                    of physic in 1653, was created doctor in that faculty in 1660, and the same year
                    elected master of his college in pursuance of the king’s mandate to that effect.
                    In 1685 he received the appointment of keeper of the records in the Tower of
                    London, and soon after was chosen regius professor of physic in the University
                    of Cambridge. In 1679 he wrote a letter to Dr Sydenham on the influence of air,
                    which was published among the works of that learned person. But his largest and
                    most considerable performance was <hi rend="italic">An Introduction to the old
                    English History,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A Complete History of England from

                    II.,</hi> in three volumes folio, usually bound in two. In his Introduction Dr
                    Brady maintains, first, that the representatives of the Commons in parliament,
                    knights, citizens, and burgesses, were not introduced until the forty-ninth of
                    Henry III.; secondly, that William Duke of Normandy made an absolute conquest of
                    the nation; and, thirdly, that the succession to the crown of England is
                    hereditary, descending to the nearest blood, and not elective ;—principles which
                    -were afterwards adopted by Hume as the basis of his History. In the year 1681
                    Brady was chosen one of the representatives<pb break="no" facs="nls:193735325"

                    parliament which met at Oxford; and again, 1685, in the parliament of James II.,
                    to whom he afterwards became physician in ordinary. But the Revolution put a
                    stop to his public career, and he died in August 1700, immediately after the
                    publication of his History. Dr Brady’s other productions were, 1. An Answer to
                    Mr Petyt’s Book on Parliaments, London, 1681, 8vo; and, 2. An Historical

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Brady,</hi><hi rend="italic">Nicholas,</hi> an English
                    divine, the son of Nicholas Brady, an officer of the king’s army in the civil
                    war, was born at Bandon in the county of Cork in October 1659. He continued in
                    Ireland till he was twelve years of age; at which period he was sent over to
                    England, entered at Westminster School, and thence in due time removed to Christ
                    Church, Oxford, where he remained about four years. He then returned to Dublin,
                    where his father resided, and immediately commenced bachelor of arts at Trinity
                    College, which afterwards, on his attaining due standing, presented him with a
                    diploma conferring the degree of doctor in divinity. His first ecclesiastical
                    preferment was to a prebend in the Cathedral of St Barry at Cork, to which he
                    was collated by Bishop Wettenhall. He was a zealous promoter of the Revolution,
                    and suffered in consequence. When the troubles broke out in Ireland in 1690,
                    Brady, by his influence, thrice prevented the burning of the town of Bandon,
                    after as many orders had been issued for its destruction; and the same year,
                    being deputed by the people of Bandon, he went over to England to solicit
                    parliament for the redress of some grievances they had suffered while King James
                    was in Ireland. What success attended this mission we know not; but Brady soon
                    afterwards, quitting his preferments in Ireland, settled in London, where he was
                    chosen minister of St Catherine Cree Church, and lecturer of St Michael’s
                    Wood-street. He subsequently became minister of Richmond in Surrey, and
                    Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, and at length rector of Clapham in Surrey,
                    which, together with his living of Richmond, he held till his death. He was also
                    chaplain to the Duke of Ormond’s troop of horse-guards, and to their majesties
                    King William and Queen Mary. He died in May 1726, aged sixty-six. Dr Brady was
                    accounted a man of an agreeable temper, and had the reputation of being a polite
                    gentleman, an excellent preacher, and an indifferent poet. His name is familiar
                    as the translator, in conjunction with Mr Tate, of a new version of the Psalms,
                    which was licensed in 1696. He also translated Virgil’s Aeneid, published by
                    subscription in 1726, in four vols. 8vo; and a tragedy entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Pape, or the Innocent Imposture,</hi> both very indifferent
                    performances. His prose works consist of Sermons, three volumes of which were
                    published by himself, and other three by his eldest son, who was a clergyman at
                    Tooting in Surrey.</p>
