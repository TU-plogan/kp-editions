                    rend="italic">sepher,</hi> is very common in Scripture, and has several
                    significations.</p>
                <p>It signifies, first, a clerk, writer, or secretary. This was a very considerable
                    employment in the court of the kings of Judah, in which the Scripture often
                    mentions the secretaries as the first officers of the crown. Seraiah was scribe
                    or secretary to King David (2 Sam. viii. 17). Shevah and She-maiah exercised the
                    same office under this prince (2 Sam. XX. 25). In Solomon’s time we find
                    Elihoreph and Ahia secretaries to that sovereign (1 Kings iv. 4); Shebna under
                    Hezekiah (2 Kings xix. 2); and Shaphan under Josiah (2 Kings xxii. 8). As there
                    were but few in those times that could write well, the employment of a scribe or
                    writer was very considerable.</p>
                <p>Secondly, a scribe is put for a commissary or muster-master of an army, who makes
                    the review of the troops, keeps the list or roll, and calls them over. Under the
                    reign of Uzziah king of Judah, there is found Jeil the scribe, who had under his
                    hand the king’s armies (2 Chron, xxvi. 11); and at the time of the captivity, it
                    is said the captain of the guard, among other considerable persons, took the
                    principal scribe of the host, or secretary at war, which mustered the people of
                    the land (2 Kings xxv. 19).</p>
                <p>Thirdly, scribe is put for an able and skilful man, a doctor of the law, a man of
                    learning that understands affairs. Jonathan, David’s uncle by the father’s side,
                    was a counsellor, a wise man, and a scribe ( 1 Chr. xxvii. 32). Baruch, the
                    disciple and secretary to Jeremiah, is called a scribe (Jer. xxxvi. 26); and
                    Ezra is celebrated as a skilful scribe in the law of his God (Ezra vii. 6). The
                    scribes of the people, who are frequently mentioned in the Gospel, were public
                    writers and professed doctors of the law, which they read and explained to the
                    people. Some place the original of the scribes under Moses; but their name does
                    not appear until under the judges. It is said that, in the wars of Barak against
                    Sisera, “out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle
                    the pen of the writer” (Judges V. 14). But others think that David first
                    instituted them when he established the several classes of the priests and the
                    Levites. The scribes were of the tribe of Levi; and at the time that David is
                    said to have made the regulations in that tribe, we read that six thousand men
                    of them were constituted officers and judges (1 Chr. xxiii. 4), among whom it is
                    reasonable to think that the scribes were included. For in 2 Chr. xxiv. 6, we
                    read of Shemaiah the scribe, one of the Levites; and in Chr. xxxiv. 13, we also
                    find it written, “Of the Levites that were scribes and officers.”</p>
                <p>The scribes and the doctors of the law, in the Scripture phraseology, mean the
                    same thing. And as the whole religion of the Jews at that time consisted chiefly
                    in pharisaical traditions, and in the use that was made of them to explain the
                    Scripture, the greatest number of the doctors of the law, or of the scribes,
                    were Pharisees; and we almost always find them joined together in Scripture.
                    Each of them valued themselves upon their knowledge of the law, and upon their
                    studying and teaching it (Mat. xxii. 52). They had the key of knowledge, and sat
                    in Moses’s chair (Mat. xxiii. 2). Epiphanius, and the author of the Recognitions
                    imputed to St Clement, reckon the scribes among the sects of the Jews; but it is
                    certain that they formed no sect by themselves, and were only distinguished by
                    their study of the law.</p>
