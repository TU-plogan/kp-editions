                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">SALLUSTIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">C. Crispus</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated Latin historian, was born of a plebeian family of Amiternum, a city
                    of the Sabines, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 86, the same year that Marius
                    died. We can have no doubt that the cultivation of his mental powers must have
                    been carefully attended to, though this does not seem to have prevented him from
                    falling into all the extravagances and dissipation of a profligate age. His
                    intrigue with Fausta, daughter of Sulla, and wife of Milo, became known to her
                    husband, and was punished in a way which made the two parties irreconcileable
                    enemies. Sallust became quaestor at the age of twenty-seven, and tribune of the
                    people in the year <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 52. His profligacy, however,
                    became so notorious, that the censors, Appius Claudius and L. Piso, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 50, found it necessary to remove him from the
                    senate, though his removal has been ascribed by others to political reasons, as
                    he was a warm supporter of Caesar. It is supposed that he at this time wrote his
                    account of the conspiracy of Catiline. His absence from public affairs continued
                    only for a short time, as we find him praetor, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0674-0620"/> he accompanied Caesar to Africa; and after the
                    battle of Thepsa, he was appointed to the province of Numidia, where he enriched
                    himself by the most nefarious means. He returned to Rome with immense wealth;
                    and after the murder of Caesar abstained from taking any part in public affairs.
                    He again devoted himself to a life of pleasure, and constructed a magnificent
                    palace on the Quirina), in the midst of gardens which were afterwards known as
                    the Horti Sallustiani. This palace was subsequently occupied by Vespasian,
                    Nerva, and many other emperors, and was destroyed by fire when Rome was
                    plundered by Alaric. According to Eusebius, Sallust was married to Terentia,
                    wife of Cicero, and died <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 35, in the fifty-first
                    year of his age, being not less distinguished for his talents than for his
                    profligacy. Of his historical works the following remain: 1. Bellum
                    Catilinarium, a history of the conspiracy of Catiline, B. c. 63, with a very
                    beautiful introduction, in which he laments, with much apparent feeling, the
                    corruption of the age, and the profligacy of his contemporaries; 2. Bellum
                    Jugurthinum, a history of the wars carried on against Jugurtha, king of Numidia,
                    which he was probably induced to write from his residence in that country; 3.
                    Historiarum Libri Quinque, a work on the history of Rome, from the consulship of
                    M. AEmilius Lepidus and Q. Lutatius Catulus, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 78,
                    to that of M. AEmilius Lepidus and L. Volcatius Tullus, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.
                    c.</hi> 66, with an introduction on the manners and government of Rome, and a
                    short summary of the wars of Marius and Sulla. Of this work only a few fragments
                    have been preserved. Some other works, however, have come down to us, which are
                    ascribed to Sallust, though without sufficient reason: 1. Duae Orationes de
                    Republica Ordinanda, addressed to Julius Caesar when he was proceeding against
                    Petreius and Afranius, in Spain; and, 2. Declamatio in Ciceronem, which is
                    alluded to by Quintilian. The character of Sallust as a historian stood high
                    among the ancients, who regarded him as the rival of Thucydides, and in many
                    points he was certainly the imitator of that writer. Like Thucydides, he
                    endeavours to give the causes of the various events which he is narrating; and
                    if he more frequently ascribes them to unworthy motives, we may readily discover
                    the reason of this in the corruption of the age in which he lived. But they both
                    show themselves profound thinkers, and intimately acquainted with the springs of
                    human action. The first edition of the works of Sallust was published in Rome in
                    1470, and in Venice the same year; but since that time a variety of editions
                    have appeared. The best is that of C. H. Frotscher, giving the notes and
                    emendations of Cortius, three vols. Lips. 1380, 8vo. C. Sallustii Histor. iii.
                    fragmenta e cod. Vatic, edita ab. Angelo Maio, editio auction et emendation,
                    curante J. Th. Kreissig, Misen. 1830.</p>
