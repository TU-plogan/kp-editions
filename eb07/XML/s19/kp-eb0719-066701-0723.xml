                <p><label type="entry">SAXONY</label>, one of the provinces of the kingdom of
                    Prussia. It has been formed out of several of the hereditary states of the
                    monarchy, and also by the addition of the territory of some mediatized princes,
                    and in a great measure by extensive parts of the kingdom of Saxony which were
                    transferred to Prussia by the negotiations for the general peace of 1814. The
                    parts then conveyed from Saxony were the duchy of that name and its province of
                    Thuringia. The actual province now extends in north latitude from 50° 27' to 53°
                    5', and in east longitude from 9° 44' bo 13° 58', being 9902 square miles. The
                    division of the province is into three governments, assuming the names of the
                    cities where the several administrative boards are established, viz. Magdeburg,
                    Merseburg, and Erfurt. The population amounted in 1817 to 1,214,219, but had,
                    like that of the other parts of Prussia, increased so as to amount in 1831,
                    according to the census at the end of that year, to 1,449,587. Of these persons,
                    two thirds adhere to the Lutheran church, and the other third are mostly
                    Catholics, but with a small number of other protestant sects, and some Jews. The
                    Catholics are chiefly found in the circles of Upper and Lower Reichsfeld, and in
                    that of Erfurt.</p>
                <p>The greater part of the province is a plain, with a few undulations; but on the
                    western side, in the circles of Merseburg and Erfurt, are the Thuringian Hills,
                    which are elevated but fertile, and include a part of the Hartz Forest, which is
                    mountainous and woody. The whole is well watered by various small rivulets,
                    which form the rivers Mulda, Saale, Ohre, Aland, Black-Alster, and Havel, all of
                    which run through the Elbe to the German Ocean. There are three canals, viz. the
                    Plauen, which unites the Havel with the Elbe, which is about twenty miles in
                    length, and is used for navigation; the Shiffigraben, between Magdeburg and
                    Brunswick, which is chiefly constructed for draining a rich tract of land; and
                    the Flossgraben, in Merseburg, which connects the Elster and the Pegau, and is
                    chiefly used for floating timber. The rivers, lakes, and ponds are very fully
                    stocked with a variety of fishes.</p>
                <p>No part of Germany is better cultivated than this province, and as the land is of
                    a moderate quality, it yields abundant crops, and is considered as the granary
                    of the Prussian dominions. The number of sheep is very great, and the wool of
                    them, which has been much improved of late years, both supplies the home
                    manufacturers, and also exports much to other countries. The inhabitants are
                    industrious, cleanly, and temperate, like all the Saxons; and there is the
                    appearance of ease in the villages and towns, where the manufacture of linens
                    and woollens is the usual employment. There are mines, in that part which is
                    within the Hartz, that produce silver, copper, iron, and coals; but the most
                    productive of the mines are those of salt, which are found at a great depth in
                    various parts of the province, and supply abundance of culinary salt when
                    refined.</p>
                <p>The country of Saxony is remarkable for bcing∙ the cradle of the present English
                    nation; but concerning the Saxons themselves previous to that period, we have
                    very few particulars. The Saxons, says Mr Whitaker, have been derived by our
                    historians from very different parts of the globe; India, the north of Asia, and
                    the forests of Germany. Their appellation, too, has been equally referred to
                    very different causes; the name of their Indian progenitor, the plundering
                    disposition of their Asiatic fathers, and the short, hooked weapons of their
                    warriors. But the real origin of the Saxons, and the genuine derivation of their
                    name, seem to be different.</p>
                <p>In the earlier period of the Gallic history, the Celtae of Gaul crossed the Rhine
                    in considerable numbers, and planted various colonies in the regions beyond it.
                    Thus the Volcae Tectosages settled on one side of the Hercynian Forest and about
                    the banks of the Neckar; the Helvetii upon another and about the Rhine and
                    Maine; the Boii beyond both; and the Senones in the heart of Germany. Thus also
                    we see the Treviri, the Nervii, the Suevi, and the Marcomanni, the Quadi, the
                    Venedi, and others in that country, all plainly indicated as Gallic nations, by
                    the Gallic appellations which they bear, and all together possessing the
                    greatest part of it. And, even as late as the conclusion of the first century,
                    we find one nation on the eastern side of this great continent actually speaking
                    the language of Gaul, and another upon the northern side using a dialect nearly
                    related to the British. But as all the various tribes of the Germans are
                    considered by Strabo as <hi rend="italic">γεvησιoι</hi> Γ <hi rend="italic"
                    >αλαται,</hi> or genuine Gauls in their origin, so those particularly that lived
                    immediately beyond the Rhine, and are asserted by Tacitus to be indubitably
                    native Germans, are expressly denominated Γ <hi rend="italic">αλαται</hi>, or
                    Gauls, by Diodorus, and declared by Dio to have been from the earliest period
                    distinguished by the equivalent appellation of <hi rend="italic">Celtae.</hi>
                    And the broad line of nations which extended along the ocean, and reached to the
                    borders of Scythia, was all known to the learned in the days of Diodorus by the
                    same significant appellation of Γ <hi rend="italic">αλαται</hi>, Gauls.</p>
                <p>Of these the most noted were the Sicambri and Cimbri, the former being situated
                    near the channel of the Rhine, and the latter inhabiting the peninsula of
                    Jutland. The denominations of both declare their original, showing them to have
                    been derived from the common stock of the Celtae, and to be of the same Celtic
                    kindred with the Cimbri of our Somersetshire, and the Cymbri or Cambrians of our
                    Wales. The Cimbri are accordingly denominated Celtae by Strabo and Appian; and
                    they are equally asserted to be Gauls by Diodorus, descendants of that nation
                    which sacked the city of Rome, plundered the temple of Delphi, and subdued a
                    great part of Europe and some of Asia.</p>
                <p>Immediately to the south of these were the Saxons, extending from the isthmus of
                    the Chersonesus to the current of the Elbe; and they were equally Celtic in
                    their origin as their neighbours. They were denominated Ambrones as well as
                    Saxons; and as such, they are included by Tacitus under the general appellation
                    of <hi rend="italic">Cimbri,</hi> and comprehended in Plutarch under the equal
                    one of <hi rend="italic">Cello-Scythoe.</hi> The name of Ambrones appears
                    particularly to have been Gallic, being common to the Saxons beyond the Elbe,
                    and the Ligurians in Cisalpine Gaul; as both found to their surprise, on the
                    irruption of the former into Italy with the Cimbri. And, what is equally
                    surprising, and has been equally unnoticed by the critics, the Welsh distinguish
                    England by the name of <hi rend="italic">Loegr</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Liguria,</hi> even to the present moment. In that irruption these Saxons,
                    Ambrones, or Ligurians, composed a body of more than thirty thousand men, and
                    were principally concerned in cutting to pieces the large armies of Manlius and
                    Caepio. Nor is the appellation of Saxons less Celtic than the other. It was
                    originally the same with the Belgic Suessones of Gaul; the capital of that tribe
                    being now entitled Soisons by the French, and the name of the Saxons pronounced
                    Saisen by the Welsh, Sason by the Scotch, and Sasenach by the Irish. And the
                    Suessones or Saxones of Gaul derived their own appellation from the position of
                    their metropolis on a river, the stream at Soisons being now denominated the
                    Aisne, and formerly the Axon; Uesson or Axon importing only waters or a river,
                    and S-uess-on or S-ax-on on the waters or the river. The<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=724" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0724-0668"/>
                    Suessones, therefore, arc actually denominated the Ues-sones by Ptolemy, and the
                    Saxones are actually entitled the Axones by Lucan.</p>
                <p>These, with their brethren and allies the Cimbri, having been more formidable
                    enemies to the Romans by land, than the Samnites, Carthaginians, Spaniards,
                    Gauls, or Parthians, in the second century applied themselves to navigation, and
                    became nearly as terrible by sea. They soon made themselves known to the
                    inhabitants of the British isles by their piracies in the northern channels, and
                    were denominated by them Lochlyn or Lochlynach; <hi rend="italic">lued-lyn</hi>
                    signifying the people of the wave, and the <hi rend="italic">d</hi> being
                    quiescent in the pronunciation. They took possession of the Orkney Islands,
                    which were then merely large shoals of sand, uncovered with wood, and overgrown
                    with rushes; and they landed in the north of Ireland, where they ravaged the
                    country. Before the middle of the third century they made a second descent upon
                    the latter, disembarked a considerable body of men, and designed the absolute
                    subjection of the island. Before the conclusion of it, they carried their naval
                    operations to the south, infested the British channel with their little vessels,
                    and made frequent descents upon the coasts. And in the fourth and fifth
                    centuries, acting in conjunction with the Picts of Caledonia and the Scots of
                    Ireland, they ravaged all the eastern and south-eastern shores of Britain, began
                    the formal conquest of the country, and finally settled their victorious
                    soldiery in Lancashire.</p>
                <p>In the course of time these barbarous tribes were civilized, and settled in their
                    lands, on which they began to exercise their industry in cultivation, and in
                    various manufactures for their own convenience. Their possessions extended from
                    beyond the north-western part of Germany to the southern extremity of the
                    Erzgebirge, and were denominated the Duchy of Saxony, forming one of the most
                    powerful German states, which was governed till the commencement of the tenth
                    century by various Vandal houses, when Henry I. took from them the land lying
                    between the Saale and the Elbe, and founded for its protection the margravate of
                    Meissen, which was governed at first by various houses, but latterly became
                    hereditary in the Askanian family. When the duchy of Saxony was taken from Henry
                    the Lion, in the twelfth century, it was split into so many parts, that Bernhard
                    of Askania, who succeeded to this duchy, being unable to procure any thing but
                    the mere title, transferred the name of Saxony to the lands which he already
                    possessed, and which still constitute a principal part of the present kingdom.
                    After the death of Bernhard, and the extinction of his family, Frederick,
                    landgrave of Thuringia, succeeded in the year 1423 to his titles and property.
                    In 1485, however, his family divided itself into two distinct lines; the elder,
                    or Ernestine, which possessed Thuringia and the electorship, and the younger, or
                    Albertine, which possessed Meissen and the title of duke.</p>
                <p>In the year 1547, Frederick the Magnanimous was made prisoner, and forced to
                    resign a great part of his territory and his electorship to his cousin Maurice,
                    of the Albertinian line; and thus the kings of Saxony are descended from the
                    younger of the Thuringian family. In 1697, the royal family went over to the
                    Catholic church, in the reign of Augustus I. and thereby procured for a season
                    the crown of Poland.</p>
                <p>During the early stages of the French revolution, Saxony took little or no part
                    in the struggle, and only as a member of the Germanic empire furnished the
                    contingent of troops required by that relation, which were withdrawn when
                    Prussia formed a combination of the northern states of Germany to counteract the
                    confederation which France had formed in the southern states. To this extent
                    Saxony was in alliance with Prussia when France, in 1806, began the war with
                    that power. At the decisive battle of Iena, in October of that year, a body of
                    twenty thousand Saxons were joined to the Prussian army. The complete victory of
                    Napoleon in duced the Duke of Saxony to conclude a peace with him, and to become
                    a member of the Rhenish confederation, of which the French emperor was
                    acknowledged the protector.</p>
                <p>In July 1807, the peace of Tilsit, between Russia, France, and Prussia, was
                    concluded. In conformity with its conditions, the whole of the dominions of
                    Prussia on the left bank of the Elbe, including the strong fortresses which
                    commanded the passages over that river, were ceded to Saxony, and the duke was
                    acknowledged as king. A part also of Poland, which at the last division of that
                    country had been shared by Prussia, was, with the capital, erected into a grand
                    duchy, called by the name of Warsaw, and the sovereignty of it was conferred on
                    the king of Saxony. After the peace between Austria and France, which followed
                    the battle of Wagram, the newly-created grand duchy of Warsaw was extended by
                    additions from Austria of West Gallicia and the city of Cracow, with the vast
                    salt mines of Wielicsla, whilst to the Saxon crown there were conveyed some
                    portions of the kingdom of Bohemia.</p>
                <p>When Napoleon declared war with Russia in 1812, the Saxon capital was the spot on
                    which the several monarchs of Europe were assembled to pay homage to him whose
                    dependents they had become. In the grand army that invaded Russia, the troops of
                    the king of Saxony formed a part of the right wing, and advanced into Russia.
                    They had little opportunity of distinguishing themselves, and after the burning
                    of Moscow retired to their own country.</p>
                <p>When in the following year the French army advanced into Germany to oppose the
                    Russians and Prussians, the king of Saxony treated with Austria, with the
                    pretext that it was only for the purpose of obtaining a peace. He declared his
                    own neutrality, and gave orders to his general, Thielman, to refuse admission to
                    the troops of any of the belligerent parties into his fortress of Torgau on the
                    Elbe. While these negotiations with Austria were proceeding, the king left
                    Dresden, and repaired first to Ratisbon, and from thence to Prague, whilst the
                    French general Davoust entered his capital. About five weeks afterwards (2d
                    May), Napoleon had gained a battle at Lutzen, over the united army of Russia and
                    Prussia. Upon this the French emperor, who by the victory was master of Leipsig,
                    and the whole of the king’s dominions, peremptorily demanded by a special
                    messenger to Prague, “Je veux que le roi se déclare; je saurai alors ce que
                    j’aurai à faire; mais s’il est contre moi, il perdra tout ce qu’il a.” This
                    determined the conduct of the king. He returned to Dresden. His forces joined
                    the French army, and the troops of that nation occupied Torgau and the other
                    fortresses. His troops joined those of Napoleon in the successful resistance of
                    the attack by the Russians and Prussians on Dresden, when the French general
                    Moreau was killed; and at length, after an armistice, proceeded to Leipsig with
                    the French. At the fatal battle before that city on the 19th of October, when
                    the French retreated, the king was left in that city, where he was made a
                    prisoner by the confederate armies of Austria, Russia, Prussia, and Sweden, and
                    was removed to Berlin. The king remained under restraint from October 1813 till
                    June 1815; whilst the allied powers were fully occupied, first, in annihilating
                    the government of Napoleon, then in quelling his attempts to resume that power,
                    and, finally, in settling the arrangements which the state of Europe demanded.
                    At the congress of Vienna, the first intention seems to have been to depose the
                    king of Saxony, and allot to other powers the whole of the territory; but
                    gradually a more tender feeling prevailed. He was compelled to sign a treaty
                    soon after Napoleon had arrived in Paris from Elba, by which he consented to the
                    partition of his dominions, and joined his forces to those of the allies then
                    advancing towards France.</p>
                <p>By the partition Prussia received from Saxony more in extent than one half of its
                    territory, and somewhat less than half as regarded the number of inhabitants.
                    The loss most<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=725"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0725-0669"/> lamented was that of the province of Saxony, the
                    cradle of the reigning dynasty, which was 5700 square miles in extent, and
                    contained 875,000 inhabitants. Among the subjects of regret, the greatest was
                    the loss of those portions of the kingdom which chiefly supplied the corn, the
                    wood, and the salt.</p>
                <p>Amidst the calamities that had been endured, not a complaint was made by the
                    subjects against their monarch. They were universally satisfied, that in all the
                    changes, he had acted more out of regard to the happiness of his people than his
                    own aggrandisement; and when he returned from his captivity to Dresden, he was
                    received with the affectionate feeling which would be displayed in a domestic
                    circle, when the virtuous head of a family returned home among scenes of
                    distress and common suffering. The country was at that time, from having been so
                    long occupied by numerous armies of various nations, in a most dreadful state of
                    poverty, disease, and moral depravity; but the return of peace, the restoration
                    of the monarch, and the confidence reposed in his goodness and wisdom, produced
                    in a very short time a wonderful effect. Order and credit in the finances were
                    first established, and the fruitful soil, by the application of the skill and
                    industry for which the natives are distinguished, soon produced abundance of the
                    necessaries of life; by breeding fine-woolled sheep, the means of restoring that
                    manufacture was effected; and the surplus wool being exported, brought in return
                    much real wealth. The fabrics of linen, cotton, iron, and other goods, were much
                    extended, whilst the great fairs at Leipsig became two central points yearly for
                    beneficial commerce with foreign countries. As the tranquillity gradually
                    produced prosperity, judicious improvements were made in the establishments for
                    the education of the common people, as well as for the training of the medical
                    students, of the civil and military engineers, and of the higher branches of
                    knowledge. The king lived to a great age, the last twelve years of which were
                    attended with improvements in every public department, and exhibited among all
                    classes, whether agricultural, commercial, mining, or manufacturing, an advance
                    which excited surprise in all who attentively watched its steps, and inspired
                    that mutual confidence between the king and the people, which was retained till
                    his death in 1827. The progress was continued under the successor of the king
                    till the year 1831. At that time the revolution in France, which expelled the
                    elder branch of the Bourbons, was felt in every part of Germany, and excited
                    popular tumults. Dresden had its share, and a mob destroyed one or two of the
                    inferior public buildings. It was, however, soon suppressed, by the discharge of
                    a good but unpopular minister, by the division of the states into two chambers,
                    and other trifling alterations. From that period peace has continued and
                    prosperity has advanced.</p>
                <p>The kingdom of Saxony, in its present state, is a compact and connected
                    territory. It extends from 28° 5’ to 31° 13' east longitude, and from 50° 10' to
                    51° 31' north latitude. It is bounded on the north and north-east by Prussia, on
                    the south-east and south by Austria, on the south-west by Bavaria, on the west
                    by the principality of Reus and the duchy of Saxe-Gotha, and on the north-west
                    by Prussia. By a recent arrangement it has been divided into four circles, and
                    these again are subdivided into amts or bailiwicks in the following manner:</p>

                <p>The northern part of the kingdom of Saxony is for the most part a level or an
                    undulating country; but on the south it is very mountainous. The mountains rise
                    in three successive ridges, denominated the Vorgeberg, Mithelgeberg, and
                    Hochgeberge; the southernmost of these, bordering on Bohemia, is the loftiest.
                    The highest points of these mountains are those of the Fichtelberg, 3730 feet;
                    Auersberg, 2931 feet; the Lausche, 2400 feet; and Hochwald, 2299 feet.</p>
                <p>A part of this mountainous district, between Dresden and Bohemia, usually
                    denominated Saxon Switzerland, has peculiar charms for the lovers of picturesque
                    scenery. It is about twenty-eight miles in length and twenty-three in breadth,
                    displaying deep chasms bordered by perpendicular rocks, some naked, and others
                    clothed with every variety of trees. Rapid streams pour from declivities,
                    forming cascades in some parts, and in others, in deep vales, meandering through
                    verdant meadows, without their issue or their egress being discoverable by the
                    observer from the precipices which enclose such recesses, and whence he can see
                    no path by which the vales can be reached. Through this mass of mountains the
                    river Elbe has worn itself a passage, by a most tortuous course, and washes the
                    bases of rocks, in some parts of near a thousand feet in perpendicular height,
                    from the summit of which that stream appears to the beholder as an insignificant
                    rivulet. From the surface of this mountain plain rise pinnacles of rocks, on
                    which castles in the feudal times were erected, some of the ruins of which add
                    to the romantic grandeur of the prospect; whilst others, such as Königstein and
                    Litherstein, have had applied to them all the arts of modern fortification, and
                    are the most impregnable fortresses in the Saxon dominions. Königstein
                    especially, though, from its great height, it appears to terminate in a point,
                    has on its apex strong walls, surrounding buildings in which the treasures of
                    the crown are secured in times of danger, with ground to yield potatoes enough
                    to feed the garrison, as that vegetable grows there to perfection, though, from
                    being fourteen hundred feet in height, the rigid cold of winter is most severely
                    felt This fortress, and that of Lillienstein on the opposite side of the Elbe,
                    are considered as the keys to Bohemia. Few spots in Europe create greater
                    interest in the geologist the botanist or the lover of picturesque scenery, than
                    this portion of the country so appropriately denominated Saxon Switzerland.</p>
                <p>The principal river of Saxony, and that to which almost all the others contribute
                    their streams, though not till it has left this kingdom, is the Elbe. It enters
                    from Bohemia, and is navigable for barges through the whole of its Saxon course.
                    The other rivers are the Black Elster, which rises in Lusatia, and soon enters
                    the Prussian territory; and the Spree, which comes out of Bohemia, divides
                    itself into two<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=726"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0726-0670"/> branches near Bautzen, and then passes into
                    Prussia. These ' rivers fall into the Elbe on its right bank. On the left bank
                    it receives the Moldau, which has two sources in Bohemia, and in Saxony unites
                    with the Zwichau, and runs parallel to the Elbe till it joins that stream at
                    Dessau. The White Elster rises in Voightland, with many curvatures reaches the
                    suburbs of the city of Leipsig, and, receiving there the small river Pleisse,
                    falls into the Saale, and is ultimately lost in the Elbe above Magdeburg. The
                    only river that does not run to the Elbe is the Neisse, which rises in the
                    eastern corner of the kingdom, and, passing into Silesia, is at length emptied
                    into the Oder. There are no lakes in Saxony, nor any canals, except such as are
                    used in the mining districts for conveying the ore to the mills.</p>
                <p>As compared with most parts of Germany, the agriculture of Saxony is much
                    advanced. Wherever the soil is capable of cultivation, it is worked with
                    diligence; and the more hilly and poorer soils have a good herbage, and yield
                    pasture to numerous flocks and herds. The sides of the mountains towards the
                    Elbe, from Pirna to Meissen, are covered with vines which yield both red and
                    white wine; the former from the vicinity of Pilnitz and Loschwitz, and the
                    latter from that of Hoflasnitz, are the most valued; but the great portion of
                    the Saxon wines is of a very indifferent quality. The best of them are produced
                    from the vineyards belonging to the king; and though they are sold at the
                    highest prices, it is very doubtful if the expenses of cultivation, and the rent
                    which might be obtained for the land, do not exceed what is produced by the sale
                    of the wines.</p>
                <p>The whole of Saxony is highly productive of fruit, and the care and skill
                    exercised in its cultivation is amply rewarded. Great destruction to the
                    fruit-trees took place during the tremendous military conflicts of which the
                    country was the theatre; but still the orchards and gardens are very extensive,
                    and new trees, planted since the wasting warfare of 1813, are beginning to yield
                    their products. The calamities which proved injurious to the fruit-trees have
                    lessened the number of cattle of every description; in the year 1817, in many
                    districts of the circle of Meissen, not a single head of cattle was to be found.
                    The bee-hives were destroyed by the same events; but the traces of these
                    calamities have now disappeared, and the remembrance of them is scarcely
                    adverted to by the rising generation. The sheep were preserved by being driven
                    to the mountains, and since the war have vastly multiplied; and the fineness of
                    the wool, for the sake of which they are chiefly kept, has been most wonderfully
                    increased, and excels the finest wools of Spain.</p>
                <p>The arable land is chiefly cultivated on a three-course system, consisting of a
                    fallow, winter sown grain, and spring sown grain. In some cases there is a
                    fallow crop of flax, hemp, or potatoes. The winter corn that succeeds is
                    generally rye, and sometimes, though less extensively, wheat; the summer corn
                    which follows is chiefly oats, and sometimes barley. The greater part of the
                    arable land is in common fields, held under a feudal tenure, over which the lord
                    of the manor has the right of depasturing his flocks between the harvest and the
                    next seed time. The farming occupations are generally very small, and the
                    increase of grain throughout the whole kingdom is said not to average more than
                    five to one. The culture of potatoes has been very much extended of late years,
                    and forms almost exclusively the food of the labouring classes in the
                    mountainous districts. Tobacco, hemp, flax, wood, hops, and chiccory, are grown
                    in some parts of the kingdom, but neither of them to the extent which the
                    ∞nsumption of the country requires. The woods of the kingdom, since the
                    separation of its best portions, are insufficient to furnish the inhabitants
                    with the necessary fuel; and though abundance of coal is found near Dresden, it
                    is of so sulphureous a nature as to be deemed unwholesome, and is used only by
                    those who are unable to pay the high price for wood which its scarcity has
                    created.</p>
                <p>Saxony abounds in minerals, and though the veins in general are far from being of
                    great thickness, the ore is tolerably rich; which, added to superior skill and
                    economy in working the mines and separating the metals, makes them very
                    beneficial to the crown, to whom the greater portion of them belong. The
                    mineralogical school of Freyberg has had a wonderful influence, not only in
                    Saxony, but in all parts of the world, in increasing the knowledge and in
                    improving the practice of the operative labourers in the mining art. The annual
                    produce of the silver-mines is about 400,000 ounces; and besides this, they
                    yield copper, lead, tin, iron, sulphur, quicksilver, bismuth, arsenic, and coal.
                    Gold is found in very small quantities.</p>
                <p>In no part of the Continent has manufacturing industry been carried to so great
                    an extent, or occupied so large a proportion of the population, as in Saxony.
                    Before the separation from it of the most productive agricultural provinces, it
                    was calculated that two fifths of the inhabitants were employed in manufactures;
                    but since that unfortunate event, it is estimated that three fifths are occupied
                    in commerce and manufactures, and only two fifths in agriculture. It is by the
                    extent of its manufactures alone that the country can be furnished with the
                    means of paying for those articles of the first necessity, of which a
                    sufficiency is not now produced within it. The provinces which supplied com,
                    fuel, and salt, have been ceded to Prussia, and those articles must be paid for
                    by the sales of the minerals and manufactures. During the continuance of
                    Napoleon’s continental system, the Saxon manufacturers enjoyed a most extensive
                    trade, and the encouragement thus obtained gave an impulse which directed the
                    efforts and the capital of the country towards their perfection; but the
                    division of labour was not carried to such an extent, nor was the application of
                    machinery so generally adopted, as to enable them to withstand the competition
                    with British goods, which peace introduced into many of those markets that they
                    had before almost exclusively supplied. It would include almost the whole
                    catalogue of European manufactures to enumerate the respective kinds of goods
                    made in Saxony. Woollens, linens, cottons, and silks for clothing; iron, brass,
                    and copper wares; paper, leather, earthenware, hats, musical instruments, and
                    turnery ware; various chemical and dyeing preparations; clocks, watches, swords,
                    guns, and pistols, are all comprehended in the list of Saxon manufactures.</p>
                <p>The commerce of a country whose inhabitants are chiefly occupied in manufactures,
                    and produce an insufficiency of food for their own consumption, must necessarily
                    be extensive. The trade of Saxony chiefly centres in the city of Leipsig,
                    whence, at the time of the two annual fairs, the greater part of the
                    manufactures are disposed of, and contracts are made for such foreign
                    commodities as the supply of the country demands. As the fairs of
                    Frankfort-on-the-Maine precede, and those of Frankfort-on-the-Oder follow, the
                    fairs of Leipsig, some portion of the trade is carried on by those channels. The
                    roads leading to Leipsig are generally good, and trains of waggons loaded with
                    goods are at all times to be seen proceeding to and from that place; many of
                    which come from Flanders, Holland, Hamburg, and Brunswick, on one side, and from
                    Russia, Poland, and even Turkey, on the other. At the fairs of Leipsig the new
                    books printed in most parts of Germany are brought for publication. There the
                    publishers meet and exchange the works of one part of the country, where the
                    German language is spoken, with those of another. So extensive is this trade,
                    that it is said the commissions on it to the brokers and merchants of Leipsig
                    amount to more than 40,000 rix-thalers a year. The whole sales at the fairs in
                    that city are estimated, including the exports and imports, at about 20,000,000
                    rix-thalers, or more than L.3,000,000 sterling. Saxony disposes, in this<pb

                    and thread lace, yam and worsted, ironmongery, cutlery, and braziery, and also
                    books. It receives in return corn, wine, salt, wood, and colonial wares.
                    Although the river Elbe is navigable from the ocean to the interior of Saxony,
                    it is only used for the conveyance of the heaviest goods, and for them but
                    partially. It is found that the tolls on that river, with the risk of damage and
                    of robbery, make it more advantageous to convey commodities by land than by
                    water.</p>
                <p>The government is a monarchy hereditary in the Saxon Albertine line, and in
                    failure of that, in the Ernestine or Saxe-Weimar branch of the family. The
                    monarchy may be called limited; but the limitations are of such a nature that
                    the liberties of the people have been more secured by the mildness of the
                    reigning family than by any restrictions that the states have or could exercise.
                    The king enjoys the whole executive power, confirms pardons, bestows
                    commissions, nominates the supreme judges, and enjoys the power of making peace
                    and war, and of concluding all treaties. In making new laws, and in imposing new
                    taxes, the states have the right to be consulted. According to the ancient
                    constitution, which is still adhered to, the states are constituted of various
                    elements; and, in fact, are an amalgamation of various corporations, each of
                    which thinks only of its own peculiar interests, and contrives to cast the
                    weight of all public burdens from the cities and the nobles, who are
                    represented, to the country people, who have no voices. The assembly consists,
                    first, of members chosen by the provincial representatives of the nobility;
                    secondly, of the representatives of the prelates, who, before the Reformation,
                    had seats, but who have since been chosen by the higher class of nobles in right
                    of their possessing certain estates of which the prelates were deprived; and,
                    thirdly, the university of Leipsig. These states represent only the circles of
                    Meissen, Leipsig, Erzgebirge, and Voightland; for that of Lausatia has its own
                    peculiar assembly of states, which differs but little from those of the other
                    four, except that the members from the land possessors must have at least
                    sixteen quarterings in their coats of arms. When the king pleases, these states
                    are convoked; but as it has not been found necessary to impose new taxes, or to
                    make alterations in the laws, they have seldom been assembled, and their session
                    has usually been very short. The administration is conducted by a cabinet
                    council, under which, through the medium of the privy council, orders are
                    communicated to the departments of finance, war, domains, police, and foreign
                    affairs..</p>
                <p>The financial affairs of the kingdom and the credit of the government have
                    rapidly improved. According to the budget of 1837, the income, a great part of
                    which is derived from the estates of the crown, amounted to 5,194,873
                    rix-thalers, valued at about three shillings each. The expenditure amounted to
                    the same sum, but in that was included 145,424 thalers appropriated to a reserve
                    fund to meet unforeseen contingencies, 321,545 thalers to pay the interest of
                    the debt, and 171,806 thalers which forms a sinking fund to extinguish the debt,
                    which, at the rate now proceeding, a few years will accomplish, as at the close
                    of the war it was near L.4,000,000 sterling, and is, according to the budget,
                    reduced to L.l,l77,740 sterling.</p>
                <p>The armed force is no more than the contingent: required from the kingdom by the
                    German Confederation. It is composed of the following arms :—</p>
                <p>The guards 370</p>
                <p>Infantry of the line 7,080</p>
                <p>Cavalry 2,066</p>
                <p>Artillery 1,032</p>
                <p>Sharp-shooters 1,454</p>
                <p>Engineers 191</p>
                <p>12,193</p>
                <p>Although the royal family profess the Catholic religion, and are zealous in
                    discharging its injunctions, the established faith is the Lutheran, and, until
                    the year 1811, no person of any other sect was eligible to seats in the several
                    corporations in the provincial or general assembly of the states. At that period
                    all sects were placed on the same footing. The whole number of Catholics is
                    about 28,000, some of whom are attached to the royal household; but most of them
                    are found among the inhabitants of the province of Lausatia. The number of
                    Protestants dissenting from the established church, including Moravians and
                    Calvinists, is not supposed to exceed two thousand. The Lutheran church is
                    governed by four consistories or assemblies of divines, differing in the number
                    of superintendents, but comprising together twenty-five of that order. The
                    Catholics in Lausatia are governed by the abbot of Bautzen, on whom the pope
                    generally bestows the title of bishop <hi rend="italic">in partibus
                    infidelium.</hi></p>
                <p>Education is well conducted in the university of Leipsig, and in the endowed
                    classical schools of Meissen, Wurzen, and Grimma, as well as in several
                    gymnasia. The popular education is not so well managed as in the other
                    Protestant German states; but some steps have been taken, and others are in
                    contemplation, which may soon make the Saxon system as effective as that of
                    Prussia. The fine arts have been cultivated with considerable success, and both
                    statuary and painting receive valuable assistance from the fine productions
                    which are contained in the collections of Dresden.</p>
