                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">SAVONAROLA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jerome</hi></label>, a
                    famous Italian monk, was born at Ferrara in 1452, being descended of a noble
                    family. At the age of twenty-two he assumed the habit of a Dominican friar,
                    without the knowledge of his parents, and distinguished himself in that order by
                    his piety and ability as a preacher. Florence was the theatre where he chose to
                    appear, and where he preached, confessed, and wrote. He had address enough to
                    place himself at the head of the faction which opposed the family of the Medici.
                    He explained the Apocalypse, and there found a prophecy which foretold the
                    destruction of his opponents. He predicted a renovation of the church, and
                    declaimed with much severity against the clergy and the court of Rome. Alexander
                    VI. excommunicated him, and prohibited him from preaching. He derided the
                    anathemas of the pope; yet he forbore for some time from preaching, and then
                    resumed his employment with more applause than before. The pope and the Medici
                    family then thought of attacking him with his own weapons. Savonarola having
                    posted up a thesis as a subject of disputation, a Franciscan, at their
                    instigation, offered to prove it heretical. The Franciscan was seconded by his
                    brother friars, and Savonarola by his; and thus the two orders were at open war
                    with each other. To settle the dispute, and to convince their antagonists of the
                    superior sanctity of Savonarola, one of the Dominicans offered to walk through a
                    fire; and in order to prove his wickedness, a Franciscan agreed to the same
                    experiment. The multitude, eager to witness so extraordinary a spectacle, urged
                    both parties to come to a decision; and the magistrates were constrained to give
                    their consent. Accordingly, Saturday the 7th of April 1498 was fixed for the
                    trial. On that day the champions appeared; but when they saw one another in cold
                    blood, and beheld the wood in flames, they were seized with fear, and very
                    anxious to escape, by any subterfuge, the imminent danger into which they had
                    rashly thrown themselves. The Dominican pretended he could not enter the flames
                    without the host in his hand. This the magistrates obstinately refused to allow;
                    and the Dominican’s fortitude was not put to the test The Franciscans incited
                    the multitude against their opponents, who accordingly assaulted their
                    monastery, broke open the gates, which were shut against them, and entered by
                    force. Upon this, the magistrates thought it necessary to bring Savonarola to
                    trial as an impostor. He was put to the torture and examined, and the answers
                    which he gave fully evinced that he was both a cheat and a fanatic. He boasted
                    of having frequent conversations with God, and he found his brother friars
                    credulous enough to believe him. One of the Dominicans who had shared in his
                    sufferings, affirmed that he saw the Holy Ghost in the shape of a dove, with
                    feathers of gold and silver, twice in one day alight on the shoulder of
                    Savonarola and peck his ear; and he pretended also that he had violent combats
                    with demons. John Francis Picus, count of Mirandola, who wrote his life, assures
                    us that the devils which infested the convent of the Dominicans trembled at the
                    sight of Friar Jerome, and that out of vexation they always suppressed some
                    letters of his name in pronouncing it He expelled them from all the cells of the
                    monastery. When he went round the convent sprinkling holy water to defend the
                    friars from the insults of the demons, it is said that the evil spirits spread
                    thick clouds before him to prevent his passage. At length, the Pope Alexander
                    VI. sent the chief of the Dominicans, with Bishop Romolino, to degrade him from
                    holy orders, and to deliver him up to the secular judges with his two fanatical
                    associates. They were condemned to be hanged and burned on the 23d of May 1498.
                    Savonarola submitted to the execution of the sentence with great firmness and
                    devotion, and without uttering a word respecting his guilt or his innocence. He
                    was in the forty-sixth year of his age. His works have been published at Leyden
                    in six vols, 12mo.</p>
