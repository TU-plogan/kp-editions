                <p><label type="entry">SACRIFICE</label>, an offering made to God on an altar, by
                    means of a regular minister, as an acknowledgment of his power, and a payment of
                    homage. Sacrifices, though the term is sometimes used for all the offerings made
                    to God, or in any way devoted to his service and honour, differ from mere
                    oblations in this, that in a sacrifice there is a real destruction or change of
                    the thing offered; whereas an oblation is only a simple offering or gift,
                    without any such change at all. Thus, all sorts of tithes and first fruits, and
                    whatever of men’s worldly substance is consecrated to God, for the support of
                    his worship and the maintenance of his ministers, are offerings or oblations;
                    and these, under the Jewish law, were either of living creatures or other
                    things; but sacrifices, in the more peculiar sense of the term, were either
                    wholly or in part consumed by fire. They have by divines been divided into
                    bloody and unbloody. Bloody sacrifices were made of living creatures; unbloody,
                    of the fruits of the earth. They have also been divided into expiatory,
                    impetratory, and eucharistical. The first kind were offered to obtain of God
                    forgiveness of sins; the second to procure some favour; and the third to express
                    thankfulness for favours already received. Under one or other of these heads may
                    all sacrifices be arranged; though we are told that the Egyptians had six
                    hundred and sixty-six different kinds, a number surpassing all credibility.</p>
                <p>Concerning the origin of sacrifices very various opinions have been held. By
                    many, the Phoenicians are supposed to have been the authors of them, though
                    Porphyry attributes their invention to the Egyptians; and Ovid imagines, from
                    the import of the terms <hi rend="italic">victim</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >hostia,</hi> that no bloody sacrifices were offered until wars prevailed in the
                    world, and nations obtained victories over their enemies. These are mere
                    hypotheses, contradicted by the most authentic records of antiquity, and
                    entitled to no regard.</p>
                <p>By modern dcists, sacrifices are said to have had their origin in superstition,
                    which operates much in the same way in every country. It is therefore weak,
                    according to these men, to derive this practice from any particular people,
                    since the same mode of reasoning would lead various nations, without any
                    intercourse with each other, to entertain the same opinions respecting the
                    nature of their gods, and the proper means of appeasing their anger. Men of
                    gross conceptions imagine their deities to be, like themselves, covetous and
                    cruel. They are accustomed to appease an injured neighbour by a composition in
                    money; and they endeavour to compound in the same manner with their gods, by
                    rich offerings to their temples and to their priests. The most valuable property
                    of a simple people is their cattle. These offered in sacrifice are supposed to
                    be fed upon by the divinity, and are actually fed upon by his priests. If a
                    crime is committed which requires the punishment of death, it is accounted
                    perfectly fair to appease the deity by offering one life for another; because,
                    by savages, punishment is considered as a debt, for which a man may compound in
                    the best way that he can, and which one man may pay for another. Hence, it is
                    said, arose the absurd notions of imputed guilt and vicarious atonement. Among
                    the Egyptians a white bull was chosen as an expiatory sacrifice to their god
                    Apis. After being killed at the altar, his head was cut off and cast into the
                    river, with the following execration: “May all the evils impending over those
                    who perform this sacrifice, or over the Egyptians in general, be averted on this
                    head.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Herodotus, lib.
                    ii.</p></note></p>
                <p>Had sacrifice never prevailed in the world but among such gross idolaters as
                    worshipped departed heroes, who were supposed to retain in their state of
                    deification all the passions and appetites of their mortal state, this account
                    of the origin of that mode of worship would have been to us perfectly
                    satisfactory. We readily admit that such mean notions of their gods may have
                    actually led far distant tribes, who could not derive any thing from each other
                    through the channel of tradition, to imagine that beings of human passions and
                    appetites might be appeased or bribed by costly offerings. But we know, from the
                    most incontrovertible authority, that sacrifices of the three kinds that we have
                    mentioned were in use among people who worshipped the true God, and who must
                    have had very correct notions of his attributes. Now we think it impossible that
                    such notions could have led any man to fancy that the taking away of the life of
                    a harmless animal, or the burning of a cake or other fruits of the earth in the
                    fire, would be acceptable to a Being self-existent, omnipotent, and omniscient,
                    who can neither be injured by the crimes of his creatures, nor receive any
                    accession of happiness from a thousand worlds.</p>
                <p>Sensible of the force of such reasoning as this, some persons of great name, who
                    admit the authenticity of the Jewish and Christian Scriptures, and firmly rely
                    on the atonement made by Christ, arc yet unwilling to allow that sacrifices were
                    originally instituted by God. Of this way of thinking were St Chrysostom,
                    Spencer, Grotius, and Warburton, as were likewise the Jews Maimonides, R. Levi,
                    Ben Gcrson, and Abarbanel. The greater part of these writers maintain that
                    sacrifices were at first a human institution; and that God, in order to prevent
                    their being offered to idols, introduced them into his service, though he did
                    not approve of them as good in themselves, or as proper rites of worship. That
                    the infinitely wise and good God should introduce into his service improper
                    rites of worship, appears to us so extremely improbable, that we cannot but
                    wonder how such an opinion should ever have found its way into the minds of such
                    men as those who held it Warburton’s theory of sacrifice is much more plausible,
                    and worthy of particular examination.</p>
                <p>According to this ingenious prelate, sacrifices had their origin in the
                    sentiments of the human heart, and in the ancient mode of conversing by action
                    in aid of words. Gratitude to God' for benefits received is natural to the mind
                    of man, as well as his bounden duty. “This duty,” says the bishop,<note

                    />ferer’s bringing the first fruits of pasturage or agriculture to that
                    sequestered place where the Deity used to be more solemnly invoked, at the
                    stated times of public worship; and there presenting them in homage, with a
                    demeanour which spoke to this purpose: 'I do hereby acknowledge thee, O my God,
                    to be the author and giver of all good; and do now, with humble gratitude,
                    return my warmest thanks for these thy blessings particularly bestowed upon
                    me.’” Things thus devoted became thenceforth sacred; and to prevent their
                    desecration, the readiest way was to send them to the table of the priest, or to
                    consume them in the fire of the altar. Such, in the opinion of our author, was
                    the origin of eucharistical sacrifices. Impetratory or precative sacrifices had,
                    he thinks, the same origin, and were contrived to express by action an
                    invocation for the continuance of God’s favour. “Expiatory sacrifices,” says the
                    same learned prelate, “were in their own nature as intelligible, and in practice
                    as rational, as either of the other two. Here, instead of presenting the first
                    fruits of agriculture and pasturage, in corn, wine, oil, and wool, as in the
                    eucharistical, or a portion of what was to be sown or otherwise propagated, as
                    in the impetratory, some chosen animal, precious to the repenting criminal who
                    deprecates, or supposed to be obnoxious to the Deity who is to be appeased, was
                    offered up and slain at the altar, in an action which, in all languages, when
                    translated into words, speaks to this purpose: ‘I confess my transgressions at
                    thy footstool, O my God, and with the deepest contrition implore thy pardon,
                    confessing that I deserve death for those my offences.’ The latter part of the
                    confession was more forcibly expressed by the action of striking the devoted
                    animal, and depriving it of life; which, when put into words, concluded in this
                    manner: ‘ And I own that I myself deserve the death which I now inflict on this
                    animal.’”</p>
                <p>This system of sacrifice, which his lordship thinks so well supported by the most
                    early movements of simple nature, we admit to be ingenious, but by no means
                    satisfactory. That mankind in the earlier ages of the world were accustomed to
                    supply the deficiencies of their language by expressive gesticulations, we are
                    not incliped to controvert. The custom prevails among savage nations, or nations
                    half civilized, at the present day. His lordship, however, is of opinion, and we
                    heartily agree with him, that our first parents were instructed by God to make
                    articulate sounds significant of ideas, notions, and things, and not left to
                    fabricate a language for themselves. That this heaven-taught language could at
                    first be copious, no man will suppose, who thinks of the paucity of ideas which
                    those who spoke it had to express; but when we consider its origin, we cannot
                    entertain a doubt but that it was precise and perspicuous, and admirably adapted
                    to all the real purposes of life. Among these purposes must surely be included
                    the worship of God as the most important of all. Every sentiment therefore which
                    enters into worship, gratitude, invocation, confession, and deprecation, the
                    progenitors of mankind were undoubtedly taught to clothe in words the most
                    significant and unequivocal; but we know from Moses, whose divine legation the
                    bishop surely admitted, that Cain and Abel, the eldest children of our first
                    parents, worshipped God by the rites of sacrifice; and can we suppose that this
                    practice occurred to them from their having so far forgotten the language taught
                    them by their father, as to be under the necessity of denoting by action what
                    they could not express by words? If this supposition be admitted, it will force
                    upon us another still more extravagant. Even Adam himself must, in that case,
                    have become dumb in consequence of his fall; for it is not conceivable, that as
                    long as he was able to utter articulate sounds, and affix a meaning to them, he
                    would cease, in the presence of his family, to confess his sins, implore
                    forgiveness, and express his gratitude to God for all his mercies.</p>
                <p>The author, as if aware of some such objection as this, contends, that if
                    sacrifices had arisen from any other source than the light of reason, the
                    Scripture would not have been silent concerning that source; “especially since
                    we find Moses carefully recording what God immediately, and not nature, taught
                    to Adam and his family.” “Had the original of sacrifice,” says he, “been
                    prescribed and directly commanded by the Deity, the sacred historian could never
                    have omitted the express mention of that circumstance. The two capital
                    observances in the Jewish ritual were the Sabbath and sacrifices. To impress the
                    highest reverence and veneration on the Sabbath, he is careful to record its
                    divine original; and can we suppose that had sacrifices had the same original,
                    he would have neglected to establish this truth at the time that he recorded the
                    other, since it is of equal use and of equal importance? I should have said,
                    indeed, of much greater; for the multifarious sacrifices of the law had not only
                    a reference to the forfeiture of Adam, but likewise prefigured our redemption by
                    Jesus Christ.”</p>
                <p>But all this reasoning was foreseen, and completely answered, before his lordship
                    gave it to the public. It is probable, that though the distinction of weeks was
                    well known over all the eastern world, the Hebrew’s, during their residence in
                    Egypt, were very negligent in their observance of the Sabbath. To enforce a
                    religious observance of that sacred day, it became necessary to inform them of
                    the time and occasion of its first institution, that they might keep it holy in
                    memory of the creation; but, in a country like Egypt, the people were in danger
                    of holding sacrifices rather in too high than too low veneration, so that there
                    was not the same necessity for mentioning explicitly the early institution of
                    them. It was sufficient that they knew the divine institution of their own
                    sacrifices, and the purposes for which they were offered. Besides this, there is
                    reason to believe, that, in order to guard the Hebrews from the infections of
                    the heathen, the rite of sacrificing was loaded with many additional ceremonies
                    at its second institution under Moses. It might, therefore, be improper to
                    relate its original simplicity to a rebellious people, who would think
                    themselves ill used by any additional burdens of trouble or expense, however
                    really necessary to their happiness. Bishop Warburton sees clearly the necessity
                    of concealing from the Jews the spiritual and refined nature of the Christian
                    dispensation, lest such a backsliding people should, from the contemplation of
                    it, have held in contempt their own economy. This, he thinks, is the reason why
                    the prophets, speaking of the reign of the Messiah, borrow their images from the
                    Mosaic dispensation, that the people living under that dispensation might not
                    despise it from perceiving its end; and we think the reason will hold equally
                    good for their lawgiver concealing from them the simplicity of the first,
                    sacrifices, let they should be tempted to murmur at their own multifarious
                    ritual.</p>
                <p>But his lordship thinks that sacrifices had their origin from the light of
                    natural reason. We should be glad to know what light natural reason can throw
                    upon such a subject. That ignorant pagans, adoring as gods departed heroes, who
                    still retained their sensual appetites, might naturally think of appeasing such
                    beings with the fat of fed beasts, and the perfumes of the altar, we have
                    already admitted; but that Cain and Abel, who knew that the God whom they adored
                    has neither body, parts, nor passions; that he created and sustains the
                    universe; and that from his very nature he must will the happiness of all his
                    creatures, should be led by the light of natural reason to think of appeasing
                    him, or obtaining favours from him, by putting to death harmless animals, is a
                    position which no arguments of his lordship can ever compel us to admit. That
                    Abel’s sacrifice was indeed accepted, we know; but it was not accepted because
                    it proceeded from the movements of the human mind, and the deficiency of the
                    original language, but because it was offered<pb break="no"

                    through faith. The light of natural reason, however, does not generate faith,
                    but science; and when it fails of that, its offspring is absurdity. “Faith is
                    the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen,” and comes
                    not by reasoning, but by hearing. What things then were they of which Abel had
                    heard, for which he hoped, and in the faith of which he offered sacrifice?
                    Undoubtedly it was a restoration to that immortality which was forfeited by the
                    transgression of his parents. Of such redemption an obscure intimation had been
                    given to Adam, in the promise that the seed of the woman should bruise the head
                    of the serpent; and it was doubtless to impress upon his mind in more striking
                    colours the manner in which this was to be done, that bloody sacrifices were
                    first instituted. As long as the import of such rites was thus understood, they
                    constituted a perfectly rational worship, as they showed the people that the
                    wages of sin is death; but when men sunk into idolatry, and lost all hopes of a
                    resurrection from the dead, the slaughtering of animals to appease their deities
                    was a practice grossly superstitious. It rested in itself without pointing to
                    any further end, and the grovelling worshippers believed that by their
                    sacrifices they purchased the favour of their deities. When once this notion was
                    entertained, human sacrifices were soon introduced; for it naturally occurred to
                    those who offered them, that what they most valued themselves, would be most
                    acceptable to their offended gods. By the Jewish law, these abominable offerings
                    were strictly forbidden, and the whole ritual of sacrifice restored to its
                    original purity, though not simplicity.</p>
                <p>All Christian churches, the Socinian, if it can be called a church, not excepted,
                    for a long period of time agreed in believing that the Jewish sacrifices served,
                    amongst other uses, for types of the death of Christ, and the Christian worship.
                    In this belief all sober Christians agree still; whilst many are of opinion that
                    they were likewise federal rites, as they certainly were considered by the
                    ancient Romans.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>Of the various kinds of Jewish sacrifices, and the subordinate ends for which
                    they were offered, a full account is given in the books of Moses. When an
                    Israelite offered a loaf or a cake, the priest broke it in two parts, and,
                    setting aside that half which he reserved for himself, broke the other into
                    crumbs, poured oil, wine, incense, and salt upon it, and spread the whole upon
                    the fire of the altar. If these offerings were accompanied with the sacrifice of
                    an animal, they were thrown upon the victim to be consumed along with it. If the
                    offerings were of the ears of new corn, they were parched at the fire, rubbed in
                    the hand, and then offered to the priest in a vessel, over which he poured oil,
                    incense, wine, and salt, and then burned it upon the altar, having first taken
                    as much of it as of right belonged to himself.</p>
                <p>The principal sacrifices amongst the Hebrews consisted of bullocks, sheep, and
                    goats; but doves and turtles were accepted from those who were not able to bring
                    the other. These beasts were to be perfect, and without blemish. The rites of
                    sacrificing were various, all of which are minutely described in the books of
                    Moses.</p>
                <p>The manner of sacrificing amongst the Greeks and Romans was the following. In the
                    choice of the victim, they took care that it was without blemish or
                    imperfection; its tail was not to be too small at the end, the tongue not black,
                    nor the ears cleft; and that the bull was one that had never been yoked. The
                    victim being pitched upon, they gilt his forehead and horns, especially if a
                    bull, heifer, or cow. The head they also adorned with a garland of flowers, a
                    woollen infula or holy fillet, whence hung two rows of chaplets with twisted
                    ribands; and on the middle of the body a kind of stole, pretty large, hung down
                    on each side. The lesser victims were only adorned with garlands and bundles of
                    flowers, together with white tufts or wreaths.</p>
                <p>The victims thus prepared were brought before the altar, the lesser being driven
                    to the place, and the greater led by an halter; when, if they made any struggle,
                    or refused to go, the resistance was taken for an ill omen, and the sacrifice
                    frequently set aside. The victim thus brought was carefully examined, to see
                    that there was no defect in it; then the priest, clad in his sacerdotal habit,
                    and accompanied with the sacrificers and other attendants, and being washed and
                    purified according to the ceremonies prescribed, turned to the right hand, and
                    went round the altar, sprinkling it with meal and holy water, and also
                    besprinkling those who were present. Then the crier proclaimed with a loud
                    voice, Who is here? To which the people replied, Many and good. The priest then
                    having exhorted the people to join with him, by saying, Let us pray, confessed
                    his own unworthiness, acknowledging that he had been guilty of different sins,
                    for which he begged pardon of the gods, hoping that they would be pleased to
                    grant his requests, accept the oblations offered them, and send them all health
                    and happiness; and to this general form he added petitions for such particular
                    favours as were then desired. Prayers being ended, the priest took a cup of
                    wine, and having tasted it himself, caused his attendants to do the like, and
                    then poured forth the remainder between the horns of the victim. Then the priest
                    or the crier, or sometimes the most honourable person in the company, killed the
                    beast, by knocking it down, or cutting its throat. If the sacrifice was in
                    honour of the celestial gods, the throat was turned upwards towards heaven; but
                    if they sacrificed to the heroes or infernal gods, the victim was killed with
                    its throat towards the ground. If by accident the beast escaped the stroke,
                    leaped after it, or expired with pain and difficulty, it was thought to be
                    unacceptable to the gods. The beast being killed, the priest inspected its
                    entrails, and made predictions from them. They then poured wine, together with
                    frankincense, into the fire, to increase the flame, and laid the sacrifice upon
                    the altar, which in the primitive times was burned whole to the gods, and thence
                    called an holocaust; but in after times only part of the victim was consumed in
                    the fire, and the remainder reserved for the sacrificers; the thighs, and
                    sometimes the entrails, being burned to their honour, the company feasted upon
                    the rest. During the sacrifice, the priest, and the person who gave the
                    sacrifice, jointly prayed, laying their hand upon the altar. Sometimes they
                    played upon musical instruments in the time of the sacrifice, and on some
                    occasions they danced round the altar, singing sacred hymns in honour of the
                    god.</p>

                    abominable practice, about the origin of which different opinions have been
                    formed.</p>
                <p>The true account seems to be that which we have given in the preceding article.
                    When men had gone so far as to indulge the fancy of bribing their gods by
                    sacrifice, it was natural for them to think of enhancing the value of so cheap
                    an atonement by the cost and rarity of the offering; and, oppressed with their
                    malady, they never rested till they had got that which they conceived to be the
                    most precious of all, a human sacrifice. “It was customary,” says Sanchoniatbon,
                    “in ancient times, in great and public calamities, before things became
                    incurable, for princes and magistrates to offer up in sacrifice to the avenging
                    daemons the dearest of their offspring.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    every nation under heaven of which we have received any ancient account. The
                    Egyptians had it in the early part of their monarchy. The Cretans likewise had
                    it, and retained it for a long time. The nations of Arabia did the same. The
                    people of Dumah, in<pb break="no"

                    particular, sacrificed every year a child, and buried it underneath an altar,
                    which they made use of instead of an idol; for they did not admit of images. The
                    Persians buried people alive. Amestris, the wife of Xerxes, entombed twelve
                    persons quick under ground for the good of her soul. It would be endless to
                    enumerate every city, or every province, where these dire practices obtained.
                    The Cyprians, the Rhodians, the Phoceans, the Ionians, those of Chios, Lesbos,
                    Tenedos, all had human sacrifices. The natives of the Tauric Chersonese offered
                    up to Diana every stranger whom chance threw upon their coast. Hence arose that
                    just expostulation in Euripides upon the inconsistency of the proceeding.
                    Iphigenia wonders, as the goddess delighted in the blood of men, that every
                    villain and murderer should be privileged to escape, nay, to be driven from the
                    threshold of the temple; whereas, if an honest and virtuous man chanced to stray
                    thither, he only was seized upon and put to death. The Pelasgians, in a time of
                    scarcity, vowed the tenth of all that should be born to them for a sacrifice, in
                    order to procure plenty. Aristomenes the Messenian slew three hundred noble
                    Lacedaemonians, among whom was Theopompus the king of Sparta, at the altar of
                    Jupiter at Ithome. Without doubt the Lacedaemonians did not fail to make ample
                    returns; for they were a severe and revengeful people, and offered similar
                    victims to Mars. Their festival of the Diamastigosis is well known, when the
                    Spartan boys were whipped in the sight of their parents with such severity
                    before the altar of Diana Orthia, that they often expired under the torture.
                    Phylarchus, as quoted by Porphyry, affirms that of old every Grecian state made
                    it a rule, before they marched towards an enemy, to solicit a blessing on their
                    undertakings by human victims.</p>
                <p>The Romans were accustomed to the like sacrifices. They both devoted themselves
                    to the infernal gods, and they constrained others to submit to the same horrid
                    doom. Hence we read in Titus Livius, that, in the consulate of AEmilius Paulus
                    and Terentius Varro, two Gauls, a man and a woman, and two in like manner of
                    Greece, were buried alive at Rome in the ox-market, where was a place under
                    ground walled round to receive them, and which had before been made use of for
                    such cruel purposes. He says it was a sacrifice not properly Roman, that is, not
                    originally of Roman institution; yet it was frequently practised there, and that
                    too by public authority. Plutarch makes mention of a similar instance a few
                    years before, in the consulship of Flaminius and Furius. There is reason to
                    think that all the principal captives who graced the triumphs of the Romans
                    were, at the close of that cruel pageantry, put to death at the altar of Jupiter
                    Capitolinus. Caius Marius offered up his own daughter for a victim to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dii Averrunci,</hi> to procure success in a battle against the
                    Cimbri, as we are informed by Dorotheus, quoted by Clemens. It is likewise
                    attested by Plutarch, who says that her name was Calpurnia. Marius was a man of
                    a sour and bloody disposition, and had probably heard of such sacrifices being
                    offered in the enemy’s camp, among whom they were very common, or he might have
                    beheld them exhibited at a distance, and therefore murdered what was nearest,
                    and should have been dearest to him, to counteract their fearful spells, and
                    outdo them in their wicked machinery. Cicero, making mention of this custom
                    being common in Gaul, adds, that it prevailed among that people even at the time
                    he was speaking; whence we may be led to infer that it was then discontinued
                    among the Romans. And we are told by Pliny, that it had then, and not very long
                    before, been discouraged. For there was a law enacted, when Lentulus and Crassus
                    were consuls, so late as the 657th year of Rome, that there should be no more
                    human sacrifices; for till that time those horrid rites had been celebrated in
                    broad day, without any mask or control, which, had we not the best evidence for
                    the fact, would appear scarcely credible. And however they may have been
                    discontinued for a time, we find that they were again renewed, though they
                    became not so public nor so general. For not very long after this, it is
                    reported of Augustus Caesar, when Perugia surrendered, in the time of the second
                    triumvirate, that besides multitudes executed in a military manner, he offered
                    up, upon the ides of March, three hundred chosen persons, both of the equestrian
                    and the senatorial order, at an altar dedicated to the manes of his uncle
                    Julius. Even at Rome itself this custom was revived; and Porphyry assures us,
                    that in his time a man was every year sacrificed at the shrine of Jupiter
                    Latialis. Heliogabalus offered similar victims to the Syrian deity which he
                    introduced among the Romans. The same is said of Aurelian.</p>
                <p>The Gauls and the Germans were so devoted to this shocking custom, that no
                    business of any moment was transacted among them without being prefaced with the
                    blood of men. They were offered up to various gods; but particularly to Hesus,
                    Taranis, and Thautates. These deities are mentioned by Lucan, where he
                    enumerates the various nations who followed the fortunes of Caesar.</p>
                <p>The altars of these gods were far removed from the common resort of men, being
                    generally situated in the depth of woods, that the gloom might add to the horror
                    of the operation, and give a reverence to the place and proceeding. The persons
                    devoted were led thither by the Druids, who presided at the solemnity, and
                    performed the cruel offices of the sacrifice. Tacitus takes notice of the
                    cruelty of the Hermunduri, in a war with the Catti, in which they had greatly
                    the advantage, and at the close of which they made one general sacrifice of all
                    that was taken in battle. The poor remains of the legion under Varus suffered in
                    some degree the same fate. There were many places destined for this purpose all
                    over Gaul and Germany; but especially in the mighty woods of Arduenna, and the
                    great Hercynian Forest, a wild that extended above thirty days’ journey in
                    length. The places set apart for this solemnity were held in the utmost
                    reverence, and only approached at particular seasons. Lucan mentions a grove of
                    this sort near Massilia, which even the Roman soldiers were afraid to violate,
                    although commanded by Caesar. It was one of those set apart for the sacrifices
                    of the country.</p>
                <p>Claudian compliments Stilicho, that, among other advantages accruing to the Roman
                    armies through his conduct, they could now venture into the awful forest of
                    Hercynia, and follow the chase in those so much dreaded woods, and otherwise
                    make use of them.</p>
                <p>These practices prevailed among all the people of the north, of whatever
                    denomination. The Massagetae, the Scythians, the Getes, the Sarmatians, all the
                    various nations upon the Baltic, particularly the Suevi and Scandinavians, held
                    it as a fixed principle, that their happiness and security could not be obtained
                    but at the expense of the lives of others. Their chief gods were Thor and Woden,
                    whom they thought they could never sufficiently glut with blood. They had many
                    very celebrated places of worship, especially in the island Rugen near the mouth
                    of the Oder, and in Zeeland; some, too, which were very famous among the
                    Semnones and Naharvalli. But the most reverenced of all, and the most
                    frequented, was at Upsal; where there was every year a grand celebrity, which
                    continued for nine days. During this term they sacrificed animals of all sorts.
                    But the most acceptable victims, and the most numerous, were men. Of these
                    sacrifices none were esteemed so auspicious and salutary as a sacrifice of the
                    prince of the country. When the lot fell for the king to die, it was received
                    with universal acclamations and every expression of joy; as it once happened in
                    the time of a famine, when they cast lots, and it fell to King Domalder to be
                    the people’s victim. And he was accordingly put to death. Olaus Tretelger,
                    another prince, was burned alive to Woden. They did not spare<pb break="no"

                    their own children. Harald the son of Gunild, the first of that name, slew two
                    of his children to obtain a storm of wind. “He did not hesitate,” says
                    Verstegan, “to sacrifice two of his sons unto his idols, to the end he might
                    obtain of them such a tempest at sea as should break and disperse the shipping
                    of Harald king of Denmark.” Saxo-Grammaticus mentions a similar fact. He calls
                    the king Haquin; and speaks of the persons put to death as two very hopeful
                    young princes. Another king slew nine sons to prolong his own ife, in hopes,
                    perhaps, that what they were abridged of would in a great measure be added to
                    himself. Such instances, however, occur not often; but the common victims were
                    without end. Adam Bremensis, speaking of the awful grove at Upsal, where these
                    horrid rites were celebrated, says that there was not a single tree but what was
                    reverenced, as if it were gifted with some portion of divinity; and all this
                    because they were stained with gore, and foul with human putrefaction. The same
                    is observed by Scheif-for in his account of this place.</p>
                <p>The manner in which the victims were slaughtered was different in different
                    places. Some of the Gaulish nations chined them with a stroke of an axe. The
                    Celtae placed the man who was to be offered for a sacrifice upon a block or an
                    altar, with his breast upwards, and with a sword struck him forcibly across the
                    sternum; then tumbling him to the ground, from his agonies and convulsions, as
                    well as from the effusion of blood, they formed a judgment of future events. The
                    Cimbri ripped open the bowels, and from them they pretended to divine. In Norway
                    they beat men’s brains out with an ox-yoke. The same operation was performed in
                    Iceland, by dashing them out against an altar of stone. In many places they
                    transfixed them with arrows. After they were dead, they suspended them upon
                    trees, and left them to putrefy. One of the writers above quoted mentions, that
                    in his time seventy carcasses of this sort were found in a wood of the Suevi.
                    Dithmar of Mersburg, an author of nearly the same age, speaks of a place called
                    Le-dur in Zeeland, where there were every year ninety-nine persons sacrificed to
                    the god Swantowite. During these bloody festivals a general joy prevailed, and
                    banquets were most royally served. They fed, caroused, and gave a loose to
                    indulgence, which at other times was not permitted. They imagined that there was
                    something mysterious in the number nine; for which reason these feasts were in
                    some places celebrated every ninth year, in others every ninth month, and
                    continued for nine days. When all was ended, they washed the image of the deity
                    in a pool, and then dismissed the assembly. Their servants were numerous, who
                    attended during the term of their feasting, and partook of the banquet. At the
                    close of all, they were smothered in the same pool, or otherwise made away with.
                    On this Tacitus remarks, how great an awe this circumstance must necessarily
                    infuse into those who were not admitted to these mysteries.</p>
                <p>These accounts are handed down from a variety of authors in different ages, many
                    of whom were natives of the countries which they describe, and to which they
                    seem strongly attached. They would not therefore have brought so foul an
                    imputation on the part of the world in favour of which they w ere each writing,
                    nor could there be that concurrence of testimony, were not the history in
                    general true.</p>
                <p>The sacrifices of which we have been treating, if we except some few instances,
                    consisted of persons doomed by the chance of war, or assigned by lot, to be
                    offered. But among the nations of Canaan the victims were peculiarly chosen.
                    Their own children, and whatever was nearest and dearest to them, were deemed
                    the most worthy offering to their god. The Carthaginians, who were a colony from
                    Tyre, carried with them the religion of their mother-country, and instituted the
                    same worship in the parts where they settled. It consisted in the adoration of
                    several deities, but particularly of Kronus, to whom they offered human
                    sacrifices, and especially the blood of children. If the parents were not at
                    hand to make an immediate offer, the magistrates did not fail to make choice of
                    what was most fair and promising, that the god might not be defrauded of his
                    due. Upon a check being received in Sicily, and some other alarming
                    circumstances happening, Hamilcar, without any hesitation, laid hold of a boy,
                    and offered him on the spot to Kronus; and at the same time he drowned a number
                    of priests, to appease the deity of the sea. The Carthaginians another time,
                    upon a defeat of their army by Agathocles, imputed their miscarriages to the
                    anger of this god, whose services had been neglected. Touched with this, and
                    seeing the enemy at their gates, they seized at once three hundred children of
                    the prime nobility, and offered them in public for a sacrifice. Three hundred
                    more, being persons who were somehow obnoxious, yielded themselves voluntarily,
                    and were put to death with the others. The neglect of which they accused
                    themselves consisted in sacrificing children purchased of parents among the
                    poorer sort, who reared them for the purpose, and not selecting the most
                    promising and the most honourable, as had been the custom of old. In short,
                    there were particular children brought up for the altar, as sheep are fattened
                    for the shambles; and they were bought and butchered in the same manner. But
                    this indiscriminate way of proceeding was thought to have given offence. It is
                    remarkable, that the Egyptians looked out for the most specious and handsome
                    person to be sacrificed. The Albanians pitched upon the best man of the
                    community, and made him pay for the wickedness of the rest. The Carthaginians
                    chose what they thought the most excellent and at the same time the most dear to
                    them; which made the lot fall heavy upon their children. This is taken notice of
                    by Silius Italicus in his fourth book. Kronus, to whom these sacrifices were
                    exhibited, was an oriental deity, the god of light and fire; and therefore
                    always worshipped with some reference to that element.</p>
                <p>The Greeks, we find, called the deity to whom these offerings were made Agraulos;
                    and feigned that she was a woman, the daughter of Cecrops. But how came Cecrops
                    to have any connection with Cyprus? Agraulos is a corruption and transposition
                    of the original name (which should have been rendered <hi rend="italic">Uk El
                    Aur,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Uk El Aurus);</hi> but has, like many other
                    oriental titles and names, been strangely sophisticated, and is here changed to
                    Agraulos. It was in reality the god of light, who was always worshipped with
                    fire. This deity was the Moloch of the Tyrians and Canaanites, and the Melech of
                    the East; that is, the great and principal god, the god of light, of whom fire
                    was esteemed a symbol, and at whose shrine, instead of viler victims, they
                    offered the blood of men.</p>
                <p>Such was the Kronus of the Greeks and the Moloch of the Phoenicians. And nothing
                    can appear more shocking than the sacrifices of the Tyrians and Carthaginians,
                    which they performed to this idol. In all emergencies of state, and times of
                    general calamity, they devoted what was most necessary and valuable to them as
                    an offering to the gods, and particularly to Moloch. But besides these
                    undetermined times of bloodshed, they had particular and prescribed seasons
                    every year, when children were chosen out of the most noble and reputable
                    families, as before mentioned. If a person had an only child, it was the more
                    liable to be put to death, as being esteemed more acceptable to the deity, and
                    more efficacious for the general good. Those who were sacrificed to Kronus were
                    thrown into the arms of a molten idol, which stood in the midst of a large fire,
                    and was red with heat. The arms of it were stretched out, with the hands turned
                    upwards, as it were to receive them; yet sloping downwards, so that they dropped
                    from thence into a glowing furnace below. To other gods they were otherwise
                    slaughtered, and, as it implied, by the very hands of<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=661" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0661-0607"/>
                    their parents. What can be more horrid to the imagination, than to suppose a
                    father leading the dearest of all his sons to such an infernal shrine; or a
                    mother the most engaging and affectionate of her daughters, just rising to
                    maturity, to be slaughtered at the altar of Ashtaroth or Baal? Justin describes
                    this unnatural custom very pathetically:</p>
                <p>“Quippe homines, ut victimas, immolabant; et impuberes (quae actas hostium
                    misericodiam provocat)aris admovebant, pacem sanguine eorum exposcentes, pro
                    quorum vita Dii rogari maxime solent.” Such was their blind zeal, that this was
                    continually practised; and so much of natural affection still left
                    unextinguished, as to render the scene ten times more shocking, from the
                    tenderness which they seemed to express. They embraced their children with great
                    fondness, and encouraged them in the gentlest terms, that they might not be
                    appalled at the sight of the hellish process, begging of them to submit with
                    cheerfulness to this fearful operation. If there was any appearance of a tear
                    rising, or a cry unawares escaping, the mother smothered it with her kisses,
                    that there might not be any show of backwardness or constraint, but the whole
                    might be a free-will offering. These cruel endearments being over, they stabbed
                    them to the heart, or otherwise opened the sluices of life; and with the blood
                    warm as it ran, besmeared the altar and the grim visage of the idol. These were
                    the customs which the Israelites learned of the people of Canaan, and for which
                    they are upbraided by the Psalmist. “They did not destroy the nations,
                    concerning whom the Lord commanded them; but were mingled among the heathen, and
                    learned their works; yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto
                    devils, and shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their
                    daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was
                    polluted with blood. Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went
                    a-whoring with their own inventions.”</p>
                <p>These cruel rites, which were practised in so many nations, made Plutarch debate
                    with himself, “Whether it would not have been better for the Galatae, or for the
                    Scythians, to have had no tradition or conception of any superior being, than to
                    have formed to themselves notions of gods who delighted in the blood of men; of
                    gods who esteemed human victims the most acceptable and perfect sacrifice? Would
                    it not,” says he, “have been more eligible for the Carthaginians to have had the
                    atheist Critias, or Diagoras, their lawgiver, at the commencement of their
                    polity, and to have been taught that there was neither god nor demon, than to
                    have sacrificed, in the manner they were wont, to the god which they adored ?”
                    In this they acted, not as the person did whom Empedocles describes in some
                    poetry, where he exposes this unnatural custom. The sire there, with many idle
                    vows, offers up unwittingly his son for a sacrifice; but the youth was so
                    changed in feature and in figure that his father did not know him. These people
                    used knowingly and wilfully to go through this bloody work, and slaughter their
                    own offspring. Even they who were childless would not be exempted from this
                    cursed tribute; but purchased children of the poorer sort, and put them to death
                    with as little remorse as one would kill a lamb or a chicken. The mother who
                    sacrificed her child stood by, without any seeming sense of what she was losing,
                    and without uttering a groan. If a sigh did by chance escape, she lost all the
                    honour which she proposed to herself in the offering, and the child was
                    notwithstanding slain. All the time of this ceremony, whilst the children were
                    murdering, there was a noise of clarions and tabors sounding before the idol,
                    that the cries and shrieks of the victims might not be heard. “Tell me now,”
                    says Plutarch, “if the monsters of old, the Typhons and the giants, were to
                    expel the gods, and to rule the world in their stead, could they require a
                    service more horrid than these infernal rites and sacrifices ?”</p>
