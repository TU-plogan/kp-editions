                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">SALISBURY, or <hi rend="smallcaps">New Sarum</hi></label>, a
                    city in the county of Wilts, and in the hundred of Underditch. It is the shire
                    town of the county, where the assizes and the elections are held, and where, but
                    in the village of Fisherton adjoining, is the county jail. It stands in a narrow
                    valley, in which the small rivers Willy and Nadder unite with the Avon. These
                    streams are, by means of small channels, conducted through most parts of the
                    city, forming clear running brooks in several of the streets. By means of a
                    canal the city communicates with the sea through Southampton. Among the public
                    edifices for secular purposes, the most distinguished is the council-house,
                    erected about forty-five years ago. It is a square building with a grand Doric
                    portico which forms on one side the entrance to the law-courts, and on the other
                    to a large public room used for county meetings and other purposes. But the
                    public building which most distinguishes this city is the magnificent cathedral,
                    which is the most uniform structure, as well as being the most perfect and
                    original example, of all the edifices dedicated to the choral service of the
                    Church of England. The erection of it at the commencement of the reign of Henry
                    III. marks a decided epoch in English architecture, the very beautiful pointed
                    style having then been brought to its utmost perfection. A very experienced
                    critic has given it as his opinion, that this very interesting church, so
                    remarkable in its design for purity, simplicity, and grandeur, holds the same
                    rank in English architecture which the Parthenon bears in the Grecian.</p>
                <p>This edifice was founded in the year 1220, the fifth year of the reign of Henry
                    III., the see having been then removed from Old Sarum, to which place it had
                    been translated from Sherborn, in Dorsetshire, in 706, when the episcopal
                    jurisdiction of it extended over what have since become the dioceses of
                    Salisbury, Bristol, Wells, and Exeter. The extreme length of the cathedral
                    outside from west to east is 480 feet. The length of the grand transept from
                    south to north is 232 feet, and the extreme length of the eastern transept is
                    172 feet.</p>
                <p>This church has an important advantage over many other edifices of a similar
                    character, in not being so closely surrounded by other buildings. It is easy of
                    access, and it affords a most delightful view from almost every point. As to
                    outline and dimensions, a more splendid building can scarcely be imagined; while
                    the lofty proportions of the spire, which rises to the height of four hundred
                    feet, become the more striking upon a near approach. The spire is a most
                    interesting object from every part of the surrounding country. A slight
                    settlement was observed to have taken place<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=673" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0673-0619"/>
                    on the western sides of the tower, which on examination was found in 1681 to be
                    twenty-two inches out of the perpendicular, but no variation has taken place
                    since that time.</p>
                <p>By a recent act of parliament the see of Salisbury has been increased by the
                    county of Dorset, which before was within the diocese of Bristol, having been
                    added to it. The establishment of the church, besides the bishop, comprises the
                    dean, the precentor, the chancellor, three archdeacons, the sub-dean, the
                    sub-chanter, and forty-five prebendaries (six of whom being residentiary, are
                    called canons), four vicars, six singing men, eight choristers, and other
                    inferior officers. The palace of the bishop and the houses of the several
                    dignitaries surround the cathedral, in what is called the Close, being all
                    encircled with an ancient and lofty wall.</p>
                <p>The civil government of the city was in a body corporate, consisting of a mayor,
                    high steward, recorder, deputy-recorder, and twenty-four aldermen; but by the
                    late law it has been divided into three wards, having six aldermen and eighteen
                    councillors, who elect the mayor. It has also a recorder appointed by the crown.
                    The city elects two members to the House of Commons, and gives the title of
                    marquis to the family of Cecil. Salisbury was formerly celebrated for its
                    manufactories of cutlery, which have of late years declined, in consequence of
                    the powerful competition of Sheffield and Birmingham; but still some of the best
                    knives, scissors, and razors are made there, and some of the most beautiful and
                    costly ornaments in steel. There was till recently a considerable trade in
                    making flannels, especially one kind, almost wholly appropriated to the market
                    of Spain, from whence the goods were despatched to Buenos Ayres and other parts
                    of South America.</p>
                <p>Salisbury being on the high road to Exeter and to Plymouth, is a great
                    thoroughfare, and well provided with good inns, carriages, and horses. It is
                    well supplied with provisions at moderate prices, and has good markets, which
                    are held on Tuesdays and Fridays. It has a great number of charitable
                    establishments, both for the purposes of education and for the solace of old
                    age, or of infirmities of body or mind. It contains three parish churches, and
                    an appropriate number of places of worship for the various sects of dissenters.
                    It is eighty-one miles from London, and ninety from Exeter. The population
                    appears at the decennial enumerations to have amounted in 1801 to 7668, in 1811
                    to 8243, in 1821 to 8763, and in 1831 to 9876.</p>
