                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    <hi rend="italic">Henry,</hi> an eminent restorer of learning, was born at
                    Dundee in the year 1506. He traced his descent from the ancient family of the
                    Scrim-zeours of Dudhope, who obtained the office of hereditary standard-bearers
                    to the kings of Scotland in 1057.</p>
                <p>At the grammar-school of Dundee our author acquired the Greek and Latin languages
                    in an uncommon degree of perfection, and that in a shorter time than many
                    scholars of his age. At the university of St Andrews, his successful application
                    to philosophy gained him great applause. The next scene of his studies was the
                    university of Paris, and their more particular object the civil law. Two of the
                    most famous civilians of that age, Eguinard Baron and Francis Duaren,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Francis Duaren was the first
                    of the French civilians who purged the chair in the civil law schools from the
                    barbarisms of the Glossaries, in order to introduce the pure sources of the
                    ancient jurisprudence. As he did not desire to share that glory with any one, he
                    looked with an envious eye on the reputation of his colleague Eguinard Baron,
                    who also mixed good literature with the knowledge of the law. This jealousy put
                    him upon composing a work, wherein he endeavoured to lessen the esteem that
                    people had for his colleague. The maxim, <hi rend="italic">Pascitur in vivis
                    livor; post fata quiescit,</hi> was verified remarkably in him; for after the
                    death of Baron, he showed himself most zealous to eternize his memory, and was
                    at the expense of a monument to the honour of the deceased.” (See the
                    Translation of Bayle's Dictionary, of 1710, p. 1143-4.)</p></note> were then
                    giving lectures to crowded audiences at Bourges. The fame of these professors
                    occasioned his removal from Paris; and for a considerable time he prosecuted his
                    studies under their direction. At Bourges he had an opportunity of becoming
                    acquainted with the celebrated James Amiot, Greek professor in that city, well
                    known in the learned world by his translation of Plutarch’s Lives, and
                    distinguished afterwards by his advancement to great honours in the church, and
                    finally to the rank of cardinal. Through the recommendation of this eminent
                    person, Mr Scrimzeor engaged in the education of two young<pb break="no"

                    gentlemen of the name of Bucherel, whom he instructed in the belles lettres, and
                    other branches of literature calculated to qualify them for their station in
                    life.</p>
                <p>This connection introduced him to Bernard Bornetel, bishop of Rennes, a person
                    famed in the political world for having served the state in many honourable
                    embassies. Accepting an invitation from this prelate to accompany him to Italy,
                    Mr Scrimzeor greatly enlarged the sphere of his literary acquaintance, by his
                    conversation and connection with most of the distinguished scholars of that
                    country. The death of Francis Spira<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Francis Spira was a lawyer of great reputation at
                    Cittadella, in the Venetian state, about the beginning of the sixteenth century.
                    He had imbibed the principles of the Reformation, and was accused before John
                    (de la Casa, archbishop of Benevento, the pope's nuncio at Venice. He made some
                    concessions, and asked pardon of the papal minister for his errors. But the
                    nuncio insisted on a public recantation. Spira was exceedingly averse to this
                    measure; but at the pressing instances of his wife and friends, who represented
                    to him that he must lose his practice and ruin his affairs by persisting against
                    it, he at last complied. Shortly afterwards he fell into a deep melancholy, lost
                    his health, and was removed to Padua for the advice of physicians and divines.
                    But his disorders augmented, and the recantation, which he said he had made from
                    cowardice and interest, filled his mind with continual horror and remorse,
                    insomuch that he sometimes imagined that he felt the tormentβ of the damned. No
                    means being found to restore either his health or his peace of mind, in 1548 he
                    fell a victim to his miserable situation. See Collyer's Dictionary, art. <hi
                    rend="italic">Spira.</hi></p></note> happened during his visit to Padua; and as
                    the character and conduct of this remarkable person engaged at that time the
                    attention of the world, Mr Scrimzeor is said to have collected memoirs of him in
                    a publication entitled The Life of Francis Spira, by Henry of Scotland. This
                    performance, however, does not appear in the catalogue of his works.</p>
                <p>After he had stored his mind with the literature of foreign countries, and
                    satisfied his curiosity as a traveller, it was his intention to revisit
                    Scotland. He might without vanity have entertained hopes, that the various
                    knowledge which he had treasured up would win him a partial reception among his
                    countrymen. An ambition of being usefully distinguished among them as a man of
                    letters is justly supposed to have been the principal motive of his return; but
                    the most sanguine projects of life are often strangely diverted by accident, or
                    rather perhaps are invisibly turned by Providence from their natural course. Mr
                    Scrimzeor, on his journey homewards, had to pass through Geneva. His fame had
                    long forerun his footsteps. The syndics and other magistrates, on his arrival,
                    requested him to set up the profession of philosophy in that city, promising a
                    compensation suitable to the exertion of his talents. He accepted the proposal,
                    and established the philosophical chair.</p>
                <p>After he had taught for some time at Geneva, a fire broke out in the
                    neighbourhood, by which his house was consumed, and he himself reduced to great
                    distress. His pupils, the Bucherels, however, had not forgotten their
                    obligations to him, and sent a considerable sum of money to his relief.</p>
                <p>At this time flourished at Augsburg the famous mercantile family of the Fuggers.
                    Ulric Fugger was then its representative; a man possessed of prodigious wealth,
                    passionately fond of literature, a great collector of books and manuscripts, and
                    a munificent patron of learned men. Being informed, by means of his literary
                    correspondence, of the misfortune which had befallen Mr Scrimzeor in the burning
                    of his house, he immediately sent him a pressing invitation to accept an asylum
                    beneath his roof until his affairs should be re-established. Mr Scrimzeor gladly
                    availed himself of such hospitable kindness, and lost no time in repairing to
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>Whilst residing at Augsburg with Mr Fugger, he was much employed in augmenting
                    his patron’s library, by vast collections purchased from every corner of Europe.
                    Codices of the Greek and Latin authors were then of inestimable value, and seem
                    to have been more particularly the object of Mr Scrimzeor’s researches.</p>
                <p>When his manuscripts were ready for the press, he was desirous of returning to
                    Geneva to print them. His patron. Fugger, recommended him for that purpose to
                    the learned</p>
                <p>Henry Stephens, one of his pensioners, and at that time the most celebrated
                    printer in Europe.</p>
                <p>Immediately on his arrival at Geneva, 1563, he was earnestly solicited by the
                    magistrates to resume the chair of philosophy. Notwithstanding his compliance,
                    and consequently the dedication of much of his time to the study of physics, he,
                    two years afterwards, instituted a course of lectures in the civil law, and had
                    the honour of being its first founder and professor at Geneva.</p>
                <p>As soon as he had settled again in this city, he hoped, amidst his other
                    occupations, to prosecute the great object of his literary fame, the printing of
                    his various works. But a suspicion which Henry Stephens entertained, that it was
                    his intention to set up a rival press at Geneva, occasioned great dissensions
                    between them; and the result of the quarrel was, that the republic of letters,
                    during Scrimzeor’s life, was deprived of his valuable productions. At his death
                    most of them fell into the hands of Isaac Casaubon, who has been accused of
                    publishing considerable portions of them as his own.</p>
                <p>Some account of Mr Scrimzeor’s several performances will serve to convey an idea
                    of his extensive erudition.</p>
                <p>He wrote critical and explanatory notes upon Athenaeus’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Deipnosophists,</hi> or Table Conversations of Philosophers and Learned Men of
                    Antiquity, having first collated several manuscripts of his author. This work
                    Casaubon published at Leyden in 1600, but without distinguishing his own notes
                    from those of Scrimzeor.</p>
                <p>A Commentary and Emendations of the Geography of Strabo were among our author’s
                    literary remains. These were published in Casaubon’s Parisian edition of Strabo
                    in 1620. Henry Stephens, from an idea of justice due to Scrimzeor’s literary
                    fame, notwithstanding the violent animosity which had subsisted between them,
                    reproaches Casaubon for adopting, without acknowledgment, the Scottish critic’s
                    lucubrations on Strabo. Dempster assures us, that Scrimzeor, in his manuscript
                    letters, mentions his design of publishing this performance; and hence it is
                    probable that his work appeared to himself of considerable consequence, and had
                    taken up much of his attention. Although Casaubon, in his ample notes exhibited
                    at the foot of Strabo’s text, makes no confession of having derived any thing
                    from Scrimzeor, it must not be concealed, that in an epistle to Sir Peter Young,
                    the nephew of the critic through whom the Commentary and Emendations of Strabo
                    came into his hands, Casaubon acknowledges how very useful to him they might be
                    made; for, speaking there of his intended edition of Strabo, he says, “It cannot
                    be expressed how much assistance I may obtain from your notes of Scrimzeor.”</p>
                <p>Edward Herrison, a Scottish author, in his Commentary on Plutarch’s Book
                    concerning the Inconsistencies of the Stoics, informs us that Scrimzeor collated
                    different manuscripts of all the works of Plutarch. This undertaking appears
                    sufficient to occupy half the life of an ordinary critic. Every one knows how
                    voluminous an author was the philosopher, the historian, and the orator of
                    Chaeronea. Whether the learned critic meant to publish an edition of Plutarch’s
                    works is not known; but such an intention seems higly probable, from this
                    laborious enterprise of collating them.</p>
                <p>The ten books of Diogenes Laertius on the Lives, Opinions, and Apophthegms of the
                    Philosophers, were collated from various manuscripts by Scrimzeor. His
                    corrected<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=844"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0844-0780"/> text of this author, with notes full of
                    erudition, came also into Casaubon’s possession, and is supposed to have
                    contributed much to the value of his edition of the Grecian biographer, printed
                    at Paris in 1593.</p>
                <p>The works of Phornutus and Palaephatus were also among the collations of Mr
                    Scrimzeor. To the latter of these authors he made such considerable additions,
                    that the work became partly his own. These are two ancient authors who explain
                    the fables of the heathen deities. The former wrote <hi rend="italic">Be Natura
                    Deorum, seu de Fabularum Poeticarum Allegoriis Speculatio,</hi> On the Nature of
                    the Gods, or the Allegorical Fictions of the Poets. The latter entitled his book
                    <hi rend="italic">De Falsis Narrationibus,</hi> concerning False Relations.
                    These works were printed at Basil in 1570, but whether in Greek or Latin is
                    uncertain. They have been published since that time in both languages. The
                    manuscripts of them were for some time preserved in the library of Sir Peter
                    Young, after that of his uncle Scrimzeor, which was brought into Scotland in
                    1573, had been added to it. What became of this valuable bequest at the death of
                    the former is uncertain. Our learned philologer also left behind him, in
                    manuscript, the orations of Demosthenes, AEschines, and Cicero, and the
                    Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius, all carefully collated.</p>
                <p>Among his literary remains was a collection of his Latin epistles. The men of
                    letters in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries seem to have kept their
                    republic, as it is called, more united and compact than it is at present, by an
                    epistolary intercourse in the Latin language, then the universal medium of
                    literature and science.</p>
                <p>Of the many performances which had exercised his pen, it does not appear that any
                    were immediately published by himself but his Translation of Justinian’s Novels
                    into Greek. This was printed at Paris in 1558, and again with Holoan-der's Latin
                    version at Antwerp in 1575. This work has been highly extolled, both for the
                    purity of its language and the accuracy of its execution, and is likely,
                    according to some, to hold its estimation as long as any use or memory of the
                    civil law shall exist.</p>
                <p>A Latin translation of the <hi rend="italic">Basilica,</hi> or Basilics as they
                    are called by the civilians, is the last we have to mention of this author’s
                    performances. This is a collection of Roman laws, which the eastern emperors
                    Basil and Leo, who reigned in the fifth century, commanded to be translated into
                    Greek, and which preserved their authority until the dissolution of the eastern
                    empire. The Basilics comprehend the institutes, digests, code, and novels, and
                    some of the edicts of Justinian and other emperors. Of sixty original books,
                    however, forty-one only remain. Mr Scrimzeor collated them with various
                    manuscripts, probably before he commenced his translation.</p>
                <p>Different years have been assigned for the time of his death; but it appears most
                    likely, from a comparison of the different accounts of this event, that it
                    happened very near the expiration of 1571, or at the beginning of the succeeding
                    year, about the sixty-sixth year of his age. He died in the city of Geneva. The
                    characteristic features of Scrimzeor are few, but they are prominent and
                    striking. His industry and perseverance in the pursuit of knowledge and
                    erudition were equalled only by the exquisite judgment which he displayed in his
                    critical commentaries on the errors and obscurities of ancient books and
                    manuscripts.</p>
