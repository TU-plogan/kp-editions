                    an ancient family in Shropshire, was bom in 1615, and educated at Cambridge,
                    where he became eminent for his great knowledge in the oriental languages. He
                    removed to Lincoln’s Inn, where he made great progress in the study of the law;
                    and in 1644 he was admitted one of the masters in chancery, as also one of the
                    two masters of requests. In 1649 he was chosen town-clerk of London, and the
                    same year he published his Rights of the Kingdom. He was greatly esteemed by
                    Oliver Cromwell, by whose special warrant he was continued a master in chancery,
                    when their number was reduced to six. By his interest it was that the Jews
                    obtained the privilege of building for themselves a synagogue in London. In 1658
                    he was made member of parliament for Yarmouth, and next year was appointed first
                    commissioner under the great seal with Mr Taylor, Mr Whitelocke, and others, for
                    the probate of wills. In 1660 he published his <hi rend="italic">Olbia;</hi> and
                    soon after the Restoration he lost all his employments. In the fire of London in
                    1666 he was a great sufferer, which obliged him to retire to his seat of
                    Warm-well in Dorsetshire, where he lived in a private manner until 1674, when he
                    died.</p>

                    father’s side, from Sir Ralph Sadler, one of Queen Elizabeth’s ministers; and
                    his mother’s family had been French refugees at the revocation of the edict of
                    Nantes. He was educated principally at home, his father having intended him for
                    one of the learned professions; but, when about eighteen years old, he was
                    induced to join his brother in business at Leeds, where he continued until
                    called into public life by the ministerial proposal of the Catholic Relief Bill.
                    On a vacancy occurring for the borough of Newark, in March 1829, Mr Sadler,
                    being invited to become a candidate, immediately complied, and triumphantly
                    carried his election, though opposed by Mr Sergeant Wilde, one of the most able
                    and energetic members of the bar. Mr Sadler distinguished himself by a long and
                    eloquent speech delivered against the Roman Catholic claims on the 17th of the
                    same month; and during the continuance of the discussion he was the great
                    champion of the Protestant cause. At the general election of 1830, he was again
                    chosen for Newark, and in 1831 he took his seat for Aldborough in Yorkshire. At
                    the first general election under the Reform Bill, Aldborough having been
                    disfranchised, he became a candidate for the new borough of Leeds; but, though
                    highly<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=663"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0663-0609"/> esteemed by a large number of his townsmen, his
                    reputation as an anti-reformer preponderated over his less equivocal merits, and
                    he lost his election.</p>
                <p>In his public career Mr Sadler was generally associated with the old
                    constitutional Tories. We have already mentioned his strenuous opposition to the
                    Roman Catholic Relief Bill. To the policy of free trade he was also most
                    decidedly hostile; nor was he less unfriendly to the settlement of the currency
                    question, which he considered should have been effected upon a more equitable
                    adjustment. Mr Sadler was likewise very hostile to the Reform Bill, to which he
                    recorded his objections in a speech when seconding General Gascoigne’s motion,
                    the effect of carrying which was the dissolution of parliament. For Ireland he
                    always expressed the deepest interest, and twice introduced a poor-law bill for
                    that country into parliament. During the last session he sat in parliament, he
                    was almost constantly occupied in prosecuting the bill he had brought before the
                    legislature for the protection of children employed in the manufactories, and
                    which is familiarly called the Ten Hours Bill. This measure was referred to a
                    select committee, of which Mr Sadler was appointed chairman; and it is believed
                    that the fatigue and responsibility thus imposed on him, of collecting the mass
                    of evidence contained in the report, laid the foundation of his long and fatal
                    illness. Neither, after all, were his efforts successful in passing this
                    measure.</p>
                <p>Mr Sadler was some years a member of the Royal Society, and author of several
                    works, the most important of which are, 1. Ireland, its Evils, and their
                    Remedies; and, 2. An Essay on the Law of Population, in two volumes, written
                    principally to controvert the opinions of Mr Malthus. A third volume, intended
                    to complete this treatise, the author was engaged upon at the time of his death,
                    which took place at New Lodge, near Belfast, on the 29th of July 1835. Mr
                    Sadler’s disease appears to have been an incurable affection of the heart,
                    brought on by severe study and intense anxiety. At the time of his death, he was
                    the leading partner of the firm of Sadler, Fenton, and Company, of Belfast. <hi
