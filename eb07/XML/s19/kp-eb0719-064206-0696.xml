                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Santa Catharina</hi> a province of Brazil, comprehending the
                    island of the same name, and a territory of sixty leagues in length from north
                    to south on the neighbouring continent, reckoning from the Sahy Grande, which
                    separates it from St Paulo on the north, to the Mampituba, which divides it from
                    Rio Grande on the south. On the west, the heads of the Cordillera divide it from
                    the same provinces, its greatest width not exceeding twenty leagues. The above
                    limits include a territory extending from 25° 50' to 29° 20' of south latitude.
                    On the continent, four miles south-east of the capital, stands the town of San
                    Jose, the inhabitants of which are principally occupied in sawing timber into
                    planks, making bricks, and growing rice. To the north of this town the shores
                    are studded with houses, pleasantly situated amid bananarias, orangeries, and
                    plantations of rice, coffee, and mandioca. Nine leagues from San Jose is the
                    village of Armaçao, situated at the extremity of the Bay of St Miguel. It is a
                    fishing station for whales, which were formerly very numerous on the coast, and
                    in the bays that indent it. The conveniencies for the manufacture of oil are
                    extensive and well contrived, and all the fish on the coast are brought to this
                    quarter. Beyond the point of Armaçao is that of Dos Ganchos, forming the
                    southern extremity of the spacious Bay of Tejuco or Tejucas, into which a river
                    of the same name, fifty fathoms wide, discharges itself. Ten leagues north of
                    this place is the fine capacious harbour of Gua-roupas, with its handsome town.
                    Further northward is the Bay of St Francisco, in which there is an island with a
                    town, both of the same name. The harbour is fine, and has three entrances,
                    defended by forts. Ship-building is carried on at this place to some extent; the
                    cutting of the fine timber in the neighbourhood, and other labours connected
                    with this art, being the chief occupation of the inhabitants, who may amount to
                    about two thousand. The largest continental town in the province is Laguna,
                    prettily situated upon the eastern margin of the lake from which it derives its
                    name, two miles from the bar, and sixty miles south of Desterro. In the months
                    of November, and December particularly, a prodigious quantity of a long fish,
                    with a forked tail, called <hi rend="italic">bagre,</hi> enter the lake,
                    supplying a lucrative branch of commerce. This place contains four thousand
                    inhabitants. Fifteen miles north of Laguna is Villa Nova, or Santa Anna,
                    situated on an elevation near the northern extremity of the same lake. More flax

                    province. The other towns or villages of Santa Catharina are small and of little
                    importance. In 1812 the population, according to Cazal, was 31,530; but it has
                    greatly increased. The province is divided into seven parishes, three of which
                    are situated on the island of Santa Catharina, and four on the continent. The
                    whole are included within the see of Rio de Janeiro. For a description of the
                    island of Santa Catharina, see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Catherine,

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Santa Cruz,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">St Croix,</hi> a small
                    and unhealthy island, situated in about sixty-four degrees west longitude and
                    eighteen north latitude. In 1643 it was inhabited by the Dutch and the English,
                    who soon became enemies to each other; and in 1650 they were both driven out by
                    twelve hundred Spaniards, who arrived there in five ships. The triumph of these
                    lasted but a few months. The remains of that numerous body, which were left for
                    the defence of the island, surrendered without resistance to a hundred and sixty
                    French, who had embarked, in the year 1651, from St Christopher’s, to make
                    themselves masters of the island. It continued without inhabitants and without
                    cultivation till 1733, when it was sold by France to Denmark for L.30,750. Soon
                    afterwards the Danes built there the fortress of Christianstadt. It was then
                    that this northern power seemed likely to take deep root in America; but,
                    unfortunately, she laid her plantations under the yoke of exclusive privileges.
                    Industrious people of all sects, particularly Moravians, strove in vain to
                    overcome this great difficulty. Many attempts were made to reconcile the
                    interests of the colonists and their oppressors, but without success. The two
                    parties kept up a continual struggle of animosity, and not of industry. At
                    length the government purchased, in 1754, the privileges and effects of the
                    company. The price was fixed at L.4l2,500; and the navigation of the islands
                    opened to all the subjects of the Danish dominions. It is the most valuable of
                    the Danish possessions in the West Indies. The soil is fertile and well
                    cultivated, and the principal productions are sugar, rum, and coffee. It is
                    about eighty-one square miles in extent, and contains about 37,000 inhabitants,
                    of whom 3000 are whites, 1200 free blacks and mulattoes, and the remainder
                    slaves.</p>

                    and in the province of Andalusia. When, under Ferdinand and Isabella, the court
                    of Spain determined to reduce to the Christian dominion the last refuge of the
                    Moors in the city of Granada, as the siege was likely to be very protracted,
                    this city was founded near it, as the head-quarters of the Catholic forces. It
                    is in a fine situation, surrounded by the best cultivation, and enjoying the
                    best soil in Spain, perhaps in the world; and its powers of irrigation are
                    always greater in proportion to the heat of the weather, as the waters are
                    supplied from the melting of the snows on the summit of the Sierra Nevada. This
                    city has been frequently injured by earthquakes, which have at times almost
                    destroyed its edifices. One in 1807 was especially destructive; but, from the
                    richness of the soil, it has speedily risen from its ruins, and been as
                    flourishing as before the visitation. It is said that a narrow strip of land,
                    extending the whole distance across the plain, and on one part of which this
                    city is built, is periodically subject to this calamity, which, however the
                    inhabitants may dread it, has not power to drive them from it. Near to this
                    place is the residence and estate granted by the Spanish government to the Duke
                    of Wellington for his services during the war. It is called the Sota de Roma,
                    and is finely situated.</p>

                    capital of New Granada, is situated at the foot of a steep mountain, at the
                    entrance of a vast plain. It is the residence of a viceroy and an archbishop,
                    and the seat of an audiencia and a university, and contains magnificent houses,
                    five bridges, and thirty thousand inhabitants. The air is constantly temperate.
                    The wheat of Europe and the sesame of Asia produce abundant crops, and at all
                    seasons. The plateau on which the town of Santa Fe de Bogota is situated bears a
                    resemblance in several respects to that which encloses the Mexican lakes. They
                    are both more elevated than the convent of St Bernard, the former being 8190,
                    the latter 7008 feet above the level of the sea. Long. 74.10. W. Lat. 4. 35.
