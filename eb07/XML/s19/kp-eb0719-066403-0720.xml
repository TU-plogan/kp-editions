                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">SAXE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Maurice, Count of</hi></label>,
                    was born on the 13th of October 1696. He was the natural son of Frederick
                    Augustus II. elector of Saxony and king of Poland, and of the Countess of
                    Konigsmarc, a Swedish lady, celebrated both for her wit and her beauty. He was
                    educated along with Frederick Augustus, the electoral prince, afterwards king of
                    Poland. His infancy announced the future warrior. Nothing could prevail on him
                    to apply to his studies but the promise of being allowed, after he had finished
                    his task, to mount on horseback, or exercise himself in arms.</p>
                <p>He served his first campaign in the army commanded by Prince Eugene and the Duke
                    of Marlborough, when only twelve years old. He signalized himself at the sieges
                    of Toumay and Mons, and particularly at the battle of Malplaquet. In the evening
                    of that memorable day, he was heard to say, “I’m content with my day’s work.”
                    During the campaign of 1710, Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough made many
                    public encomiums on his merit. Next year the young count accompanied the king of
                    Poland to the siege of Stralsund, the strongest place in Pomerania, and
                    displayed the greatest intrepidity, swimming across the river in sight of the
                    enemy, with a pistol in his hand. His valour shone no less conspicuously on the
                    bloody day of Gaedelbusck, where he commanded a regiment of cavalry. He had a
                    horse killed under him, after he had three times rallied his regiment, and led
                    them to the charge.</p>
                <p>Soon after that campaign, his mother prevailed on him to marry the Countess of
                    Lubin, a lady both rich and beautiful. This union lasted but a short time. In
                    1721, the count procured a dissolution of the marriage; a step of which he
                    afterwards repented. The countess left him with regret; but this did not prevent
                    her from marrying soon afterwards. The Count of Saxe was too fond of variety to
                    submit to the duties which marriage imposes. In the midst, however, of the
                    pleasures in which he sometimes indulged, he never lost sight of his profession.
                    He carried along with him wherever he went a library of military books; and even
                    when he seemed most occupied with his pleasures, he never failed to spend an
                    hour or two in private study.</p>
                <p>In 1717 he went to Hungary, where the emperor had an army of 15,000 men commanded
                    by Prince Eugene. Count Saxe was present at the siege of Belgrade, and at a
                    battle which the prince gained over the Turks. On his return to Poland in 1718,
                    he was rnade a knight of the Golden Eagle.</p>
                <p>The wars in Europe being concluded by the treaties of Utrecht and Passarowitz,
                    Count Saxe went to France. He had always professed a partiality for that
                    country. French, indeed, was the only foreign language which during his infancy
                    he was willing to learn. He spent his whole time during the peace in studying
                    mathematics, fortification, and mechanics, sciences which exactly suited his
                    genius. The mode of exercising troops had struck his attention when very young.
                    At sixteen he invented a new exercise, which was taught in Saxony with the
                    greatest success. Having obtained a regiment in France in 1722, he formed it
                    himself according to his new plan. From that moment the Chevalier Folard, an
                    excellent judge of military talents, predicted that he would be a great man.</p>
                <p>In 1726 the states of Courland chose him for their sovereign, but both Poland and
                    Russia rose in arms to oppose the election. The Czarina wished to bestow the
                    duchy on Menzikoff, a happy adventurer, who from a pastry-cook’s boy became a
                    general and a prince. Menzikoff sent eight hundred Russians to Milan, where they
                    besieged the newly-chosen duke in his palace. Count Saxe, who had only sixty
                    men, defended himself with astonishing intrepidity. The siege was raised, and
                    the Russians were obliged to retreat. Soon afterwards he retired to Usmaiz, and
                    prepared to defend his people against the two hostile nations. Here he remained
                    with only three hundred men, until the Russian general approached to force his
                    retreat, at the head of four thousand. That general invited the count to a
                    conference, during which he intended to surprise him, and take him prisoner. The
                    count, informed of the plot, reproached him for his baseness, and broke up the
                    conference. About this time he wrote to France for men and money. Mademoiselle
                    le Couvreur, a celebrated actress, pawned her jewels and plate, and sent him the
                    sum of forty thousand livres. This actress had formed his mind for the fine
                    arts. She had made him read the greater part of the French poets, and given him
                    a taste for the theatre, which he retained even in the camp. The count, unable
                    to defend himself against Russia and Poland, was obliged in the year 1729 to
                    leave his new dominions, and retire into France. It is said that Anne Iwanowa,
                    duchess dowager of Courland, and second daughter of the Czar Iwan Alexiowitz,
                    had given him hopes of marriage, and abandoned him at that time because she
                    despaired of fixing his wavering passion. This inconstancy lost him not only
                    Courland, but the throne of Russia itself, which that princess afterwards
                    filled.</p>
                <p>Count Saxe, thus stripped of his territories, devoted himself for some time to
                    the study of mathematics. He com-<pb break="no"

                    posed also, in thirteen nights, and during the intervals of an ague, his
                    Reveries, which he afterwards corrected. This book is written in an incorrect
                    but forcible style; it is full of remarks both new and profound, and is equally
                    useful to the soldier and the general.</p>
                <p>The death of the king of Poland, his father, in 1733, kindled a new war in
                    Europe. His brother, the elector of Saxony, offered him the command of all his
                    forces; but he preferred the French service, and repaired to Marshal Berwick’s
                    army, which was encamped on the Rhine. “Count,” said that general, who was
                    preparing to attack the enemy’s intrenchments at Etlinghen, “I was going to send
                    for three thousand men, but your arrival is of more value than theirs.” When the
                    attack began, the count, at the head of a regiment of grenadiers, forced the
                    enemy’s lines, and by his bravery decided the victory. He behaved with no less
                    intrepidity at the siege of Philipsburg. For these services he was, in 1734,
                    rewarded with the rank of lieutenant-general. Peace was concluded in 1736; but
                    the death of Charles VL, the emperor of Germany, almost immediately kindled a
                    new war.</p>
                <p>Prague was besieged by the Count of Saxe in 1741, near the end of November, and
                    was taken the same month by assault. The conquest of Egra followed that of
                    Prague. It was taken a few days after the trenches were opened. This success
                    gave so much joy to the Emperor Charles VIL, that he wrote with his own hands a
                    congratulatory letter to the conqueror.</p>
                <p>In 1744 he was made marshal of France, and commanded a part of the French army in
                    Flanders. During that campaign he displayed the greatest military conduct.
                    Though the enemy was superior in number, he observed their motions so skilfully
                    that they could do nothing. In January 1745, an alliance was concluded at
                    Warsaw, between the queen of Hungary, the king of England, and the states of
                    Holland. The ambassador of the states-general, meeting Marshal Saxe one day at
                    Versailles, asked his opinion of that treaty. “I think,” said he, “that if the
                    king my master would give me an unlimited commission, I would read the original
                    at the Hague before the end of the year.” This answer was not a bravado; the
                    marshal was capable of performing it.</p>
                <p>He went soon afterwards, though exceedingly ill, to take the command of the
                    French army in the Low Countries. A gentleman seeing the feeble condition in
                    which he left Paris, asked him how he could in that situation undertake so great
                    an enterprise. “The question,” replied he, “is not about living, but setting
                    out.” Soon after the opening of the campaign, the battle of Fontenoy was fought.
                    Marshal Saxe was at the point of death, yet he caused himself to be put into a
                    litter, and carried round all the posts. During the action he mounted on
                    horseback, though he was so very weak that his attendants dreaded every moment
                    to see him expire. The victory of Fontenoy, which was owing entirely to his
                    vigilance and capacity, was followed by the reduction of Tournay, Bruges, Ghent,
                    Oudenard, Ostend, Ath, and Brussels. This last city was taken on the 28th of
                    February 1746; and very soon afterwards the king sent to the marshal a letter of
                    naturalization, conceived in the most flattering terms. The succeeding campaigns
                    gained him additional honours. After the victory of Raucoux, which he gained on
                    the 11th of October 1746, the king of France made him a present of six pieces of
                    cannon. He was, on the 12th of January of the following year, created marshal of
                    all the French armies, and, in 1748, commander-general of all those parts of the
                    Netherlands which were lately conquered.</p>
                <p>Holland now began to tremble for her safety. Maestricht and Bergen-op-Zoom had
                    already fallen, and nothing but misfortunes seemed to attend the further
                    prosecution of the war. The states-general, therefore, offered terms of peace,
                    which were accepted, and a treaty concluded on the 18th of October 1748.</p>
                <p>Marshal Saxe retired to Chambord, a country-seat which the king of France had
                    given him. Some time afterwards he went to Berlin, where the king of Prussia
                    received him as Alexander would have received Caesar. On his return to France,
                    he spent his time among men of learning, artists, and philosophers. He died of a
                    fever, on the 30th of November 1750, at the age of fifty-four.</p>
                <p>The best edition of his Reveries was printed at Paris, 1757, in two volumes 4to.
                    It was compared with the greatest attention with the original manuscript in the
                    king’s library. It is accompanied with many designs exactly engraved, and a life
                    of the author written in the panegyrical style.</p>
