                <p><label type="entry">SAW</label>, an instrument which serves to cut into pieces
                    several solid matters, as wood, stone, ivory, and the like.</p>
                <p>The best saws are of tempered steel ground bright and smooth; those of iron are
                    only hammer-hardened. Hence the first, besides their being stiffer, are likewise
                    found smoother than the last. They are known to be well hammered by the stiff
                    bending of the blade; and to be well and evenly ground, by their bending equally
                    in a bow.</p>
                <p>The lapidaries, too, have their saw, as well as the workmen in mosaic; but of all
                    mechanics, none have so many saws as the joiners, the chief of which are the
                    following. The pit-saw, which is a large two-handed saw, employed for sawing
                    timber in pits, and chiefly used by the sawers. The whip-saw, which has likewise
                    two handles, used in sawing such large pieces as the hand-saw will not easily
                    reach. The hand-saw is made to be used by an individual, of which there are
                    different kinds, as the frame-saw, which is furnished with cheeks. By the
                    twisted cords which pass from the upper parts of these cheeks, and the tongue in
                    the middle of them, the upper ends are drawn close together, and the lower set
                    farther asunder. The tenon-saw, which being very thin, has a back to keep it
                    from bending. The compass-saw, which is very small, and its teeth usually not
                    set. Its use is to cut a round, or any other compass-kerf, on which account the
                    edge is made broad, and the back thin, that it may have a compass to turn
                    in.</p>
                <p>At an early period, the trunks of trees were split with wedges into as many and
                    as thin pieces as possible; and if it were necessary to have them still thinner,
                    they were hewn on both sides to the proper size. This simple and wasteful manner
                    of making boards has been still continued in some places to the present day.
                    Peter the Great of Russia endeavoured to put a stop to it, by forbidding hewn
                    dales to be transported on the river Neva. The saw, however, though so
                    convenient and beneficial, has not been able to banish entirely the practice of
                    splitting timber used in building, or in making furniture and utensils; and
                    indeed it must be allowed that this method is attended with peculiar advantages
                    which that of sawing can never possess. The wood-splitters perform their work
                    more expeditiously than sawers, and split timber is much stronger than that
                    which has been sawn: for the fissure follows the grain of the wood, and leaves
                    it whole; whereas the saw, which proceeds in the line chalked out for it,
                    divides the fibres, and by these means lessens its cohesion and solidity. Split
                    timber, indeed, turns out often crooked and warped; but for many purposes to
                    which it is applied this is not injurious, and these faults may sometimes be
                    amended. As the fibres, however, retain their natural length and direction,
                    thin<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=719"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0719-0663"/> boards particularly can be bent much better. This
                    is a great advantage in making pipe-staves, or sieve-frames, which require still
                    more art, and in forming various implements of a similar kind.</p>
                <p>Our common saw, which requires only to be guided by the hand, however simple it
                    may be, was not known to the inhabitants of America when they were subdued by
                    the Europeans. The inventor of this instrument has been inserted in their
                    mythology by the Greeks, with a place, in which, amongst their gods, they
                    honoured the greatest benefactors of the earliest ages. By some he is called
                    Talus, and by others Perdix. None except Pliny make Daedalus the inventor; but
                    Hardouin, in the passage where this occurs, reads Talus for Daedalus. Talus is
                    the name of the inventor according to Diodorus Siculus, Apollodorus, and others.
                    He was the son of Daedalus’s sister, and was by his mother placed under the
                    tuition of her brother, to be instructed in his art. Having found the jaw-bone
                    of a snake, he employed it to cut through a small piece of wood, and by these
                    means was induced to fabricate a similar instrument of iron, that is, to make a
                    saw. This invention, by which labour is greatly facilitated, excited the envy of
                    his master, and prompted him to put Talus privately to death. Being asked, when
                    burying the body, what he was depositing in the earth, he replied, a serpent.
                    This ambiguous answer discovered the murder; and thus a snake was the cause of
                    the invention, of the murder, and of its being brought to light. By others the
                    inventor is called Perdix, who is supposed to have been the son of a sister of
                    Daedalus. Perdix did not employ the jaw-bone of a snake for a saw, but the
                    back-bone of a fish, as is mentioned by Ovid.</p>
                <p>The saws of the Grecian carpenters had the same form, and wore made with equal
                    ingenuity as the same instruments at present. This appears from a painting
                    preserved among the antiquities of Herculanum. Two genii are represented at the
                    end of a bench consisting of a long table resting on two four-footed stools, and
                    the piece of wood to be sawn through is secured by cramps. The saw with which
                    the genii are at work bears a striking resemblance to our frame-saw. It consists
                    of a square frame, having a blade in the middle, the teeth of which are
                    perpendicular to the plane of the frame. The piece of wood to be sawn extends
                    beyond the end of the bench, and one of the workmen appears standing, and the
                    other sitting on the ground. The arms in which the blade is fastened have the
                    same form as that which is given to them at present. In the bench are seen
                    holes, in which the cramps holding the timber are stuck. They are shaped like
                    the figure 7; and the ends of them reach below the boards which form the top of
                    it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Saw</hi><hi rend="italic">-Mills.</hi> The most
                    beneficial improvement of the operation of sawing was the invention of
                    saw-mills, which are driven either by water or by wind. Mills of the first kind
                    were erected in Germany, on the small river Ruer, as early as the fourth
                    century. The art of cutting marble with a saw is very ancient. According to
                    Pliny, it was invented in Caria. Stones of the soap-rock kind, which are softer
                    than marble, were sawn at that period; but it appears that the harder kinds of
                    stone were also then sawn; for we are informed of the discovery of a building
                    which was encrusted with cut agate, carnelian, lapis lazuli, and amethysts.
                    There is, however, no account in any of the Greek or Roman writers of a mill for
                    sawing wood; and as modern authors speak of saw-mills as new and uncommon, it
                    appears that the oldest construction of them has been forgotten, or that some
                    interesting improvement has made them appear entirely new.</p>
                <p>Becher says that saw-mills were invented in the seventeenth century, which is a
                    mistake; for when the Infant Henry sent people to settle in the island of
                    Madeira, discovered in 1420, he gave orders for saw-mills to be erected, for the
                    purpose of sawing into deals the various species of excellent timber with which
                    the island abounded, and which were afterwards exported to Portugal. There was a
                    sawmill in the city of Breslau about the year 1427, producing a yearly rent of
                    three merks; and in 1490, the magistrates of Erfurt purchased a forest, in which
                    they erected a sawmill, besides renting another in the neighbourhood. The first
                    saw-mill in Norway was erected about the year 1530. In the year 1552 there was a
                    saw-mill erected at Joachimethal, the property of a mathematician called Jacob
                    Geusen. In 1555, the Bishop of Ely, ambassador from Queen Mary of England to the
                    court of Rome, having seen a saw-mill in the vicinity of Lyons, the writer of
                    his travels gave a particular description of it. The first saw-mill was
                    erecte&lt;l in Holland at Saardam in 1596, the invention of which is ascribed to
                    Cornelius Cornelissen. The first mill of this kind in Sweden was erected in the
                    year 1653.</p>
                <p>In England, saw-mills had at first a similar effect with printing in Turkey, the
                    ribbon-loom in the dominions of the church, and the crane at Strasburg. When
                    attempts were made to introduce them, they were violently opposed, because it
                    was apprehended that the sawers would thus be deprived of the means of procuring
                    subsistence. An opulent merchant in 1767 or 1768, by desire of the Society of
                    Arts, caused a saw-mill to be erected at Limehouse, driven by wind; but it was
                    demolished by the mob, and the damage was sustained by the nation, while some of
                    the rioters were punished. This, however, was not the only mill of the kind then
                    in Great Britain; for at Leith there was one driven by wind some years before.
                    Saw-mills are very common in America, where the moving power is generally water.
                    Some have been constructed on a very extensive plan.</p>
                <p>The mechanism of a sawing-mill may be reduced to three principal things. The
                    first is, that the saw is drawn up and down as long as is necessary, by a motion
                    communicated to the wheel by water. The second is, that the piece of timber to
                    be cut into boards is advanced by an uniform motion to receive the strokes of
                    the saw; for here the wood is to meet the saw, and not the saw to follow the
                    wood, therefore the motion of the wood and that of the saw ought immediately to
                    depend the one on the other. The third is, that where the saw has cut through
                    the whole length of the piece, the whole machine stops of itself, and remains
                    immoveable; lest having no obstacle to surmount, the moving power should turn
                    the wheel with too great velocity, and break some part of the machine.</p>
                <p>When a completely cylindrical pillar is to be cut out of one block of stone, the
                    first thing will be to ascertain in the block the position of the axis of the
                    cylinder, then lay the block so that such axis shall be parallel to the horizon,
                    and let a cylindrical hole of from one to two inches diameter be bored entirely
                    through it. Let an iron bar, whose diameter is rather less than that of this
                    tube, be put through it, having just room to slide freely to and fro as occasion
                    may require. Each end of this bar should terminate in a screw, on which a nut
                    and frame may be fastened. The nut-frame should carry three flat pieces of wood
                    or iron, each having a slit running along its middle from nearly one end to the
                    other, and a screw and handle must be adapted to each slit. By these means the
                    frame-work at each end of the bar may readily be so adjusted as to form equal
                    isosceles or equilateral triangles; the iron-bar will connect two corresponding
                    angles of these triangles, the saw to be used two other corresponding angles,
                    and another bar of iron or of wood the two remaining angles, to give sufficient
                    strength to the whole frame. By this construction the workmen are enabled to
                    place the saw at any proposed distance from the hole drilled through the middle
                    of the block; and then, by giving the alternating motion to the saw-frame, the
                    cylinder may at length be cut from the block, as required.</p>
                <p>If it were proposed to saw a conic frustum from such a block, then let two frames
                    of wood or iron be fixed to those parallel ends of the block which are intended
                    to coincide<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=720"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0720-0664"/> with the bases of the frustum, circular grooves
                    being previously cut in these frames to correspond with the circumferences of
                    the two ends of the proposed frustum; the saw being worked in these grooves will
                    manifestly cut the conic surface from the block. This, we believe, is the
                    contrivance of Sir George Wright.</p>
                <p>The best method of drilling the hole through the middle of the proposed cylinder
                    seems to be this. On a carriage running upon four low wheels let two vertical
                    pieces, each having a hole just large enough to admit the borer to play freely,
                    be fixed two or three feet asunder, and so contrived that the pieces and holes
                    to receive the borer may, by screws, be raised or lowered at pleasure, while the
                    borer is prevented from sliding to and fro by shoulders upon its bar, which are
                    larger than the holes in the vertical pieces, and which, as the borer revolves,
                    press against those pieces; let a part of the boring bar between the two
                    vertical pieces be square, and a grooved wheel with a square hole of a suitable
                    size be placed upon this part of the bar; then the rotatory motion may be given
                    to the bar by an endless band which shall pass over this grooved wheel and a
                    wheel of a much larger diameter in the same plane, the latter wheel being turned
                    by a winch-handle in the usual way.</p>
                <p>Circular saws, acting by a rotatory motion, have been long known in Holland,
                    where they are used for cutting wood used in veneering. They were introduced
                    into this country, we believe, by General Bentham, and are now used in the
                    dock-yard at Portsmouth, and in a few other places; but they are not as yet so
                    generally adopted as might be wished, considering how well they are calculated
                    to abridge labour, and to accomplish with expedition and accuracy what is very
                    tedious and irksome to perform in the usual way. Circular saws may be made to
                    turn either in horizontal, vertical, or inclined planes, and the timber to be
                    cut may be laid upon a plane inclined in any direction; so that it may be sawn
                    by lines making any angle whatever, or at any proposed distance from each other.
                    When the saw is fixed at a certain angle, and at a certain distance from the
                    edge of the frame, all the pieces will be cut of∙the same size, without marking
                    upon them by a chalked line, merely by causing them to be moved along, and
                    keeping one side in contact with the side of the frame; for then, as they are
                    brought one by one to touch the saw revolving on its axle, and are pressed upon
                    it, they are soon cut through.</p>
