                <p><label type="entry">SAVAGE</label> is a word so well understood as scarcely to
                    require explanation. When applied to inferior animals, it denotes that they are
                    wild, untamed, and cruel; when applied to man, it is of much the same import
                    with barbarian, and means a person that is untaught and uncivilized, or who is
                    in the rudest state of uncultivated nature.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Savage,</hi><hi rend="italic">Richard,</hi> one of the most
                    remarkable characters that is to be met with in all the records of biography,
                    was, according to her own confession, the son of Anne countess of Macclesfield
                    by the Earl of Rivers, and was born in 1698. This confession of adultery was
                    made in order to procure a separation from her husband the Earl of Macclesfield;
                    yet, having obtained this desired end, no sooner was her spurious offspring
                    brought into the world, than, without the dread of shame or poverty to excuse
                    her, she discovered the resolution of disowning him, and, as long as he lived,
                    treated him with the most unnatural cruelty. She delivered him over to a poor
                    woman to educate as her own; prevented the Earl of Rivers from leaving him a
                    legacy of L.6000, by declaring him dead; and in effect deprived him of another
                    legacy which his godmother Mrs Lloyd had left him, by concealing from him his
                    birth, and thereby rendering it impossible for him to prosecute his claim. She
                    endeavoured to send him secretly to the plantations; but this plan being either
                    laid aside or frustrated, she placed him apprentice with a shoemaker. In this
                    situation, however, he did not long continue; for his nurse having died, he went
                    to take care of the effects of his supposed mother, and found in her boxes some
                    letters which discovered to young Savage his birth, and the cause of its
                    concealment.</p>
                <p>From the moment of this discovery it was natural for him to become dissatisfied
                    with his situation as a shoemaker. He now conceived that he had a right to share
                    in the affluence of his real mother; and therefore he directly, and perhaps
                    indiscreetly, applied to her, and made use of every art to awaken her tenderness
                    and attract her regard. But in vain did he solicit this unnatural parent. She
                    avoided him with the utmost precaution, and took measures to prevent his ever
                    entering her house on any pretence whatever.</p>
                <p>Savage was at this time so touched with the discovery of his birth, that he
                    frequently made it his practice to walk before his mother’s door in hopes of
                    seeing her by accident; and often did he warmly solicit her to admit him to see
                    her; but all to no purpose. He could neither soften her heart nor open her
                    hand.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, whilst he was assiduously endeavouring to rouse the affections
                    of a mother in whom all natural affection was extinct, he was destitute of the
                    means of support, and reduced to the miseries of want. We are not told by what
                    means he got rid of his obligation to the shoemaker, or whether he ever was
                    actually bound to him; but we now find him very differently employed in order to
                    procure a subsistence. In short, the youth had parts, and a strong inclination
                    towards literary pursuits, especially poetry. He wrote a poem, and afterwards
                    two plays, Woman’s a Riddle, and Love in a Veil; but the author was allowed no
                    part of the profits from the first; and from the second he received no other
                    advantage than the acquaintance of Sir Richard Steele and of Mr Wilkes, by whom
                    he was pitied, caressed, and relieved. However, the kindness of his friends not
                    affording him a constant supply, he wrote the tragedy of Sir Thomas Overbury,
                    which not only procured him the esteem of many persons of wit, but brought him
                    in L.200. The celebrated Aaron Hill was of great service to him in correcting
                    and fitting this piece for the stage and the press; and he extended his
                    patronage still further. But Savage was, like many other wits, a bad manager,
                    and was ever in distress. As fast as his friends raised him out of one
                    difficulty, he sunk into another; and, when he found himself greatly involved,
                    he would ramble about like a vagabond, with scarcely a shirt to his back.</p>
                <p>Mr Hill also earnestly promoted a subscription to a volume of Miscellanies by
                    Savage, and likewise furnished part of the poems of which the volume was
                    composed. To this miscellany Savage wrote a preface, in which he gives an
                    account of his mother’s cruelty in an uncommon strain of humour. The profits of
                    his tragedy and his Miscellanies together had now, for a time, somewhat raised
                    poor Savage both in circumstances and in credit; so that the world just began to
                    behold him with a more favourable eye than formerly, when both his fame and his
                    life were endangered by a most unhappy event. A drunken frolic in which he one
                    night engaged, ended in a fray, and Savage unfortunately killed a man, for which
                    he was condemned to be hanged. His friends earnestly solicited the mercy of the
                    crown, whilst his mother as earnestly exerted herself to prevent his receiving
                    it. The Countess of Hertford at length laid his whole case before Queen
                    Caroline, and Savage obtained a pardon.</p>
                <p>Savage had now lost that tenderness for his mother which the whole series of her
                    cruelty had not been able wholly to repress; and considering her as an
                    implacable enemy, whom nothing but his blood could satisfy, threatened to harass
                    her with lampoons, and to publish a copious narrative of her conduct, unless she
                    consented to allow him a pension. This expedient proved successful; and the Lord
                    Tyrconnel, upon his promise of laying aside his design of exposing his mother’s
                    cruelty, look him into his family, treated him as an equal, and engaged to allow
                    him a pension of L.200 a year. This was the golden part of Savage’s life. He was
                    courted<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=713"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0713-0659"/> by all who endeavoured to be thought men of
                    genius, and caressed by all who valued themselves upon a refined taste. In this
                    gay period of his life he published the Temple of Health and Mirth, on the
                    recovery’ of Lady Tyrconnel from a languishing illness; and The Wanderer, a
                    moral poem, which he dedicated to Lord Tyrconnel, in strains of the highest
                    panegyric. But these praises he in a short time found himself inclined to
                    retract, being discarded by the man on whom they were bestowed. Of this quarrel
                    Lord Tyrconnel and Mr Savage assigned very different reasons. Our author’s known
                    character pleads too strongly against him; for his conduct was ever such as made
                    all his friends, sooner or later, grow weary of him, and even forced most of
                    them to become his enemies.</p>
                <p>Being thus once more turned adrift upon the world, Savage, whose passions were
                    very strong, and whose gratitude was very small, became extremely diligent in
                    exposing the faults of Lord Tyrconnel. He, moreover, now thought himself at
                    liberty to take revenge upon his mother, in a poem called The Bastard. This poem
                    had an extraordinary sale; and its appearance happening when his mother was at
                    Bath, many persons there took frequent opportunities of repeating passages from
                    the Bastard in her hearing.</p>
                <p>Some time after this, Savage formed the resolution of applying to the queen. With
                    this view, he published a poem on her birth-day, which he entitled the
                    Volunteer-Laureat; for which she was pleased to send him L.50, with an
                    intimation that he might annually expect the same bounty. But this annual
                    allowance was nothing to a man of his strange and singular extravagance. His
                    usual custom was, as soon as he had received his pension, to disappear with it,
                    and secrete himself from his most intimate friends, till every shilling of the
                    L.50 was spent; which done, he appeared again, pennyless as before. But he would
                    never inform any person where he had been, or in what manner his money had been
                    dissipated. From the reports, however, of some, who found means to penetrate his
                    haunts, it would seem that he expended both his time and his cash in the most
                    sordid and despicable sensuality.</p>
                <p>His wit and parts, however, still raised him new friends as fast as his behaviour
                    lost him his old ones. Yet such was his conduct, that occasional relief only
                    furnished the means of occasional excess; and he defeated all attempts made by
                    his friends to fix him in a decent way. He was even reduced so low as to be
                    destitute of a lodging, insomuch that he often passed his nights in those mean
                    houses that are set open for casual wanderers; sometimes in cellars, amidst the
                    riot and filth of the most profligate of the rabble; and not seldom would he
                    walk the streets till he was weary, and then lie down in summer on a hulk, or in
                    winter with his associates among the ashes of a glass-house.</p>
                <p>Yet, amidst all this penury and wretchedness, had this man so much pride, and so
                    high an opinion of his own merit, that he was always ready to repress, with
                    scorn and contempt, the least appearance of any slight or indignity towards
                    himself, in the behaviour of his acquaintance, among whom he looked upon none as
                    his superior. This life, unhappy as it may be imagined, was yet rendered more so
                    by the death of the queen in 1738, which stroke deprived him of all hopes from
                    the court. His pension was discontinued, and the insolent manner in which he
                    demanded of Sir Robert Walpole to have it restored, for ever cut off this
                    considerable supply.</p>
                <p>His distress became now so great and so notorious, that a scheme was at length
                    concerted for procuring him a permanent relief. It was proposed that he should
                    retire into Wales, with an allowance of L.50 per annum, on which he was to live
                    privately in a cheap place, for ever quitting his town haunts, and resigning all
                    further pretensions to fame. This offer he seemed gladly to accept; but his
                    intentions were only to deceive his friends, by retiring for a while, to write
                    another tragedy, and then to return with it to London in order to bring it upon
                    the stage.</p>
                <p>In 1739 he set out in the Bristol stage-coach for Swansey, and was furnished with
                    fifteen guineas to bear the expense of his journey. But, on the fourteenth day
                    after his departure, his friends and benefactors, the principal of whom was Mr
                    Pope, who expected to hear of his arrival in Wales, were surprised with a letter
                    from Savage, informing them that he was yet upon the road, and could not proceed
                    for want of money. There was no other method than a remittance, which was sent
                    him, and by the help of which he was enabled to reach Bristol, whence he was to
                    proceed to Swansey by water. At Bristol, however, he found an embargo laid upon
                    the shipping, so that he could not immediately obtain a passage. Here,
                    therefore, being obliged to stay for some time, he, with his usual facility, so
                    ingratiated himself with the principal inhabitants, that he was frequently
                    invited to their houses, distinguished at their public entertainments, and
                    treated with a regard that highly flattered his vanity, and therefore easily
                    engaged his affections. At length, with great reluctance, he proceeded to
                    Swansey, where he lived about a year, very much dissatisfied with the diminution
                    of his salary; for he had, in his letters, treated his contributors so
                    insolently, that most of them withdrew their subscriptions. Here he finished his
                    tragedy, and resolved to return with it to London; which was strenuously opposed
                    by his great and constant friend Mr Pope, who proposed that Savage should put
                    this play into the hands of Mr Thomson and Mr Mallet, in order that they might
                    fit it for the stage, that his friends should receive the profits it might bring
                    in, and that the author should receive the produce by way of annuity. This kind
                    and prudent scheme was rejected by Savage with the utmost contempt. He declared
                    he would not submit his works to any one’s correction; and that he should no
                    longer be kept in leading-strings. He soon returned to Bristol in his way to
                    London; and there meeting with a repetition of the same kind treatment he had
                    before found, he was tempted to make a second stay in that opulent city. Here he
                    was again not only caressed and treated, but the sum of L.30 was raised for him,
                    with which it had been happy if he had immediately departed for London. But he
                    never considered that a frequent repetition of such kindness was not to be
                    expected, and that it was possible to tire out the generosity of his Bristol
                    friends, as he had before tired his friends everywhere else. In short, he
                    remained here till his company was no longer welcome. His visits in every family
                    were too often repeated; his wit had lost its novelty, and his irregular
                    behaviour grew troublesome. Necessity came upon him before he was aware. His
                    money was spent, his clothes were worn out, his appearance was shabby, and his
                    presence was disgustful at every table. He now began to find every man from home
                    at whose house he called. Thus reduced, it would have been prudent in him to
                    have withdrawn from the place; but prudence and Savage were never acquainted. He
                    staid, in the midst of poverty, hunger, and contempt, till the mistress of a
                    coffee-house, to whom he owed about eight pounds, arrested him for the debt. He
                    remained for some time, at a great expense, in the house of the sheriff’s
                    officer, in hopes of procuring bail; which expense he was enabled to defray by a
                    present of five guineas from Mr Nash. No bail, however, was to be found, so that
                    poor Savage was at last lodged in Newgate, a prison so named in Bristol.</p>
                <p>But it was the fortune of this extraordinary mortal always to find more friends
                    than he deserved. The keeper of the prison took compassion on him, and greatly
                    softened the rigours of his confinement by every kind of indulgence. He
                    supported him at his own table, gave him a commodious room to himself, allowed
                    him to stand at the door of the jail, and even frequently took him into the
                    fields for the<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=714"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0714-0660"/> benefit of the air and exercise; so that, in
                    reality, Savage endured fewer hardships in this place than he had usually ,
                    suffered during the greater part of his life. Whilst he remained in this not
                    intolerable prison, his ingratitude again broke out, in a bitter satire on the
                    city of Bristol, to which he certainly owed great obligations, notwithstanding
                    the circumstances of his arrest, which was but the act of an individual, and
                    that attended with no circumstances of injustice or cruelty.</p>
                <p>When Savage had remained about six months in this hospitable prison, he received
                    a letter from Mr Pope, who still continued to allow him L.20 a year, containing
                    a charge of very atrocious ingratitude. What were the particulars of this charge
                    we are not informed; but, from the notorious character of the man, there is
                    reason to fear that Savage was but too justly accused. He, however, solemnly
                    protested his innocence; but he was very unusually affected on this occasion. In
                    a few days afterwards he was seized with a disorder, which at first was not
                    suspected to be dangerous; but growing daily more languid and dejected, at last
                    a fever seized him, and he expired on the 1st of August 1743, in the forty-sixth
