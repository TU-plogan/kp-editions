                <p><label type="entry">SARDINIA</label>. This kingdom is composed of two portions.
                    One is the island bearing that name, which has long been entitled to the
                    distinctive title of a kingdom; and the other consists of portions of the
                    north-west of Italy, which at different periods had been distinguished as feudal
                    or independent sovereignties under various forms of government as well as
                    titles.</p>
                <p>The existence of the island of Sardinia is noticed casually in the ancient
                    writers, so as to justify the opinion of some authors on its antiquities, that
                    it was peopled about 1700 years before our era, by a party of Etruscans; but
                    others have contended for an origin 500 years later, and for its first colonists
                    having been Libyans under Sardis, a descendant of the Theban Hercules, who gave
                    his name to the island. Without entering on the dark subject of the first
                    peopling of this island, the high antiquity of its settlement is attested by
                    durable monuments, the materials, height, and construction of which are
                    different from almost any other that are to be found. These Cyclopean structures
                    are very numerous, between five and six hundred of them being to be seen on the
                    island. They are called <hi rend="italic">nuraggis,</hi> both by ancients and
                    moderns, being in height about fifty feet, and in diameter at the base about
                    ninety feet. They are strong buildings, in the form of a truncated cone,
                    composed of masses of stone from two to five or six feet square, arranged in
                    layers, without cement. The materials are lava, freestone, porphyry’, or such
                    other substances as the respective sites afford; and they generally crown the
                    summits of hills, commanding plains where they are seen in every state, some
                    being nearly complete, and others a mere heap of rubbish. On entering these
                    edifices, which is effected by a low door, the structure is found to extend
                    below the surface of the surrounding earth. The interior space is almost
                    invariably divided into two floors, each consisting of a vaulted room, to which
                    access is gained from a ramp between two concentric walls, and leading to the
                    summit, where a flight of steps completes the ascent. The nuraggis are of two
                    distinct kinds. Those which are the most common have no marks of the chisel, and
                    are constructed of massive blocks, with irregular faces, and smaller stones in
                    the interstices; the materials of the others exhibit exteriors formed by tools,
                    though the stones are not exactly square, but are placed with a stricter regard
                    to keeping the horizontal layers, and gradually diminish in size towards the
                    summit.</p>
                <p>There have been various conjectures respecting the probable object of these
                    buildings. The darkness of their interior, and the fragments of terracotta found
                    in them, would indicate their having been monuments for the dead, a belief so
                    general that they have obtained in their neighbour-<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=701" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0701-0647"/>
                    hood the name of <hi rend="italic">Domu de Orcu,</hi> or the house of death; but
                    the pottery being evidently Roman, and in some instances accompanied by coins of
                    the lower empire, indicates only that such was the use made of them at a late
                    period. Captain Smyth, who examined these ancient monuments, says, “From their
                    laborious construction, their number, and their general situation on <hi
                    rend="italic">curureddus</hi> or eminences, more or less distant from each
                    other, I cannot but suppose they were designed to answer the double purpose of
                    mausolea for the eminent dead, and as asyla for the living, especially as many
                    of them are flanked with smaller nuraggis having a subterraneous communication.
                    But the mystery in which they are involved will probably remain impenetrable,
                    since none of them exhibit the least trace of either literal or symbolical
                    characters.”</p>
                <p>At whatever periods these remarkable works were erected, a long time elaspsed
                    before any precise notice is to be discovered of the history of Sardinia, until
                    about the year 560 before Christ, when the Carthaginians under Machaeus, after a
                    victorious campaign in Sicily, attempted the conquest of the island. They were
                    repulsed with such loss, however, as left it in repose until the contests
                    commenced between the Punic and Roman republics.</p>
                <p>By successive conquests it passed into the hands of the Vandals, the Mahommedans,
                    and the Spaniards, in whose power it remained from 1324 till the period of the
                    disputed succession of the crown of Spain between the houses of Bourbon and
                    Austria in 1708, when the Austrian party, with the assistance of the English
                    fleet under Sir John Leake, succeeded in obtaining possession of the island. In
                    1720 it was ceded by treaty to Victor Asmodeus, who assumed the title of king of
                    Sardinia. After this event, notwithstanding the wars which agitated the rest of
                    Europe, Sardinia experienced a peace of seventy years, during which period the
                    princes of the house of Savoy, especially Charles Emanuel, made the greatest
                    exertions to ameliorate the condition of the people.</p>
                <p>The success of the French arms in Italy by the year 1798 had been such as to
                    compel the king, Charles Emanuel IV., to abandon the capital, Turin, and the
                    whole of his continental dominions. He withdrew to Leghorn, where he received
                    with delight deputies from the stamente of Sardinia, assuring him of the entire
                    devotion of the people to his person and government. Satisfied with these
                    assurances, he embarked, and, escorted by an English frigate, arrived at
                    Cagliari on the 3d of March 1799, where he was welcomed with the most
                    enthusiastic affection.</p>
                <p>The successes of the Russian General Suwarof induced his majesty to return to the
                    Continent, till, hearing in Tuscany of the battle of Marengo, and being
                    inconsolable for the death of his wife, the sister of Louis XVI., he abdicated
                    in favour of the Duke of Aosta in March 1802, and resided in privacy at Rome,
                    where he died in 1819. His successor, Victor Emanuel, remained some time in
                    Italy in the hope of gaining his continental dominions; but seeing little
                    prospect of succeeding, he left Naples, where he had resided since his
                    accession, and arrived in Sardinia on the 17th of February 1806, where he
                    remained secure under the protection of England.</p>
                <p>The son of Charles Emanuel followed the footsteps of his father in opposing the
                    principles of the French revolution, which was then spreading its direful
                    effects over all Europe, and nowhere more generally than in the continental part
                    of the kingdom of Sardinia. The events of that period are to be found in this
                    work in the historical parts of the two articles <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Europe</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">France.</hi> We need only state here,
                    therefore, that the king of Sardinia returned to his continental capital in
                    1814, and by the treaty of Vienna the duchy or ancient republic of Genoa was
                    added to his dominions; and that by the same treaty he ceded to the state of
                    Geneva the circles of Carouge and Chesne, containing</p>
                <p>12,700 inhabitants. On the restoration of Victor Emanuel, he re-established, as
                    far as could be done, the old constitution; again introducing the Jesuists, and
                    becoming a zealous member of the Holy Alliance. He confirmed to those who had
                    made purchases under the French confiscation the property they had gained;
                    restored to their owners the few estates that had not been sold; and allotted
                    the annual sum of 400,000 lire as some compensation for the plunder which they
                    had suffered. He however established a very severe censorship of the press, and
                    introduced such restrictions on the process of education in the universities and
                    the other seminaries as he judged necessary to check the prevailing tendency to
                    infidelity and immorality. These measures, and the predisposition to revolution
                    indulged throughout Italy, caused an insurrection in 1821, the particulars of
                    which are narrated in this work under the head of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Italy.</hi> The prosperity of the kingdom has been proceeding with regularity
                    since the return of tranquillity, owing in a great measure to the increased
                    demand for silk in England, Germany, France, and Russia, and in no
                    inconsiderable degree from the annexation of Genoa to the territory, by which a
                    trade is now carried on to almost every part of the habitable world.</p>
                <p>The extent of the several divisions of this kingdom, and their population in
                    1833, were as follow :—</p>

                <p>The whole of the inhabitants of this kingdom adhere to the Roman Catholic church,
                    with the exception only of about 30,000 Jews, who have a restricted toleration,
                    and some Protestants, well known under the name of Waldenses, who are settled,
                    after long and frequent persecutions, in the valleys of Lucerne, Perusa, and St
                    Martin, in the western part of Piedmont. According to their own account, they
                    occupy thirteen villages, and number nearly 20,000 souls, who are allowed the
                    free exercise of their own mode of religious worship.</p>
                <p>The religious establishment of the kingdom is very extensive, comprehending no
                    less than nine archbishoprics and thirty-four bishoprics, who have under them
                    ninety-seven chapters of ecclesiastics in the cities, with 3619 parish priests
                    in the towns and villages, besides 300 monasteries of various orders, and about
                    eighty nunneries for females. The state of education is generally very low, and
                    few of the peasantry can either read or write. There is a university at Turin
                    with about eight hundred students, another at Genoa with about four hundred, and
                    a third in the island of Cagliari with two hundred and fifty. There are also
                    about eighty colleges where Latin is taught, and forty seminaries for the
                    education of the ecclesiastics.</p>
                <p>The government is an absolute and hereditary monarchy, although in the island of
                    Sardinia the assembly of the<pb break="no"

                    ancient states is still continued; but their power extends only to objects of a
                    local and insignificant nature. In Genoa, too, some shadow of the ancient
                    republican aristocracy exists, but it has little or no influence on the
                    determinations of the monarch. The revenues of the kingdom are stated to amount
                    to about two millions sterling annually, and the expenditure to be nearly the
                    same. In the latter is included the interest on a national debt of five
                    millions, a large portion of which is owing to foreigners, and among others to
                    the capitalists of Geneva and other parts of Switzerland; but by means of a
                    sinking fund it is yearly diminishing. An army of thirty-five thousand men is
                    maintained in time of peace, and a naval force, consisting of six frigates,
                    three corvettes, six brigs, and several schooners and other small craft.</p>
                <p>The continental parts of this kingdom present a face of the greatest possible
                    variety. The part to the north, formerly the duchy of Savoy, is in appearance
                    more a part of Switzerland than of ltaly. It is an alpine land, separated from
                    the plains of the peninsula by an enormous chain of mountains known as the Gray
                    Alps. It is peculiarly interesting, from the lofty heights, whose tops are
                    covered with snow and ice, from the narrow and deep valleys, from its
                    perpendicular cliffs, from the numerous cascades, and from the deep lakes; and
                    it is especially distinguished by the raging winds and violent storms of hail,
                    rain, and snow, which occur with frequency in the more elevated regions.</p>
                <p>The provinces of Piedmont, Milan, and Montserrat, form a vast valley, or rather
                    plain, which was probably once covered with water, and which begins at the pass
                    of Susa, and only terminates on the easternmost frontier of Italy. The river Po
                    divides this valley into two nearly equal portions. Its northern side extends to
                    the foot of the Alps, which separate it from Switzerland, some great projections
                    of which enter it at Aosta and Ossola. The southern part of this valley is
                    bordered in its whole length by the range of the Apennines, which separates it
                    from the provinces on the sea-coast-This valley is bounded on the part in
                    contact with France by the Cottian Alps.</p>
                <p>The provinces on the sea-shore, comprehending Genoa and Nice, which surround the
                    Gulf of Genoa, are separated from the other parts of the kingdom by the
                    Apennines. They are collectively mountainous districts, which extend to the sea,
                    and have only narrow valleys or strips on the shore, in which marshes, heaths,
                    and sandy tracts of land, yielding but little, and thinly inhabited, are in fact
                    the most cold, dreary, and uncomfortable of any part of the Apennine ranges.</p>
                <p>The soil of Savoy is everywhere stony, and consequently not favourable to
                    agriculture upon a great scale. There are few plains of any extent, the valleys
                    are narrow, and the earth is very thin on the rocks, which, by the force of the
                    mountain torrents, is often washed away, leaving the bare stone. The deposited
                    soil in the great valley which contains Piedmont, Montserrat, and Milan, is in
                    most parts rich and deep, except that at the foot of both the Apennines and the
                    Alps there are vast accumulations of banks of pebbles, to which the practices of
                    agriculture cannot be applied with any profit. The height of the mountains,
                    which enclose the valley, give such force to the streams of water that rush
                    down, as to prevent them from being generally under the direction of human art;
                    but in many instances the water has been turned into channels and canals, where,
                    by the help of sluices, it has been applied beneficially to the purpose of
                    irrigation, and, as far as it has been accomplish, ed, with beneficial
                    effect.</p>
                <p>The provinces on the borders of the Mediterranean Sea have no resemblance to
                    Piedmont, either in respect to the soil, the climate, or the vegetation. The
                    soil is stony and poor, the stones are in enormous blocks, and in a few parts
                    only is it adapted for cultivation; but the olive and the vine are found to
                    flourish.</p>
                <p>In the island of Sardinia the land is generally rather hilly than mountainous.
                    Several ranges of hills intersect the whole land, and two large streams cause in
                    many parts extensive marshes, while the scarcity of water in other parts causes
                    cultivation to be much neglected. The soil is, however, productive, and is
                    capable of becoming, with good management, much more than sufficient for the
                    subsistence of the inhabitants. At present it is said that scarcely one third of
                    the land is cultivated, whereas, if the whole were, it might become, as in the
                    time of the Romans and Carthaginians, a granary for the countries on the
                    Continent.</p>
                <p>The mountains within the Sardinian dominions are objects which excite the
                    greatest interest; but a description of them will be found in this work under
                    the general article <hi rend="smallcaps">Alps.</hi> The chains of mountains may
                    be viewed as the cisterns for collecting those vast bodies of water which empty
                    themselves into the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas. The first of these seas
                    receives the waters of the Rhone, which rises in Savoy, and at first forms the
                    boundary towards France.</p>
                <p>The river Var constitutes the boundary between Nice and France; and the Paglion
                    is a river of short course in the province of Nice, which rises near to Luce,
                    and falls into the sea at a short distance from the capital. The great river of
                    Sardinia, however, is the winding and lengthened Po, of which an account has
                    been given under that head.</p>
                <p>The larger lakes of the Alps belong only in part to this kingdom. The Leman, or
                    lake of Geneva, is divided between Sardinia and the canton of Switzerland, the
                    southern bank of it only belonging to the kingdom. Lake Maggiore has also only
                    its western shores in the Sardinian dominions, the eastern side belonging to the
                    Austro-Venetian kingdom of Lombardy, and the upper part forming a portion of
                    Switzerland. The lakes exclusively Sardinian are of smaller extent than those
                    which are but partly in the kingdom. The lake of Bourget, in Savoy, scarcely
                    exceeds 100,000 acres in extent, but is about 240 feet in depth, and being
                    connected by the Canal of Savières, discharges much water into the Rhone. The
                    lake of Annency, in Savoy, is 1350 feet above the level of the sea, and is 180
                    feet in depth. It has an outlet by the rivers Thon and Fier into the Rhone. The
                    lake of Orta is a long narrow piece of water by the side of Lake Maggiore, into
                    which its surplus water is discharged. There are some smaller lakes, a few of
                    which are dried up in the summer; and others of them are on elevations of great
                    height, the most remarkable of which is one on Mont Cenis, 5740 feet above the
                    level of the sea.</p>
                <p>The several states abound in mineral springs of great use to the healing art. In
                    Savoy the sulphureous wells of Bonneval have attained great celebrity; but their
                    reputation is excelled by that of the warm baths of Aix. In the valley of Aosta
                    are the medicinal springs of St Vincenzio and of Cor-maggiore, and the baths of
                    Pre and of St Didier. In the province of Piedmont are the baths of Aqui,
                    Balieri, and Vi-nadio, and the springs of St Genesio.</p>
                <p>The mountains on the island are small chains. The most remarkable of them are,
                    Monti di Limbara in Gallura; Monti di Villanova, between Alghieri and Bosa;
                    Monti Genargento, between Oleastra and the Barbagien; and the Monti Arizzo and
                    Founi, in the Barbagien itself. None of the mountains are of a height to be
                    covered with perpetual snow. The general elevation of the range is from 1000 to
                    3000 feet; but the peak of Limbara is 3686 feet, and that of Genargento has an
                    altitude of 5276, and enables the people of the neighbouring town, Aritzu, to
                    trade in snow for the consumption of the capital. These mountains are almost
                    covered with wood to their summits, and the lower parts have olive-woods,
                    yielding good oil.</p>
                <p>The rivers of the island are the Oristano, which rises<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=703" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0703-0649"/>
                    near Buboso, runs from north-east to south-east, and enters ' the sea at the
                    town of its name; the Flumendoso, which springs from Monti Genargento, waters
                    the district of Bar-bagien, and falls into the sea at Muravera; and the
                    Quoqui-nos, which rises near Tirso, and, taking a northerly direction, falls
                    into the sea about seven miles from Castel Sardo. The lakes of Sardinia are
                    insignificant; they are mostly formed by rain in winter, and are dried up in
                    summer; or by the overflowing of the sea from the dilapidated state of the
                    embankments.</p>
                <p>Mineral springs are numerous on the island, but are for the most part neglected.
                    The principal are those of Sar-dara, Villa Cidro, and Fordongianus, in the Capo
                    de Sotto; and those at the foot of Castel Doria, at Codrongianus, and the
                    Benetutti springs of the Goceana Mountains, on the Capo di Sopra. In a secondary
                    rank may be noticed the thermal waters of Marrubin, of Iglesias, and of St
                    Antonio. Aqua Cotta, at the eastern base of an insulated hillock near Villa
                    Cidro, is a small but constantly limpid spring, of about 105° of Fahrenheit,
                    close by a stream of potable water having a temperature of 60°, whilst that of
                    the atmosphere is 64°. Here most of the cloth of the Campe-dano is fulled, the
                    makers of it paying to the proprietor for the use of the water.</p>
                <p>The climate of this kingdom varies excessively in the different provinces which
                    compose it. In Savoy, in the valley of Aosta, and between the Alps of Piedmont,
                    a real Swiss climate prevails. Often is to be seen in those valleys the summer
                    in its glorious garb, when the surrounding hills have their tops and sides
                    covered with snow. The air on them is too raw to bring forth the more tender
                    fruits of Italy; but in favoured spots the grapes ripen, and the sides of the
                    hills yield abundance of chestnuts. Though changeable, the air in these
                    districts is on the whole pure and healthful. The valley of Piedmont, according
                    to Saussure’s division, has the climate of the north region of Italy, where the
                    quicksilver falls below ten degrees. Even in the midst of summer the benumbing
                    Tramonta winds descend from the heights, and night-frosts, which begin in
                    November, continue till April. It is not unusual, in the neighbourhood of the
                    mountains, to see the ground covered with snow during ten or twelve days. It is,
                    however, not subject to the inconveniences of Southern Italy; and neither the
                    burning atmosphere of Calabria, nor the Sirocco, nor earthquakes, are
                    experienced, nor the annoyance of the sharp-biting musquito. The mulberry trees,
                    the vines, and the maize, flourish; and the air, when not in the vicinity of
                    rice-fields, has a balmy fragrance, and is remarkably pure and healthful. The
                    coasts of the kingdom, from Nice to Genoa, are protected by the Apennines from
                    the Tramonta winds, and the climate is that distinguished by Saussure as the
                    second region of Italy, in which the olives and the agrumens attain perfection;
                    but the evils of the Sirocco or Mistrol winds are too often felt in the whole of
                    the district.</p>
                <p>The island of Sardinia has some peculiarities of climate. In times of antiquity,
                    the unhealthiness of the island is alluded to by Martial, Cicero, Pausanias,
                    Cornelius Nepos, Strabo, Tacitus, and Claudian; and in later times the same
                    character is given it by Dante. The chief agent of this insalubrity is found in
                    the feculent miasma of marshes, beds of rivers and torrents, stagnant pools, and
                    putrescent vegetation, in the vicinity of which it is always found deleteriously
                    active, and which are well known to be quite adequate to the generation of
                    malignant fevers. The common disease, called here <hi rend="italic"
                    >intemperie,</hi> appears to be somewhat different from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >malaria</hi> of Sicily and Italy; for although equally or more acrimonious in
                    effect, it does not produce the swelled bodies and sallow skins which are the
                    pathognomonic symptoms of the latter. Both diseases usually commence when the
                    summer heat, assisted by slight showers, disengages the impure gases from the
                    low grounds; and continue till the end of No vember, when the heavy rains have
                    precipitated the miasma, and purified the air. But they differ, in as much as
                    malaria is generally supposed to be weak in its effects, unless imbibed during
                    sleep; whereas <hi rend="italic">intemperie,</hi> though worst at night, is
                    dangerous at all times. Instances have been known of strangers landing for a few
                    hours only, from Italian coasters, who were almost immediately carried off by
                    its virulence; indeed the very breathing of the air by a foreigner at night, or
                    in the cool of the evening, is considered as certain a death in some parts, as
                    if he had swallowed some poisonous drug. While the atmosphere is in this state,
                    the natives never move abroad until an hour after sunrise, and they hasten home
                    before sunset, carefully closing every door and window, or, if obliged to go
                    out, carefully holding a handkerchief before the mouth. The extreme heat of the
                    day is also carefully avoided, for they are apprehensive of the <hi
                    rend="italic">colpo di sole,</hi> or stroke of the sun, attributing its
                    frequency and fatal effects to the malignancy of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >intemperie.</hi></p>
                <p>It is agreed on all sides that fire is an excellent antidote to this evil; and it
                    is recorded that the Lords of Oristano were wont, during the unhealthy season,
                    to burn large fires around the town every night, to rarefy the mephitic
                    exhalations. Most of the people remove from the plains to the higher grounds on
                    St John’s day in June, when the air begins to be unsafe, although it does not
                    become dangerous before August. Those who, from their circumstances, are obliged
                    to remain, keep themselves well clad in thick woollens, to avert the ardent rays
                    of the sun. Exertion, exposure to summer showers, and fatigue of every kind, are
                    studiously avoided; and a spare but good diet is adopted, with cool acidulated
                    drinks. The migrations consequent on this distressing visitation, with the want
                    of cottages, pastures, and enclosures, and the many extensive commons, give the
                    plains of Sardinia a depopulated aspect, and may be adduced, among other causes,
                    as a reason for the comparatively low consideration in which this once most
                    fertile of the Tyrrhenian islands has been held. The contempt in which the
                    inhabitants of the plains are held by those of the mountains, with the large
                    fiefs in the hands of some of the nonresident nobles, are also serious obstacles
                    to improvement.</p>
                <p>The chief occupation of the inhabitants of this kingdom consists in the
                    cultivation of the land, and is accordingly as varied as the surface of the
                    soil, and as that of the climate, which depends on the elevation. Under the head
                    of <hi rend="smallcaps">Lombardy</hi> will be found a detailed account of the
                    agriculture of this district, the greater part of which may be adverted to as a
                    description of what takes place in the richer portion of Sardinia, which belongs
                    to the basin of the river Po, comprehending the greater part of the provinces of
                    Turin, Cuneo, and Alessandria. In Savoy generally the cultivation is badly
                    conducted. The cultivable land is divided into large portions, belonging to a
                    few great proprietors, and is subdivided into smaller portions to tenants, who,
                    without leases, transmit their lots from one generation to another, who pay
                    neither money-rent nor labour to their superiors, but deliver to them or their
                    agents one half the produce of the fields, whatever it may be, in its several
                    kinds. The cattle on these lands are commonly the property of the lord, and are
                    maintained on the produce of the soil, before the division is made of what it
                    yields. The power of the tenants to transmit the land to their successors is
                    combined with the power of subdividing it among their several children; and this
                    is carried to such an extent, as in Ireland and in some other countries, that it
                    has led, and is leading, to such a subdivision that a great number of the farms
                    barely raise sufficient food for the occupants, though their provisions are of
                    the most humble and penurious kind. Savoy is annually deficient in corn to the
                    extent of nearly one third of its consumption. This is in some measure made up
                    by using chestnuts and potatoes as substitutes for bread; though in Aosta and in
                    some other<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=704"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0704-0650"/> parts the potato is little cultivated, and in
                    them corn must be drawn from the neighbouring countries. The land on the coast
                    of Nice and Liguria consists chiefly of narrow strips of valley, which in the
                    greater portion is composed of sand, and not very appropriate for the growth of
                    grain, though a little is grown in some of the more fertile of the valleys; but
                    the common people only eat bread on Sundays and holidays, and at other times
                    subsist on chestnuts obtained from the Apennines, and on inferior cheese made by
                    themselves. They derive a part of their subsistence from fish, especially
                    sardinias, which at some seasons are abundant; and oil, a useful accompaniment,
                    is at a very moderate price.</p>
                <p>The agriculture of the island of Sardinia differs so much from that of the rest
                    of the kingdom, that it merits a special notice, the more so from its having
                    been, in ancient times, the source of supplies of grain to the continent of
                    Italy, and occasionally of Spain. The lands are divided into feudal and
                    non-feudal. The former comprise those belonging to the respective nobles, as
                    well as those sold to individuals, but recognising the feudal lord. Those not
                    feudal belong to communities or to individuals; for landed property can be let
                    or sold, or given away, with the consent of the tribunals, or of the husband if
                    belonging to married females. The first lands as to importance, though the least
                    in extent, are those called <hi rend="italic">tanche,</hi> or enclosed lands,
                    which are generally well cultivated. But the far larger proportion are those
                    called <hi rend="italic">vidazzone,</hi> or belonging to communities. They are
                    chiefly divided into three parts, each of which is cultivated in its turn, and,
                    while under culture, is enclosed with a line of hurdles; but the rest being
                    fallow, lies open to the ravages of wandering flocks, and the blast of every
                    wind that blows.</p>
                <p>The foreign commerce of Sardinia, both by sea and by land, with the countries
                    contiguous to it, naturally demands observation. The number and tonnage of the
                    vessels belonging to the kingdom are shown in the following table, furnished by
                    the British consul.</p>

                <p>The accounts for the last seven years are not to be procured; but there is reason
                    to believe that no very material increase has taken place during that period,
                    and that the proportion of the national vessels of the larger class has been
                    more augmented, while that of the smaller class has somewhat declined, as is
                    observable in the preceding table of the five years from 1827 to 1831.</p>
                <p>The chief articles which Sardinia imports from foreign countries are sugar,
                    coffee, spices, cotton wool, cotton manufactured, indigo, cochineal, and other
                    dyeing drugs, corn chiefly from the Black Sea, salted fish, salt, hides and
                    leather, iron, steel, lead, copper, pitch and tar, tobacco, and timber. There
                    are many smaller articles of luxury, whose aggregate amount bears hut a trifling
                    proportion in value to those here enumerated. The commerce in grain is casual,
                    depending in a great degree on the productiveness of the harvests in
                    Switzerland, to which country, when the domestic supply is found to be
                    insufficient, the corn, chiefly wheat from the ports of Odessa and Taganrog, is
                    transmitted to the Swiss districts bordering on the Sardinian territory.</p>

                <p>The most valuable product of Sardinia which is exported is silk, but it has
                    little connection with maritime commerce. The greater part of it, which goes to
                    other countries, is transported by land-carriage, in order to supply the
                    manufacturers of France, of Prussia, of Belgium, of Holland, and in some measure
                    of England; for even to the latter country much is now sent by land through
                    France, or by the Rhine. Oil is one of the greater productions exported from
                    Genoa, after being collected there by means of the numerous coasting vessels
                    with which the shores of Sardinia abound. The larger portion of this article is
                    sent to England, where it is used by the wool-combers in the manufacture of
                    cloth; but a considerable quantity of it is sent to Holland, and from thence
                    into the interior of Germany, where it is applied to the same purposes. Rice is
                    also exported by sea to France, though it can scarcely sustain the competition
                    with that which is produced in the East Indies or in Carolina. Though much wine
                    is made, it is almost wholly consumed at home, the quantity exported being
                    trifling. Fruit is an article of foreign trade; and soap, white lead, essences,
                    and perfumery, may he enumerated as the most prominent of the smaller<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=705"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0705-0651"/> articles of export. There is, however, a
                    considerable transit trade carried on through Genoa, by which many of the
                    products of the other parts of Italy are exchanged with those of France, to the
                    advantage of the commission-houses in that city.</p>
                <p>Before the seventeenth century, Genoa was the centre or channel of all the supply
                    of manufactured silks and velvets to the other parts of Europe; but at present
                    the manufacturing industry, as regards silk, is reduced to the point which the
                    internal consumption demands, or to the process of preparing the raw material
                    for the manufacturers of France, England, Holland, Germany, and Russia. For
                    domestic use, Sardinia has sufficient manufactories to supply with silk, linen,
                    or woollen goods, the demand for clothing. Their silks are handsome and strong,
                    especially the stockings; but, in the absence of the best descriptions of
                    machinery, they are dearer than elsewhere. Leather, iron goods, copper ware,
                    glass, pottery, and the smaller articles of the household, are made at home.</p>
                <p>As to the islanders, they are in so rude a state, that, in a commercial view,
                    they scarcely require to be noticed; as must be the case where every man is his
                    own tailor, shoemaker, spinner, weaver, tanner, carpenter, mason, and
                    blacksmith, and wants nothing but his fire-arms, or other weapons of
                    defence.</p>
