                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Under</hi> this title are commonly designated the sacred
                    books of the Jews and the Christians, in which are contained the revelation of
                    God’s will to mankind, and the principles of that religion which he has
                    inculcated upon us. In other parts of this work the reader will find articles
                    elucidatory of the claims preferred and of the doctrines taught in these books
                    (see especially <hi rend="smallcaps">Inspiration, Miracle, Prophecy,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Theology).</hi> In the present article it is proposed to
                    furnish an outline of what may be denominated <hi rend="italic">the
                    historicocritical knowledge of these books.</hi> In treating of this we have to
                    do with the composition, the history, the reputation, and the literary
                    characteristics of the sacred writings viewed simply as remains of ancient
                    literature.</p>
                <p>This department of investigation is comparatively of recent date. In the earlier
                    ages of the church the same necessity for such inquiries did not exist as now,
                    in consequence especially of the efforts which have been made in more recent
                    times to impugn the authenticity of the sacred documents; nor is it probable
                    that the early fathers, from the views which they entertained of the sole agency
                    of the Holy Spirit in the composition of these, would have deemed any inquiry
                    into their peculiarities, as the products at the same time of human agency,
                    other than impious and absurd (1). Since the time, however, when Spinoza issued
                    his attack upon the authenticity of the Pentateuch and the general inspiration
                    of the Scriptures (1670), and Richard Simon, a presbyter and fellow of the
                    oratory at Paris, followed with his acute, learned, and liberal investigations
                    into the critical history of the Old Testament (1678), this subject has occupied
                    the attentive study of critics and theologians of all confessions, and may now
                    be said to have reached the dignity of a <hi rend="italic">science</hi> (2).</p>
                <p>1. The prevailing notion among the Jews and the early Christians respecting
                    Inspiration was, that the faculties of the person inspired were completely
                    suspended and superseded during the afflatus, so that the only parts of him
                    actively engaged in the work of composition were his hands and his eyes. Philo
                    speaks of God as “using the organs of the prophets for the manifestation of his
                    will” (Θιβν <hi rend="italic">κατα,χouμΛiey rots ixtivui oςγαvo∣t vçeg</hi>
                    2t)λwm&gt; <hi rend="italic">ωt Wcληtrr∣, De Monarch.</hi> lib.i.ed. Mangey, t.
                    ii. p. 222); Justin Martyr compares them to the strings of a lyre, which produce
                    sounds just as they are touched by the hand of the player <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Cohort, ad Graces,</hi> c. 8); and Augustin frequently speaks of the
                    Scriptures as the “Chirograph of Deity,” and of their writers as “the stylus or
                    pen of the Holy Spirit.” The influence of such exclusive views in discouraging
                    any inquiries of a historicocritical nature is seen in the following sentence of
                    Gregory the Great: “Quis librum Job scripserit, valde superflue quaeritur, cum
                    tamen auctor libri Spiritus Sanctus fidelitercredatur. Ipse scripsit, qui et in
                    ejus opera inspirator extitit et per scribentis vocem imitandam ad nos facta
                    transmisit.” <hi rend="italic">(Moral, in Job.</hi> t. i. p. 7.) Ideas of a
                    similar kind are found in the writings of several of the older divines
                    subsequent to the Reformation. For the opinions most generally received among
                    Protestant divines in the present day, see Henderson’s Lectures on Inspiration,
                    London, 1836, the latest and best book upon this subject</p>
                <p>2. Spinoza’s work is entitled “Tractatus historicopoliticus, continens
                    dissertationes aliquot, quibus ostenditur, libertatem philosophandi non solum
                    salva pietate et reipublicae pace posse concedi; sed∙candem nisi cum pace
                    reipublicae ipsaque pietate tolli non posse,” Hamburgi, 1670, 4to. Simon’s
                    “Histoire critique du Vieux Testament” appeared in one vol. 4to, in 1678 at
                    Paris; but a fuller and more correct edition was published at Rotterdam in 1685,
                    superintended, in all probability, by the author. It produced numerous replies
                    and strictures, from the pens both of Catholic and Protestant divines, of which
                    the most important were those of Spanheim <hi rend="italic">(Lettre sur l'Hist.

                    latter, whilst reproving Simon, indulged certain speculations of their own,
                    which were considerably too free for the age in which they lived, and which drew
                    down upon them, along with the object of their strictures, the censures of the
                    acute and ingenious Bossuet <hi rend="italic">(Dicers Traités contre Mr B.
                    Simon, Du Pin, et autres. OEuvres Posthumes,</hi> t. ii. 1753). In more recent
                    times the scholars of Germany have chiefly distinguished themselves in this
                    department of inquiry. Their most valuable works are those of Carpzov <hi

                    >ai γφcφa∣; τα iιga γgaμ-μara, 2</hi> Tim. iii. 15. At an early period of the
                    Christian era, the term <hi rend="italic">Sιair∣xn</hi> began to be affixed to
                    the Scriptures as the documents unfolding God’s <hi rend="italic">covenant;</hi>
                    and their two great divisions to be designated as <hi rend="italic">ή πaλaιa

                    though it is only in the writings of Origen that it makes its appearance for the

                    Scriptures.</hi></p>
                <p>The greater part of the Old Testament Scriptures is composed in pure Hebrew, the
                    most ancient language of which we have any specimen extant. This language
                    belongs to a class of tongues formerly called, by way of eminence, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Oriental,</hi> but now more appropriately discrimi nated by the
                    term <hi rend="italic">Semitic</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Shemitic,</hi> from
                    Shem, the great progenitor of the races by which they are spoken (1). This class
                    embraces three leading tongues, corresponding in general character and relation
                    to the geographical situations of the respective nations by which they were
                    used; the <hi rend="italic">Aramaic</hi> abounding in combinations of
                    consonants, and consequently marked by considerable harshness of pronunciation,
                    employed by the nations of the northern and more mountainous districts of Syria,
                    Mesopotamia, and Babylonia; the <hi rend="italic">Arabic,</hi> remarkable for
                    richness, melifluousness, and the preponderance of vowels, spoken by the
                    inhabitants of the warm and open plains of Arabia and Ethiopia; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hebrew,</hi> the language of the middle district, possessing an
                    intermediate character between the other two, richer than the Aramaic, poorer
                    and harsher than the Arabic (2). The opinion that Hebrew was the original
                    language of the world, and the mother of all the other Semitic tongues, is now
                    generally relinquished by scholars, who content themselves with the more
                    moderate hypothesis, that it is the oldest daughter of the primeval tongue, and
                    that which retains the most striking resemblances to the mother speech of the
                    antediluvian period (3). In the earliest books of the Bible, those of Moses,
                    this language appears in its greatest purity; nor did it sustain any decided
                    deterioration till after the Babylonian captivity. The attempts of some
                    Hebraists to divide its history into a golden, a silver, a brazen, and an iron
                    age, are by the most accurate scholars rejected, as much more fanciful than
                    sound (4). The Hebrew of the Scriptures is the pure classical Jerusalem Hebrew,
                    the language of the temple and of the court. That there were dialects more or
                    less corrupt in the provinces, is attested by the sacred writers themselves.
                    Thus they tell us that the Ephraimites could not distinguish between the <hi
                    rend="italic">w</hi> and the P in pronunciation (Judges, xii. 6); Nehemiah was
                    indignant that part of the people should speak “in the speech (dialect) of
                    Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab” (Nehem, xiii. 23-25); and the dialect of Galilee
                    is mentioned in the New Testament (Matt, xxvi. 73) (5).</p>
                <p>1. The first to use this term seems to have been Nicoas Fuller, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Miscellanea Sacra.</hi> He was followed by Eichhorn, and
                    ultimately by nearly all the orientalists of Germany.</p>

                    Testament, there are only two distinct periods characteristically discriminated,
                    the one comprehending the books written before, and the other those written
                    during and subsequent to the exile.” Gesenius, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der

                <p>The portions of the Old Testament not in pure Hebrew are Ezra, iv. 8,—vi. 18, and
                    vii. 12-26; Jer. x. 11; and Daniel, ii. 4,—vii. 28. These are in Chaldaic or
                    Eastern Aramaic, and have reference chiefly to the history of the captivity, and
                    the events following its close.</p>

                <p>As ancient literary documents, the Scriptures lay claim to be regarded as both
                    <hi rend="italic">genuine</hi> or <hi rend="italic">authentic,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">credible.</hi><pb break="no"

                    book is <hi rend="italic">genuine</hi> when it really is what it professes to
                    be, as the composition of a particular individual, or as produced under
                    particular circumstances, and at a certain place and time; as opposed to a book
                    which appears under a <hi rend="italic">forged</hi> title. A book is <hi
                    rend="italic">credible</hi> when the statements it contains are physically true;
                    as opposed to a book the contents of which are <hi rend="italic">false</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">fictitious.</hi> Both these qualitics may meet in the same
                    work, or they may exist separately in separate works. Thus the book of Genesis
                    may be the composition of Moses, and yet be fabulous; or it may be true in all
                    its statements, and yet not be the work of Moses; or it may be, as it is
                    generally believed to be, both the production of Moses and true, both genuine
                    and credible.</p>
                <p>The genuineness and credibility of the sacred books form matter of separate
                    investigation and proof. At the same time, they are so connected, that the proof
                    of the one paves the way for the proof of the other; for, in the case of such
                    works, it is highly improbable that truth would be issued under a forged name,
                    or that such men as Moses, Samuel, or the Evangelists, would or could issue
                    fictitious narratives as true. It is not, however, matter of indifference which
                    of them we establish first. Before we can set ourselves to prove their
                    credibility, we must be in circumstances to show their genuineness; for unless
                    we can do this, a preliminary difficulty will lie in the way of the former, from
                    the suspicion that these books appear with a falsehood, or at least what has not
                    been shown to be a truth, upon their front; a work of supposititious authorship
                    being always <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> less credible than one which is
                    the genuine production of the writer to whom it is ascribed.</p>
                <p>The proof of the genuineness of the Sacred Scriptures rests upon the following
                    considerations:</p>
                <p>1. There is no antecedent impossibility that they should be genuine. It cannot be
                    showm that it was impossible for Moses to have written the Pentateuch, Isaiah
                    and the other prophets their prophecies, the Evangelists their gospels, the
                    Apostles their epistles, or for the books which are anonymous to have been
                    composed under the circumstances which they profess; nor that, being composed,
                    it was impossible for them to have been preserved and handed down from
                    generation to generation.</p>
                <p>2. Circumstances were favourable to the preservation of these books, supposing
                    them written. The Old Testament books professedly form the national literature,
                    as well as the sacred documents of the Jews, and would naturally be carefully
                    preserved by them. The New Testament books constitute the religious archives and
                    statute-books of the Christian church, and would from their first publication be
                    sacredly conserved by those for whom they were so deeply interesting.</p>
                <p>3. It is matter of undeniable history, that both Jews and Christians did possess
                    certain sacred books, which they regarded with the utmost reverence, and
                    preserved with the greatest care. The only question, then, is, Are the books
                    which we possess the same as those thus reverenced and preserved? And, <hi
                    rend="italic">first,</hi> with respect to those of the Old Testament.</p>
                <p>i. These are the books which were recognised in the early church as the sacred
                    books of the Jews. This is placed beyond doubt by the early versions of
                    Scripture, and. by the catalogues of Athanasius, Epiphanius, Jerome, Origen, and
                    Melito bishop of Sardis. Lardner, Works, vol. iv. p. 290, 8vo ed.</p>
                <p>ii. The books of the Old Testament which we possess must have been extant <hi
                    rend="italic">at the commencement</hi> of the Christian era. This is evident
                    from the allusions to them, and the quotations from them, in the New Testament,
                    but especially from the testimony of Philo, an Egyptian Jew, who at the latest
                    was contemporary with the apostles, and also of Josephus, himself a priest of
                    the Jews, and consequently accurately informed, on all matters relating to their
                    sacred books, and who lived in the latter part of the first century of the
                    Christian era. Philo gives no formal catalogue, but quotes from or refers to
                    nearly all the books of the Old Testament, while no other is mentioned by him as
                    of accredited authority. Josephus, besides frequent quotations and allusions,
                    gives (C <hi rend="italic">ont. Apion,</hi> lib. i. c. 8) a catalogue of the
                    sacred books of his nation, assigning five to Moses, thirteen to the prophets,
                    and four to the writers of hymns and moral maxims. This, if we regard Judges and
                    Ruth as one book, and add the Lamentations to the Prophecies of Jeremiah, which
                    there is good reason to believe was the case in the days of Josephus, gives
                    exactly the number of the books now extant.</p>

                <p>iii. These books must have been written <hi rend="italic">long before</hi> the
                    Christian era. This is plain from the fact of targums or explanations of them
                    into the Syro-Chaldaic dialect, which was the language of the people, having
                    been made for a long course of years antecedent to the times of Onkelos and
                    Jonathan Ben Uzziel, by whom they were collected in the form now extant, and who
                    lived probably near the days of our Lord; from the allusions to the sacred books
                    of his nation already quoted from the prologue to the work of Jesus the son of
                    Sirach, which was composed about 230 years <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c.; and
                    from the existence of the Septuagint version, which was at least commenced 280
                    years <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c.</p>
                <p>iv. Under such circumstances, the forgery of these books was morally impossible.
                    If such a thing took place, it must have been during the 140 years which elapsed
                    between the death of Malachi, the last of the prophets, and the execution of the
                    Septuagint version. But, first, it is inconceivable that, in so short a period,
                    and in an age when literature was not a trade, a set of men (for the agency of
                    only one man is out of the question) should have appeared in the land of Judaea,
                    all endowed with genius sufficient to share in the composition of such works,
                    and all infected with the spirit of literary dishonesty, so as to act the part
                    of forgers. Secondly, even supposing such a piece of deception attempted, it is
                    inconceivable how it should have succeeded, as, by the holders of this
                    hypothesis, it must be allowed to have done. As the whole nation of the Jews
                    acknowledged these books, we must suppose, either that they were all imposed
                    upon in the matter, or that they all agreed to impose upon the rest of the
                    world. But no ingenuity can suffice to persuade a nation that they have for ages
                    possessed sacred books, when they know they have not; and a national agreement
                    to sanction a forgery and tell the world a lie, is a hypothesis too extravagant
                    to be for a moment entertained. Thirdly, the opinions expressed in these books,
                    the doctrines taught, and the duties enjoined, are so averse from those most
                    cherished by the Jews at the time the supposed forgery must have taken place,
                    and the facts recorded are so little flattering, upon the whole, to the pride of
                    the nation, that it is quite incredible, either that any should have been found
                    to write them, or that, being written, they should have been received by the
                    people with any other feelings than those of execration and abhorrence. The
                    respect in which they were held can be accounted for only on the principle, that
                    it was rendered to the <hi rend="italic">venerable antiquity</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">indisputable authority</hi> with which they were invested.</p>
                <p>v. The force of this conclusion is heightened by the circumstance, that while all
                    testimony is in favour of the genuineness of these books, not one witness can be
                    produced whose evidence is incompatible with this.</p>
                <p>vi. When we apply to the contents of these books such<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=847" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0847-0783"/>
                    tests as are best fitted to try their genuineness, the result is such as to
                    confirm our previous conclusion. 1. They display just such a diversity of
                    talent, style, and character, as we should expect in works composed by different
                    authors at different times. 2. They are written, with a few slight exceptions,
                    in pure Hebrew, a language which we know to have been that of the Jews before
                    the captivity, but the knowledge of which as a vernacular tongue was entirely
                    lost very shortly afterwards. 3. Whilst they use the same language, there are
                    certain grammatical and linguistic differences between the early and the later
                    writers, indicative of such changes as all languages experience in the lapse of
                    time, but less extensive than those found in others of the ancient tongues;
                    which is exactly what might have been expected in the case of persons using,
                    through a long interval, a language which, though exposed to causes of change,
                    was, from the fixed and exclusive habits of those speaking it, less liable to be
                    affected in this way than the languages of more versatile and cosmopolitan
                    nations. 4. The narratives occurring in these books are marked by that minute
                    accuracy and circumstantiality of detail which a forger generally endeavours to
                    avoid, but into which a true witness naturally falls, from having all these
                    details present to his mind as integral parts of the occurrence which he
                    attests, <hi rend="italic">as it presented itself to his senses.</hi> 5. There
                    is, amidst the greatest elevation of thought and sublimity of conception, a
                    chastened simplicity of language, and, amidst the utmost variety of manner,
                    style, and illustration, an essential unity of doctrine, which comports well
                    with the claims of these books to be regarded as the sacred books of the Jews,
                    and seems strongly incompatible with the supposition that they are
                    forgeries.</p>
                <p>For these reasons, it is affirmed that, the books which we now possess are the
                    same as those which were always possessed and held genuine by the Jews. We turn,
                    <hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi> to the New Testament, and inquire whether the
                    same evidence of its genuineness can be furnished.</p>
                <p>i. No person doubts the existence of the New Testament books from the close of
                    the <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> century of the Christian era downwards,
                    because the fact is so notorious, that to deny it would be to discredit all
                    historical testimony.</p>
                <p>ii. As little can it be doubted that they were extant from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >commencement</hi> of that century. Not only are they frequently quoted by
                    writers who lived during that period, but we possess <hi rend="italic">ten</hi>
                    distinct catalogues of the New Testament books, issued during this century, of
                    which six are identical with our present canon (1), three omit only the book of
                    Revelation (2), and one omits this book and the Epistle to the Hebrews (3),
                    though both are mentioned in other parts of the author’s writings.</p>
                <p>1. Those of the forty-four bishops at the Council of Carthage <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(a.d</hi>. 897), of Augustin <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d</hi>.

                <p>3. That of Philaster or Philastrius, bishop of Brixia or Brescia <hi

                <p>iii. Their existence in the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> century is placed
                    equally beyond doubt, from the careful and explicit testimony of Eusebius, who
                    wrote <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> D. 315; from the references to them in the
                    writings of the apologists Arnobius Afer and Lactantius (cir. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> D. 300); from the testimonies contained in fragments
                    preserved from numerous writers in that century, especially Victorinus bishop of
                    Pettau, in Germany, who refers to nearly every book in the New Testament; from
                    the commentaries upon them and quotations from them of Origen <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(a.</hi> D. 253); from the quotations of Cyprian <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(a.</hi> D. 258); and from references to them in the re mains
                    of a number of writers who lived during the first thirty years of the third
                    century.</p>
                <p>Lardner, Works, vol. ii. pp. 397—430.</p>
                <p>iv. For their existence in the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> century, we have
                    abundant evidence, in the quotations from them and allusions to them in the
                    writings of Tertullian <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.</hi> D. 200), Clement of
                    Alexandria, Athenagoras <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.</hi> D. 180), Irenaeus <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(a.</hi> D. 170), Justin Martyr <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.</hi>
                    D. 150), and Papias <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.</hi> D. 113), and in the Harmony of
                    the Gospels by Tatian <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.</hi> D. 170).</p>
                <p>v. Collateral with these testimonies of the orthodox fathers are those of the
                    early heretics, Cerinthus, the Ebionites, the Basilidians, Marcion, and others,
                    who, by denouncing the writings of the apostles, as containing error, thereby
                    attest the existence and genuineness of these writings; and of the early
                    opponents of Christianity, Celsus, Porphyry, and Julian, who, by the notice they
                    take of these books, show how much in their day their genuineness was matter of
                    public notoriety.</p>
                <p>vi. We have thus traced up the existence of these books to the close of the <hi
                    rend="italic">first</hi> century. To say nothing of the testimony in their
                    favour of the apostolic fathers, Barnabas, Clement of Rome, Hennas, Ignatius,
                    and Polycarp, who flourished during that century, and reached up to the days of
                    the apostles, the supposition of a forgery at that time is clearly absurd.
                    Whilst men were still alive whose fathers were the contemporaries of the
                    evangelists and apostles, how could any one impose upon the community as the
                    production of the latter what was only forged in their name? or whilst the
                    churches at Rome, Colossae, Corinth, and other places, were still existing, who
                    could have persuaded them to receive as Paul’s letters to them what they knew
                    Paul had never sent to them? or how can we conceive that an attempt so audacious
                    would have been allowed to pass, without a single voice being raised in any
                    quarter to denounce the imposture?</p>
                <p>vii. The conclusion thus gained by the consideration of external testimony is
                    forcibly confirmed by the contents of the books themselves. The <hi
                    rend="italic">language</hi> in which they are written is exactly such as a Jew
                    of the first century would naturally fall into in attempting to write Greek, and
                    such as could hardly have been thought of or imitated by a later writer. The <hi
                    rend="italic">style</hi> of composition is such as a forger could not possibly
                    have hit upon; it has so much of a prevailing simplicity and earnestness, and at
                    the same time is so suitably diversified in the different books, that it bears
                    every indication of having flowed from the pens of the simple-minded,
                    unambitious, uneducated, and honest men to whom it is ascribed. The <hi
                    rend="italic">sentiments</hi> are such as we cannot suppose men of sufficiently
                    depraved moral habits to act the part of forgers, to have conceived or
                    inculcated. And above all, the <hi rend="italic">minute circumstantiality</hi>
                    of the narrative is such as, on the one hand, strikingly indicates the agency of
                    an eye and ear witness in the composition of it, and on the other, affords too
                    many tests of the author’s personal familiarity with what he narrates, to have
                    been ventured on by a forger. The striking coincidence of one part of the volume
                    with another may also be mentioned as a further evidence of its genuineness.</p>
                <p>For these reasons it is concluded, that the Scriptures of the Old and New
                    Testament are the genuine productions of those to whom they are ascribed. They
                    are reasons which must satisfy every person familiar with such inquiries, that
                    we possess in favour of the genuineness of these books a far larger and more
                    unquestionable body of proof, than we have in favour of the genuineness of any
                    of the ancient classics, and indeed of much even of comparatively modern
                    literature.</p>

                    Books.</hi></p>
                <p>Closely connected with the question of the genuineness of the Scriptures is the
                    question of their <hi rend="italic">integrity,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >uncor-rupted preservation.</hi> Infidels have often asserted, that extensive
                    and important changes have been made upon the original documents, especially
                    upon those of the Old Testament. But,</p>
                <p>1. Of this there is no proof. It is a mere unsupported assertion on their part,
                    resting upon nothing but certain <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> conclusions to
                    which they profess to have come, as to the <hi rend="italic">probability</hi> of
                    such a thing. To prove it, we should require some competent historical testimony
                    to the fact, or an articulate comparison of the alleged interpolations with the
                    original text.</p>
                <p>2. Such interpolations could have been perpetrated only by universal consent on
                    the part of all possessing these documents. Had one man altered his own copy,
                    and published his alterations, the only result would have been certain
                    discrepancies between the readings of that family of manuscripts of which his
                    copy was the parent, and those of other families, unless he could have persuaded
                    the whole nation of the Jews, or the entire body of the Christians, as the case
                    might be, to adopt his innovations,—a supposition plainly impossible.</p>
                <p>3. Had extensive alterations taken place, the harmony of Scripture would have
                    been destroyed. A number of separate books are written by different persons, for
                    the purpose of unfolding under different aspects and modifications one
                    harmonious system of truth. The result is a harmonious work. But some person,
                    for purposes of his own, sets about interpolating these books. Is it conceivable
                    that this should have been accomplished with such exquisite skill and
                    adroitness, that the original harmony of the work should have been preserved,
                    and all vestiges of a spurious intermixture concealed?</p>
                <p>4. It is morally certain, that previous to the Christian era, the Jews did not
                    alter their sacred books. For this we have sufficient security in the habits and
                    circumstances of the people. The Bible was their national statute-book; on it
                    the whole of their civil economy, and all their political and judicial
                    procedure, rested. They were in the habit of giving the utmost publicity to its
                    contents; kings were required to study it continually, priests were appointed to
                    teach it to the people, and fathers were enjoined to inculcate it upon their
                    children, so that the idea of connivance among the members of any class in the
                    community for the purpose of falsifying it is entirely precluded. Their law
                    contains a solemn prohibitory statute against any, the slightest, alterations of
                    these books, Deut. v. 2, xii. 32. The rival sects which arose among them after
                    their return from Babylon served the same purpose, by acting as mutual checks
                    upon each other. And, finally, in the absence of any censure by our Lord upon
                    the Jews, whose crimes he faithfully exposed, for their treatment of the sacred
                    text, and in his continual references to the Old Testament in the state in which
                    it was then extant, as containing an accurate record of God’s will, we have the
                    best assurance that no liberty affecting its perfect integrity had been taken
                    with it previous to his advent.</p>
                <p>5. Since the commencement of the Christian era, it is equally certain that no
                    intentional corruption of the Old Testament Scriptures can have taken place. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Jews</hi> have not corrupted them, for they have ever shown
                    too deep a reverence for every word and letter of these books to have done so;
                    they have been too much scattered and disunited to have agreed upon any such
                    attempt; they would not have left so many statements condemnatory of themselves
                    and favourable to Christianity had they set about altering their own Scriptures;
                    and they have since that time been so much under the eye of Christians, that any
                    such attempt on their part would immediately have been detected and denounced by
                    the latter. <hi rend="italic">Christians</hi> have not done it; for, to say
                    nothing of the fact, that hardly any Christian has been sufficiently master of
                    the Hebrew language to execute skilfully any such alterations, the attempt on
                    their part to do such a thing would have been immediately discovered and exposed
                    by the Jews.</p>
                <p>6. As impossible is it that any corruption has taken place in the Christian
                    Scriptures. It is plain that this could not have occurred during the lives of
                    their authors, nor whilst the autographs of their works were extant. But in some
                    cases before, and in others immediately after, the death of the inspired
                    writers, copies of their writings were multiplied to a great extent, and
                    disseminated over the whole Christian world. It could only therefore have been
                    by the general consent of all Christians, that any material alterations could
                    have been made on these writings; for if one sect or party had interpolated
                    their copies, this could not have affected the copies of others, and would have
                    been detected and denounced by them. But the idea of a general consent of
                    Christians in all parts of the world to falsify their own documents, is one too
                    extravagant to be admitted.</p>
                <p>7. The agreement of versions and of manuscripts, both of the Old Testament
                    Scriptures and of the New, is a corroborative evidence of their integrity. The
                    number of early versions is considerable, and among them so great a harmony
                    prevails, that it is undeniable they must have been made from a common original,
                    and that that original must have been the same as we now possess. The same
                    conclusion is attested by the agreement of the manuscripts. Of these nearly 1150
                    containing the whole or parts of the Old Testament, and about 700 containing the
                    whole or parts of the New Testament, have been collated, without any material
                    discrepancy having been elicited (1); a fact which is utterly irreconcileable
                    with the supposition of any designed interpolations having been so much as
                    attempted by any class or party, either of Jews or of Christians (2).</p>
                <p>1 Rosenmüller observes respecting the codices of the Old Testament, “Ii qui hodie
                    exstant codices omnes ita inter se conspirant, ut ex aliquot centenis variis
                    lectionibus vix una deprehendatur quoe sensum mutet. Circa unam duntaxat vel
                    alteram litteram, Vocalem vel Accentum versantur. Quod quidem argumento est,
                    Veteris Testamenti libros, prouti eos nunc legimus, ex unius, quam dicunt,
                    recensionis codicibus ad nos transmissos esse, atque omnes codices, antiquiores
                    aeque qui perierunt, ac recentiores quos habemus tanquam a communi fonte
                    fluxisse.” <hi rend="italic">(Proef. ad Edit. Stereotypam Hahnii Bib. Heb.</hi>

                <p>That these books, in their narrative parts, contain statements of actual facts,
                    is sufficiently established by various considerations.</p>
                <p>1. The things narrated are such as their writers were fully competent to attest.
                    For the most part they were eye and ear witnesses of what they record; and where
                    this was not the case, they were placed in circumstances the most favourable for
                    gaining information from first sources as to the facts they narrate. They are,
                    in fact, with one or two partial exceptions, what very few of the ancient
                    historians are, annalists of their own times.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=849" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0849-0785"/>
                    2. The matters which they record were such as they could not possibly be
                    deceived about. They are such as any man with the use of his senses, and an
                    ordinary portion of discrimination, was as fully competent to judge of as the
                    most profound philosopher. The passage of the Red Sea, for instance, or the
                    re-appearance of our Lord after his death, was a fact respecting which no man in
                    his senses could be deceived. Unless the sacred writers were the wildest
                    enthusiasts (of which, however, no trace is discoverable in any other part of
                    their conduct, but the contrary), they could not have been misled into the
                    belief that they had seen such things, if they had not seen them.</p>
                <p>3. The blameless character and disinterested fidelity of these witnesses show
                    that they were not themselves deceivers. The mind of man is subject to certain
                    laws, upon which we may calculate with the same security as upon the laws of
                    matter; and one of these is, that no man of generally irreproachable character
                    will deliberately and pertinaciously propagate a falsehood, save under the
                    influence of very strong temptation. Now the sacred writers were men of
                    blameless character, so that if their narrative be false, it can only have been
                    under the stress of very urgent necessity or sinister inducement that they can
                    he supposed to have promulgated it. But where was this stress in their case?
                    What evil had they to shun, what prodigious advantage to gain, by falsehood? On
                    the contrary, did not their adherence to their story expose many of them to the
                    severest privations and the cruelest sufferings, even to death itself? Do men,
                    then, ever so fall in love with falsehood as to consecrate their lives to its
                    propagation, and willingly to endure every species of contumely, persecution,
                    and oppression, rather than relinquish it? Would not such a thing be a moral
                    miracle, infinitely more incredible than any of those which the sacred writers
                    narrate, because, unlike theirs, performed not only without the affirmation of
                    divine agency, but in direct opposition to the law of the God of truth?</p>
                <p>4. Their narratives were published at a time when the events they record were so
                    recent that it outrages all probability to suppose, either that they would have
                    had the audacity to publish what was false, or that their falsehoods would have
                    been allowed to descend to posterity uncontradicted. Who can for a moment
                    imagine, that had the Israelites not crossed the Red Sea in the manner described
                    by Moses, he could have persuaded them to believe that they had? or that the
                    facts of our Lord’s history could have been palmed upon the world when there
                    were so many still alive both interested in and competent for their refutation,
                    had they not really occurred?</p>
                <p>5. These histories account satisfactorily for numerous undeniable facts that are
                    otherwise unaccountable, such as the existence and present state of the Jews,
                    the existence and propagation of Christianity, and the prevalence of certain
                    rites and ceremonies among Jews and Christians, such as circumcision in its
                    religious aspect, the weekly Sabbath, the Lord’s Supper, &amp;c. They further
                    tally with the testimony of profane history, in as far as the field is common to
                    both. They “interweave themselves,” as Dr Channing has well observed, “with real
                    history so naturally and intimately, as to furnish no clue for detection, as to
                    exclude the appearance of incongruity and discordance, and as to give an
                    adequate explanation, and the only explanation, of acknowledged events of the
                    most important revolutions in society.” That such narratives should be
                    fictitious, the same writer justly concludes, “is a supposition from which an
                    intelligent man at once revolts, and which, if admitted, would shake a principal
                    foundation of history.” Discourse on the Evidences of Revealed Religion, p. 34,

                <p>The Greek word <hi rend="italic">χαvωv</hi> signifies originally a <hi

                    a <hi rend="italic">rule,</hi> and hence a <hi rend="italic">list</hi> or <hi

                    things contained in it.</p>
                <p>In this last sense it is applied to the Scriptures, but with a different
                    reference, according as it is used in inquiries of a dogmatical or in inquiries
                    of a historicocritical nature. In the former, it means the list of books deemed
                    <hi rend="italic">inspired;</hi> in the latter, the list of books recognised as
                    <hi rend="italic">genuine</hi> by Jews and Christians. In either case, such
                    books are opposed to those that are <hi rend="italic">apocryphal (ἀποχϑυφα,</hi>
                    “ea scripta quibus <hi rend="italic">publice</hi> ecclesia non utebatur, sed <hi

                <p>In regard to the sacred writings, both these lists are so far identical, that all
                    the books which are found in the former are found also in the latter.</p>
                <p>An ancient and not improbable tradition represents Ezra as the person who formed
                    the Jewish canon in its present state; but this can only mean that he made it up
                    as far as the books composing it were written in his day. It is generally
                    supposed that Nehemiah, who is said to have collected a <hi rend="italic"
                    >βιζλιοθηχη</hi> of the sacred books (2d Macc. ii. 13), and Malachi, the last of
                    the prophets, closed the canon by adding to it their own writings; though some
                    affirm that the list was not finally made up until about the time of the Syrian
                    invasion under Antiochus Epiphanes, in the third century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c</hi>. Certain it is that by that time all the books now extant had been
                    composed and arranged in their present order, as they not only were then
                    translated into Greek, but are spoken of by Jesus Siracides, who lived about two
                    hundred years <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi> as divided into three classes,
                    and as of considerable antiquity.</p>
                <p>At what time the canon of the New Testament was made up we have not the means of
                    accurately determining. We arc sure, however, that from a very early age these
                    writings were collected, and were referred to in their collected character, as
                    the received documents of the Christian community. Tertullian does so repeatedly
                    in his writings, denominating them sometimes “the New Testament,” and sometimes
                    “the Divine Instrument,” in the singular number. The collection was doubtless
                    made gradually; and from what we learn from Eusebius respecting a distinction
                    between books <hi rend="italic">ὁμολογουμεvα</hi> and books ἀ <hi rend="italic"

                    244), it would appear that the claims of every book were carefully weighed
                    before its canonicity was admitted.</p>

                    Testament Scriptures.</hi></p>
                <p>The history of the Hebrew text may be divided into three great epochs. The <hi
                    rend="italic">first</hi> of these reaches from the completion of the Alexandrian
                    Greek version to the times of Origen, Jerome, and the Talmud, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 300— <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d</hi>. 500. During
                    this period the use of the Greek version had very much superseded, even in
                    Palestine, the original Hebrew; but ample compensation for this has been
                    rendered by the aid which the existence of this and of other versions has
                    afforded the critic in settling the Hebrew text. Important service was rendered
                    by Origen’s critical revision of the Greek, and Jerome’s revision of the Latin
                    versions. Nor were the Jews behind the Christians in this respect, for we find
                    from the Talmud evidence that already had various readings begun to be collected
                    by them.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Talmud, Hierosol. Tract. Thaanit.</hi> fob lxviii., it
                    is said of certain various readings, that “they have come down from the times
                    when the temple was yet standing.” Capeili <hi rend="italic">Critica Sacra,</hi>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">second</hi> epoch reaches from the times of Jerome and the
                    Talmud to that of Ben-Asher and Ben-Naphthali, that is, from the sixth to the
                    eleventh century. About the commencement of this period the Masorah, or
                    collection of traditionary observations, orthographical, critical, grammatical,
                    and exegetical, which had been accumulating for upwards of three centuries among
                    the Jewish rabbin, was made by a college of leaτned Jews at Tiberias in
                    Palestine. To this mass of scholia additions were continually made, as well as
                    corrections proposed on it, by the <hi rend="italic">Lords of the Masorah</hi>
                    (בעלי חמםורח), as they were called, until the time of Jacob Ben Ha-yim, by whom
                    the whole was completed and printed along with the Hebrew text in the year 1526.
                    The commencement of the eleventh century is memorable in the history of the
                    Hebrew text, from the circumstance of two recensions having been issued by the
                    heads of two celebrated Jewish academies; by Aaron Ben Asher, principal of the
                    academy of Tiberias, and Jacob Ben Naphthali, principal of the academy of
                    Babylon. These have given rise to the various readings denominated the
                    occidental and the oriental respectively. By them also the last hand was put to
                    the pointing of the Hebrew text.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">third</hi> epoch reaches from the beginning of the eleventh
                    century to the middle of the eighteenth. About the year 1040 many learned Jews,
                    banished from the cast, took refuge in Europe, and brought with them their
                    Scriptures and their critical learning. Maimonides, Jarchi, Ebenezra, Kimchi,
                    and others, rendered additional service as to the interpretation, so also to the
                    criticism, of the sacred text. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries
                    Todrosius, Me-nachem, and Sal. Norzi, collected various readings. In 1477 the
                    first scriptural book in Hebrew, in 1488 the entire Hebrew Bible for the first
                    time, was printed; the latter at Soncino, the former at some place unknown. Of
                    great importance is the so-called <hi rend="italic">Rabbinical Bible,</hi>
                    printed at •Venice in 1526, and edited by Ben Ha-yim. Among Chris tian editors,
                    Sebastian Münster was the first who issued an edition of the Hebrew Bible, with
                    various readings, Basil., 1535. The editions of Jablonski, Berlin, 1699, and of
                    Van der Hooght, Amsterdam, 1705, are worthy of notice as critical editions. John
                    Henry Michaelis published his edition at Halle in 1720, for which he collated
                    five manuscripts and nineteen editions. In 1753, at Paris, appeared the edition
                    of Charles Francis Houbigant, for which twelve manuscripts were collated, but
                    the value of which is greatly impaired by the editor’s propensity to conjectural
                    emendation, and by his attaching such undue importance to the readings of the
                    Septuagint. The splendid work of Kennicot (Oxford, t. i. 1776, ii. 1780)
                    presents the largest mass of various readings yet collected; but the want of
                    scientific discrimination as to their relative value has impaired the usefulness
                    of the collection. The same may be said of the various readings collected by De
                    Rossi, Parma, 1784-1788.</p>

                    Text of the New Testament Scriptures.</hi></p>
                <p>In regard to the <hi rend="italic">Greek</hi> text of the New Testament, the
                    first thing to be considered is the variety of opinion among critics respecting
                    the different <hi rend="italic">recensions,</hi> as they have been termed, or
                    <hi rend="italic">classes</hi> of documents containing the original text. Of
                    these documents, some more, and others less, closely resemble each other as
                    respects the nature and selection of their readings, and not unfrequently traces
                    of a common origin in the older codices and versions arc apparent. This has led
                    to the idea of arranging these into <hi rend="italic">classes,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">families,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">recensions,</hi> an idea first
                    started by Bengel and Semler ( I ), and which has been carried out by several
                    more recent inquirers. Bengel concluded that there are two families of
                    manuscripts, the African and Asiatic, of the former of which the Alexandrian
                    manuscript is the sole representative (with which agree the Ethiopic, the
                    Coptic, and the ancient Latin versions), whereas the latter is very numerous.
                    After Bengel came Griesbach (2), who contended for a threefold recension, the
                    Western, the Alexandrian or Eastern, and the Constantinopolitan or Byzantine. Of
                    these, the two former are the oldest, and are by him attributed to the same age.
                    They differ, in that the Western text is more replete with Hebraisms, with
                    explanatory additions, and with occasional substitutions of a perspicuous
                    formula for one more difficult; whilst the Eastern prefers those readings that
                    are accommodated to the classic Greek, corrects phrases that are less pure, and
                    is less deformed by errors of the transcriber, though particles and synonyms are
                    occasionally omitted through haste. The Constantinopolitan has arisen from the
                    mingling of the readings of the other two. It properly consists of <hi
                    rend="italic">two</hi> recensions; a senior (fourth century), even more fond of
                    pure Greek forms, and richer in glosses, than the Alexandrian itself; and a
                    junior (fifth or sixth century), which appears to have been formed after a new
                    collation of the senior with the Eastern and Alexandrian recensions, by the
                    labours of some learned men of the Syrian Church. Griesbach defends his system
                    with great learning and ingenuity; but it is open, as Schott observes, to the
                    following objections: 1 <hi rend="italic">st,</hi> His positions respecting the
                    origin assigned to both recensions are destitute of a solid basis; <hi
                    rend="italic">idly,</hi> Many reasons concur to prevent our admitting that any
                    state of the text of the New Testament peculiar to the Western Church, such as
                    could from its singular character be entitled to the name of a recension,
                    existed (3); <hi rend="italic">3dly,</hi> The features of the text followed by
                    the very ancient Peschito version cannot well be accounted for on the principles
                    of Griesbach; and, in fine, all who seek accurately to arrange codices,
                    versions, and extracts found in the fathers, according to different recensions,
                    labour under this difficulty, that none of those do-<pb break="no"

                    >origin,</hi> belong to different recensions. (See Eichhorn, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Einl.</hi> bde. iv. p. 265 and 269, &amp;c.) Nor is it probable that the
                    doctors of the Western Church, who were but little skilled in Greek, should have
                    thought of preparing a recension of the New Testament.</p>

                <p>A different theory of recensions has been adopted by Hug. He thinks that the text
                    which we find in those early codices which Griesbach referred to the Western
                    recension, in the oldest Latin versions, in the SahidicoCoptic version, in the
                    quotations of the fathers till the time of Origen, and in Origen himself, was
                    the <hi rend="italic">χοιvὴ ἔχδοσις</hi>, or common edition, conformed to no
                    recension in particular, and containing various readings of different sorts and
                    of different origins mingled together, especially such as serve to explain the
                    text. At the same time those codices which were written in Syria and other parts
                    of the east (the inhabitants of which understood better than most others the
                    Hebraeo-Greek dialect of the New Testament) preserved the primitive text more
                    correctly; and hence it happened that the oldest Syriac version, though upon the
                    whole belonging to this common edition, not unfrequently dissents from the
                    readings of the other documents of the same edition. About the middle of the
                    third century, Hesychius, an Egyptian bishop, first set about correcting the
                    errors of the recension of the common edition used in Egypt, purging out all
                    interpolations and glosses, restoring words that had been omitted, but aiming
                    too much at producing a text that should be remarkable for its Greek purity and
                    elegance. Almost at the same time, Lucian, a presbyter of Antioch, in Syria,
                    revised the common edition as it appeared in the Peschito version, following
                    chiefly the authority of this version. but at the same time comparing other
                    codices found in Syria, and produced a text differing from that of Hesychius in
                    this, that it showed less desire to amend the Greek of the New Testament.
                    Besides these, a third recension was undertaken by Origen in Palestine, based
                    upon the common edition used by the Christians there, which conformed in some
                    respects to that of Hesychius, in others to that of Lucian, whilst frequently it
                    differed from both, and which subsequently became the one commonly used in
                    Palestine and the adjoining districts. Of these recensions none is preserved in
                    any of those documents which we now possess, as the transcribers frequently
                    compared their recension with the common edition and with other recensions.
                    Hug’s theory rests so far on an historical basis, that it appears certain that
                    Hesychius and Lucian did undertake some such labour as he ascribes to them; but
                    that codices of their recensions were either very numerous or very widely
                    disseminated, cannot be shown. The labour attributed to Origen is more than
                    doubtful.</p>

                <p>Matthaei thinks that no recensions of the text of the New Testament were
                    anciently made, and he prefers dividing the documents from which the text is to
                    be determined, into, 1 <hi rend="italic">st, Codices textus perpetui,</hi> in
                    which there are neither scholia nor commentaries, and which excel all the others
                    in the purity of the text they exhibit; 2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">Lectionaria,</hi> which contain the lessons read in churches, and

                    scholia and interpretations partly on the margin, but chiefly interpolated.
                    Matthaei thought the Moscow manuscripts, which he had himself diligently
                    collated, the best; and this perhaps led him to a very unjust estimate of the
                    worth and authority of many other documents of the text of the New
                    Testament.</p>

                <p>Scholz, the most recent editor of the Greek New Testament, adopts neither the
                    opinion of Griesbach nor that of Hug. He concludes that there are two classes of
                    critical witnesses for the text of the New Testament, the Alexandrian and the
                    Constantinopolitan; to the former of which belong all the codices executed in
                    Egypt and western Europe, the most of the Coptic and Latin versions, the
                    Ethiopic version, and the quotations by ecclesiastical writers of these
                    districts; and to the latter all the codices written in Asia Minor, Syria,
                    Palestine, and eastern Europe, the Phi-Ioxenian Syriac version, the Gothic, the
                    Georgian, the Sclavonian, the quotations by the fathers living in these regions,
                    and all printed editions. To manuscripts of the latter class he attributes
                    superior value, because of their greater harmony, and of their having been more
                    faithfully copied from original documents than those of the former, which often
                    exhibit a text altered at the will of grammarians. A twofold difficulty presses
                    upon this theory of Scholz; for, first, the Western text of the New Testament
                    has a character considerably different from that of the Alexandrian; and,
                    secondly, the text divulged at Constantinople by order of Constantine and
                    Constans was, as Scholz himself admits, collated with the Alexandrian text, so
                    that the readings of both recensions were intermixed. It is, moreover, rather
                    assumed than proved that that form of the text which, during the first three
                    centuries, prevailed in Asia Minor and Greece, was the same which was afterwards
                    divulged principally in the Constantinopolitan codices; nor is it sufficiently
                    clear that Alexandria was the primary seat of the arbitrary corruption of the
                    New Testament text.</p>

                <p>The theory of Eichhorn is that which perhaps approaches nearest the truth; He
                    grants, that from a very early age, different readings, derived from various
                    sources, existed, and were vastly augmented in the third century by various
                    efforts of an exegetical nature, so that as early as the second century there
                    were two species of texts, the Asiatic and the African, but neither of them was
                    determined by any very certain critical laws. He denies that Origen was the
                    author of a peculiar recension, but admits the services of Hesychius and Lucian
                    in this respect, although he questions the possibility of ascertaining
                    accurately the primitive character of either recension from ancient documents.
                    There thus arose a threefold text of the New Testament, the African
                    (Alexandrian), the Asiatic (Constantinopolitan), and a Mixed, which had its
                    source from this, that many, notwithstanding the authority acquired by the
                    recensions of Hesychius and Lucian in the churches of Africa and Asia, preferred
                    following the authority of older codices. No change of a critical kind took
                    place upon the text thus formed until editions of the New-Testament began to be
                    printed. No opinion so fully accords with what may be regarded as best
                    ascertained as this of Eichhorn, though it is still doubtful whether the efforts
                    of Hesychius and Lucian exerted a very wide or lasting influence upon the form
                    of the text of the New Testament.</p>

                <p>With the exception of some detached portions, the first printed editions of the
                    New Testament were those of the Complutensian Polyglott, 1514, and of Erasmus,

                    that of 1549, 12mo, and that of 1550, folio. Beza was the first to issue an
                    edition of the New Testament with a copious critical apparatus; and his edition
                    many of the minor editions for several years followed. The beautiful editions of
                    the Elzevirs, which conform partly to the text of Stephen, partly to that of
                    Beza, became so famous that they formed what has been called the <hi
                    rend="italic">textus receptus.</hi> In 1707 the edition of Mill was published at
                    Oxford, in which not only is there a larger collection of various readings
                    furnished, but also a more scientific discrimination of these aimed at, than in
                    any preceding edition. His example was followed by Bengel in Germany and
                    Wetstein in Holland, both of whom have rendered important service to the text of
                    the New Testament. All these, however, have been outstripped in diligence,
                    learning, and acuteness, by Griesbach, who issued his first edition, which
                    embraced only the historical books of the New Testament, at Halle, 1774—75. In
                    the mean time, the researches of Matthaei, Alter, Birch, and others, had greatly
                    enlarged the mass of materials for a critical revision of the New Testament, and
                    of these Griesbach eagerly and ably availed himself in preparing a critical
                    edition of the whole New Testament. This he published in two volumes large
                    octavo, the former in 1799, and the latter in 1806, at Halle. Subsequent editors
                    have chiefly followed the scheme of this recension, at the same time exercising
                    their own judgment upon the readings it supplies; but recently Professor Scholz
                    of Bonn has issued a new recension, for which he has subjected most of the
                    manuscripts already used to a new collation, and collated some not hitherto
                    examined. It appeared in two vols. 4to, in 1830-36, at Leipzig. A beautiful and
                    exceedingly useful edition of the New Testament has been recently issued in this
                    country by Dr S. T. Bloomfield, formed upon a careful collation of all previous
                    critical recensions; the third edition, two vols. 8vo, appeared at London in
                    1839.</p>

                    rend="italic">the square;</hi> the former prepared for the use of the
                    synagogues, and written only on parchment; the latter for private use, and
                    written sometimes on parchment and sometimes on paper. In all the ancient
                    manuscripts the words are written continuously without any division, and in the
                    square Chaldaic character. They are divided by De Rossi into three classes, viz.
                    1. <hi rend="italic">The more ancient,</hi> or those written before the twelfth
                    century; 2. <hi rend="italic">The ancient,</hi> or those of the thirteenth and

                    written at the end of the fourteenth or beginning of the fifteenth century. The
                    number of manuscripts collated by Dr Kennicot was about 630, and by De Rossi
                    479.</p>

                <p>Manuscripts of the Greek New Testament were written first on Egyptian papyrus,
                    and then, as this was found too subject to decay, on skins. Subsequent to the
                    twelfth century, silk paper was used for this purpose, until the thirteenth
                    century, when common (linen) paper came into use (1). For the first eight
                    centuries the manuscripts were written in uncial letters, large, erect, and not
                    united either by strokes or hooks. From the beginning of the ninth century the
                    cursive letters were employed, which are smaller, more inclined, and united with
                    strokes; they have, moreover, the iota subscribed (2). At first all the words
                    were written without any diacritical marks or separations; but as this was found
                    inconvenient, and productive of mistakes, especially in the public reading of
                    the New Testament, a plan was introduced to remedy it by Euthalius, then a
                    deacon at Alexandria, in the fifth century, which consisted in so arranging
                    those words that make one sense, as that they should compose one stich (<hi
                    rend="italic">στιχοv</hi>) or line (3). To save room, subsequent transcribers,
                    instead of arranging these in distinct lines, marked the conclusion of each by a
                    colon or point; and thus by degrees arose a complete grammatical punctuation,
                    which is presented in manuscripts from the tenth century downwards, though it
                    was not till the sixteenth century that it was subjected to fixed rules in the
                    editions then printed. From a very early period the custom prevailed of dividing
                    the text into sections (<hi rend="italic">χεφαλαια</hi>) <hi rend="italic"
                    >,</hi> but until the time of Euthalius no uniform order was observed in this
                    respect. About the middle of the third century, Ammonius of Alexandria, in
                    preparing a Diatesseron or Harmony of the Evangelists, divided the text into a
                    number of very short sections; and these having been adopted with slight
                    variations by Eusebius (4) (whence they are frequently denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">χεφαλαια Ammoniano-Eusebiana),</hi> they were in many manuscripts
                    conjoined with the Euthalian divisions. In the sixth century, some finding use
                    for a division of the text into larger portions, introduced the arrangement by
                    <hi rend="italic">τιτλοι</hi> or <hi rend="italic">breves;</hi> but in the
                    course of time these two modes led to so much confusion, that in the thirteenth
                    century Hugo de Santo Caro, a Spanish cardinal, introduced as a remedy the
                    division into chapters and verses, which was afterwards perfected by Robert
                    Stephen into that now in use. Besides these divisions, there was another for
                    church purposes into <hi rend="italic">τεϑιχοπαι</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ἀvαγvωσεις</hi>, or containing the sections of the New Testament appointed for
                    lessons in the public service of the church on Sundays and festivals. The
                    commencement of each of these was marked with an α (<hi rend="italic"
                    >ἀϑχη</hi>), and the close with a (<hi rend="italic">τελος</hi>) (5).</p>

                    each version has in the former.</p>
                <p>1. ORIENTAL VERSIONS.—1. <hi rend="italic">Chaldaic Targums.</hi> After the
                    return of the Jews from Babylon they brought with them so much of the language
                    of Chaldaea, that they were unable to understand their own Scriptures. Hence
                    arose the necessity of accompanying the reading of these in the synagogues with
                    an interpretation; a practice first introduced by Ezra (Nehem, viii. 8), and
                    which continued to be followed as long as the Jewish service was maintained.
                    These interpretations were at first merely oral, and confined to a literal
                    version of the original into the popular dialect; but gradually they became more
                    paraphrastic, and the idea naturally arose of committing the more valuable of
                    them to writing. From this sprung the Chaldaic Targums, or paraphrastic versions
                    of the Hebrew Scriptures. The oldest now extant is that of Onkelos on the
                    Pentateuch, composed according to some in the first, and to others in the third
                    century of the Christian era. It is the least paraphrastic, and the most
                    correct, of any we possess. Next in point of age and value is that of Jonathan
                    Ben Uzziel on the Prophets. The Jews make him a disciple of Simeon, who took our
                    Lord in his arms; but the probability is that he was later. His Targum is more
                    diffuse and paraphrastic than that of Onkelos, but contains much that is
                    valuable. Both of these are printed in Walton’s Polyglott. The remaining
                    Targums, nine in number, are of comparatively recent date, and of little value.
                    Their renderings are very harsh; and they are filled with idle and foolish
                    fables.</p>

                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Syriac Versions.</hi> Eight versions of the whole or parts
                    of Scripture into the ancient Syriac tongue are known to critics, but of these
                    only two deserve particular notice. These are, 1. <hi rend="italic">The
                    Peschito,</hi> that is, <hi rend="italic">right</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >correct,</hi> not later than the third century, probably as early as the
                    second. It contains the whole Bible, is pure in diction and faithful in version,
                    and appears to have been made immediately from the original. 2. <hi
                    rend="italic">The Philoxenian,</hi> so called from Philoxenus, bishop of
                    Hierapolis, under whose direction it was executed by Polycarp, rural bishop of
                    the same district, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> D. 508. It contains only the New
                    Testament, and is literal to servility; but its renderings are not good. Its
                    chief value is to the critic, in helping him to judge of various readings.</p>

                    with “the Pentateuch of the Samaritans,” which is merely a copy of the original
                    Hebrew in Samaritan characters; whereas the other is a translation of the Hebrew
                    into the Samaritan dialect. This version bears a strong resemblance to the
                    Targum of Onkelos, and even some have deemed it a translation of that. It is
                    probably, how ever, from the original, but cannot be dated earlier than the
                    second century.</p>

                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Western</hi> VERSIONS.—1. <hi rend="italic">Greek
                    Versions of the Old Testament.</hi> The most important of these is the
                    Septuagint, as it is commonly called, or more properly the Alexandrian.
                    Respecting the origin and early history of this version much uncertainty
                    prevails, of which advantage has been taken to clothe the whole in the mist of
                    fable. The common story of Ptolemy Philadelphus having sent, at the instigation
                    of his librarian Demetrius Phalereus, to Judaea for a correct copy of the Hebrew
                    Scriptures, and for seventy-two men of learning (six out of each of the twelve
                    tribes) to translate these into Greek, of his having shut them up in the Isle of
                    Pharos, apart from each other, and of their having produced versions <hi
                    rend="italic">verbatim et literatim</hi> the same, is now rejected by all
                    scholars. The opinion commonly held by such embraces the following points: <hi
                    rend="italic">1st,</hi> That it is highly probable that the work was commenced
                    during the period when Ptolemy Lagus and his son Philadelphus held the joint
                    sovereignty; <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> that the motive prompting to it was the
                    multitude of Jews in Alexandria and throughout Egypt, who were ignorant of
                    Hebrew, and needed the Scriptures in Greek; <hi rend="italic">3d,</hi> that it
                    was undertaken under the auspices of the Alexandrian Sanhedrin or council of the
                    Jews, who probably consulted their brethren in Judaea about it, and from whom,
                    being seventy-two in number, in all likelihood the version took its name; 4 <hi
                    rend="italic">th</hi>, that the different books were executed at different times
                    and by different persons, as is evident from the varieties in point of accuracy
                    and purity which they present, the Pentateuch being that first executed; and,
                    <hi rend="italic">5th,</hi> that the translators of the Pentateuch were
                    evidently Egyptian Jews, from their introducing into their version many Coptic
                    words, and rendering many Hebrew expressions, not into their Greek equivalents,
                    but so as to give an Egyptian hue to the idea. The version thus executed soon
                    acquired great vogue, not only in Egypt, but also in Palestine, where, in the
                    days of our Lord and his apostles, it had mostly superseded the use of the
                    original Hebrew. In the Christian church it acquired the same reputation. Few of
                    the Fathers understood Hebrew, and consequently almost all their quotations from
                    the Old Testament are made through the medium of the Septuagint. The best
                    editions of this version are those of Grabe, Oxon. 1707, 1709, 1719, 1720, four
                    vols. folio and eight vols. 8vo, reprinted with the addition of various readings
                    from the Vatican manuscript by Breitinger, Tiguri Helvet., 1730-31-32, four

                <p>Of the other Greek versions, eleven in number, we have only fragments or
                    traditionary information. That of Aquila, a proselyte Jew of Sinope, a city of
                    Pontus, was executed in the first century, for the purpose of discrediting the
                    Septuagint, which the Christians were in the habit of quoting against the Jews;
                    it is very literal and Hebraistic. That of Symmachus, an Ebionite, time
                    uncertain, seems to have aimed chiefly at elegance and purity of style; it is
                    very free. Between these stands that of Theodotion, also an Ebionite, and nearly
                    contemporary with Aquila; more elegant and idiomatic than that of Aquila, more
                    literal and correct than that of Symmachus. These, with three anonymous
                    versions, enumerated as <hi rend="italic">editio quinta, sexta,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">septima</hi> respectively, were included by Origen in his splendid
                    work the Hexapla, a sort of Polyglott, which that distinguished Biblical scholar
                    drew up for the use of those who wished to understand accurately the Old
                    Testament, and which contained in parallel columns the Hebrew in the original
                    character, the same in Greek characters, and the Greek versions above
                    enumerated, including the Septuagint. The versions designated as 6 <hi
                    rend="italic">iSçu.m;, i</hi> &lt;r⅛βj, ri <hi rend="italic">α ∕μαgi∣mι∣v,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">i</hi> sλλιjwx⅛, are known to us only from being
                    occasionally referred to on the margins of manuscripts. The extant fragments of
                    these versions may be found in the sixth volume of the London Polyglott, under
                    the title <hi rend="italic">Flaminii Nobilii Notae,</hi> and in the edition of
                    the Septuagint by Bos.</p>

                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Latin Versions.</hi> Translations of the Scriptures into the
                    Latin tongue began to be executed at a very early period, for the benefit
                    chiefly of the Christians in Africa, and those parts of Europe where that
                    language was used. Some have supposed that, as early as the second century,
                    there was a commonly received or authorized version in the Latin churches, but
                    this opinion is hardly tenable. The name <hi rend="italic">Itala,</hi> which has
                    been supposed to designate this version, was more probably an appellation
                    including collectively the whole. Towards the close of the fourth century,
                    Jerome set himself to revise and correct these versions, and in pursuance of
                    this design issued revised editions of the Psalter, the books of Chronicles,
                    Job, and the writings of Solomon. Unfortunately, the manuscripts containing his
                    revised copies of the other books were lost, either through negligence or fraud
                    on the part of some one to whom he had intrusted them. Satisfied, however, that
                    something more than a correction of existing versions was necessary, he
                    undertook a new translation from the original; and this he executed at
                    intervals, and in the order in which particular books were requested by his
                    friends. At first his undertaking was viewed with no small jealousy, and even St
                    Augustin sought to discourage it, from a fear that a new translation, especially
                    one from the Hebrew, would shake the faith of the ignorant in the certainty of
                    Scripture; nor was it till the sanction of Gregory the Great had been given to
                    it that the version of Jerome was able entirely to supersede the old Itala (1).
                    This version is that commonly denominated the <hi rend="italic">Vulgate,</hi> of
                    which the Council of Trent decreed an immaculate edition; a decree which gave
                    rise to a Papal dissension, to which Christians have not been slow to point as
                    fatal to the claims of the supreme pontiff to infallibility (2).</p>

                    Ulphilas, bishop of the Gothic tribes in Wallachia, about the middle of the
                    fourth century, only the four gospels, part of the Epistle to the Romans, and
                    fragments of the other Epistles, are extant; the first in the famous Codex
                    Argenteus, a manuscript in silver letters of the fifth or sixth century; the
                    second in a Codex Rescriptus belonging to the library of Wölfenbuttel; and the
                    third in certain Codices Rescripti recently discovered by Maio in the Ambrosian
                    Library at Milan. This version appears to have been made from the Greek, and
                    particularly from the Constantinopolitan text, but to have been subsequently
                    altered after the Vulgate. The best edition of the gospels is that of Lye, Oxon.
                    1750, 4to. The fragments were edited by Knittel, in 1762, 4to, and by Ihre,
                    Upsal, 1763, 4to.</p>

                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The Anglo-Saxon Versions.</hi> The history of these is by no
                    means accurately known. It appears, that as early as the year 709, the Psalter
                    was rendered into Saxon by Adelme, bishop of Sherborne. A few years later,
                    Aldred, who styles himself “Presbyter indignus et miserrimus,” “overglossed in
                    English” the Latin of a copy of the four gospels, which had been written by
                    Eadfrith, bishop of the <hi rend="italic">church</hi> of Lindisfern,
                    “out-attired, and blazoned as well as he could,” by Ethilwold, bishop of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Land</hi> of Lindisfern, and “smoothed, ornamented, and
                    overgilded,” by Billfrith the anchoret (1). Nearly about the same time Beda
                    translated the whole Bible into∙Saxon-English. About two hundred years after
                    this the Psalter was translated by King Alfred. A Saxon translation of the
                    Pentateuch, Joshua, part of the books of Kings and Esther, is attributed to
                    Ealfric, archbishop of Canterbury, in 995. The entire Anglo-Saxon Bible has
                    never been published. Alfred’s Psalter was edited by Spelman in 1640; and a
                    translation of the gospels made from the old Latin of the Itala has been thrice
                    edited (2).</p>

                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">The Sclavonic Version.</hi> The authors of this version were
                    Cyrill of Thessalonica, and his brother Methodius, who in the ninth century
                    introduced the gospel among the Sclavonians inhabiting Moravia. It seems to have
                    been made from the Greek, and from manuscripts having the Constantinopolitan
                    text. It embraces the whole Bible, and has been frequently printed.</p>

                <p>These ancient versions are useful, both to the critic and the exegete; to the
                    former, as supplying not a few various readings which are wanting in all or in
                    most of the codices containing the original text, as serving to determine more
                    accurately the age and country of any particular form of the text, and as
                    helping to confirm or refute particular readings occurring in the Greek codices;
                    to the latter, inasmuch as every faithful version is not only a perpetual
                    interpreter of the sentiments of the original into another tongue, but the
                    authors of these ancient versions, from the time in which they lived, and the
                    locality they inhabited, had peculiar advantages, both philological and
                    historical, for the successful interpretation of the sacred books.</p>

                <p>Besides the object to which these have been already applied, as showing the
                    authenticity of the sacred documents, they serve also a useful purpose to the
                    critic, in furnishing him with numerous readings, in assisting to determine the
                    age, origin, and country, of remarkable readings, and in illustrating the whole
                    history of the Greek texts of Scripture. Care, however, must be taken to
                    discriminate between passages quoted freely from memory, or adapted to the
                    construction and sentiment of the writer himself who quotes, and those which are
                    formally cited from the codex. We must also be sure that the work in which the
                    quotation occurs is genuine, and that the common text of the places in which the
                    citation occurs is correct.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> XII.— <hi rend="italic">Laws for the
                    Determination of various Readings.</hi></p>
                <p>1. That reading is to be regarded as true, which is supported by far the greater
                    number of copies and witnesses; but still readings supported by a few books are
                    not entirely to be disregarded, especially when they harmonise with the <hi
                    rend="italic">usus loquendi</hi> of the author. 2. That reading which the better
                    copies exhibit, unless special reasons prohibit it, is to be preferred to the
                    one which the inferior copies exhibit, although most numerous. Neither the
                    antiquity nor propriety of a reading, solely considered, always proves it to be
                    a true one. 3. That reading which is more harsh, obscure, difficult, unusual, or
                    delicately chosen, if supported by the authority of a proper witness, is
                    preferable to one which is plain, easy, usual, and common. 4. That reading which
                    approaches nearest to the popular and familiar method of speaking, if it be
                    supported by external testimonies, is preferable to one which is more artificial
                    and subtle. 5. The shorter reading, when supported by testimony of importance,
                    and not incongruous with the style and design of the writer, is preferable to a
                    more verbose one. Still there are cases where the more copious reading is to be
                    preferred. 6. That reading which gives the best sense is peculiarly preferable.
                    But to determine this, the nature of the whole passage, and the genius of the
                    writer, not the mere opinions and sentiments of particular interpreters, are to
                    be consulted. 7. The reading which produces an unworthy or incongruous sense is
                    to be rejected. Good care, however, must be taken not to condemn a reading as
                    unworthy or incongruous, which a more correct grammatical and historical
                    investigation would prove to be a true reading, or at least a probable one. 8. A
                    reading which agrees with the <hi rend="italic">usus loquendi</hi> of the
                    writer, is preferable to that which disagrees with it. It must be remembered in
                    judging here, that the style of an author sometimes varies with increasing age.
                    9. A reading is to be rejected, in respect to which plain evidence is found that
                    it has undergone a <hi rend="italic">designed</hi> alteration. Such alteration
                    may have taken place, <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> from doctrinal reasons,
                    Matthew, i. 18; Mark, viii. 31, xiιi. 32: <hi rend="italic">second,</hi> from
                    moral and practical reasons, Matthew, v. 22: <hi rend="italic">third,</hi> from
                    historical and geographical doubts, Matthew, viii. 28, comp. Mark, v. 1: <hi
                    rend="italic">fourth,</hi> from the desire of reconciling pas sages inconsistent
                    with each other, Mark, viii. 31: <hi rend="italic">fifth,</hi> from desire to
                    make the discourse more intensive; hence many emphatic readings have originated:
                    <hi rend="italic">sixth,</hi> from the comparison of many manuscripts, the
                    readings of which have been amalgamated: <hi rend="italic">seventh,</hi> from a
                    comparison of parallel passages. Corrections of the more celebrated manuscripts
                    have been sometimes detected. 10. Various readings are to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >rejected</hi> which spring from the mere negligence of copyists, and from those
                    errors which are very common in all kinds of books. To these belong, <hi
                    rend="italic">first,</hi> the commutation of unusual forms for those of the
                    common dialect; the Alexandrine or common form, however, has the preference over
                    others in the New Testament; and this dialect itself also admitted some Attic
                    forms: <hi rend="italic">second,</hi> the commutation of single letters and
                    syllables, by an error of either the eye or the ear; the former resulting from
                    obscure and compendious methods of writing, or from the similarity of certain
                    letters, such as A Δ A, Ο Θ, &amp;c.; the latter, from copying after the reading
                    of one who was misunderstood, or who read erroneously: <hi rend="italic"
                    >third,</hi> the commutation of synonyms: <hi rend="italic">fourth,</hi> from
                    transferring into the text words written in the margin of copies, and thus
                    uniting both readings, James, v. 2: <hi rend="italic">fifth,</hi> from the
                    omission or insertion of a word or a verse, by an error of the sight: <hi
                    rend="italic">sixth,</hi> from the transposition of words and passages, whence
                    it may have happened that some error has crept into most of our books: <hi
                    rend="italic">seventh,</hi> from words which ended with the like sound, or
                    appeared alike; and from proximate words, one ending and the other beginning
                    with the same syllable: <hi rend="italic">eighth,</hi> from incorrectly uniting
                    or separating words, which naturally resulted, in some cases, from the ancient
                    method of <hi rend="italic">continuous writing;</hi> and, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ninth,</hi> from an erroneous inter-punction and distinction of passages. 11. A
                    reading is to be rejected which plainly betrays a gloss or interpretation. This
                    may be a word or a whole passage. Sometimes these glosses are united to the true
                    text, and sometimes they have thrust it out. All interpretations, however, are
                    not spurious glosses; for authors themselves sometimes add them, in order to
                    explain their own language. 12. Readings deduced merely from versions or the
                    commentaries of interpreters are to be rejected.</p>
