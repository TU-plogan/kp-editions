                <p><label type="entry">SCHLEGEL, <hi rend="smallcaps">Frederick</hi></label>, an
                    eminent German critic and philosophical writer, was born at Hanover in 1772, of
                    a family which had already produced more than one writer of ability. He was the
                    third son of the family, being three years younger than his distinguished
                    brother, who is still alive, Augustus William. In his earlier years he is said
                    to have displayed no remarkable genius. Though intended for the mercantile
                    profession, he received an admirable classical education; and ultimately
                    prevailed on his father to allow him to follow the bent of his own inclination,
                    and to devote himself to literature. He then began to devote himself in earnest
                    to study, which he pursued first at Göttingen and afterwards at Leipsig. From
                    the age of seventeen, as he himself informs us, the writings of the Greek
                    tragedians, and of Plato, combined with Winkelmann’s enthusiastic criticisms on
                    art, formed the intellectual world in which he lived. This admiration for the
                    antique was increased by a visit which he was enabled to pay to Dresden in 1789,
                    where he was for the first time enabled to contemplate, in their marble forms,
                    those gods, heroes, and sages, who had been the companions of his thoughts.
                    “These firm indelible impressions,” he adds, “were in succeeding years the firm
                    enduring groundwork for my study of classical antiquity.”</p>
                <p>As might be expected, his first literary effort, which appeared in 1794, took the
                    direction of these his early studies.<pb break="no"

                    It was a short Essay on the different Schools of Greek Poetry, which appeared in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Berlinn Monatsehrift,</hi> displaying not only an
                    erudition of considerable depth and extent, but an elegance of style and a
                    clearness of classification less frequently to be found among his countrymen.
                    Two little treatises followed, composed in 1795 and 1796; the Dio-tema, a view
                    of the condition of the female sex in Greece; and a parallel between Caesar and
                    Alexander, which, however, was not published till twenty-six years afterwards.
                    In this work we trace the first indications of that talent which was afterwards
                    so conspicuously displayed in the field of philosophical and critical
                    history.</p>
                <p>A more important work, entitled the Greeks and Romans, appeared in 1797. which
                    was highly praised by Heine. It was followed two or three years afterwards by a
                    History of Greek Poetry, in which, taking Winkelmann’s History of Art as his
                    model, he has thrown into criticism an imaginative and poetical tone, which,
                    combining as it did with profound learning and breadth of philosophical views,
                    succeeded in bringing before the mind the true spirit of antiquity, with a
                    freshness and distinctness of portraiture which mere erudition could not have
                    effected. The work, however, is incomplete. In the portion which is finished,
                    but which was afterwards considerably modified, and incorporated with another
                    work, Frederick Schlegel reviews the Orpheic poetry, which he considers to be of
                    the age of Hesiod; the Homeric poems, his criticism on which forms indeed the
                    most important and the best executed part of the work; the Hesiodic epos; the
                    middle epos, or the works of the Cydic poets; and, lastly, the productions of
                    the Ionic, AEolic, and Doric schools of lyric poetry. The portion of the work
                    which treats of the lyric poets is unfinished; nothing indeed but a few
                    fragments, full of promise, affording an imperfect idea of the style in which it
                    would have been executed. The strong hold, in fact, which the literary
                    scepticism of Wolff had taken of the German mind, and the ardent application of
                    his principles, not merely to the Homeric poems, but to all compositions
                    claiming a remote antiquity, appear to have discouraged Schlegel from
                    persevering, and the work accordingly was dropt.</p>
                <p>In 1799 he published his Lucinde, a work, as Mrs Austin describes it, “of fancy,
                    sentiment, and reflection,” in which, however, the very anti-platonic character
                    of his descriptions of love occasioned not a little scandal and censure. What
                    the precise object of the author in this equivocal novel was, may admit of
                    question, though, perhaps, it is not unaptly characterized by a German critic as
                    a fantastic and dreamy attempt to exalt and sublimate sensual love. Certain it
                    is, that the public in general conceived, and not without some reason, that,
                    like Hemse’s Ardinghello, it was an elaborate effort to invest sensuality with
                    grace, and to lavish a poetical colouring on scenes and incidents of a very
                    questionable character. Frederick Schlegel appears to have felt that the cold
                    reception of this philosophical experiment was not without foundation; for
                    though he threatened the public in the <hi rend="italic">Europa</hi> with a
                    continuation, the work remained a fragment. In the year 1800 he established
                    himself as a private teacher in Jena, where he delivered a course of
                    philosophical lectures with success. His first poetical compositions, which
                    appeared in the Athenaeum, seem to have been the productions of this period. In
                    1801 he published, in conjunction with his brother Augustus W. Schlegel, two
                    volumes, entitled <hi rend="italic">Characteristiken und Critiken,</hi> one of
                    the most popular and pleasing of his works. The second volume includes his
                    Hercules Musagetes, an elegiac poem of some length; and in 1802 he published a
                    tragedy, Alarcos, in which he has tried, with no remarkable success, to impart
                    the severe and gloomy simplicity of AEschylus to a le gend of the middle ages.
                    In fact, it is neither as a lyric nor as a dramatic poet that the name of
                    Frederick Schlegel is likely to be remembered. Goethe, at least, always appeared
                    to estimate the poetical talent of Schlegel at a low standard.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Characteristics of Goethe,
                    vol. i. p. 120.</p></note> Still he may fairly be admitted to possess a chaste
                    classical diction, great harmony and flexibility of diction, with considerable
                    tenderness, while in the poetical compositions which he wrote on patriotic
                    subjects there appears real feeling and enthusiasm. In boldness and originality
                    of conception his poetry is unquestionably deficient; and, on the whole, it may
                    be said that the philosophical element preponderates in the character of
                    Frederick Schlegel, nearly as much as the poetical does in that of his
                    brother.</p>
                <p>But the study of the poetry and literature of the west was near about to be
                    exchanged for that of the eastern nations. Following in the footsteps of Sir
                    William Jones, and filled with the idea of the important additions which might
                    be made to Europe by naturalizing in Germany the results of Indian research, and
                    of the still greater benefits which he conceived might be derived from the
                    pursuit of Indian literature, philosophy, and antiquities, in an enlarged,
                    philosophical, and at the same time religious spirit, he resolved to devote
                    himself to the study of Sanscrit. He probably overrated, on the whole, both the
                    importance of the labour in which he was about to engage, and its probable
                    interest to the public mind. With a view, however, to his intended
                    investigations, he repaired to Paris in 1802, accompanied by his wife, the
                    daughter of the celebrated Moses Mendelsohn, and, with the assistance afforded
                    by the valuable stores of the National Library, and the hints derived from those
                    distinguished orientalists, MM. de Langlès and Chézy, he is said to have made
                    considerable progress in the study of Persian and Sanscrit poetry.</p>
                <p>But he was by no means so entirely absorbed in his new task as not to find time
                    for other studies, having contrived during his residence in France, which
                    continued till 1805, to deliver a course of lectures on metaphysics, which
                    appear to have met with but partial success; a result by no means surprising,
                    when the lofty and Platonic character of Schlegel’s philosophy is contrasted
                    with the strong material tendencies which had long encumbered the metaphysical
                    views of the French. During the same period he wrote a variety of articles on
                    the early Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Provençal poetry; and published, in
                    1804, a collection of the romantic poems of the middle ages, and a series of
                    letters on the different schools and epochs of Christian painting and Gothic
                    architecture, a work for which the temporary concentration of the various
                    treasures of modem art in the Parisian capital afforded ample materials. These
                    letters, which he afterwards revised and enlarged, form one of the most pleasing
                    of his compositions. He takes up the subject nearly where Winkelmann had left
                    it, and performs, in the same spirit of love, the same service for the arts of
                    the middle ages, which that critic had done for those of antiquity.</p>
                <p>It was at this period of Frederick Schlegel’s life (1805) that he took the step
                    which occasioned so much surprise in some quarters, and such bitter hostility
                    and censure in others, namely, his forsaking the tenets of the Protestant
                    church, in which he had been brought up, and embracing Catholicism, as Count
                    Stolberg had done a few years before. His conversion was ascribed by Voss, who,
                    in addition to the rancour of religious opposition, was probably influenced by
                    the jealousy of literary rivalry, to the most unworthy and interested motives,
                    as resulting entirely from a time-serving spirit, and the prospect of honours
                    and promotion in the service of Austria, which Protestant Germany was less
                    likely to supply. Now that personal animosity is at an end, it seems to be
                    conceded that there is<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=743" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0743-0687"/>
                    little reason to question the sincerity of Frederick Schlegel’s change of
                    religious belief. To his poetical and enthusiastic mind, long occupied with the
                    study of the religion, monuments, and literature of the middle ages, Catholicism
                    presented many more attractive features than the rationalizing and semi-infidel
                    spirit which too generally pervaded German Protestantism, in which, to use an
                    expression of Hegel, the disciples of Luther and Calvin had “united on a basis
                    of nullity.” Of course the accession of such a convert was hailed with
                    enthusiasm by the Catholic priesthood; and his example was shortly afterwards
                    followed by several Protestants of rank or literary ability.</p>
                <p>In 1808 appeared his work on the Language and Wisdom of the Indians. The first
                    part of this work is occupied with a comparative examination of the etymology
                    and grammatical structure of the Sanscrit, Persian, Greek, Roman, and German
                    languages. The second traces the connection of the different religions and
                    philosophical systems that prevailed in the ancient oriental world. The last
                    consists of metrical versions from the sacred and didactic poems of the Hindus.
                    It cannot be denied that this work, with all its learning and sagacity of
                    conjecture, is yet a very imperfect one. The profounder learning of Jacob Grimm
                    has demolished many of the ingenious theories of Schlegel as to the original
                    monuments of the German language. Much, too, has of course been added to Indian
                    learning since it appeared; many of its views have so completely passed into
                    commonly-received opinions, that they have ceased to strike us as novelties; and
                    other truths which are there only hinted at, have been elucidated and confirmed.
                    But it had the merit of opening a comparatively new path in Germany, and perhaps
                    in other countries of Europe. “Prior to the publication of this work, the
                    Semitic languages of the East, were alone, I believe, cultivated with much
                    ardour in Germany; its appearance had the effect of directing the national
                    energies towards an intellectual region, where they were destined to meet with
                    the most brilliant success; and Germany may now boast with reason of her
                    illustrious professors of Sanscrit. If France under the restoration made such
                    progress in oriental literature; if England, roused from her inglorious apathy,
                    has at last founded an Asiatic Society in London, and, more recently, the Boden
                    professorship at Oxford; these events are in a great degree attributable to the
                    enthusiasm which this little book excited.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>After Schlegel’s return from France, he proceeded in 1808 to Vienna, with the
                    view, it is said, of completing from historical documents an unfinished drama on
                    the subject of Charles V. In the following year he was appointed imperial
                    secretary at the Archduke Charles’s head-quarters, and contributed much, by his
                    spirited proclamations, towards rousing the patriotic ardour of the country in
                    the contest against Napoleon. After the unfortunate issue of the war, he resumed
                    his literary activity, and in 1810 delivered his course of lectures on modern
                    history. By many these lectures were considered as his masterpiece. They
                    embodied in a systematic form the various opinions and incidental views which he
                    had thrown out in his earlier essays, and contained, in a more detailed form,
                    the proofs of many of those positions which he afterwards stated in a more brief
                    and general form in his Philosophy of History.</p>
                <p>In 1812 Schlegel delivered, before a numerous and distinguished audience in
                    Vienna, his celebrated Lectures on the History of Literature, the work by which
                    he is best known beyond the limits of his own country. Of course a work which
                    exhibits an outline of the literary history of the world, and traces the
                    influence of its various literatures on one another, within the compass of two
                    volumes, cannot descend to much minuteness of detail, or delineate, with that
                    precision which would be desirable, the characteristics of individuals. Yet, in
                    addition to the broad and striking views which the History of Literature
                    exhibits, to the skill and sagacity with which it traces the divergence and
                    reunion of the various streams of literature, as if the whole had been
                    contemplated from some vast elevation in which their mutual relations were
                    visible as on a map, and to the general spirit of candour and impartiality which
                    pervades the work, it may be added, that some of Schlegel’s brief sketches of
                    the great ornaments of literature are among the happiest specimens of pregnant
                    and characteristic delineation which are to be met with in any language. The
                    style, too, of the work is elegant and enthusiastic without being extravagant.
                    Yet some deductions must be made, both from the impartiality of the work, and
                    from the soundness of its views. It is difficult to conceive on what grounds of
                    sound criticism the Lusiad of Camaens can be exalted above the Jerusalem of
                    Tasso ;. and still more how the “romantic witchery” of the drama of Calderon,
                    rich and fantastical as it is, can ever be placed on the same level with the
                    profound imagination which combines with this romantic beauty in the theatre of
                    Shakspeare. English literature, with the exception of Shakspeare, can hardly be
                    said to be appreciated at all. French literature, at least after the time of
                    Corneille, is treated with great injustice; Pascal is passed over with a single
                    word; Malebranche is not mentioned at all. And indeed the literature of the
                    seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is discussed in a very perfunctory and
                    unsatisfactory manner. Some of the faults of the work are undoubtedly owing to
                    the strong religious bias of the author. For the Catholic literature of Spain
                    and Italy he shows an undue preference, with a corresponding coldness and
                    indifference towards that of Protestant nations. “Frederick Schlegel,” says
                    Heine, in his lively work on Germany, “has examined all literatures from a lofty
                    point of view; but this high position of his is always on the belfry of the
                    Catholic Church; and whatever Schlegel says, you can’t help hearing the bells
                    jingle about him, and now and then the croaking of the ravens that haunt the old
                    weathercock.” “Yet,” he adds, “I know no better book of the kind; and indeed I
                    know not where one can procure such a complete view of the literature of all
                    nations, unless by putting together the multifarious lucubrations of
                    Herder.”</p>
                <p>With the History of Literature the critical career of Frederick Schlegel may be
                    said to have closed; for a flattering and somewhat exaggerated criticism on
                    Lamartine’s <hi rend="italic">Meditations Poétiques,</hi> which appeared in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Concordia,</hi> scarcely deserves to be noticed as an
                    exception. From 1812 he was much occupied with political and diplomatic
                    employments. Having acquired the friendship and confidence of Prince Metternich,
                    he was employed by him in various diplomatic missions; and for several years
                    after the peace of 1814 he was one of the representatives of the court of Vienna
                    at Francfort. A pension, with letters of nobility, and the title of councillor
                    confessor, were conferred upon him by the emperor. These diplomatic functions,
                    of course, occasioned a temporary interruption to his literary pursuits; but in
                    1818 he returned to Vienna, where they were resumed with ardour. The years 1819
                    and 1820 were marked by the simultaneous outbreak of revolutions in different
                    countries in Europe; by a wild republican spirit among the youth of Germany,
                    leading, as in the case of Kotzebue, to the assassination of those who were at
                    the time considered as enemies of their country; by the formation of
                    associations for disseminating pernicious and anti-social doctrines, often
                    countenanced even from academical chairs; in short, by evident symptoms of a
                    wide-spread conspiracy against the existing forms of government and society. It
                    was to counteract this spirit, which preventive measures of force might con-<pb

                    Schlegel, in conjunction with his friend Adam Müller founded a religious and
                    political journal, entitled <hi rend="italic">concordia,</hi> in which, while
                    opposing the irreligious and dangerous notions which were abroad, he propounded
                    not a few principles as to government, which excite surprise when coming from
                    such a quarter, and addressed to the subjects of a government supposed to be so
                    attached to absolutism, and so bent on maintaining the existing state of things,
                    as the Austrian government.</p>
                <p>In 1827 he delivered at Vienna another course of Lectures on the Philosophy of
                    Life, of which, indeed, an outline had appeared in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >concordia</hi> for 1820. The work is of great, nay even of startling
                    originality, and deep interest, embracing questions of the most solemn
                    importance, which are discussed with a grave eloquence, and in a deeply
                    religious strain of feeling, but strangely immethodical in its arrangement, and,
                    whether from the imperfection of their expression, or the real obscurity of the
                    ideas themselves, in some parts scarcely intelligible. This work was almost
                    immediately followed by another course of Lectures on the Philosophy of History,
                    which have lately been translated into English, and which appear not unworthy of
                    the reputation of the author. Towards the close of the year 1828 Schlegel went
                    to Dresden, where he delivered nine Lectures on the Philosophy of Language, in
                    which he farther developed and expanded those philosophical views which he had
                    already laid down in his Philosophy of Life. The course, however, was
                    interrupted by death. “On Sunday the 11th of January 1829, he was, between ten
                    and eleven o’clock at night, preparing a lecture which he was to deliver on the
                    following Wednesday, and had begun a sentence with the remarkable words, ‘But
                    the consummate and perfect knowledge,’ when sickness suddenly arrested his pen.
                    From that illness he never recovered.”</p>
                <p>We have already briefly expressed our opinion of the nature of Schlegel's genius.
                    It was philosophical and critical, rather than poetical; but he had that species
                    of poetical imagination without which there can be no lofty or useful criticism,
                    which enables the critic to rise above artificial and natural peculiarities, and
                    to judge with truth and certainty upon broad and universal principles. Even when
                    his criticism is imperfect or erroneous, it is often valuable; for it abounds in
                    new and original views, excites the mind to independent speculation, and teaches
                    the habit of viewing literature, the arts, and philosophy, not as isolated
                    subjects of study, but as acting and re-acting with the most important
                    influences upon each other. From his powerful and inventive mind many of the
                    speculations of his brother appear to have been derived. In the study of the
                    oriental languages and literature, the poetry of the Provencals, and that of
                    Spain, Frederick Schlegel led the way; and in the History of Literature will be
                    found the germs of many of those views which were developed at greater length by
                    his brother in his Dramatic Course. (w. w. w. w.)</p>
