                    source in the Vosges, near Darney, and falls into the Rhone at Lyons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Saone</hi>, <hi rend="smallcaps">Upper,</hi> a department of
                    France, formed out of a part of the ancient province of High Burgundy, or
                    Franche Comté. It is bounded on the north by the Upper Marne and the Vosges, on
                    the east by the Upper Rhine, on the south by the Doubs and the Jura, and on the
                    west by the Cote d’Or and the Upper Marne. It extends, according to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Statistique de la France,</hi> over 530,990 hectares, equal to
                    1867 square miles, and is divided into three arrondissements, twenty-eight
                    cantons, and 651 communes, with a population of 343,298 persons. The chief river
                    is that from which the name is taken, which rises in the Vosges, and is
                    navigable for only a short portion of its course through this department. The
                    other rivers are the Oignon, the Drageon, the Amance, the Auterne, the Saolon,
                    and the Branchin. The surface consists of mountains, hills, and valleys. A spur
                    from the Vosges Mountains enters the eastern side of the department, but to the
                    south-west it is quite level. The soil for the most part consists of clay, and
                    is very stony; but much of it is fertile, and a great part covered with woods.
                    Although the husbandry is conducted in a slovenly manner, yet it yields
                    sufficient corn for the consumption, and more of wheat than of rye. There are
                    abundance of good meadows which afford pasturage for cows, and the dairies
                    produce excellent butter. Fruit is plentiful, especially walnuts, from which
                    much valuable oil is extracted. The vine is extensively cultivated, the
                    vineyards occupying about 20,000 acres, which enables the inhabitants to export
                    some wine. There are mines of iron<pb break="no"

                    and of coal at work, which afford employment to many hands. Much of the iron is
                    converted near the mines into the heavier hardware articles. There are some
                    manufactures produced, but the establishments are upon a small scale, furnishing
                    tiles, glass, paper, and liqueurs. There is also some trade in timber, and in
                    pot and pearl ashes, from the more wooded divisions of the department.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Saone</hi> AND <hi rend="smallcaps">Loire,</hi> a department
                    of France, formed out of some portions of the ancient duchy of Burgundy, then
                    distinguished as the Autunois, the Charollais, and the Cha-lonnais. It is
                    bounded on the north by the departments of the Nievre and the Cote d’Or; on the
                    east by that of Jura; on the south by those of the Aine, the Rhone, and the
                    Loire; and on the west by the Allier and the Nievre. It extends over 856,472
                    hectares, which are equal to 3009 square miles, is divided into five
                    arrondissements, fortyeight cantons, and 592 communes, and in 1836 it contained
                    a population of 538,507 persons. Its inhabitants have increased since the peace
                    at a far greater rate than the other parts of France, having been in 1818 only
                    470,085. The chief rivers arc the two which confer their names on the
                    department, but there are others of great value, such as the Doubs, the Arroux,
                    the Seille, and the Garonne. It is favoured, too, by the Canal of Digoin, and
                    the Central Canal, which commences at Digoin, and terminates in the Saone at
                    Chalons. The surface is covered with hills, some of which are 2400 feet in
                    height, with rich valleys between them. The soil, upon the whole, is highly
                    fruitful, though in parts chalky, stony, or sandy. The strip from Chalons to
                    Maçon, along the Loire, is one of the finest in France, consisting, on one side
                    of the river, of extensive rich natural meadows, and on the other of gentle
                    acclivities covered with corn and vines. The agriculture has been much increased
                    by bringing into cultivation large portions of land before covered with woods.
                    There are some mines of iron and coal, but their product is not large. There are
                    some manufactures, chiefly for home consumption. The trade consists chiefly in
                    exporting the fruits of the soil, especially corn, wine, hay, wool, and some
                    timber and coal. The capital of the department is the city of Maçon, which in
                    1836 contained 11,944 inhabitants.</p>
