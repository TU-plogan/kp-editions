                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    from the Greek word Σ <hi rend="italic">υvεδϑιov</hi>, which signifies a council
                    or assembly of persons sitting together, was the name by which the Jews called
                    the great council of the nation, assembled in an apartment of the temple of
                    Jerusalem to determine the most important affairs of their church and state.
                    This council consisted of seventy senators. The room they met in was a rotunda,
                    half of which was built without the temple, and half within; that is, one
                    semicircle was within the compass of the temple, the other semicircle was built
                    without, for the senators to sit in, it being unlawful for any one to sit down
                    in the temple. The Nasi, or prince of the sanhedrim, sat upon a throne at the
                    end of the hall, having his deputy at his right hand, and his sub-deputy at his
                    left. The other senators were ranged in order on each sidc.</p>
                <p>The rabbin pretend, that the sanhedrim has always subsisted in their nation from
                    the time of Moses down to the destruction of the temple by the Romans. They date
                    the establishment of it from what happened in the wilderness, some time after
                    the people departed from Sinai, in the year of the world 2514. Moses, being
                    discouraged by the continual murmurings of the Israelites, addressed himself to
                    God, and desired to be relieved at least from some part of the burden of the
                    government. ' Then the Lord said to him,</p>
                <p>“Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the
                    elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle
                    of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee: And I will come down
                    and talk with thee there; and I w ill take of the spirit which is upon thee, and
                    will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee,
                    that thou bear it not thyself alone.” The Lord, therefore, poured out his spirit
                    upon these men, who began at that time to prophesy, and have not ceased ever
                    since. The sanhedrim was composed of seventy counsellors, or rather seventy-two,
                    being six out of each tribe; and Moses, as president, made up the number to
                    seventy-three. To prove the uninterrupted succession of the judges of the
                    sanhedrim, there is nothing unattempted by the partisans of this opinion. They
                    find a proof where others cannot so much as perceive any appearance or shadow of
                    it. Grotius may be consulted in many places of his commentaries, and in his
                    first book <hi rend="italic">De jure belli et pacis</hi> (c. iii. art. 20), and
                    Selden <hi rend="italic">De Synedriis veterum Hebrttorum;</hi> also Calmet’s
                    Dissertation concern ing the Polity of the ancient Hebrews, printed before his
                    Commentary upon the Book of Numbers.</p>
                <p>As to the personal qualifications of the judges of this bench, their birth was to
                    be untainted. They were often taken from the race of the priests or Levites, or
                    out of the number of the inferior judges, or from the lesser sanhedrim, which
                    consisted only of twenty-three judges. They were to be skilful in the law, as
                    well traditional as written. They were obliged to study magic, divination,
                    fortune-telling, physic, astrology, arithmetic, and languages. The Jews say they
                    were to know to the number of seventy tongues; that is, they were to know all
                    the tongues, for the Hebrews acknowledged but seventy in all, and perhaps this
                    is too great a number. Eunuchs were excluded from the sanhedrim because of their
                    cruelty, usurers, decrepid persons, players at games of chance, such as had any
                    bodily deformities, those that had brought up pigeons to decoy others to their
                    pigeon-houses, and those that made a gain of their fruits in the sabbatical
                    year. Some also exclude the high priest and the king, because of their power;
                    but others will have it that the kings always presided in the sanhedrim whilst
                    there were any kings in Israel. Lastly, it was required that the members of the
                    sanhedrim should be of a mature age, of a handsome person, and of considerable
                    fortune. We speak now according to the notions of the rabbin, without pretending
                    to warrant their opinions.</p>
                <p>The authority of the great sanhedrim was very extensive. This council decided
                    such causes as were brought before it by way of appeal from the inferior courts.
                    The king, the high priest, and the prophets, were under its jurisdiction. If the
                    king offended against the law, for example, if he married above eighteen wives,
                    if he kept too many horses, if he hoarded up too much gold and silver, the
                    sanhedrim had him stripped and whipped in their presence. But whipping, they
                    say, among the Hebrews was not at all ignominious; and the king bore this
                    correction by way of penance, and himself made choice of the person that was to
                    exercise this discipline over him. The general affairs of the nation were also
                    brought before the sanhedrim. The right of judging in capital cases belonged to
                    this court, and the sentence could not be pronounced in any other place, but in
                    the hall called <hi rend="italic">Laschat-haggazith,</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">hall paved with stones,</hi> supposed by some to be the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aι0oστϑωτoς,</hi> or pavement, mentioned in John xix. 13. Hence it
                    came to pass, that the Jews were forced to quit this hall when the power of life
                    and death was taken out of their hands, forty years before the destruction of
                    their temple, and three years before the death of Jesus Christ. In the time of
                    Moses this council was held at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony. As
                    soon as the people were in possession of the land of promise, the sandhedrim
                    followed the tabernacle. It was kept successively at Gilgal, at Shiloh, at
                    Kirjath-jearim, at Nob, at Gibeon in the house of Obed-edom; and, lastly, it was
                    settled at Jerusalem until the Babylonish captivity. During the captivity it was
                    kept up at Babylon. After the return from Babylon, it continued at Jerusalem
                    until the time of the Sicarii or Assassins. Then finding that these profligate
                    wretches, whose number increased every day, sometimes escaped punishment by
                    favour of the president or judges, it was removed to Hanoth, which were certain
                    abodes situated, as the rabbin tell us, upon the mountain of the temple. From
                    thence they came down into the city of Jerusalem, withdrawing themselves by
                    degrees from the temple. Afterwards they removed to Jamia, thence to Jericho, to
                    Uz-zah, to Sepharvaim, to Bethsanim, to Sephoris, last of all to Tiberias, where
                    they continued till the time of their utter extinction. And this is the account
                    the Jews themselves give us of the sanhedrim.</p>
                <p>But the learned do not agree with them in all this. Father Petau fixes the
                    beginning of the sanhedrim not till Gabinius was governor of Judaea, who,
                    according to Josephus, erect<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=696" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0696-0642"/>ed
                    tribunals in the five principal cities of Judaea; at Jerusalem, at Gadara, at
                    Amathus, at Jericho, and at Sephora or Sephoris, a city of Galilee. Grotius
                    places the origin of , the sanhedrim under Moses, as the rabbin do; but he makes
                    it terminate at the beginning of Herod’s reign. Mr Basnage at first thought that
                    the sanhedrim began under Gabinius; but afterwards he places it under Judas
                    Maccabaeus, or under his brother Jonathan. We see, indeed, under Jonathan
                    Maccabaeus, in the year 3860, that the senate along with the high priest sent an
                    embassy to the Romans. The rabbin say, that Alexander Jannaeus, king of the
                    Jews, of the race of the Asmonaeans, appeared before the sanhedrim, and claimed
                    a right of sitting there, whether the senators would or not. Josephus informs
                    us, that when Herod was but yet governor of Galilee, he was summoned before the
                    senate, where he appeared. It must be therefore acknowledged that the sanhedrim
                    was in being before the reign of Herod. It was in being afterwards, as we find
                    from the Gospel and from the Acts. Jesus Christ in St Matthew (v. 22)
                    distinguishes two tribunals. “Whosoever is angry with his brother without a
                    cause shall be in danger of the judgment this, they say, is the tribunal of the
                    twenty-three judges. “And whosoever shall say to his brother Raca, shall be in
                    danger of the council ;” that is, of the great sanhedrim, which had the right of
                    life and death, at least generally, and before this right was taken away by the
                    Romans. Some think that the jurisdiction of the council of twenty-three extended
                    to life and death also; but it is certain that the sanhedrim was superior to
                    this council.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See also
                    Mark, xiii. 9, xiv. 55, xv. 1; Luke, xxii. 52, 66; John, xi. 47; Acts, iv. 15,
                    v. 21; where mention is made of the synedrion or sanhedrim.</p></note></p>
                <p>From all this it may be concluded, that the origin of the sanhedrim is involved
                    in uncertainty; for the council of the seventy elders established by Moses was
                    not what the Hebrews understand by the name of sanhedrim. Besides, we cannot
                    perceive that this establishment subsisted either under Joshua, the judges, or
                    the kings. We find nothing of it after the captivity till the time of Jonathan
                    Maccabaeus. The tribunals erected by Gabinius were very different from the
                    sanhedrim, which was the supreme court of judicature, and fixed at Jerusalem,
                    whereas Gabinins established five at five different cities. Lastly, it is
                    certain that this senate was in being in the time of Jesus Christ; but the Jews
                    themselves inform us that they had then no longer the power of life and death
                    (John, xviii. 31).</p>
