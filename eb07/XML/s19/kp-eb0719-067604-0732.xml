                <p><label type="entry">SCEPTIC</label>, σχηπτχος, from <hi rend="italic">σχεπτομαι,
                    I consider, look about,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">deliberare,</hi> properly
                    signifies considerative and inquisitive, or one who is always weighing reasons
                    on one side and the other, without ever deciding between them. It is chiefly
                    applied to an ancient sect of philosophers founded by Pyrrho, who, according to
                    Laertius, had various other denominations. From their master they were called
                    Pyr-rhonians; from the distinguishing tenets or characteristic of their
                    philosophy they derived the name of <hi rend="italic">Aporetici,</hi> from <hi
                    rend="italic">ἀποϑειv</hi>, to <hi rend="italic">doubt;</hi> from their
                    suspension and hesitation they were called <hi rend="italic">ephectici,</hi>
                    from <hi rend="italic">ἐπεχειv, to stag</hi> or <hi rend="italic">keep
                    back;</hi> and, lastly, they were called <hi rend="italic">zetetici,</hi> or
                    seekers, from their never getting beyond the search of truth.</p>
                <p>That the sceptical philosophy is absurd, can admit of no ' dispute in the present
                    age; and that many of the followers of Pyrrho carried it to the most ridiculous
                    height, is not less true. But we cannot believe that he himself was so
                    extravagantly sceptical as has sometimes been asserted, when we reflect on the
                    particulars of his life, which are still preserved, and the respectful manner in
                    which we find him mentioned by his contemporaries and writers of the first name
                    who flourished soon after him. The truth, as far as at this distance of time it
                    can be discovered, seems to be, that he learned from Democritus to deny the real
                    existence of all<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=733"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0733-0677"/> qualities in bodies, except those which are
                    essential to primary atoms; and that he referred every thing else to the
                    perceptions of the mind produced by external objects, in other words, to
                    appearance and opinion. All knowledge of course appeared to him to depend on the
                    fallacious report of the senses, and consequently to be uncertain; and in this
                    notion he was confirmed by the general spirit of the Eleatic School, in which he
                    was educated. He was further confirmed in his scepticism by the subtilties of
                    the Dialectic school, in which he had been instructed by the son of Stilpo;
                    choosing to overturn the cavils of sophistry by recurring to the doctrine of
                    universal uncertainty, and thus breaking the knot which he could not unloose.
                    For being naturally and habitually inclined to consider immoveable tranquillity
                    as the great end of all philosophy, he was easily led to despise the dissensions
                    of the dogmatists, and to infer from their endless disputes, the uncertainty of
                    the questions on which they debated; controvérsy, as it has often happened to
                    others, becoming also with respect to him the parent of scepticism.</p>
                <p>Pyrrho’s doctrines, however new and extraordinary, were not totally disregarded.
                    He was attended by several scholars, and succeeded by several followers, who
                    preserved the memory of his notions. The most eminent of his followers was
                    Tiraon, in whom the public succession of professors in the Pyrrhonic school
                    terminated. In the time of Cicero it was almost extinct, having suffered much
                    from the jealousy of the dogmatists, and from a natural aversion in the human
                    mind to acknowledge total ignorance, or to be left in absolute darkness. The
                    disciples of Timon, however, still continued to profess scepticism, and their
                    notions were embraced, privately at least, by many others. The school itself was
                    afterwards revived by Ptolemaeus a Cyrenian, and was continued by AEnesidemus a
                    contemporary of Cicero, who wrote a treatise on the principles of the Pyrrhonic
                    philosophy, the heads of which are preserved by Photius. From this time it was
                    continued through a series of preceptors of little note to Sextus Empiricus, who
                    also gave a summary of the sceptical doctrine.</p>
                <p>A system of philosophy thus founded on doubt, and clouded with uncertainty, could
                    neither teach tenets of any importance, nor prescribe a certain rule of conduct;
                    and accordingly we find that the followers of scepticism were guided entirely by
                    chance. As they could form no certain judgment respecting good and evil, they
                    accidentally learned the folly of eagerly pursuing any apparent good, or of
                    avoiding any apparent evil; and their minds of course settled into a state of
                    undisturbed tranquillity, the grand postulatum of their system.</p>
                <p>In the schools of the sceptics we find ten distinct topics of argument urged in
                    support of the doctrine of uncertainty; with this precaution, however, that
                    nothing could be positively asserted either concerning their number or their
                    force. These arguments chiefly respect objects of sense. They place all
                    knowledge in appearance; and as the same things appear very different to
                    different people, it is impossible to say which appearance most truly expresses
                    their real nature. They likewise say that our judgment is liable to uncertainty
                    from the circumstance of frequent or rare occurrence, and that mankind are
                    continually led into different conceptions concerning the same thing, by means
                    of custom, law, fabulous tales, and established opinions. On all these accounts,
                    they think every human judgment is liable to uncertainty; and concerning any
                    thing, they can only assert that it seems to be, not that it is what it
                    seems.</p>
                <p>This doubtful reasoning, if reasoning it may be called, the sceptics extended to
                    all the sciences, in which they discovered nothing true, or which could be
                    absolutely asserted. In all nature, in physics, morals, and theology, they found
                    contradictory opinions, and inexplicable or incomprehensible phenomena. In
                    physics, the appearances, they thought, might be deceitful; and respecting the
                    nature of God and the duties of morality, men were, in their opinion, equally
                    ignorant and uncertain. To overturn the sophistical arguments of these sceptical
                    reasoners, would be no difficult matter, if their reasoning were worthy of
                    confutation. Indeed, the great principle is sufficiently, though shortly,
                    refuted by Plato, in these words. “When you say all things are
                    incomprehensible,” says he, “do you comprehend or conceive that they are thus
                    incomprehensible, or do you not? If you do, then something is comprehensible; if
                    you do not, there is no reason we should believe you, since you do not
                    comprehend your own assertion.”</p>
                <p>But scepticism has not been confined entirely to the ancients and to the
                    followers of Pyrrho. Numerous sceptics have arisen also in modern times, varying
                    in their principles, manners, and character, as chance, prejudice, vanity,
                    weakness, or indolence, prompted them. The great object, however, which they
                    seem to have in view is to overturn, or at least to weaken, the evidence of
                    analogy, experience, and testimony; though some of them have even attempted to
                    show, that the axioms of geometry are uncertain, and its demonstrations
                    inconclusive. This last attempt has not indeed been often made; but the chief
                    aim of Mr Hume’s philosophical writings is to introduce doubts into every branch
                    of physics, metaphysics, history, ethics, and theology. It is needless to give a
                    specimen of his reasonings in support of modern scepticism. The most important
                    of them have been noticed in the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Miracle,
                    Metaphysics,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Philosophy</hi>; and such of our
                    readers as have any relish for speculations of that nature can be no strangers
                    to his Essays, or to the able confutations of them by Reid, Campbell, Gregory,
                    Beattie, and Stewart, who have likewise exposed the weakness of the sceptical
                    reasonings of Descartes, Malebranche, and other philosphers of great fame in the
                    same school.</p>
