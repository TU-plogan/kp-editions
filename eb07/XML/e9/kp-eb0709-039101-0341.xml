                    rend="smallcaps">Megara,</hi> a distinguished philosopher and logician, who
                    flourished about 400 years before Christ. The Athenians having prohibited the
                    Megareans from entering their city on pain of death, this philosopher disguised
                    himself in women’s clothes, in order to attend the lectures of Socrates. After
                    the death of Socrates, Plato and other philosophers went to Euclid at Megara, in
                    order to shelter themselves from the tyrants who then governed Athens. Euclid
                    admitted but one chief good, which he sometimes called God, sometimes Spirit,
                    and sometimes Providence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Euclid of Alexandria,</hi> author of the most ancient
                    elements of geometry which have come down to us, and for this reason justly
                    regarded as one of the fathers of science. He has been sometimes confounded with
                    Euclid of Megara, the disciple of Socrates, and the founder of a philosophic
                    sect who pushed to an extreme the subtilties of dialectics. The place of his
                    birth is unknown. But Proclus Diadochus, one of his commentators, informs us
                    that he opened a school of mathematics in Alexandria in the reign of Ptolemy the
                    son of Lagus; and Pappus extols his kindness and affection for those who
                    laboured to advance the study of geometry. This being all that is known of the
                    life and character of Euclid, it only remains therefore to speak of his works,
                    some of which have been lost. Amongst those which we possess, however, the most
                    remarkable is that which is simply entitled <hi rend="italic">Elements,</hi> as
                    if to indicate that it contained the entire body of principles upon which the
                    pure mathematics then rested. This work now consists of fifteen books; but the
                    last two are attributed to Hypsicles, a mathematician of Alexandria who
                    flourished at a later period. Euclid, however, neither was nor could be the
                    inventor of all that is contained in his work; for geometers more ancient than
                    he, including Hippocrates of Chio, had written Elements; but, on the other hand,
                    there can be little doubt that he added to the pre-existing stock of elementary
                    truths, improved the demonstrations in which his predecessors had failed, and
                    composed a whole which, by more severe forms of reasoning, and a more exact
                    concatenation of propositions, superseded all works of the same description
                    which had been previously written, and became the basis of instruction in the
                    mathematics. These <hi rend="italic">Elemeìits</hi> were first commented on by
                    Theon, and by Proclus; but whatever success such commentaries may have had in
                    the school of Alexandria, they remained wholly unknown to the occidentals of the
                    middle ages, who derived all their knowledge of geometry, such as it was, from
                    the works of Boe-cius, and from a production entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Principiis Geometrice,</hi> ascribed to St
                    Augustin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Montucla,

                    the twelfth and thirteen centuries that Athelard in England and Campano in Italy
                    laboured to decipher and translate Euclid from the Arabic versions, including
                    the commentary of the Persian geometer Nazir-Eddin, which was held in great
                    estimation among the Saracens; for although there <hi rend="superscript">

                    Euclid, it has not come down to our t ’ mes; and, in fact, it was not till long
                    after the revival °i letters, and when versions had been multiplied by means <hi

                    part of the <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> of Euclid was introduced into the
                    course of instruction in the schools, <hi rend="superscript"> n 0r</hi> der to
                    form an idea of the entire work, however, it may be considered as composed of
                    four parts. The first of these parts comprehends the first six books, and may be
                    divided into three sections, viz. the demonstration of the properties of plane
                    figures treated in an absolute manner, as in books first, second, third, and
                    fourth; the theory of the proportions of quantities in general, which is the
                    object of the fifth; and the application of this theory to plane figures, as in
                    book sixth. The second part contains the seventh, eighth, and ninth books, which
                    are denominated <hi rend="italic">arithmetical,</hi> because they treat of the
                    general properties of numbers. The third part consists only of the tenth book,
                    in which the author considers in detail incommensurable quantities, and which he
                    terminates by proving that the diagonal of a square and its side cannot have a
                    common measure; a doctrine, we may add, which is much more ancient than Euclid,
                    since Plato, towards the close of his seventh book of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Laws,</hi> pronounces those who have no idea of such incommensurability as sunk
                    in almost brutish ignorance. The fourth part, which is composed of the last five
                    books, treats of planes and solids. But of all this great body of geometrical
                    doctrine, the only portions which have been considered as adapted to the
                    purposes of instruction are the first six books, together with the eleventh and
                    the twelfth; the propositions which they contain having formed the basis of all
                    the elements of geometry which, under whatever form, have from time to time been
                    given to the world. The fifth book, however, has often been omitted in such
                    publications, because the notation of our arithmetic, and still more that of our
                    algebra, have greatly simplified the theory of proportions; and, for the same
                    reason, the other arithmetical books, which it is now difficult to read, are
                    justly considered as more curious than useful. But, in borrowing their materials
                    from the work of Euclid, modern authors have frequently altered the arrangement;
                    and on this subject there have arisen two contradictory opinions, which have
                    been debated with very great warmth, yet still remain as irreconcilable as ever.
                    The concatenation established by Euclid, and even the forms which he has
                    employed in demonstrating his propositions, are regarded by some as almost the
                    last term of perfection in works of this kind; whilst others, again, have
                    considered these as mere essays, which, however excellent in themselves, leave
                    room for the introduction of a more natural order and more simple
                    demonstrations. Ramus, who declared war on the dialectics of Aristotle, accuses
                    Euclid of omissions and redundancies, and expresses his conviction that it was
                    with reference to these imperfections that Ptolemy inquired if there were not a
                    more easy method than that usually employed for learning geometry; an inquiry
                    which, as is well known, elicited from Euclid the reply, that in the mathematics
                    there was no road for kings. Antony Arnauld, and the author of the Logic of
                    Port-Royal, have also blamed the order followed by the Greek geometer, and
                    disputed some of his definitions;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>fee Nouveaux Elements de la Géométrie, and the Fourth Part
                    of the Logique Port-RoijaL</p></note> but if Arnauld, either from not being very
                    profound in the mathematics, or by reason of the great difficulty of the
                    subject, failed, as Ramus and so many others had done, in the changes which he
                    attempted to introduce into the <hi rend="italic">Elements,</hi> his reasons for
                    making the attempt still remain in all their force. For, whatever may be said to
                    the contrary, it is certain that they are deficient in that order which, causing
                    the propositions, as far as possible, to arise out of one another, exhibits in
                    full evidence the analogies which connect them, assists the memory, and prepares
                    the mind for the investigation of truth. But whether, in the actual state of the
                    science, it be practicable to reconcile <pb break="no" facs="nls:193750354"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-0354-0392"/>this order with the rigour of demonstration, or to
                    obviate objections the force of which, abstractedly considered, cannot be
                    disputed, is a question which it would far exceed the limits of this notice to
                    discuss.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lacroix, Essais

                    possible, then no reason would exist for giving an absolute preference to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> of Euclid. As a precious relic of antiquity, and
                    as one of those works of science which time has thrown least in arrear of actual
                    knowledge, the <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> would doubtless continue to be
                    classed in the first rank of mathematical productions; but their too arbitrary
                    arrangement, and the style in which they are written, sometimes too prolix and
                    at other times too concise, would no longer constitute the essential character
                    of the geometric or synthetic method, in opposition to the analysis of the
                    moderns. The true difference of these two methods of treating the science of
                    quantities consists in this, that the one is founded on the immediate
                    consideration of the properties of figures, whilst the other employs arbitrary
                    signs, combined by the operations of calculation. The first is geometry itself,
                    not that of Euclid more than of any other; the second is an application of
                    algebra, which ought not to be confounded with analysis, inasmuch as synthesis
                    may be effected with algebraic signs as well as with the figures of geometry.
                    The latter, however, which may also be treated analytically, presents operations
                    equivalent to the resolution of certain equations. Of this some propositions
                    contained in^he book of <hi rend="italic">Data</hi> are remarkable examples;
                    propositions which, by a natural and certain path, lead to the solution of
                    problems otherwise un-discoverable. The book of <hi rend="italic">Data</hi> was
                    particularly relished by Newton, who, persuaded that a proposition scarcely
                    deserved to see the light unless it could be demonstrated without the assistance
                    of calculation, conceived that a more profound study of this treatise would have
                    enabled him to dispense with the aid of such an instrument. But it may well be
                    doubted, to say nothing more, whether his successors, by pursuing a similar
                    path, would have ever attained those great and striking results which they have
                    derived from the new methods of calculation. Besides the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elements</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Data·,</hi> which are the most
                    important works of Euclid, Pappus and Proclus mention the following: <hi
