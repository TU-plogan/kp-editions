                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    Tables</hi></label>, <hi rend="italic">Tabulce Eugu-binoe,</hi> inscribed
                    tablets in bronze, found in 1444 at La Schieggia, near Gubbio <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Eugubiurn),</hi> in the duchy of Urbino. These tablets are seven in number,
                    five of them containing inscriptions in Umbric, mixed with Etruscan, and the
                    remaining two inscriptions in Latin characters. They were at first believed to
                    be of very high antiquity; but it is now pretty generally agreed that they are
                    not more ancient than the fourth century before the Christian era. The learned
                    reader will find copies of these remarkable monuments in Dempster’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Etruria</hi><hi rend="italic">Regalis</hi> (vol. i. p. 91, et
                    seqq.), and also some curious details respecting them in the supplement to that
                    work by the senator Buonarotti (vol. ii. p. 101). According to Lanzi, they refer
                    entirely to the mode of sacrifice, the particular forms of prayer, and other
                    religious rites of certain Umbrian communities, who were united in a sort of
                    federal bond; but the explanations of the learned Italian are much too arbitrary
                    and hypothetical to be of any authority; and, in point of fact, we are still as
                    ignorant of the <hi rend="italic">language</hi> of these inscriptions as when
                    the tablets were first discovered, nearly four centuries ago. (See article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Etruscans.)</hi> But as the character has proved less
                    untractable than the text, an Etruscan alphabet has been constructed, by means
                    of which we are enabled to read the words which as yet we cannot interpret.
                    Previously to the time (1732) when Bourguet undertook this difficult task,
                    several persons had attempted it, and failed. But, by carefully comparing the
                    tablets in the Roman character with those in the Etruscan, the ingenious
                    Frenchman discovered that the former were a compendium of the latter, and that
                    many words were common to both sets; and, having obtained this key, he
                    succeeded, by pursuing the comparison he had instituted, in constructing an
                    alphabet which, though far from being complete, was yet much more perfect than
                    any <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> which had preceded it. Since the time of
                    Bourguet, however, no further progress has been made in this confined but
                    interesting field of inquiry; and as the language has hitherto baffled every
                    artifice of interpretation, the contents of these curious monuments of antiquity
                    still remain undeciphered. The discovery of a bilingual inscription, which is
                    not an impossible event, would, however, furnish the needful key, and lead
                    directly to the solution of an enigma alike vexatious and interesting to the
                    scholar. Should this ever happen, or should some rare effort of sagacity or
                    miracle of fortune unexpectedly put any inquirer on the right road without such
                    aid, we venture to prognosticate that the language of these inscriptions will be
                    found to be radically Celtic, perhaps a dead dialect of that language,
                    intermixed with terms of Pelasgic origin. That the Umbri were Celts, or at least
                    of Celtic origin, there can be little doubt; and it seems equally certain that
                    the Etruscans, who ultimately predominated over all the other tribes which from
                    time to time had settled in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193750432"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-0432-0398"/>Etruria, were also, in part at least, of northern
                    descent. It would therefore be strange indeed if in these inscrip* tions, five
                    of which are in the Umbric mixed with the Etruscan character, no traces were
                    found of that primitive language which successive immigrations from the north
                    must have diffused over a considerable portion of the great plain of Italy. The
                    Eugubine Tables were first published by Smetius, 1588; then by Gruter, <hi
