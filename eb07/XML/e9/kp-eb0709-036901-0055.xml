                <p><label type="entry">ESSEX</label>, a county of England, is bounded on the south
                    by the river Thames, on the east by the German Ocean, on the north by the
                    counties of Suffolk and Cambridge, and on the west by Hertfordshire and
                    Middlesex. Its surface contains 1473 square miles, according to the last
                    measurement of the Board of Ordnance. The population has not increased in this
                    county at the same rapid rate as that of the other counties of England, having
                    been 226,437 in 1801, 252,473 in 1811, 289,424 in 1821, and 317,200 in 1831. As
                    the surface is about 942,720 acres, there is nearly one person to every three
                    acres; but if the rivers and large estuaries be deducted from the calculation of
                    extent, the population may be stated as still more dense.</p>
                <p>Essex may be considered as a mere agricultural county; for though, from the near
                    approach of one part of it to the metropolis of the kingdom, there are some
                    manufactories established, which find both their raw materials and their
                    consumption in London; and though in one district of the county there are
                    remains of the once extensive manufactories which were brought from Flanders to
                    this island; the number of persons occupied in them bears but a very small
                    proportion to that part of the population which depends on agriculture. The
                    former manufactures of Colchester baizes for the Spanish and American markets
                    have wholly disappeared, and those for woollen goods at Bocking, Halsted, and
                    Coggeshall, are nearly extinct; all having removed to the northern parts of the
                    kingdom. On the eastern side of the county, in the vicinity of the metropolis,
                    are several large distilleries, and some establishments for bleaching and
                    printing calicoes. There are also manufactories of sal-ammoniac, of Prussian
                    blue, of iron liquor for calico-printers, and Some other chemical preparations.
                    There is a considerable trade in corn, and much barley is malted for the great
                    breweries and distilleries. The only other commerce is that of supplying the
                    inhabitants with foreign and domestic articles of luxury.</p>
                <p>Although nearly half the county is bounded by the sea, or by navigable rivers, it
                    carries on no foreign commerce; and what vessels belong to it are employed
                    either in conveying to London the produce of its agriculture, or in the oyster
                    fishery, which occupies a considerable tonnage and many seafaring persons. The
                    oysters are bred both in the river Coln and in the Crouch; in the former they
                    are protected by the seignorial rights of the corporation of Colchester, and in
                    the latter by the proprietor of that river, Sir Henry Mildmay. The spawn is
                    deposited in the months of April and May; and it is said the shell about it
                    begins to form within twenty-four hours. The fishermen are forbidden to dredge
                    for them at this season. In the month of July the dredgers separate the small
                    oysters from the stones on which the spawn was deposited, and on which they have
                    grown, and lay them down in the channels of the river till they grow of a size
                    fit for consumption, which is determined by a gage kept for that purpose by the
                    water-bailiff of Colchester. The stones or other substances to which the young
                    oysters had adhered are again thrown into the water whence they were taken, as
                    it is apprehended the accumulation of the ouse at the bottom of the river would
                    otherwise generate such an increase of muscles and cockles as Va∙w <hi

                    the London market. The uncertain produce of the breeding grounds in Essex makes
                    it necessary to have recourse to the more distant coasts to obtain the requisite
                    supply.</p>
                <p>From being almost wholly an agricultural county, the far greater part of the
                    inhabitants of Essex are found in villages. The principal places, with their

                <p>Besides these, the towns of Witham, Dunmow, Harlow, Pritdewéll, Finehingfield,
                    Sible-Hedingham, Hornehurch, and Thaxted, each now contain more than 2000
                    inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The face of the county is generally very beautiful; it is well enclosed, and for
                    the most part displays good verdant pastures; the hills, none of which rise to
                    great heights, are cultivated to the tops; and there are abundance of trees,
                    especially oak and chestnut, which give a rich appearance to the view. There is
                    no county in England in which the proportion of waste land is so small. The
                    forests and wastes can indeed scarcely be considered as utterly uncultivated,
                    and the whole of them do not amount to more than 14,000 acres, including the two
                    forests of Epping and Hainault. These belong to the crown, though the
                    inhabitants of many surrounding parishes have the right of pasturing their
                    cattle upon them. The king has an unlimited right to keep deer on all the
                    enclosed woods, and the occupiers of land in the various parishes included
                    within the ancient boundaries of the forests have a right to feed horses and
                    cows, but not other cattle. The numerous common rights have led to considerable
                    devastation of the timber of these forests, and occasioned no small injury to
                    the property of the crown; but plans have lately been adopted for preserving the
                    trees, and converting a part into a nursery for growing timber for the royal
                    navy. The vicinity to navigation makes these forests well deserving of being
                    appropriated to this purpose. ’</p>
                <p>That part of Essex which lies on the banks of the Thames, and on the shores of
                    the ocean, is a rich alluvial soil on a subsoil of very tenacious clay. It
                    produces, with good cultivation, most abundant crops of wheat, beans, oats, and
                    clover. It is found necessary to the cultivation to fallow very frequently, and
                    repeated ploughings is a practice very generally adopted. The swing plough is
                    much used, and sometimes a wheel plough drawn by two, and occasionally by three
                    horses abreast, which are guided with long reins by the ploughman. In fallowing
                    it is common to plough the land six or seven times, and it is not unusual with
                    the best cultivators to plough it eight or even ten times. After the summer
                    fallow, by which the soil becomes completely pulverized, and rendered as fine as
                    a garden, it is sometimes the practice to sow wheat in the autumn; but it is
                    more common to let it remain throughout the winter, and then, after a spring
                    ploughing, to sow barley or oats. The rotation of crops which usually succeed to
                    a fallow is, 1. barley or oats; 2. clover, red or white, mostly the former; 3.
                    wheat; 4. beans, twice hoed at <pb break="no" facs="nls:193750068"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-0068-0370"/>least; 5. wheat. After this course the land is
                    again fallowed. The whole produce of the course of crops is said to depend on
                    the accuracy and skill exercised in the process of fallowing.</p>
                <p>There is in this district some land adapted for turnips, and the rotation on such
                    soils is usually, 1. turnips; 2. oats or barley; 3. clover; 4. wheat; 5. beans;
                    6. wheat. These courses are occasionally varied, tares being introduced when the
                    clover fails, and peas being sometimes substituted for beans. The best
                    cultivators often omit the second crop of wheat, and fallow again after the
                    beans. A rotation which is sanctioned by some very skilful agriculturists is the
                    following: 1. fallow; 2. barley or oats ∙, 3. clover; 4. beans; 5. wheat; 6.
                    tares or peas; 7. wheat. In this case the manure is laid on the clover ley for
                    the bean crop. In the district we are describing all the farms have a portion,
                    more or less extensive, of rich marsh land, on which oxen are fed, which
                    supplies hay for winter consumption, and is consequently the source whence the
                    manure is derived. The best wheat that is brought to the market of the
                    metropolis is raised in the part of Essex of which we are speaking, and which is
                    usually denominated the <hi rend="italic">hundreds.</hi> It has the convenience
                    of water-carriage to London; the rent of land is comparatively low, and it is of
                    extraordinary fertility; but it suffers from a scarcity of good water. It is,
                    especially in the autumn, a very ague-ish county; and though of late the roads
                    have been much improved, they are still in such a state as, added to its
                    insalubrity, prevents the gentry from residing on their estates.</p>
                <p>The middle part of Essex rises above the level of the marshy lands, but partakes,
                    in a considerable degree, of their unhealthiness. Around the town of Colchester,
                    for a considerable distance, the soil is a dry loam, well calculated for
                    turnips; and then the most general system adopted is the four-course husbandry
                    of Norfolk, viz. turnip, barley, clover, and wheat. A variation is in some
                    instances introduced by taking a crop of peas after the wheat, and occasionally
                    tares arc sown after the barley instead of clover, as that latter plant will
                    sometimes fail if too frequently repeated. The greater part of the district is,
                    however, of a clayey loam, on a subsoil of clay, and too tenacious for the
                    turnip system. Much of this is good old pasture land, used solely for feeding,
                    and to which the plough is never applied. The arable land is highly productive;
                    the crops of wheat and beans especially are very luxuriant, and their produce of
                    the best quality. The practice of fallowing is pursued as in the district before
                    described, but so many ploughings are not deemed necessary. The rotation is
                    various, but it rarely occurs that wheat is sown immediately after the fallow.
                    Most commmonly the succession is as follows: 1. fallow; 2. barley; 3. beans; 4.
                    wheat; 5. tares; 6. barley; 7. clover. When the land is more wet, which, in
                    spite of excellent draining, is frequently the case, the rotation is, 1. fallow;
                    2. oats; 3. clover; 4. wheat. When manure is abundant, the heavy soils are
                    cropped in the following rotation with great success: I. fallow; 2. beans; 3.
                    wheat; 4. tares; 5. barley; 6. clover; 7. beans; 8. wheat. In this rotation the
                    clearing of the ground from weeds depends on the use of the hoe, which is
                    applied most carefully to the crops of beans.</p>
                <p>The western part of the county, especially where it borders on Hertfordshire, is,
                    in general, land of a very inferior quality, and, without very expensive
                    cultivation, yields but light crops. In one extensive district, called the
                    Rodings, is still practised a most singular system of husbandry, known now in
                    Essex only, though formerly it was adopted on poor lands in some other counties.
                    It is, 1. a year’s fallow; 2. wheat; 3. fallow; 4. barley, and then a repetition
                    of the same-course; thus having one half the arable land constantly without any
                    crop. The soil is a tenacious clay, of a reddish colour, upon a subsoil of white
                    clay. It is difficult to pulverize, and, with wet, potches so much as not to
                    admit of ploughing when the atmosphere is moist. There are but small parts of
                    this district which produce clover, peas, tares, or beans; and what hay is grown
                    is confined to the narrow borders of the rivulets which rurt in the
                    valleys..</p>
                <p>In the south-western part of the county the agriculture assumes that system which
                    is adapted to the supply of the wants of the metropolis. A great portion of the
                    land is in permanent pasture, or grows hay to furnish the markets of Smithfield
                    and Whitechapel. The arable land is generally cultivated with a rotation of
                    three crops, viz. potatoes, wheat, and clover; and, as London supplies abundance
                    of manure, by applying it very liberally to the young clover after the wheat is
                    harvested, such culture produces most abundant crops, and the land is cleaned by
                    the potato culture. In this kind of husbandry, which, indeed, can only be
                    conducted where manure is to be obtained with great facility, the plough is only
                    used once in the rotation after the clover; as the potatoes are planted, and the
                    digging them up sufficiently prepares the land for wheat.</p>
                <p>Essex feeds some sheep, but very few are bred in the county. Calves are suckled
                    to a great extent, and the rearing them to furnish veal for the London market is
                    the principal dependence of many farmers. The whiteness of the veal is produced
                    by a great attention to cleanliness, by regular periods of suckling, and by
                    giving them a small portion of barley-meal mixed with chalk. The tendency to
                    fatten is promoted by administering narcotic drugs, which keep the young animals
                    in a quiescent state. Though the county affords such abundance of excellent
                    pasture, yet the fattening of calves is so much more profitable than the dairy,
                    that it is supplied with butter from other counties. Epping has indeed been
                    celebrated for its excellent butter; but the greater part of what is sold in
                    London under that denomination is the produce of Northamptonshire,
                    Buckinghamshire, and other counties. London is supplied with much of its beef
                    from Essex. The bullocks, in a lean state, are brought from Scotland, from
                    Wales, and some from Devonshire, and are fattened in this county, sometimes on
                    the rich natural meadows, and sometimes on turnips, with the addition of
                    oil-cake.</p>
                <p>Several other agricultural productions are cultivated in Essex. Hops are grown
                    near Chelmsford, and in a few other districts. Saffron is cultivated near
                    Saffron-Walden with great success. Mustard is an advantageous crop in the
                    islands of Foulness and Wallasea, and on the embanked marshes. On some rich old
                    pasture land, when first broken up, three crops are raised together, viz.
                    carraway seed, coriander seed, and teasels for the baize manufacturers. The
                    three kinds of seed are sowed together m the spring of the year. The harvest of
                    the coriander takes place in the following autumn. The carraway is a biennial
                    plant, and the seed is fit to be gathered in July of ⅛e succeeding year; and in
                    September of the same year the teasels are cut. The carraway sometimes produces
                    a crop the second, or even the third year. This cultivation is deemed an
                    excellent preparation for the growth of wheat, on lands which are so prolific as
                    to require some degree of exhaustion, as, the hoe being very liberally applied
                    in the process of this triple cropping, it keeps the ground free from weeds.
                    There are few counties in England, taking the whole o them together, in which
                    the agriculture is so skilfully con-dueted, or where the productiveness is so
                    great.</p>
                <p>The landed property in Essex, as in other counties near to the metropolis, is
                    very much divided; there are no overgrown estates, though some of considerable
                    value, belonging to a few individuals; but the greater part m moderate-sized
                    farms, which can be easily disposed of, an <pb break="no" facs="nls:193750081"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-0081-0371"/>which are frequently purchased from the savings of
                    the commercial class in London.</p>
                <p>The only good harbour in this county is Harwich, whence the packets for Holland
                    are dispatched, and where there is a royal dock-yard, in which some frigates are
                    built and repaired. The river Coln is navigable for small vessels to Colchester,
                    and the Blackwater river to Walden. The Crouch is navigable for the largest
                    ships; but, passing through an unhealthy country, and having few inhabitants on
                    its borders, it is useless for the purposes of commerce. The river Lea is
                    navigable by barges a distance of twenty-five miles. There are no canals in this
                    county, but one is projected to unite the river Lea with the Cam, and thus
                    create internal navigation from Lynn to London.</p>
                <p>This county gives the title of earl to the family of Capel, and of Rochford to
                    the family of Nassau; that of Baron Colchester to the family of the late Speaker
                    of the House of Commons, Abbot; and that of Baron Western to the late
                    representative of the county.</p>
                <p>The members of the House of Commons elected in Essex are ten, being two for each
                    of the boroughs of Colchester, Harwich, and Maldon, and four for the county,
                    which, for election purposes, has been divided into the northern and southern
                    districts. The polling places of the former are Braintree, Colchester,
                    Saffron-Walden, and Thorpe; and of the latter, Chelmsford, Billericay, Romford,
                    Epping, Rochford, and Maldon.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable seats of noblemen and others are Audley-End, Lord Braybrooks;
                    Thorndon, Lord Petre; Wanstead, now dilapidated, Hon. William Wellesley Pole;
                    Easton Lodge, Lord Maynard; Felix Hall, Lord Western; Mistley Hall, C. Manners

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Essex,</hi> a post-town in Essex county, New York, on the
                    western shore of Lake Champlain. It is fourteen miles south-west of Burlington,
                    and sixteen miles from Elizabethtown. In this township there is a village
                    situated on the lake, which is very flourishing, and enjoys a considerable
                    trade. Essex is the name of several counties in the United States, which will be
