                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">ERIVAN</label>, a province of Persia, bounded on the north
                    and west by the Mossian Hills, on the south by the Araxes, and on the east by
                    the districts of the Karabang and Karadang. It is of considerable extent, and
                    has a salubrious climate, though the winter is of long duration. It possesses,
                    according to Sir R. K. Porter, by whom it was visited in 1817, every natural
                    beauty which a fine assemblage of mountain, dale, and water can bestow. The
                    principal towns are Erivan and Nackshivan. This province is ruled by a sardar,
                    who differs from most others in the empire, as he pays no tribute to the king,
                    holding his station by a military tenure, by which he is bound to furnish to the
                    royal army in time of war a certain quota of troops. To him is entrusted the
                    defence of the frontier within the limits of the province; so that he more
                    resembles a prince in his authority, as well as in all his appointments, than a
                    provincial governor. He has immense wealth both in money and in land. The
                    province is 200 miles in length and 100 ⅛ breadth. According to a general census
                    taken in 1814, the number of inhabitants capable of bearing arms amounted to
                    18,000. The annual revenue is 150,000 tomauns, or L.75,000 sterling.</p>

                    rend="italic">l’rivan,</hi> the capital of the above province, situated in an
                    angle of a great plain at the foot of the Mossian Hills, on the banks of the
                    river Zengui, which rises from a lake about seventy miles farther north, and
                    falls into the Araxes about three leagues below the town. It is defended by a
                    fortress of an elliptical form, upwards of 6000 yards in circumference. The city
                    is of considerable extent, but, as generally happens in Persia, ruins mingle
                    everywhere with the habitable parts of the town. The north-west side of the town
                    is built on a precipice impending over the river, to the height of 600 feet. The
                    fortress spreads over a great deal of ground. It is fortified in the mixed
                    ancient and modern Asiatic manner; and has been lately strengthened by European
                    engineers. But it is commanded on every side by hills at a distance of scarcely
                    6000 yards. The Zengui flows close past the north-west front, which is on the
                    summit of a perpendicular rock seventy feet deep, forming a natural ditch.
                    “Nothing,” says Sir R. K. Porter, “can exceed the grandeur of these bulwarks of
                    nature, which so frequently present themselves around fortified places in those
                    precipitous countries; their vastness, simplicity, and impregnable appearance
                    being far beyond the powers of man to imitate.” The walls of Erivan, with their
                    numerous towers, make a line of defence exceeding 2000 yards. Immediately beyond
                    them a fine stone bridge crosses the river, which is almost the only object ir
                    the town that does not appear in a state of ruin or decay Erivan has been so
                    often the scene of devastation, plunder and massacre, that the population has
                    dwindled to about 15,000 persons. The singular old tower described b) Chardin
                    being struck with lightning and greatly damaged has been pulled down, and the
                    materials appropriated to th¢ repairs of the town. The city is well supplied
                    with water from the little river Q,uerk-boolak, which has its source ir the
                    great lake, and runs thence north-east, but on approaching the city is divided
                    into numberless little canals for the irrigation of the surrounding gardens, or
                    for other purposes Sir R. K. Porter supposes that the Erivan was founder
                    sixty-five years before the Christian era, by Ervandus, onr of the Armenian
                    kings. In 1635 it was taken from thr Turks by the Persians, and its position
                    changed to its pre sent site. It was besieged in 1724 by the pasha of Diar
                    bekir, who in four successive attempts to storm it los about 24,000 men. It
                    afterwards capitulated, after a brav∣ defence. It was taken by Nadir Shah in
                    1748, and ha since remained in possession of the Persians. In 18081 was
                    blockaded for six months by the Russians, who, u attempting to storm, were
                    repulsed with great slaughter and lost half their army in its retreat to Tiflis.
