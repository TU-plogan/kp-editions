                    tom. ii. p. 1091. Several biographers refer the birth of Erasmus to the year
                    1465; but the inscription of his statue at Roterdam assigns the date of
                    1467.</p></note> His father, who bore the name of Gerard, was an inhabitant of
                    Tergou; his mother, named Margaret, was the daughter of Peter, a physician of
                    Sevenbergen. He had an elder brother, called Peter, but their parents were never
                    married, though a promise of marriage is said to have preceded their
                    intercourse. The brothers of Gerard, who was a young man of wit and gaiety,
                    endeavoured to secure his patrimony by compelling him to become an ecclesiastic.
                    Finding himself very uncomfortable in his own country, he went to Rome, where he
                    employed himself in transcribing ancient authors; for the recent invention of
                    printing had not entirely superseded this more slow and expensive method of
                    multiplying copies of books. In the mean time, his relations sent him a false
                    account of Margaret’s death; and his grief for her supposed loss led him to
                    adopt a resolution to which he could not be impelled by their importunities.
                    Having taken orders, he returned to Holland, and found that she was still alive;
                    but he could not now fulfil his promise of marrying her, and she never would
                    marry another, nor did she continue to cohabit with him after he became a
                    priest. He did not neglect the education of a son who was destined to reflect so
                    much lustre on the age and nation to which he belonged. The boy was sent to
                    school when he was only four years old; and, when he was still very young, his
                    musical voice procured him a place among the choiris-ters in the cathedral
                    church of Utrecht. At the age of nine he was removed to the school of Deventer,
                    where his master was Alexander Hegius, and one of his school-fellows was
                    Adrianus Florentius, who continued to be his friend when he was long afterwards
                    elevated to the papal chair, under the name of Adrian the Sixth. At this early
                    period, he exhibited uncommon powers of memory; and it has been said, perhaps
                    with some degree of exaggeration, that he could repeat all Terence and Horace.
                    His affectionate mother, who had likewise fixed her residence at Deventer, died
                    of the plague when he was about thirteen; and his father, deeply affected with
                    her loss, speedily followed her to the grave. They had both of them attained the
                    age of about forty.</p>
                <p>Gerard had recommended his hopeful son to the care of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193749860" xml:id="kp-eb0709-9860-0354"/>Peter Winckel, master of the
                    school of Gouda, and to that of other two guardians, but they all seem to have
                    been alike unworthy of such a trust; for with the view of dividing his slender
                    patrimony among themselves, they agreed to urge upon him the necessity of
                    embracing the monastic state. They accordingly compelled him to betake himself
                    to a convent of friars at Bois le Duc in Brabant, where, as he has himself
                    stated, he lost three years of his existence. No artifice or persuasion could at
                    first induce him to become a friar, nor did any length of time subdue his utter
                    repugnance to a monastic life. Even at this early period, as has been well
                    remarked, he could discern that religion was the thing least regarded in
                    religious houses. He was afterwards placed in the convent of Sion near Delft;
                    and having next been removed to that of Stein near Tergou, he reluctantly
                    submitted to pass his year of probation, and to take the vows as a canon regular
                    of St Augustin. His brother, who had likewise been devoted to the monastic
                    profession, made an abrupt retreat from his convent, and led a profligate and
                    dissolute life; but Erasmus, though he also quitted his monastic state, to
                    which, as Du Pin observes, “he had no inward vocation,” conducted himself with
                    sobriety, and prosecuted his studies with great assiduity. In 1490 he left the
                    monastery to reside in the household of Henry de Bergues, bishop of Cambray; and
                    in 1492 he was ordained priest by the bishop of U trecht. He had quitted the
                    convent with the consent of the bishop, of the prior, and of the general of the
                    order. He wore the habit as long as he conveniently could; but when he resided
                    in Italy he was obliged to lay it aside, on account of its resemblance to the
                    dress of those who attended persons infected with the plague. From Julius the
                    Second he obtained permission to wear it or not, according to his own
                    convenience, but on condition of still bearing some mark of his order; and from
                    the same pope, or from his successor Leo the Tenth, he obtained an absolution
                    from his monastic vows. For the name of Gerardi he had substituted that of
                    Erasmus, as bearing a more classical form, with the same signification. This
                    name is of a Greek origin, though its proper form is Erasmius; and, prefixing a
                    Latin name of similar import, he adopted the appellation of Desiderius Erasmus,
                    instead of Gerard Gerardi.</p>
                <p>In the year 1496 he was prosecuting his studies in the university of Paris, where
                    he became a member of the College of Montaigu, and was led to contract a
                    friendship with our learned countryman Hector Boyce, afterwards principal of
                    King’s College, Aberdeen. The bishop of Cambray, who was more liberal of his
                    promises than of his money, had undertaken to assist him with a small pension;
                    but as he excited hopes which were never realized, Erasmus was left to the usual
                    expedients of a scholar placed in such circumstances. He laboured very
                    diligently to increase his own stock of learning, and endeavoured to earn his
                    subsistence by taking private pupils: thus he gradually established a high
                    reputation, and secured the friendship of individuals distinguished by their
                    rank and influence, as well as by their talents and learning. One of his pupils
                    was Lord Montjoy, in whom he found a steady friend, and who afterwards bestowed
                    upon him an annual pension of a hundred crowns. It was apparently through his
                    connexion with this young nobleman that he was induced to visit England. The
                    plague drove him from Paris in the year 1497; and after passing through the
                    Netherlands, where he was kindly treated by the marchioness of Vere in the
                    castle of Tornenhens, he proceeded to London and Oxford. He now formed an
                    acquaintance with John Colet, afterwards dean of St Paul’s, and with Thomas
                    Linacre, William Grocyn, and William Latimer, three individuals who each
                    contributed to promote among their countrymen a more general taste for the
                    elegancies of classical literature. He is said to have resided for some time in
                    St Mary’s College, Oxford; but not long afterwards we again find him at Paris,
                    and he likewise appears to have visited Orleans. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Enchiridion</hi><hi rend="italic">Militis Christiani</hi> he had begun in 1494,
                    at the castle of Tornenhens, but it was not completed till after an interval of
                    several years. This little book became very popular, and was translated into
                    various languages. An English version, ascribed to Tindall, was printed by
                    Wynkyn de Worde in 1533.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This was soon followed by another edition, printed by John Byddell, and
                    bearing the following title: “Enchiridion ĭlilitis Christiani, whiche may be
                    called in Englysshe the hansom Weapon of a Christen Knvght; replenvshed with
                    many goodly and godly preceptes: made by the famous clerke Erasmus of Roterdame,
                    and newly corrected and imprinted.” Lond. 1534, 8vo. Many Englist translations
                    from Erasmus are mentioned in Mr Lowndes’s Bibliographer’s Manual of English
                    Literature, vol. ii. p. 673.</p></note> About the same period he was preparing
                    one of his most elaborate works, the <hi rend="italic">Adagia,</hi> first
                    printed at Paris in 1500, and was strenuously applying himself to the study of
                    the Greek language. He mentions to one of his correspondents, that as soon as he
                    could get any money, he would first purchase books, and afterwards clothes. He
                    had already published several of his smaller tracts, and had laid the foundation
                    of that celebrity which long continued to increase, and which that of very few
                    modern scholars has exceeded. He had not however secured any adequate provision;
                    and as he lived somewhat precariously, and wandered from one place to another,
                    he was too frequently compelled to solicit the bounty of those to whom fortune
                    had been more propitious.</p>
                <p>It appears from his correspondence that he was occasionally residing in Paris in
                    1504 and the two succeeding years. To the study of the Greek language, to which
                    he closely applied for the space of three years, he was induced to add that of
                    the Hebrew; but, as Dr Jortin has remarked, “he soon grew tired of the attempt,
                    in all probability for want of proper instructors and helps; else he did things
                    infinitely harder than it is to learn Hebrew.” The necessity of taking pupils
                    interfered with his own plans of study, and prevented him from executing some
                    literary projects which he had now formed. In 1506 he again made his appearance
                    in England, and is then supposed to have visited Cambridge. During the same
                    year, he returned to Paris, and took with him the sons of J. Baptista Boeria,
                    first physician to Henry the Seventh. He next directed his course towards Italy;
                    and while he was prosecuting his journey on horseback, he composed a poem on the
                    infirmities of old age, and addressed it to William Cope, another physician.
                    Although he had not completed his fortieth year, he considered himself as
                    already numbered with the aged. His constitution had never been vigorous; and he
                    was subject to various distempers, which his habits of unremitting application
                    to study did not contribute to alleviate. At an earlier period of life, he had
                    expressed some anxiety to visit Italy, in order to take a doctor’s degree;
                    which, as hé was sufficiently aware, makes one neither better nor wiser; “but it
                    must be done,” says he, “if a man would be esteemed in the world.” He
                    accordingly took the degree of D. D. in the university of Turin. Having resided
                    about fifteen months at Bologna, when he superintended the education of Boeria’s
                    two sons, he afterw ards went to Venice, and there published a third edition of
                    his Adages. He spent a winter at Padua, and repaired to Rome in the ensuing
                    year. At Venice he contracted an acquaintance with Marcus Musurus and Scipio
                    Carteromachus, who taught the Greek language at Padua and Bologna; an he availed
                    himself of so favourable an opportunity of ob-taming<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193749873" xml:id="kp-eb0709-9873-0355"/> a solution of some of the
                    difficulties which had occurred to him in the explication of Greek proverbs. It
                    was at this period that he became the tutor of Alexander Stewart, a natural son
                    of James the Fourth, by Margaret the daughter of Archibald Boyd of Bonshaw. His
                    pupil, who was a youth of an amiable disposition and of promising talents, had
                    been sent to the continent under the direction of Sir Thomas Halkerton, and,
                    having travelled through France, became a student in the university of Padua;
                    but it was at Sienna that he studied grammar and rhetoric under Erasmus, who has
                    left a very pleasing account of his character, and who affectionately bewailed
                    his premature death. At a very early age, he became archbishop of St Andrews,
                    and obtained <hi rend="italic">in commendam</hi> the abbacy of Dunfermline and
                    the priorship of Coldingham. To these ecclesiastical preferments he added the
                    office of lord chancellor; but having accompanied his father in the unfortunate
                    expedition to England, he was slain, along with other warlike churchmen, at the
                    battle of Floddon-field, before he had completed the twentieth year of his
                    age.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Crawfurd’s Lives of

                <p>Erasmus experienced a gracious reception from the pope and some of the cardinals,
                    but Rome had not sufficient attractions for a person of his disposition. We
                    again find him in England about the beginning of the year 1510. On his arrival,
                    he took up his abode with Thomas More, who was then a young man, and who
                    afterwards rose to great eminence. It was at this period that he composed one of
                    his most popular works, <hi rend="italic">Stultitiae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Laudatio,</hi> or the Praise of Folly, which has been translated into all or
                    most of the cultivated languages of Europe. In this lucubration, which he
                    dedicated to his friend More, he treated the pope and the court of Rome with but
                    little ceremony; so that, as Dr Knight has observed, “he was never after this
                    looked upon as a true son of the church.” The king, before the death of his
                    father, had addressed a very friendly letter to Erasmus when he was in Italy,
                    and he now received him with courtesy, although it does not appear that he ever
                    bestowed upon him any very substantial proofs of kindness. To the king, as well
                    as to Cardinal Wolsey, he owns himself indebted, not for magnificent benefits,
                    but for magnificent promises. His chief patron was William Warham, archbishop of
                    Canterbury, and chancellor of the kingdom; who, besides many occasional
                    gratuities, bestoaved upon him a living worth about a hundred nobles, the
                    rectory of Aldington, near Ashford in Kent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Knight’s Life of Erasmus, p. 154. See Dr Middleton’s Free
                    Inquiry, p. cxxvi.</p></note> This however he speedily resigned, reserving to
                    himself a yearly pension of twenty pounds; to which the archbishop added an
                    equal sum from his own purse. He was invited to Cambridge by Dr Fisher, bishop
                    of Rochester, president of Queen’s College, and chancellor of the university,
                    who entertained him in his own house, and procured him the appointment of Lady
                    Margaret’s professor of divinity, and that of Greek professor. Of these offices
                    however, the honour appears to have exceeded the emoluments, nor did he long
                    continue his residence at Cambridge. In the Greek chair he was succeeded by
                    Richard Croke, who had previously taught that language in the university of
                    Leipzig. His treatment in England reflects no particular credit on the character
                    of those who had the chief distribution of ecclesiastical preferments. The king,
                    though capable of perceiving his merit, had not sufficient generosity to reward
                    it; and the lordly churchmen reserved their best benefices mr those who had
                    other recommendations to their protection and favour. He has himself stated that
                    if the promises made to him had been realized, he would have spent the remainder
                    of his days in England; but having been invited to Brabant, to the court of
                    Charles archduke of Austria, he again returned to the Netherlands, where he
                    appears to have been residing in the beginning of the year 1514. With the
                    honorary title of counsellor to that prince, he obtained an annual pension of
                    two hundred florins, which, if it had been regularly paid, would have placed him
                    in circumstances sufficiently easy. He was presented to a canonry at Courtray,
                    but this he likewise resigned, reserving to himself a pension out of its yearly
                    revenue.</p>
                <p>He had for some time been laboriously employed in preparing an edition of the
                    Greek Testament; and in the course of the same year ∙he proceeded to Basel, for
                    the purpose of printing it at the celebrated press of Froben. He likewise
                    carried with him the epistles of St Jerom, illustrated with his notes, and some
                    other books intended for publication. To the writings of this father he had
                    devoted much attention, and, on his arrival, he was therefore gratified to find
                    that an edition of his works had already been sent to the press. His edition of
                    the New Testament was first printed in 1516; and other editions issued from the
                    same press in 1519, 1522, and 1527. At Basel he now spent several months, much
                    to his satisfaction, and was particularly gratified with the reception which he
                    experienced from the bishop of that see. Returning to the Netherlands, he
                    learned that Charles, who afterwards became emperor of Germany, had nominated
                    him to a vacant bishopric in Sicily, supposing it to be at his own disposal;
                    and, finding the right of nomination belonged to the pope, that he had solicited
                    this preferment for Erasmus. But the recommendation, which perhaps was not very
                    urgent, failed to produce any effect; nor did he hear of any effort to procure
                    him a bishopric, where the patronage was more free from entanglement. In the
                    year 1515, he appears to have paid another visit to Basel, and likewise to
                    England. To this country he made another excursion in 1517. Of the domestic
                    habits of the English, he has drawn a picture which now seems not a little
                    antiquated. The plague, from which that country was scarcely ever free, and the
                    sweating sickness, he partly ascribes to the incommodious form and bad
                    exposition of the houses, to the filthiness of the streets, and to the
                    sluttishness within doors. “The floors,” says he, “are commonly of clay, strewed
                    with rushes, under which lies unmolested an ancient collection of beer, grease,
                    fragments, bones, spittle, excrements of dogs and cats, and every thing that is
                    nasty.”</p>
                <p>Francis the First had invited him to fix his residence in France, and had
                    promised him a benefice of a thousand livres; but of this offer he could not be
                    induced to avail himself. He still lingered in the Netherlands; and we find him
                    occasionally residing at Louvain, the seat of a university which was long
                    conspicuous for the bigotry of its theologians, some of whom had appeared as his
                    professed antagonists.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Beatus Rhenanus mentions his having taught at Louvain. “Docuit Lovanii,

                    operam.” Erasmus, in his short account of his own life, has stated that he went
                    to Louvain after he first returned from England.</p></note> An event of great
                    moment in the history of mankind was now impending. In the memorable year 1517,
                    the reformation of religion in Germany began by Luther’s bold and decided
                    opposition to the scandalous traffic in indulgencies; one of the most corrupt
                    practices of a most corrupt church. From this beginning, apparently trivial,
                    arose many important events; and although Erasmus did not possess the undaunted
                    spirit of a genuine reformer, his writings were not without considerable
                    influence in preparing the way for those salutary changes which <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193749886" xml:id="kp-eb0709-9886-0356"/>now began to take place. The
                    edge of his wit and ridicule was very sharply directed against monastic
                    ignorance and grimace, against the vain observances which were so generally
                    substituted for real piety.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Dr Robertson has remarked that “there was hardly any opinion or practice of
                    the Romish church which Luther endeavoured to reform, but what had been
                    previously animadverted upon by Erasmus, and had afforded him subject either of
                    censure or raillery. (Hist, of Charles V. vol. ii. p. 142.) See likewise
                    Archdeacon Blackburne’s Confessional, p. 409. The worthy archdeacon describes
                    Erasmus as “one of the most illustrious characters in all history.”</p></note>
                    Many of his publications had a powerful tendency to promote a critical knowledge
                    of the Scriptures and of ecclesiastical antiquity, and consequently were
                    opposed, though indirectly, to the cause of popery. But he never had the courage
                    to avow his adherence to the cause of reformation; and he himself admitted that
                    he was not endowed with the spirit of a martyr.<note anchored="true"

                    He was sufficiently ready to condemn the heat and violence of the German
                    reformer: but the task undertaken by Luther was not to be executed by a man of a
                    cool and balancing disposition; and without a large portion of his unflinching
                    impetuosity and undaunted resolution, his disputation and his preaching would,
                    to all human appearance, have been utterly unavailing. No sudden and beneficial
                    change in the affairs of mankind will ever be effected by those who, like
                    Erasmus of Roterdam, keep themselves aloof from all danger, and recommend
                    gentleness and moderation to others, when they have to contend against temporal
                    power, fortified by inveterate prejudice, and roused by the most intense
                    feelings of selfishness.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>“As the man,” says Dr Paley, “who attacks a flourishing establishment writes
                    with a halter round his neck, few ever will be found to attempt alterations but
                    men of more spirit than prudence, of more sincerity than caution, of warm,
                    eager, and impetuous tempers; consequently, of we are to wait for improvement
                    till the cool, the calm, the discreet part of mankind begin it, till churc
                    governors solicit, or ministers of state propose it—I will venture to pronounce
                    that (without His interposition with whom nothingimpossible) we may remain as we
                    are till the renovation of all things.” (Sermons and Tracts, p 43.)</p></note>
                    He was however very far from approving of the violent proceedings of Luther’s
                    adversaries. In the year 1520, he was consulted at Cologn by Frederick elector
                    of Saxony, and gave a very favourable opinion of the reformer. Luther, he
                    remarked, has been guilty of two offences; he has touched the crown of the pope
                    and the bellies of the monks. He added, in a more serious strain, that he had
                    justly censured many abuses and errors, which it was necessary to reform and
                    correct; that his doctrine was essentially right, but that it had not been
                    delivered with a proper temper, and with due moderation. Although his conduct
                    did not fully satisfy the Lutherans, it still less satisfied the papists. The
                    publication of his <hi rend="italic">Colloquia</hi> did not contribute to
                    recommend the author to the genuine sons of the Romish church: it exposed him to
                    new accusations of laughing at indulgencies, of disregarding auricular
                    confession, and of deriding the pious use of fish, instead of flesh, on certain
                    appointed days. This book, the most popular of all his performances, was
                    published at Basel: an impression, said to consist of twenty-four thousand
                    copies, was printed in 1527 by Coli-net at Paris, and dispersed with amazing
                    rapidity. The sale was promoted by a rumour, which is supposed to have been
                    circulated by the printer, that the work was on the point of being suppressed.
                    During the preceding year, the theological faculty of Paris had censured it as a
                    book in which the fasts and abstinences of the church are slighted, the
                    suffrages of the holy virgin and the saints are derided, virginity is placed
                    below matrimony, Christians arc discouraged from a monastic life, and
                    grammatical is preferred to theological erudition. In the year 1549 a provincial
                    council, held at Cologn, condemned the Colloquies of Erasmus as unfit to be read
                    in schools.</p>
                <p>The latter years of his life he spent in Switzerland, chiefly at Basel and
                    Friburg. In the summer of 1522 he paid a visit to Constance, professing an
                    intention of repairing to Rome, for the purpose of waiting upon his old
                    school-fellow the new pope; but to one of his correspondents he mentions that he
                    had fallen sick at the former city, and was deterred by rumours of war from
                    prosecuting his journey. It is however more than probable that he had no great
                    inclination to proceed. Adrian offered him a good deanery, which he did not
                    think it advisable to accept; for he apparently considered it in the light of a
                    retaining fee from the pope. In Switzerland he had many friends, and was only
                    prevented from liking the country by the suffocating heat of the stoves, and the
                    bad quality of the wine. Being subject to the stone and gravel, he found the new
                    and acid beverage unsuitable to his constitution, and was obliged to procure
                    wine from Burgundy. As he kept two servants and two horses, it may be inferred
                    that he was enabled to live in sufficient comfort.</p>
                <p>Ulrich von Hutteň, a distinguished adherent of Luther, passing through the city
                    of Basel in 1522, solicited an interview, which the caution of Erasmus prevented
                    him from granting.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    the vehement indignation of the German knight, who speedily discharged his
                    spleen in a publication entitled “Ulrici ab Hutten cum Erasmo Roterodamo,
                    Presbytero, Theologo, Expostulatio.” This satirical effusion was followed by the
                    “Spongia Erasmi adversus Ad-spergines Hutteni.” Hutten’s insolence and ferocity
                    were blamed by Melanchthon, and by Luther himself.</p>
                <p>In the year 1523, Adrian was succeeded in the papal chair by Clement the Seventh,
                    who sent Erasmus an honourable epistle, accompanied with a donation of two
                    hundred florins. After many solicitations from different quarters, he was at
                    length induced to write against Luther, but not on a subject which involved the
                    chief points of debate between the protestants and papists. His tract <hi
                    rend="italic">De Libero</hi><hi rend="italic">Arbitrio</hi> was printed in the
                    year 1524. “Luther,” says Dr Jortin, “was an admirer of Augustin, and, like the
                    Thomists, held a physical predetermination, which entirely subverts human
                    liberty, and which, under the pretence of making the creature dependent upon the
                    Creator, deprives it of all active powers, so that it can do nothing without
                    being necessarily determined by the influence of God. If there was any
                    difference between Luther and the Thomists of the church of Rome, it was this,
                    that Luther spake more simply and sincerely and openly than they; for he
                    absolutely denied that there was any such thing as free-will, whilst they
                    admitted it in words. This perhaps deceived Erasmus, who imagined that he was
                    only disputing against Luther, whilst he was really disputing as much against
                    Thomas Aquinas and his followers, as against the reformer. Be that as it will,
                    Erasmus makes many good remarks against the sentiment which he opposes, and
                    justly insists upon it, that the human will co-operates with the grace or
                    assistance of God.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    >De Servo</hi><hi rend="italic">Arbitrio,</hi> where his antagonist is treated
                    with much scorn and contempt. Erasmus immediately replied in the first part of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Hyperas-</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193749899"

                    appeared in the year 1527; but, upon the whole, he appears to have had no reason
                    to congratulate himself on the issue of the controversy.</p>
                <p>About this period, Erasmus prepared various other works. In 1525 he published
                    “Lingua, opus novum, et hisce temporibus aptissimum.” In 1528 he published, in
                    one volume, two of the most conspicuous of his literary compositions. The first
                    bears the title, “De recta Latini Graecique Sermonis Pronuntiatione Dialogus ;”
                    the second, “Dialogus cui titulus, Ciceronianus, sive de optimo Genere Dicendi.”
                    Both these works were printed at Basel. His dialogue on the pronunciation of the
                    classical languages excited much attention, and occasioned much
                    controversy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Of this
                    famous controversy a detailed account may be found in the Foreign Quarterly
                    Review, vol. xiii. p. 60.</p></note> The pronunciation of Greek which then
                    prevailed, was in some countries denominated the Reuchlinian, from its having
                    been adopted by Reuchlin, who died in the year 1521, after having been chiefly
                    instrumental in the introduction of classical learning into Germany. It
                    essentially coincided with the pronunciation of the modern Greeks. In the

                    spent the greatest part of his life in France, and to have exercised the
                    functions of a judge at Carpentras. “Alexander Scotus Aberdonensis, magni
                    nominis, sed majoris meriti, utriusque linguae peritus, juris civilis scientia

                    we still find the same system recommended. To the letter <hi rend="italic"
                    >β</hi> he assigns the name of vita, to <hi rend="italic">ζ</hi> of zita, to <hi
                    rend="italic">η of</hi> ita, to <hi rend="italic">ô</hi> of thita. According to
                    this system, the vowels <hi rend="italic">r</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    l</hi><hi rend="italic">, ι, υ,</hi> and the diphthongs ε∕, <hi rend="italic"
                    >οι,</hi> have no variety of sound, but ought to be pronounced as the French
                    pronounce the letter <hi rend="italic">i.</hi> Thus <hi rend="italic">τη,
                    r</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">, rv,</hi><hi rend="italic

                    sound, instead of five distinct sounds. This however is not the only peculiarity
                    of the system. Reuchlin’s mode of pronunciation was almost entirely supplanted
                    by that of Erasmus, although several learned men have at a much more recent
                    period endeavoured to restore the old method. In his other ingenious dialogue,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ciceronianus,</hi> he ridicules some modern scholars,
                    chiefly Italians, who studiously rejected every word or phrase which had not
                    been sanctioned by the authority of Cicero. Of the dead and the living he speaks
                    with his usual freedom; nor did this publication contribute to diminish the
                    number of his enemies. It was attacked with great ferocity by Julius Caesar
                    Scaliger, who writes in a style by no means Ciceronian.</p>
                <p>In the year 1529, after the mass had been abolished at Basel, he removed to
                    Friburg, where he purchased a house, and repaired it at considerable expense. In
                    1533 he published at Antwerp a treatise bearing the title of “Liber de sarcienda
                    Ecclesiae Concordia.” On the same subject, he has introduced many suggestions
                    into his epistles; but the peace of the church was not to be patched up by any
                    expedients which Erasmus was capable of devising. His “Ecclesiastes, sive de
                    Ratione Concionandi,” appeared in 1535; and while it was printing at Basel, he
                    returned to that city, and there he completed his earthly pilgrimage. On the
                    accession of Paul the Third, a design was entertained of elevating Erasmus to
                    the rank of a cardinal; but he had never been ambitious of ecclesiastical
                    dignities, and now the state of his health was such as to deprive all sublunary
                    honours of their usual attractions. The pope nominated him provost of the
                    college of canons at Devenir; but already considering himself as standing on the
                    verge of the grave, he declined an office which he probably would not have
                    accepted in the vigour of his life. He &gt;ad left Friburg in a bad state of
                    health, nor were his ma-adies alleviated by his removal to Basel. He became
                    worse during the summer, and for about a month was afflicted with dysentery.
                    Disregarding those formal and minute devotions which he had so much derided in
                    the monks, he fervently implored the mercy of God through Jesus Christ; and
                    retaining his reason unimpaired till his last moments, he calmly expired on the
                    12th of July 1536, when he had nearly completed the sixty-ninth year of his age.
                    A great concourse of people attended his funeral in the cathedral church of
                    Basel. By his will, dated in the month of February, he bequeathed handsome
                    legacies to several of his friends, and directed the residue of his property to
                    be distributed by his executors, in relieving the poor and the sick, in marrying
                    young women, and in assisting young men, such as they should judge to be
                    necessitous and deserving.</p>
                <p>Erasmus, though somewhat low in stature, was well formed, and had an easy and
                    genteel air, nor was he slovenly or negligent in his apparel. He had a fair
                    complexion, with grey eyes, and, during his youth, his hair was of a pale
                    yellow. He had a cheerful countenance, with a low voice, and a pleasing
                    elocution. He was a steady friend, and an agreeable companion; and indeed if his
                    conversation displayed any portion of the wit and vivacity which distinguish his
                    writings, his society could not fail of being delightful. Ardently devoted to
                    letters, he kept his mind uncontaminated with that avarice and ambition by which
                    churchmen have in too many instances been secularized. In disseminating a love
                    of elegant letters among his contemporaries, he had no small influence, and
                    equally conspicuous were his merits as a theologian. For the lifeless
                    formalities of scholastic theology he had little respect, and less relish; but
                    by his labours on the New Testament, and more especially by his publication and
                    elucidations of the original text, he gave a new impulse to the students of that
                    age, and directed their minds to a more edifying species of knowledge. To him
                    belongs the honour of being the earliest editor of the Greek Testament; for
                    although the Alcala edition, inserted in the Polyglot Bible, bears the imprint
                    of 1514, it was not published till the year 1522. Of his paraphrase of the New
                    Testament, an English translation was printed at an early period;<note

                    and so high was the estimation in which it was held, that a copy of it was
                    directed to be placed in every parish-church in the kingdom.<note

                    church he had studied with much assiduity. To editions of Irenaeus, Chrysostom,
                    Cyprian, Hilary, Ambrose, Jerom, Augustin, and Arnobius the younger, he
                    contributed more or less aid; and he translated particular treatises of Origen,
                    Athanasius, Basil, and Chrysostom. His labours likewise served to render the
                    writings of the ancient classics more accessible. Of the Geography of Ptolomy,
                    the Greek text was first edited by Erasmus. He published editions of Livy,
                    Seneca, Suetonius, and other authors; and if he seldom added notes, his prefaces
                    were considered as no small recommendation. He translated into verse the Hecuba
                    and Iphigenia of Euripides, and into prose detached works of Galen, Plutarch,
                    Lucian, and Libanius. The labours of Erasmus were multifarious, and his
                    compositions are very numerous; for our scanty limits have only afforded us an
                    opportunity of specifying the more remarkable. An ample and elegant edition of

                <p>Dr Jortin has remarked that “the style of Erasmus is that of a man who had a
                    strong memory, a natural eloquence, a lively fancy, and a ready invention, who
                    composed with great facility and rapidity, and who did not care for the trouble
                    of revising and correcting; who had spent all his days in reading, writing, and
                    talking Latin; for he seems to have had no turn for modern languages, and
                    perhaps he had almost forgotten his mother tongue. His style therefore is always
                    unaffected, easy, copious, fluent, and clear, but not always perfectly pure, and
                    strictly classical. He hath been censured, as a dealer in barbarisms, by persons
                    who not only had not hall of his abilities and erudition, but who did not even
                    write Latin half so well as he. His verses are plainly the compositions of one
                    who had much learning and good sense, and who understood prosody, or the
                    technical part of poetry, but who had not an equal elegance of taste, and an ear
                    for poetical numbers. So that upon the whole he is rather a versifier than a
                    poet, and is not to be ranked amongst the Italian poets of those days,
                    Sannazarius, Fracastorius, Vida, &amp;c. many of whom wrote better than any of
                    the ancients, except Lucretius, Virgil, Horace, and a few more.” (x.)</p>
