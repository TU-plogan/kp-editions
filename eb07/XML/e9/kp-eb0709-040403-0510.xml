                <p><label type="entry">EUROPE</label>, <hi rend="smallcaps">One</hi> of the great
                    divisions of the globe. On a first view •Europe appears to be less favoured by
                    nature than the other quarters of the globe over which it has obtained so great
                    an ascendancy. It is much smaller in extent; its rocky and mountainous surface
                    does not admit of those noble rivers, like inland seas, which lay open the
                    remotest regions of Asia and of America to the commerce of the world. Its
                    vegetable productions are neither so various nor so exuberant; and it is poorly
                    supplied with the precious metals, and with many of those commodities on which
                    mankind set the greatest value. On the other hand, the climate of Europe, if it
                    nourishes a less luxuriant vegetation, is of an equal and temperate kind, well
                    adapted to preserve the human frame in that state of health and vigour which
                    fits it for labour, and promotes the developement of the intellectual and moral
                    powers. The mountains that intersect its surface are barriers which enabled
                    infant communities to protect themselves from violence, and to lay the
                    foundation of arts, knowledge, and civilization. If it has few large navigable
                    rivers, its inland seas and bays are, from their position and extent, the finest
                    in the world, and have been the means of creating and nourishing that commercial
                    spirit which has been one great source of its improvement. Though comparatively
                    deficient in gold and silver, it is abundantly supplied with those useful metals
                    and minerals which minister still more essentially to the wants of civilized
                    life. Its apparent defects have become the source of real benefits, and the
                    foundation of its grandeur. The disadvantages of its soil and climate have
                    excited the industry of its inhabitants, given them clearer ideas of property,
                    kindled a resolute spirit to defend their rights, and called into existence that
                    skill and enterprise, and those innumerable arts and inventions, which have
                    enabled the inhabitants of this apparently barren and rocky promontory to
                    command the riches and luxuries of all the most favoured regions of the globe.
                    It is only in Europe that knowledge and the arts seem to be indigenous. Though
                    they have appeared at times among some of the nations of Asia, they have either
                    stopt short after advancing a few steps, or they have speedily retrograded and
                    perished, like something foreign to the genius of the people. In Europe, on the
                    contrary) they have sprung up at distant periods, and in a variety of
                    situations; they have risen spontaneously and rapidly, and declined slowly; and
                    when they disappeared, it was evident they were but crushed for the time by <hi

                    they must borrow from Europe those arts which she has invented, and which belong
                    to civilized life in every climate. But the tenacious adherence of rude nations
                    to the customs and superstitions of their ancestors, will not allow us to hope
                    that the benefits of civilization will be rapidly diffused in this way. It is
                    more probable that colonies from the older states of Europe will multiply, as
                    the population becomes more and more redundant; and that these colonies will
                    carry the arts and knowledge, the language and manners of Europe with them, to
                    the other quarters of the world. From prejudices on both sides, it is found that
                    two races, in very different stages of civilization, do not readily amalgamate;
                    and it is therefore probable, that the feebler inhabitants of these countries,
                    like the American Indians, will be gradually displaced by the continual
                    encroachments of the more energetic race of Europe. Such a change, however, must
                    take place slowly, and there is nothing in it to alarm humanity. The vast number
                    of tribes that people Asia and Africa seem born only to be the victims of savage
                    superstition and ferocious tyranny. No treatment they are likely to experience
                    from European colonies can render their condition worse; and were the whole
                    swarm of these nations to die out in the course of nature without being renewed,
                    no great deduction would be made from the sum of human enjoyment. Should the
                    state of things we have been contemplating, and which seems to arise naturally
                    out of the circumstances of Europe and the other quarters of the globe, be
                    realized, it will be curious to reflect on the circle of changes which will then
                    be completed. The ancient inhabitants of Europe, as well as the modern, were
                    originally colonies sent off from the surplus population of Asia. Here they have
                    thrown off their barbarism, invented and improved arts and sciences, and carried
                    their social institutions to a high degree of perfection; and now, in the
                    maturity of their strength, they are throwing back their surplus numbers upon
                    Asia, to conquer and supplant the remains of those tribes from which they
                    originally sprung.</p>
                <p>Europe is bounded on the north and west by the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans; on the
                    south by the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, and Mount Caucasus; on the east by
                    the Caspian Sea, the river Ural, and the Uralian Mountains. These are the limits
                    proposed by Malte Brun, and adopted by Balbi and other recent geographers, as
                    corresponding better with the natural divisions of the earth’s surface than the
                    old boundary, which on the east side passed from the Sea of Asoph to the Uralian
                    Mountains, by the courses of the Don, the Wolga, and the Kama. The greatest
                    length of the continent of Europe is from Cape St Vincent to the Sea of Kara, in
                    the direction of northeast and south-west, and is 3490 English miles. Its
                    greatest extent from north to south is from Cape Matapan to Cape North, 2420
                    miles. The superficies of Europe, including the Azores, Iceland, Nova Zembla,
                    and all the other islands belonging to it, is 3,700,000 English, or '2,800,000
                    geographical square miles.</p>
                <p>The climate of Europe is distinguished by two peculiarities. It enjoys a higher
                    mean temperature than any of the other great divisions of the world in the
                    corresponding latitudes; and it is not subject to such violent extremes of heat
                    and cold. These advantages it owes chief-</p>
                <p>( its numerous seas, inland bays, and lakes, which render its temperature similar
                    to that of islands; and partly fiso, according to Humboldt, to its situation at
                    the western extremity of the greatest range of dry land on the sur- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ace</hi> of the globe; the western sides of all continents
                    be- <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> g warmer than the eastern. Europe lies almost
                    entirely within the temperate zone, not more than one fourteenth part of its
                    surface being within the arctic circle. Only a very small part or it is
                    uninhabitable from cold, and it nowhere suffers much from excessive heat. The
                    mean temperature at its southern extremity, in the latitude of 36°, is about 66°
                    of Fahrenheit; and at Cape North, in the latitude of 71°, where the mean
                    temperature is 32°, the cold is not greater than in the latitudes of 55° or 56°
                    on the east coasts of Asia and America. Hence Europe is habitable at a higher
                    latitude by 12° or 14° than either of these continents. The following table,
                    taken from Humboldt’s <hi rend="italic">Memoir on the Distribution of Heat</hi>
                    (abridged in Dr Thomson’s <hi rend="italic">Annals of Philosophy,</hi> xi. 188},
                    shows the difference in temperature between Europe and the eastern shores of
                    Asia and America at the parallel of 40°; the difference is much greater at the
                    parallel of 60°.</p>

                <p>There is a difference of the same kind between the temperature of the sea-coasts
                    of Europe and the interior. In islands, and on the sea-coast, the mean
                    temperature of the year is higher, and the heat is more equally distributed
                    through the different seasons. As we advance from the coast eastward the mean
                    annual temperature diminishes, but the heat of summer and the cold of winter
                    increase. Thus London has the same mean annual temperature as Vienna, but it has
                    the summer of Petersburg, and the winter is warmer than at Milan. The
                    Mediterranean, the Baltic, and inland lakes, produce the same effectas the
                    ocean, in an inferior degree. The two following tables are taken from Humboldt
                    <hi rend="italic">(Annals of Phil.</hi> xi. 188): the first shows the
                    temperature of the year, and the various seasons in places having the same
                    latitude; the second shows the different distribution of heat through the
                    various seasons in places having the same mean annual temperature.</p>

                <p>The mountains of Europe are more numerous in proportion to its extent than those
                    of the other great continents, but they are of less elevation than the mountains
                    of America and Asia. The highest and the most extensive chains in Europe run
                    generally in the direction of east and west, and are placed near its southern
                    shores. The central mass of the Alps, with which all the other <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193750536" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0536-0406"/>mountains in the south of
                    Europe are connected, forms the summit of the continent, and determines the
                    position of the surface and the course of most of the rivers. From this central
                    point the surface of the land descends to the sea by a series of valleys,
                    skirted by subordinate chains. The three countries to the southward of the Alps
                    and their branches, Greece, Italy, and Spain, consist of mountainous peninsulas
                    projecting into the Mediterranean. The countries to the west, north, and east or
                    the Alps, which present more extensive plains and gentle declivities, are the
                    seats of the three principal monarchies in the south of Europe. Austria, seated
                    on the eastern declivity, rules over the countries watered by the Danube; France
                    occupies the western declivity, and the countries watered by the principal
                    streams that flow to the west; and Prussia the countries watered by the streams
                    that flow to the north. If we descend from the Alps to the sea in a western
                    direction, the first valley we meet with is the level part of Switzerland,
                    between the Alps and Mount Jura, elevated from 1600 to 1800 feet above the sea:
                    the second, between Jura and the Cevennes, some hundred feet lower; and the
                    third, and lowest, extends from the Cevennes to the Atlantic. In a north and
                    north-east direction, the first valley is Bavaria, the second Bohemia, both of
                    which are completely inclosed by mountains; the third, consisting of Silesia,
                    Brandenburg, and Poland, terminates in the Baltic. In an eastern direction the
                    first valley is Austria, the second Hungary, both encircled with mountains; the
                    third, Bulgaria, extends to the Black Sea. South from the Alps we have first the
                    valley of Lombardy, and then the narrow coast of Genoa. The vast plain occupied
                    by Russia and the eastern part of the Swedish peninsula may be considered as a
                    prolongation of the valley of Prussia and Poland, extending to the Dofrines on
                    the west, the Uralians on the east, and Mount Caucasus on the south. Thus, in a
                    general point of view, the elevation and declivity of the large plains of
                    southern Europe bear a certain relation to the position and distance of the
                    central mass of the Alps.</p>
                <p>The principal mass of the Alps extends in a semicircle from Nice, on the shores
                    of the Mediterranean, to Trieste, on the Adriatic, a distance of 550 miles.
                    Southward of Mont Blanc, the Alps consist of a single chain, with many lateral
                    branches, which lie chiefly on the west side; but immediately to the eastward of
                    Mont Blanc, the principal chain divides into two, which inclose the sources of
                    the Rhone. These meet, again, at St Gothard, and, on the east side of it, part
                    into three chains, one of which loses itself in Bavaria, another in Austria near
                    Vienna, and the third terminates near Trieste. A lateral chain, of no great
                    elevation, passes eastward, and connects the Alps with the mountains of European
                    Turkey. Smaller branches connect the Alps with the Bohemian and Carpathian
                    Mountains on the north, with the Vosges and Cevennes on the west, and, through
                    the latter, with the Pyrenees. The Appennines are but a prolongation of the Alps
                    on the south. Mont Blanc, the loftiest of the Alps, and the highest mountain in
                    Europe, has an elevation of 15,680 English feet; and Mount Rosa, the Jungfrau,
                    the Schreik-horn, and several other summits, approach to this height. The
                    elevation of the chain diminishes towards both extremities. In general, the
                    escarpments, or steepest sides, are turned towards Italy, and the lateral and
                    subordinate branches are most numerous, and extend farthest, on the opposite
                    side. The central chain of the Alps consists chiefly of granite, gneiss,
                    sienite, and other primitive rocks. Among the lateral ridges, to the westward of
                    St Gothard, calcareous rocks, with clay-slate and mica-slate, abound on the side
                    of France; on the side of Italy the ridges are narrower, magnesian rocks abound,
                    and the clay-slate is wanting. On both sides are found great deposits of gravel,
                    and large detached blocks or boulders, often at a vast distance from their
                    original situations. Eastward from St Gothard, the central chain is accompanied
                    on each side by a calcareous chain of great elevation. Though the summits of the
                    Alps are steep and rocky, and the higher valleys are filled with glaciers, there
                    is much good soil below. The vine grows to the height of 1600 feet above the
                    sea, the oak to the height of 3390, corn to 4200 feet, and the larch to 6720
                    feet. At 6400 feet above the sea, we have the climate of Lapland in latitude
                    68°, so that a degree of latitude in the northern half of the temperate zone in
                    Europe corresponds to an elevation of about 290 feet. The inferior limit of
                    perpetual snow, according to Humboldt, is at the height of 8760 feet, in the
                    latitude of 46°. (Humboldt <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The chain of the Pyrenees, which is next to the Alps] in elevation, runs in the
                    direction of east and west. Its length is about 240 miles; but, if we include
                    the Cantabrian Mountains, which continue in the same line without interruption,
                    the whole length will be about 500 miles. The central chain of the proper
                    Pyrenees is of granite, but the most elevated summits are of secondary
                    limestone, and he on the south side of the granite. Mont Perdu, esteemed the
                    loftiest of the whole range, consists of fetid limestone, and rises to the
                    height of 11,270 feet. The south side of the Pyrenees is rugged and precipitous;
                    but on the north there is a gradual descent to the plains of France by a series
                    of parallel ridges diminishing in height. The Cantabrian Mountains are lower
                    than the Pyrenees, and present their steepest sides to the north. There are four
                    other chains of mountains in Spain, all running in a direction approaching to
                    east and west, and all connected with one another and with the Pyrenees. The
                    most elevated of these is the Sierra Nevada, the southmost, one of whose summits
                    rises to the height of 11,660 feet. <hi rend="italic">(Laborde,</hi> i. 173).
                    The inferior limit of perpetual snow on the Pyrenees is at the height of 8960
                    feet. The red pine rises to the height of 7480 feet, which is about 700 feet
                    higher than any species of trees on the Alps.</p>
                <p>The Appennines form an uninterrupted chain 750 miles; in length, extending from
                    the south-west termination <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> ofn the Alps near Nice
                    to the Straits of Messina. Thenorth-west division, which skirts the basin of
                    Lombardy, consists chiefly of greywacke; from Tuscany to near the southern
                    extremity, the prevailing rock is secondary limestone. Granite and other
                    primitive rocks are found at the two extremities in Liguria and Calabria, but
                    are wholly wanting in the intermediate space. The most considerable elevations
                    are about the middle of the chain, where II Gransasso rises to the height of
                    9570 feet.</p>
                <p>The Carpathian and Sudetic Mountains, with the Erz-C gebirge and Boehmerwald, may
                    be considered as form-t ing one continued chain, the length of which, from the
                    point where it strikes the Danube in Hungary, to the point where it strikes the
                    same river in Bavaria, is about 1200 miles, exclusive of the transverse branches
                    which separate Moravia from Bohemia and Hungary. The declivities of this long
                    range of mountains are steepest on the south side. The elevations are lowest on

                    of the chain, is 4030 feet high: Sçhnekoppe, the highest of the Sudetic
                    Mountains, is 5280 feet, and Lomnitz in Hungary, the loftiest of the whole
                    range, is 8460 feet. None of these mountains rise to the region of perpetual
                    snow, the inferior limit o which, according to Wahlenberg, is about sixty feet
                    above <pb break="no" facs="nls:193750549" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0549-0407"/>the
                    summit of Lomnitz. The most elevated parts of these mountains consist of
                    primitive rocks; corn and fruit trees are said to grow at a greater height upon
                    the Carpathian’s than upon the Alps, though the latter are two degrees farther
                    south.</p>
                <p>The chain of the Dofrines, or great Scandinavian Alps, is about 1000 miles in
                    length, and has a general elevation of from 6000 to 6500 feet. The altitude of
                    Skagstlos Find, the highest mountain of the chain, is 8400 feet. These mountains
                    consist almost entirely of primitive rocks, and present their steepest sides to
                    the west. On Sulitel-ma, the highest mountain of this chain in Lapland, in
                    latitude 67∙10, the inferior limit of perpetual snow is at the height of 3500
                    feet.</p>
                <p>The Uralian Mountains, which form the boundary of Europe on the north-east, are
                    but imperfectly known. Some of their summits are covered with perpetual snow,
                    but their height is believed not to exceed that of the Scandinavian Alps. They
                    consist chiefly of primitive rocks. The whole length of the chain, which runs
                    nearly north and south, is about 1400 miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">ì</hi> Of the mountains of European Turkey we know as little
                    as of the Uralian chain. From a central point, nearly equidistant from the
                    Danube, the Adriatic, and the Aegean Sea, three chains proceed in different
                    directions; one, the ancient Hemus, runs eastward to the Black Sea; a second,
                    north-westward, till it joins the Carnic Alps; and a third, southward, through
                    the peninsula of Greece. These principal chains send out many branches, but
                    neither their height nor their geological structure is known with any degree of
                    accuracy.</p>
                <p>The Cevennes in the south of France extend about 300 miles in length from north
                    to south, and their two most elevated summits, Mont d’Or and Cantal, rise to the
                    height of 6400 and 6170 feet. Mount Jura, between France and Switzerland, has
                    nearly the same elevation. The Vosges, a small chain in the north-east of
                    France, rise nowhere more than 4600 feet above the sea.</p>
                <p>3 The mountains of Britain extend, with some interrup- • tions, over a space of
                    630 miles, along the west side of the island. They are not placed in chains, but
                    rather in irregular groups, and consist chiefly of primitive and transition
                    rocks. Snowden in Caernarvonshire, the highest mountain in Wales, has an
                    elevation of 3570 feet. Ben-nevis in Inverness-shire, which rises 4336 feet
                    above the sea, is the highest land in the island.</p>
                <p>There are thirteen volcanoes in Europe, all situated in the vicinity of the sea,
                    and of which the following are the most remarkable: Mount Aetna, in Sicily, is
                    10,940 feet in height. Its eruptions happen very irregularly; sometimes fifty or
                    a hundred years have intervened between one eruption and another; at other times
                    less than one year. Mount Vesuvius, near Naples, which lies about two hundred
                    miles north from Aetna, is 3820 feet high. Its eruptions are less hequent than
                    those of Aetna. Stromboli, which occupies an island in the Mediterranean, about
                    eighty miles north from Aetna, is the only volcano in Europe that throws out
                    smoke or flames constantly. Heckla, near the south coast °f Iceland, is 4980
                    feet high. Its eruptions are not frequent The last was in 1783.</p>

                <p>A much smaller proportion of the waters of the European continent flows into the
                    Mediterranean than the extent of its coasts would lead us to expect. The high
                    mountains that range along the south of Europe, parallel to its shores, from
                    Gibraltar to Constantinople, turn the course of the large streams in an opposite
                    direction. Though the length of the line of coast between the points last
                    mentioned, without computing minute sinuosities, is 4000 miles, or one fourth of
                    the circumference of Europe, not more than one tenth of the waters of this
                    quarter of the globe fall into the Mediterranean. The Black Sea, on the other
                    hand, which presents only 850 miles of coast on the side of Europe, receives one
                    fourth of its waters. It will be seen from the subjoined table that one tenth
                    part of the waters of Europe flows into the Caspian by the Wolga; that the Black
                    Sea and the Baltic alone receive one half, whilst only about one sixth falls
                    into the Atlantic. If the whole of the river waters of Europe be divided into a
                    hundred parts, their distribution will be nearly as follows:</p>

                <p>We are not acquainted with the height of the sources of many of the European
                    rivers above the sea. Those of the Danube, according to Malte Brun, are from
                    2100 to 2200 English feet, which gives a fall of one foot and a half per mile,
                    but near the sea the inclination is less; for at Buda, 900 miles from the mouth
                    of the river, its height, according to Wahlenberg, is 229 feet, which gives a
                    fall of three inches per mile for the lower part of its course. It begins to be
                    navigable at Ulm. In general the rivers <pb break="no" facs="nls:193750562"

                    in a course of 2000 miles. The average fall may therefore be about two inches
                    and a half per mile.</p>
                <p>The islands of Europe, including Nova Zembla and Iceland, occupy a space equal to
                    280,000 square miles, or one eleventh part of the surface of the continent; and
                    of this space the area of the British isles amounts to rather less than one
                    half. The Black Sea is the only large sea connected with Europe in which there
                    are no islands worthy of notice.</p>
                <p>The Mediterranean, the noblest inland sea in the world, forms the southern
                    boundary of Europe, separating it •from Africa, and partly also from Asia. It
                    may be considered as the bottom of a vast basin formed by the Pyrenees, Alps,
                    Mount Hemus, Taurus, Libanus, and Atlas. These mountains are everywhere near its
                    shores, which are consequently narrow and much inclined. Hence there are no such
                    extensive plains as Hungary or Poland near the coast of this sea, and hence also
                    no very large rivers fall into it except the Nile; and altogether it receives a
                    smaller quantity of water from rivers than the Black Sea or the Baltic, though
                    six times larger than either. Its length is about 2350 miles, its breadth is
                    extremely various, and its surface (exclusive of the Black Sea) is nearly equal
                    to 1,000,000 of square English miles, or something less than a third part of the
                    continent of Europe. It is generally of great depth, and its numerous islands,
                    which have uniformly a rocky surface, appear to be the summits of marine
                    mountains.</p>
                <p>The Baltic, the greatest inland sea that is entirely in Europe, is about 1200
                    miles long, of very unequal breadth, and presents a surface of 175,000 square
                    miles, exclusive of islands. It occupies the bottom of another large basin, 850
                    miles in breadth, and 1400 in length, extending from the Norwegian mountains on
                    the north and west, to the Carpathians on the south, and to the high lands in
                    which the Dnieper, Don, and Wolga rise, on the east. This basin, equal to one
                    third of the surface of Europe, has a very different character from that of the
                    Mediterranean. The mountains are not very elevated, and are so placed as to
                    leave a large tract of land very little inclined between them and the Baltic,
                    over which, especially on the south side, many considerable rivers flow with a
                    gentle current. Hence the country round the Baltic is much more level than round
                    the Mediterranean; lakes are numerous in the low grounds, from the want of
                    declivity; the sea itself is comparatively shallow, and, receiving a much
                    greater quantity or river water, it is much inferior in saltness. I he commerce
                    of the Baltic is annually interrupted by the ice, which endures four months in
                    the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland. Ιhe whole of this inland sea has sometimes
                    been frozen over for a short time, but this is of rare occurrence.</p>
                <p>The Black Sea, which belongs only partly to Europe, is 690' miles long and 360
                    miles broad, and, including the Sea of Asoph, pιesents a surface of 170,000
                    square miles, being almost of the same magnitude as the Baltic. It derives four
                    fifths of its water from Europe, and is curiously distinguished from the other
                    seas of this quarter of the globe, by its being almost totally destitute of
                    islands.</p>
                <p>The White Sea is 450 miles in length, of a very irregular figure, and occupies a
                    space equal to 35,000 square miles. It receives some considerable rivers, but is
                    frozen during six months of the year.</p>
                <p>The lakes of Europe are numerous, and are of two kinds; those which lie in
                    cavities at the foot of high mountains, and which are generally deep, such as
                    the lakes in the Alps, on the east side of the Norwegian mountains, and among
                    the mountains of England and Scotland; and those which are formed in level
                    countries from the want of a sufficient declivity to carry off the water, such
                    as the lakes in Finland, Poland, and Brandenburg. Four fifths of the lakes of
                    Europe are in the country round the Baltic.</p>
                <p>The soil of Europe has neither the extremes of luxu-i riance nor sterility which
                    belong to the soil of the other] great continents. If it does not yield the rich
                    fruits of tropical climates, it is not deformed by the burning sands of Africa,
                    or the pestilent swamps of America. It does not pour forth its riches
                    spontaneously, but, soliciting the care and the labour of man, it requites his
                    industry with what is necessary to supply his wants; and, by exercising and
                    sharpening his powers of mind, has given birth to those arts which place the
                    productions of the most favoured climates at his disposal. Many of the plants
                    which have been domesticated in Europe are natives of distant countries. The
                    vine, the olive, and the mulberry, are said to have been brought from Syria by
                    the Greeks; the Arabians introduced cotton; maize was received from the Indian
                    tribes of America; the walnut and peach come from Persia; the aprico from
                    Armenia; and the sugar-cane from China. There are not very many plants belonging
                    to the tropical regions that absolutely refuse to grow in Europe, but an
                    enlightened economy finds other productions more profitable. Besides sugar and
                    cotton, the banana, the orange, citron, fig, pomegranate, and date, grow in the
                    south of Europe. But the more delicate fruits are confined to southern
                    latitudes, and disappear one by one as we advance northward. And it is worthy of
                    remark, that the zones in which they grow generally follow the lines of equal
                    summer heat, and run obliquely across the continent in the direction of
                    south-west and north-east. If a line be drawn on the map from Brest to
                    Königsberg, skirting the southern shores of the English Channel and the Baltic,
                    the zones that limit the growth of different plants will run nearly parallel
                    with this line. (Ioungs <hi rend="italic">Travels in France,</hi> i. 306.) This
                    holds generally in thesouth and middle of Europe; but in the extreme northern
                    parts, and especially with regard to plants that require a moderate heat
                    continued for a considerable time, the lines that limit the growth of certain
                    vegetables seem to follow a different course, and decline towards the south as
                    we advance eastward, in consequence of the increasing severity and length of the
                    winter. It is scarcely necessary to say, that the zones, traced as proper for
                    different plants, only mark the limits within which their cultivation is found
                    advantageous. Most of them will grow beyond these limits; but they either
                    require some peculiar advantages of soil or situation, or they are less
                    profitable than other kinds of produce.</p>

                    within the latitude of 43° in Spain, and 44° in Italy. The olive does not
                    succeed on the west coast of France in the latitude of 43°, but grows as far
                    north as 44° or45° on the east of France, and in Italy. Attempts to raise it at
                    Astracan, in latitude 46°, have not succeeded, on account of the rigour of the
                    winter. The fig and the pomegranate, which accompany the olive in the west of
                    Europe, are found in the Taurida in the east, at the latitude of 46°, where the
                    olive will not grow, a proof that these trees bear the winter cold better.

                    52°, but is not cultivated beyond 50°. (Young, i. 306; Storch, ii. 310, 323.)
                    The mulberry generally accompanies the vine. The limits of the culture of the
                    common cerealia are not so well defined, as the necessities of man oblige him to
                    raise corn under the most unfavourable circumstances. In a general point of
                    view, however, the parallel of 57° or 58° may be regarded as the northern limit
                    of the cultivation of wheat in Europe. It is raised as far north as 60° or 61°
                    in Finland, but only in some favoured spots. In Russia, generally, it is chiefly
                    confined to the provinces under the latitude of 57°. (Thomson’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Trav. in Sweden,</hi> 409; Storch, ii. 229, 240.) The hardier
                    ccrealia, rye, oats, and barley, are cultivated in some sheltered situations on
                    the coast of Norway, as high as the latitude of 69° 55'. But on the east side of
                    the Norwegian mountains these grains scarcely ripen in the latitude of 67° or
                    68°; and farther east, in Russia, it has been found impossible to carry
                    cultivation of any kind beyond the latitude of 60° or 62°. Barley, which
                    accommodates itself better than any other grain to these high latitudes, by
                    shortening the period of its growth, is sown and reaped within the space of
                    seven or eight weeks. But the introduction of potatoes promises to be of vast
                    advantage in these cold regions, as this plant thrives and yields a produce of
                    thirty or fifty fold in places where grain often will not ripen.<note

                    Peaches and apricos succeed with much care as far north only as the latitude of
                    50° in Russia; melons as far as 52°. The plum and the cherry grow wild as far
                    north as 55°, but are carried farther by cultivation. (Storch, ii. 302, 304,
                    308.) Fruit trees and the oak terminate in Sweden, at Geffle, in the latitude of
                    61°; but the pine and the birch advance within the arctic circle; and the former
                    grows to the height of sixty feet in the latitude of 70°. The black-berry and
                    the whortle <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> berry grow in Lapland, and the
                    gooseberry even in Greenland. Tobacco is extensively cultivated oyer the greater
                    part of the continent of Europe, from Sicily to Sweden. Flax and hemp have as
                    extensive a range as corn, but they are raised in the greatest perfection
                    between the latitudes of 45° and 60°.</p>
                <p>We have stated that the superficial extent of Europe is about 3,700,000 square
                    miles. ∙ If we draw an incurvated line from a point in the Uralian Mountains,
                    about the latitude of 60° or 61°, to the west coast of Norway, in the latitude
                    of69°, passing through the Lake Onega, and a httle to the northward of the Gulf
                    of Bothnia, this line will mark the extreme limits of cultivation, and will cut
                    off a space equal to 550,000 square miles, or nearly one seventh of Europe. 1he
                    space cut off, however, is not entirely useless, as a part of it produces
                    pasturage and wood. The cultivation of rye, oats, and barley, is confined to the
                    region south of this line, and includes more than five sixths of Europe; but in
                    the northern parts of this zone only a very small proportion of the land will
                    bear corn. The region adapted to the cultivation of wheat comprehends about four
                    sevenths of Europe, and includes all the densely peopled parts. The region of
                    the vine extends over three sevenths of Europe.</p>
                <p>Europe, in proportion to its extent, is probably richer in mineral wealth than
                    the other quarters of the globe. It contains all the metals except platina; and
                    though it affords gold and silver only in limited quantities, iron, copper,
                    lead, with coal and salt, commodities of greater value to society, are abundant
                    and widely distributed. The mountains, consisting of primitive and transition
                    rocks, are the great depositaries of these mineral treasures.</p>
                <p>Iron is found in all the chains of mountains in Europe. The richest mines are in
                    the Dofrines, or Scandinavian Alps. But rich mines are also found in the Alps of
                    Stiria, Carinthia, and Bavaria; in the Pyrenees, the Vosges, the Cevennes, the
                    coal district of Britain, the Urals, the Carpathians, the Hartz, and many other
                    places.</p>
                <p>Copper is also widely distributed, though less abundant than iron. The richest
                    mines are in Hungary, in the Carpathian Mountains. It abounds also in the Saxon
                    and Bohemian mountains, in the Dofriues, the Urals, the north of England, and
                    the Alps; and it is found in the Vosges, the Pyrenees, and other mountains of
                    Spain, in the north of Germany, and in Tuscany.</p>
                <p>Lead exists in the Alps, Carpathians, Pyrenees, Ce-venncs, Vosges, the British
                    mountains, and the Uralian chain.</p>
                <p>Tin is found only in a few places in Europe. The richest mines are in Cornwall;
                    next to these are the mines in the Erzgebirge. It is also found in Hungary and
                    Spanish Gallicia.</p>
                <p>Mercury, like tin, is confined to a few places. The mines of Idria, in Austria,
                    which yield 8000 to 10,000 quintals per annum, are the most productive in
                    Europe. There are also considerable mines at Deux Ponts, in the Palatinate; in
                    the Spanish province of La Mancha; and in Transylvania.</p>
                <p>Gold is widely diffused through Europe, but generally in such quantities as not
                    to repay the expense of working. It is wrought, however, in the Carpathians, the
                    Urals, the Dofrines, and the Alps. Anciently there were rich mines of gold in
                    Spain and Greece.</p>
                <p>Silver is more abundant than gold, though less widely distributed. There are
                    productive mines of this metal in the Erzgebirge, the Carpathians, the Urals,
                    the Norwegian Dofrines, and in Sardinia. It is found also in the Alps, the
                    Vosges, and the Sierra Morena.</p>
                <p>Of coal, the richest mines are found in the north and west of England. It abounds
                    also on both sides of the south of Scotland; in Ireland; in the Netherlands; in
                    one fourth part of the French territory; and occurs more sparingly in Saxony,
                    Hanover, Denmark, Sweden, Russia, Hungary, Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, Bavaria,
                    Austria, Franconia, Westphalia, Swabia, Catalonia, and some other parts of
                    Spain, in Portugal, and in Sardinia. After Britain, France is the country in
                    Europe best supplied with this mineral. The produce of the French coal mines has
                    increased fourfold within the last forty years.</p>

                    from numerous salt mines and salt springs. The most productive salt mines in
                    Europe are those in Poland, on the north side of the Carpathians, and those in
                    Salzburg, on the north side of the Alps, both of which belong to Austria. There
                    are also extensive depositaries of mineral salt in Transylvania and Hungary; in
                    Valentia, Navarre, and Catalonia, in Spain; in Cheshire in England; and in
                    Bavaria and Switzerland. Salt springs are numerous along the sides of primitive
                    mountains in most countries of Europe. The most extensive salt mines of Russia
                    are in Asia.</p>
                <p>Antimony, cobalt, zinc, manganese, sulphur, alum, and a great variety of other
                    mineral productions, are found in Europe; but it is unnecessary to specify their
                    localities.</p>
                <p>It is observed that the Alps, Pyrenees, Carpathians, and other mountain chains
                    which run east and west, are richest in metals on the south side; while the
                    Dofrines, Urals, and others which run north and south, are richest on the east
                    side. Of the mountain chains of Europe, the Appennines are the poorest in
                    metals, the Carpathians probably the richest.</p>
                <p>The present population of Europe is sprung from a va- ∙riety of tribes; but
                    authors differ much as to the number and peculiar characters of the original
                    races. It would serve little purpose to enumerate the contradictory hypotheses
                    which have been advanced on this subject. We shall therefore confine ourselves
                    to an account of those more obvious general characters, founded on language,
                    manners, or physical constitution, which distinguish the different portions of
                    the population of Europe at present.</p>
                <p>The nations in the south-west of Europe, the French, Italians, and Spaniards,
                    speak languages in which the Latin idiom predominates. They have generally black
                    hair and black eyes, and are rather inferior in stature to the Gothic nations,
                    but gifted with more imagination and a higher degree of organic sensibility;
                    they are more temperate, more inventive, but less persevering.</p>
                <p>The Gothic race includes the English, Swedes, Norwegians, Danes, Netherlanders,
                    and the various German nations inhabiting the country between the Rhine and the
                    Oder, with the Swiss, Bavarians, and a part of the inhabitants of Bohemia,
                    Moravia, and Austria. These nations are distinguished by fair hair, blue or grey
                    eyes, large stature, and a clear complexion. They have less imagination than the
                    southern nations, are more addicted to pursuits that exercise the understanding,
                    are more thoughtful and serious, and less temperate in drinking.</p>
                <p>The Sclavonic nations occupy the east of Europe generally, including Russia,
                    Moldavia, Poland, ancient Prussia, with the greater part of Silesia, Hungary,
                    Moravia, Bohemia, Croatia, and Sclavonia. They are rather lower in stature than
                    the Gothic race, the countenance is shorter but more animated, and the hair
                    black. The prevailing religion is the Greek Christian, and in the western parts
                    the Roman Catholic. They all speak dialects of the Sclavonic language, of which
                    the Russian is one.</p>
                <p>The remains of the Celtic tribes are found in the Highlands or Scotland, in
                    Wales, Ireland, Bretagne, and Biscay in Spain. They are rather low in stature,
                    have lively eyes, prominent cheek-bones, red or yellow hair in the north, but
                    sometimes black hair in the south</p>
                <p>The Finns, with the Esthonians, Karelians, and other tribes in the north of
                    Europe, have a language of their own, and the characters of a peculiar race.
                    They have light brown eyes, a pale complexion, cheeks hollow, are of middling
                    stature, but heavy and muscular.</p>
                <p>The Samoieds, Laplanders, and other tribes who live within the polar circle, are
                    distinguished by their very low stature, the smallness of the legs and feet, and
                    largeness of the head, prominent cheek-bones, small round black eyes, black and
                    bristly hair, and a swarthy skin. The Laplanders, from intermixture with the
                    Finns, Russians, and Norwegians, have lost in some degree the characteristic
                    traits of the original race.</p>
                <p>The modern Greeks and Albanians are supposed to be descended chiefly from the
                    ancient inhabitants of the country, whose language they have preserved. They
                    have a greater resemblance to the Latin nations than to those of the Gothic
                    race. The Turks are an Asiatic tribe.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Europe has been gradually advancing from poverty and] barbarism to wealth and
                    refinement since the tenth century; but the progress of the different nations
                    has been very unequal. No single cause has contributed so much to their
                    improvement as commerce; and hence the first advances have always been made by
                    maritime states; and the progress of the different communities has been nearly
                    in proportion to their vicinity to the sea, or the facility of their
                    communication with it. The small republics of Italy and the Hanse Towns were the
                    seats of industry, wealth, knowledge, and freedom; while slavery, ignorance, and
                    rapine, reigned in the countries around them. The tendency of commerce to enrich
                    a country seems to depend on its power to create disposable capital. Though a
                    certain species of opulence exists among the great landholders of agricultural
                    countries, those masses of disposable capital which give vigour to industry, and
                    supply the means of great improvements, are only found in commercial states.
                    Commerce also favours the growth of manufactures, and these two species of
                    industry raise up a middle class, closely allied with the great body of the
                    people. It is among this class that ideas of civil and religious liberty take
                    their rise, and find their firmest supporters; whereas in countries entirely
                    agricultural, liberty means only the domination of the aristocracy. The spirit
                    of liberty once introduced, laws are improved, prejudices hostile to industry
                    extinguished, and new vigour infused into every branch of society. It is thus
                    that freedom and wealth have generally followed in the train of commerce; and
                    that the commercial states have led the way in those improvements which have so
                    much ameliorated the condition of Europe. When the Italian republics flourished,
                    however, Europe was not in a state to be much benefited by the lights their
                    experience afforded. The Dutch republic, which flourished at a later period,
                    gave a more striking demonstration of the advantages of industry, freedom,
                    toleration, and good government, at a time when neither liberty nor toleration
                    were understood even in England, and when industry was in a very low state all
                    over Europe. The example of the Dutch furnished statesmen wi th new ideas, and
                    had a sensible influence on the policy of England, France, and other countries.
                    The genius of Peter the Great derived from <pb break="no" facs="nls:193750601"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-0601-0411"/>this small republic the seeds of those
                    improvements by which civilization was spread over the vast empire of Russia.
                    The superiority which the Dutch possessed has since been transferred to Britain,
                    and she has acquired with it the privilege of instructing other nations in the
                    sources of public wealth and the science of government.</p>
                <p>The Reformation had a material effect in accelerating the progress of society. It
                    put an end to a multitude of abuses and prejudices adverse to improvement, and
                    inspired the human mind with a new activity. Those countries in which it took no
                    root seemed to have had their progress arrested; while others, less favoured by
                    nature, derived new life and vigour from its influence. Italy and Spain, now so
                    far behind Britain, France, and Germany, were the first countries in Europe for
                    knowledge, wealth, and industry, at the period of the Reformation. The
                    establishment of the Protestant religion has produced a more liberal spirit
                    among the Catholics in those countries where the two churches exist together;
                    but in those countries where Protestantism has never obtained a footing, the
                    dread of its introduction has thrown the government more and more into the hands
                    of the clergy; the clergy, armed with power, have become more jealous and
                    intolerant, and have nearly put an end to all freedom of thought. The literary
                    glory of Spain expired some time after the Reformation; and Italy has been
                    checked in her career. The older writers of these countries breathe a spirit
                    which would not be tolerated at the present day, nor does society there afford
                    the elements out of which such characters could be formed. And thus it happened
                    that the very same event which called forth the powers of the human mind in the
                    north of Europe, extinguished the intellectual activity of the south.</p>
                <p>The improved means of internal communication in countries in modern times have
                    had a considerable effect upon the state of society. In ancient times free
                    states were necessarily small, because when neither the press nor the post
                    existed, that union of sentiment necessary to control the conduct of men in
                    power could not be effected among a large population scattered over a wide
                    space. A number of free states sprung up in Greece, because that country,
                    perforated by mountains and arms of the sea, afforded natural means of defence
                    to such small societies as could then exercise the functions necessary to the
                    preservation of freedom. It is a mistake to suppose that, in these states, a
                    greater extent of territory could have been united under one government by
                    adopting the representative system. The resolutions of a body of representatives
                    would command no more respect from a government than those of as many private
                    individuals, if they were not constantly supported by the opinions of the mass
                    of society; and this requires such a rapid and general circulation of
                    intelligence as could not then exist. The small size of the Grecian states was a
                    necessary condition of their freedom: but it was a serious disadvantage, not
                    only because it lessened the commercial intercourse between the different parts
                    of the country, but because such small communities had not strength enough to
                    resist a great force from without; and hence these states fell a prey to the
                    superior power of the Macedonian monarchy. The whole of the south-west of Europe
                    exhibits the physical features of Greece upon a larger scale. Its surface is
                    broken into numerous sections by gulfs and mountains, and abounds in natural
                    barriers. Favoured by these circumstances, the different communities in this
                    quarter of the world in modern times enjoyed a certain degree of independence
                    and security, which hastened their progress in civilization. Russia, which
                    occupies the <hi rend="italic superscript"> 0n</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi> l
                    <hi rend="superscript"> ar</hi> ge plain in Europe, has been the last reclaimed
                    from barbarism. So long, however, as the means of communication remained very
                    imperfect in modern Europe, free governments were confined to small states, and
                    the larger states were abandoned to feudal tyranny or military despotism; but
                    the science of government has gradually improved, as knowledge, commerce, and
                    the arts have advanced; and at present the admirable inventions of the post and
                    the press give such an electric rapidity to the circulation of public sentiment,
                    that twenty millions of men could be as easily united in defence of their rights
                    as the small population of Attica in the time of Xerxes.</p>
                <p>The progress of improvement tends to level all distinctions between states, but
                    those founded on the extent of their natural resources. Capital, skill,
                    intelligence, and all acquired advantages, tend to an equilibrium. When Europe
                    was overrun with barbarism, the city of Venice, by its commercial wealth, was a
                    counterpoise to two or three of the great monarchies of the continent. The
                    discovery of America, and of a passage by sea to the East Indies, gave a new
                    direction to commerce, and undermined the greatness of that city. The Dutch
                    republic rose by its freedom and industry, and was able, in the time of Charles
                    II. to dispute the empire of the sea with the combined powers of England and
                    France. But England increased her commerce, and improved her constitution; and
                    having a larger and more fertile territory, as well as a greater population, she
                    at length obtained an ascendancy over Holland, deprived her of the empire of the
                    sea, and stript her of most of her colonies. At the beginning, of the
                    seventeenth century, Spain and Turkey were the first powers in the west and east
                    of Europe, and inspired their neighbours with the dread of conquest. Sweden
                    ruled with undisputed sway in the north; and Russia, now so formidable, was
                    scarcely known. Spain, under abetter government, might recover a part of her
                    influence; but the Turkish empire seems near its dissolution; and the importance
                    of Sweden and Holland is gone irretrievably, in consequence of the growing
                    strength of the neighbouring powers. The extent of territory and immense natural
                    resources of Russia must, in the end, raise her to a decided superiority over
                    all the other powers of Europe, if the empire does not fall to pieces from its
                    own weight, or get into disorder from the vices of its government. Its progress
                    hitherto has been greatly aided by the personal characters of its sovereigns. If
                    we were to judge merely from the advantages which different states possess for
                    raising and supporting population, we might predict that, in the course of a
                    century and a half, Russia would rule with uncontrolled sway over the old
                    continent, and the United States over the new; and that the other states, which
                    now figure in the first rank in either hemisphere, would then owe their
                    existence, like the small principalities of Europe at the present day, to the
                    forbearance or the mutual jealousy of their powerful neighbours. But in the
                    course of events, many changes may occur to give a different destiny to both
                    continents.</p>
                <p>The number of the inhabitants of Europe has been progressively increasing, slowly
                    in the earlier part of the century, but more rapidly as we approach the present
                    times. Apparently it has been least considerable in Spain, Italy, Sweden,
                    France, and Germany; greater in Russia, Austria, and the British isles; and
                    greatest in Prussia. In 1787, Zimmermann estimated the population of Europe at
                    144,000,000; and in 1833, according to Balbi, it was 227,000,000. The increase
                    of 83,000,000 in forty-six years implies an annual augmentation of 994 upon
                    100,000, or very nearly one per cent.; and if this ratio were constant, the
                    population of Europe would double itself in seventy years and a half. In 1827
                    Baron Dupin estimated<pb break="no" facs="nls:193750614"

                <p>A comparison of the census for 1821 and 1831, the only two which include Ireland,
                    shows that Dupin’s estimate for Britain is too high. The annual increment for
                    the three kingdoms scarcely exceeds one seventy-fifth part, or 13,400 upon a
                    million. The increase in Prussia has been so very rapid, we presume, only since
                    the peace in 1815. The most obvious cause of this increase of population is the
                    increase of production, from the improvement of agriculture and the arts; but
                    part of the effect may be ascribed to the general introduction of potatoes in
                    many countries, by which the same portion of ground is made to support three or
                    four times as many persons as it would under corn. In France, where Mr Young, in
                    1789, found the cultivation of potatoes extremely limited, it was so much
                    extended in 1819, that, according to Chaptai, the annual produce was nearly
                    20,000,000 hectolitres, or 55,000,000 bushels-; a quantity fully as great in
                    proportion to the population as Mr Colquhoun assigns to Britain and Ireland.
                    This augmentation of numbers does not appear to have been accompanied with any
                    deterioration in the habits of the people. On the contrary, the diminution in
                    the rate of mortality which has taken place in Britain, France, and Sweden, is a
                    decisive proof of an improvement in the condition of these countries; and, by
                    analogy, we may extend the same conclusion to the other parts of Europe. It may
                    be remarked, that the general extension of commerce, and the accumulation of
                    capital, render a season of scarcity, in a particular country, much less
                    destructive now than formerly. In Britain, whose commerce and capital enable her
                    to draw supplies from all parts of the world, the additional mortality, in the
                    most severe scarcity, does not exceed one tenth; but in Sweden, a poor country,
                    it sometimes amounts to one third. (Milne’s <hi rend="italic">Annuities,</hi> p.
                    400.) In ancient times, when each country depended entirely on its own produce,
                    the effects of a scarcity were dreadful.</p>
                <p>The states of Europe at present are 62 in number, and, considered with respect to
                    political importance, may be divided into four classes. Britain, France, Russia,
                    Austria, and Prussia, belong to the first; Spain, Sweden, Turkey, to the second;
                    Holland, Belgium, Portugal, Naples, Bavaria, Sardinia, Denmark, Saxony,
                    Wirtemberg, Hanover, and Switzerland, to the third; Baden, Tuscany, and the
                    States of the Church, with the other small states of Germany and Italy, belong
                    to the fourth class. Objections may be made to this classification, but we have
                    not been able to find a better; and a few remarks will explain the principle on
                    which it is founded. The first five powers are the only powers that exercise a
                    decided influence over their neighbours; and it is by their joint counsels that
                    differences among the smaller powers are adjusted, and all questions that
                    concern the general state of Europe decided. The three states of the second
                    class visibly occupy a lower place in the scale of power than those of the
                    first. They have very little exterior influence, but they arc not directly
                    controlled by any of the stronger powers; and it is only among them and the
                    states of the first class that wars arc now likely to originate. The third class
                    includes those states which are too feeble, and too much under the influence of
                    the great powers, to become principals in war, but are of importance enough to
                    be valued as auxiliaries by states of the first and second classes. The fourth
                    class consists of states which have too little force to maintain any degree of
                    independence, and owe their existence to the justice, the forbearance, or the
                    mutual jealousies of the stronger powers. It is only in Europe that small states
                    exist among large ones; and their existence is the consequence of that equality
                    of power among the great states, which compels each to respect the rights of the
                    others, and to pay a certain degree of deference to public opinion.</p>
                <p>A detailed account of the principal European states is given under the proper
                    heads, in their alphabetical order. Our object here is only to bring together
                    such general facts as will afford a comparative view of the internal condition,
                    power, and resources of those larger societies which comprise the greatest part
                    of the population of Europe. With respect to the smaller states, we cannot make
                    room for any further details than what are contained in the table which forms
                    the conclusion of this article.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Britain·.</hi></p>
                <p>Though much smaller in extent than any of the other states of the first rank,
                    Britain is the most wealthy and powerful of the whole·. She has a moderately
                    good climate, a soil less fertile in grain than that of France, but affording
                    better pasturage; an extensive line of sea-coast, with numerous harbours; a
                    natural and well-defined frontier, a good commercial position, and the largest
                    fields of coal in Europe. But all these advantages have contributed less to her
                    aggrandisement than the excellence of her laws and constitution. The progress of
                    Britain in commerce, manufactures, and agriculture, within the last century, and
                    especially within the last forty years, has been wonderfully great.</p>
                <p>The British isles contain about 76,000,000 of acres, of which about 49,000,000
                    are in cultivation, and 27,000,000, or more than one third, waste or
                    uncultivated. About one half of the waste land is in Scotland, where the
                    cultivated soil forms only twenty-six parts in the 100 of the whole surface of
                    the country; in England it forms eighty-two parts in the 100, and in Ireland
                    sixty-nine.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Colquhoun s

                    iii, addenda.</p></note> The agriculture of Britain, compared with that of the
                    continent, is distinguished by the farms being generally larger, the plan of
                    cultivation more systematic and skilful, the produce on equal soils greater, the
                    pasture land bearing a higher proportion to the land in tillage, and the breed
                    of animals being superior. In Scotland the pasture land forms about one half of
                    the lan∙d in cultivation; in England, four sevenths. The whole annual produce of
                    grain in Britain and Ireland was estimated by Dr Colquhoun m 1812 at 35,000,000
                    of quarters, excluding seed; of which wheat is supposed to form twenty-six parts
                    in the 100 in quantity, barley seventeen parts, oats forty-nine, rye two, peas
                    and beans five. The value of the annual produce of grain was computed by the
                    same author at L.73,700,000; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193750627"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-0627-0413"/>that of the pasture land at L.89,200,000; and the
                    whole gross produce of all the branches of agriculture, including gardens and
                    cattle, at L.216,000,000. But as this estimate was made in 1812, when prices
                    were uncommonly high, a third or a fourth should be deducted for the present
                    value. The valued rack-rent of England and Wales, as returned to parliament by
                    the commissioners of taxes in 1810, was L.29,503,073, which gives 15s. 6d. as
                    the average of rent of all kinds of land per acre. The rental of Scotland in
                    1813, according to Sir John Sinclair, was L.5,041,779, including mines and
                    fisheries; and deducting L341,000 for these, the rent of land would be
                    L.4,700,000, <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> r 4s. lid. per acre on an average.</p>
                <p>The progress of Britain in manufactures has been still more rapid, within a
                    recent period, than hi agriculture; and her natural advantages for this species
                    of industry are perhaps more exclusive. She has a good supply within herself of
                    the raw material for all her staple manufactures except cotton; and her means of
                    procuring this article are at least equal to those of her neighbours. The growth
                    of this manufacture in Britain has been unprecedentedly rapid. In 1767, the
                    value of all the cotton goods manufactured did not exceed L.200,000, and in 1832
                    it was estimated at L.36,000,000. The produce of the woollen manufactures, in
                    the same year, including the raw material, was estimated at L.22,000,000; that
                    of leather at L.10,000,000; of linen at L.12,500,000. (M‘Culloch’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Commercial Dictionary·,</hi> 1832.)</p>
                <p>The commerce of Britain seems to have increased pretty regularly during the first
                    sixty years of the last century; but from 1760 to 1786 it remained almost
                    stationary. From this period to the present time the increase has been rapid
                    beyond example. The exports of England, about 1700, were L.6,045,000; in 1760,
                    L.14,694,000; in 1786, L.15,385,000. (Chalmers’ <hi rend="italic">Hist.
                    View.</hi> p. 315.) In 1832, the official value of the exports was L.76,07l,000,
                    of the imports L.44,586,000. The mercantile tonnage in</p>
                <p>1832 was 2.618,000 tons, and the number of seamen 161,600. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Parliamentary Papers.)</hi> The annual produce of foreign commerce, or the
                    sums derived from it by all classes concerned in it, were estimated, in 1812, at
                    L.46,373,478; the gains from inland trade at L.31,500,000; and the whole annual
                    produce of industry, from all sources, at L. 430,000,000 (Colquhoun, p. 96-100);
                    an estimate which is certainly exaggerated.</p>
                <p>The growing wealth of Britain has had to sustain an increasing weight of public
                    burdens. The public revenue of England, at the Union in 1709, was L.5,691,803;
                    of Scotland, L. 160,000. In 1763 (a year of peace) the net revenue was
                    L.9,100,000; in 1790 L.15,986,068; and in 1812 it was L.64,979,960, of which
                    England furnished L.55,995,123, Scotland L.4,155,599, and Ireland L.4,882,264.
                    (Colquhoun, p. 262.) In the year 1832, the net produce of the revenue was
                    L.51,474,000, which was collected at an expense of L.6. 13s. lid. per cent, the
                    nominal amount of the public debt at 5th January</p>
                <p>1833 was L.754,000,000, the interest L.27,703,000. The unfunded debt was
                    L.35,373,000. The army in 1832 consisted or 95,800 men, exclusive of 17,200 in
                    India.</p>
                <p>he number of men voted for the navy was 27,000. <hi rend="italic">(Parliamentary

                    rapid increase of numbers appears not to have been accompanied with any
                    deterioration of condition. In the five years ending 1784, the annual mortality
                    in England and Wales was one in thirty-seven; in the five years ending 1810, it
                    was one in 47∙86. Of the population of Britain and Ireland, about thirty-five
                    families in the hundred are employed in agriculture, forty-five in trades,
                    manufactures, and handicrafts, and twenty in other occupations. The total
                    population of Britain and Ireland in 1831 was 24,304,000. To these must be added
                    about 98,000,000 in the colonies, making a total of 122,000,000.</p>

                <p>This country enjoys, upon the whole, greater natural advantages than any other in
                    Europe. Her territory is above one half larger than Great Britain and Ireland,
                    and is superior in soil and climate. She has a greater proportion of arable land
                    than any of her neighbours; the natural means of communication between her
                    provinces are abundant and easy; she is well provided with all the useful metals
                    except tin; and is better supplied with coal than any other country in Europe
                    except Britain. When we add to these advantages the intelligence and activity of
                    her population, and consider that corvees, tithes, feudal services, and most of
                    those abuses which shackled her industry, are now removed; that she is likely to
                    enjoy the benefits of good laws and a free constitution, and is not encumbered
                    with a great national debt; we cannot doubt that, if peace continue for any
                    considerable length of time, she will yet rise to a much higher degree of wealth
                    and prosperity than she ever before possessed. Even during the distractions of
                    the Revolution, though her commerce was annihilated, her agriculture and
                    manufactures extended and improved, her population increased, and its condition
                    was ameliorated. The greatest bar to her progress will probably be the extreme
                    division of property; and, for some time also, the want of capital.</p>

                    amounts to one eighth of this, or twelve parts in the hundred; the arable land
                    to forty-four parts in the hundred; the woodland to fourteen parts; the
                    pasturage land and meadows to fourteen; the vineyards to four; wild land seven;
                    quarries, buildings, orchards, gardens, olive and other plantations, make up the
                    remaining five parts. (Chaptai, <hi rend="italic">De l’Industrie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Française,</hi> i. 205. Paris, 1819.) In addition to the vegetable
                    productions that growjn England, the climate of France enables her to raise
                    maize, vines, olives, mulberries, and chestnuts; and by some of these a produce
                    is extracted from soil which in England would yield nothing. The whole produce
                    of grain in France is estimated by Chaptai at 143,000,000 hectolitres, equal to
                    50,000,000 quarters, or 40,000,000 deducting one fifth for seed, which is only
                    5,000,000 above the produce of Britain and Ireland, as estimated by Colquhoun.
                    Of this produce of grain, wheat forms thirty-six parts in the hundred, rye
                    twenty-one parts, maize four and a half, buckwheat six, barley nine, oats
                    twenty-two, legumes one. The quantity of potatoes (19,800,741 hectolitres) is
                    equal to two thirds of the rye. The produce of 4,000,000 of acres planted with
                    vines, in 1808, was 37,600,000 hectolitres of wine. (i. 173,177.) The <hi

                <p>The mean revenue derived from a hectare of land is estimated by Dupin at thirty
                    and a half francs, or 25s. 5d. equal to about 10s. 3d. per acre; and the revenue
                    of the whole departments, calculated on this basis, is L.65,000,000. The last
                    sum includes houses, and may be considered as corresponding nearly to the
                    rack-rent of lands and buildings in France. This is certainly too low. The
                    average rent of all kinds of land in France was estimated by Young at 15s. 10d.
                    per acre. <hi rend="italic">(Tram</hi> i. 476.) The most peculiar feature in
                    French agriculture is the vast number of small proprietors, who cultivate their
                    patches of land by their own labour. Arthur Young supposed that, before the
                    Revolution, one third of the property of the kingdom was held by such persons;
                    and Chaptai says the number of proprietors is doubled within the last thirty
                    years. The latter computes the whole number of farms in France at 3,000,000; so
                    that, on an average, each cannot exceed forty-three acres, including wastes. In
                    the cultivation of good soils, the agriculture of France is nearly equal to that
                    of England; but it is greatly inferior in the management of poor soils, in the
                    system of cropping, and in the breed of animals. It has been much improved,
                    however, during the Revolution, by the extensive cultivation of artificial
                    grasses, by augmenting the live stock, by the general exclusion of fallows, and
                    by increasing the cultivation of potatoes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The manufactures of France, amidst all the troubles of the Revolution, have been
                    generally advancing, though some branches have retrograded. The number of
                    workmen employed in Lyons, the principal seat of the silk manufacture, was one
                    fourth greater in 1812 than in 1789. France produces within herself about eleven
                    millions of pounds of raw silk, and imports nearly as much; and the total value
                    of the manufactured articles produced is estimated at L.4,300,000. Of wool,
                    France produces about ninety-three millions of pounds, valued at L.3,253,000,
                    and imports seventeen millions of pounds, which, converted into various fabrics,
                    is estimated to be worth L.9,500,000 sterling. The value of the manufactures of
                    flax and hemp is estimated at L.9,612,000. The spinning of cotton by machinery,
                    which was scarcely introduced before the Revolution, employed one million of
                    spindles in 1812; in that year there were 23,000,000 pounds of cotton spun; in
                    1825 there were 62,000,000. The value of the cotton goods manufactured is
                    estimated at L.7,600,000. The manufactures of iron in France are estimated at
                    L.8,300,000; those of leather at L.5,700,000. The whole gross produce of
                    manufacturing industry, including manufacturers’ profits, is estimated at
                    1,802,000,000 of francs, or L.72,800,000, of which the value of the raw material
                    forms thirty-two parts in the hundred, wages forty-seven, manufacturers’ profits
                    ten, and expenses eleven. (Chaptal, ii. 116, 203; Dupin, tom. i.) <hi

                <p>The exports of France in the year 1827 amounted in value to 602,000,000 francs
                    (L.24,000,000); the imports to 565,000,000 (L.22,600,000). The leading articles
                    of exportation were silk goods, raw silk, cottons, linens, wines, and woollens;
                    the leading imports were raw silk, cotton, linen, and coffee.</p>
                <p>The population of France, notwithstanding the interruption to industry, and the
                    drains occasioned by the long wars, has increased since the commencement of the
                    Revolution. According to calculations made by the National Assembly in 1791,
                    France contained 26,363,074 inhabitants, and in 1831 it contained 32,560,000
                    within the same limits. <hi rend="italic">(Annuaire</hi><hi rend="italic">pour
                    ιAn</hi> 1834). The annual increase is about 200,000 individuals. The condition
                    of the labouring classes appears to be improved. Wages, which Arthur Young
                    estimated at 19 sous, or 10d. English per day, throughout the kingdom, for all
                    kinds of work, were estimated at Is. 2d. by Dupin, in 1827. The annual
                    mortality, which was estimated at one in thirty by Neckar before the Revolution,
                    we find stated recently to be one in forty. <hi rend="italic">(Annuaire</hi><hi

                <p> According to returns made in 1815, there were then in France 22,300 primary
                    schools, with 737,379 pupils. There were, besides, 368 secondary schools,
                    thirty-six lycées, and twenty-six universities. In 1833 there were 44,500
                    primary schools, which were attended by 1,907,000 pupils of both sexes.</p>
                <p>The ordinary revenue of France, in the year 1831, was 973,000,000 francs, or
                    L.39,000,000. The debt was 5,400,000,000, or L.216,000,000, and the annual
                    interest 283,000,000, or L.11,300,000. There are about 40,000 parish priests in
                    France, whose pay, with that of the bishops, amounts to L. 1,200,000.</p>
                <p>From the commencement of the Revolution to 1810, France received great accessions
                    of territory. The peace of Luneville left her in possession, in whole or in
                    part, of the Austrian and Dutch Netherlands, the bishoprics of Liege, Cologne,
                    Treves, Mentz, duchy of Juliers, the Palatinate, Moeurs, Guelders, the
                    department of Mont Blanc, Leman, Maritime Alps, with the Venaissain,
                    Montbéliard, and other <hi rend="italic">enclaves.</hi> These various districts
                    comprehended a surface of 27,400 square miles, and a population of
                    5,025,000.</p>
                <p>Between 1801 and 1810 she acquired Piedmont, Genoa, Tuscany, Parma, the Roman
                    States, the Valais, the Illyrian provinces, with Venetian Dalmatia; Holland,
                    Bremen, Hamburg, Lubec, Munster, Osnaburg, and part of Hanover. These districts
                    comprehended a surface of 110,000 square miles, and a population of 16,057,000.
                    With these additions the French empire, in 1812, included an area of 310,000
                    square miles, and a population of 44,500,000.</p>
                <p>If to these we add the states dependent upon France; namely, the Cisalpine
                    Republic, 31,000 square miles, ’with 6,350,000 inhabitants; the Confederation of
                    the Rhine, 113,000 square miles, with 14,000,000inhabitants, and Naples, 30,500
                    square miles, with 4,960,000 inhabitants; we have an aggregate of 486,000 square
                    miles, and a population of nearly 70,000,000. The kings, princes, or chiefs of
                    these dependent states, were in reality ∏θ∙ thing more than Napoleon’s viceroys;
                    and it may be saι with truth, that in 1812 the resources of the vast popula tion

                <p>The Austrian empire is one fourth larger than France, and twice as large as
                    Britain and Ireland. Its population consists of a mixed mass of nations,
                    differing in origin, language, religion, and manners, having few common ties,
                    and little intercourse with one another. Austria has but a small extent of
                    sea-coast, and is almost entirely an inland power. The climate is similar to
                    that of France, but subject to greater extremes of heat and cold, the soil not
                    much inferior, the grain and fruits nearly the same. She is richer in mineral
                    wealth than any other state in Europe, and possesses coal, though not in great
                    abundance. Her natural resources are capable of vast improvement; and in the
                    hands of a wise and liberal government, would soon raise her far above the rank
                    she now enjoys. Of the six sections into which her territories are divided,
                    Lombardy is the most populous in proportion to its extent; Bohemia and Moravia
                    are next in population, and are the seats of the chief manufacturers; Austria
                    Proper and Hungary are remarkably rich in mines; and Galicia, though in a low
                    state of cultivation, is fertile in grain, and contains the most productive
                    mines of salt in Europe. Austria has but a slender title to be regarded as a
                    German power; less than one fifth of her population are Germans. The Sclavonic
                    race, who form nearly one half of the population, give a character of ignorance
                    and backwardness to the government. In Bohemia, Hungary, and other provinces
                    where this race predominates, vassalage exists in some of its forms, and cramps
                    the progress of society. The Austrian empire, in truth, consists properly of six
                    separate governments, feebly united under one head. Each of these governments,
                    except that of Lombardy, has a diet or states, composed of the deputies from the
                    nobility, clergy, and towns; but these bodies exercise no real influence over
                    the government, except in Hungary, where the old feudal institutions remain in
                    vigour, and the aristocracy have always maintained a great degree of
                    independence.</p>
                <p>The surface of the Austrian monarchy is estimated at 258,000 square English
                    miles. Of this surface, the waste lands, including morasses, mountains, rivers,
                    and ground covered with buildings, are estimated at five parts in twenty-four,
                    the useful soil at nineteen parts in twenty-four; and of the useful soil about
                    forty-three parts in the hundred are in tillage, nine parts meadow land, nine
                    parts commons, which support cattle, two parts vineyards, two parts gardens and
                    orchards, and thirty-five parts forest land. The total produce of grain is
                    estimated at 165,500,000 metzen, or about 35,670,000 quarters, consisting of
                    wheat fourteen parts, barley eleven, rye thirty-one, and oats forty-four. In
                    1804 the net produce of a joch (equal to one acre and a half) of corn land, for
                    the whole Austrian states, was valued by Lichtenstern at five florins (10s.),
                    <hi rend="superscript"> an</hi> d of pasture land at two florins (4s.) (Hassel’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Stat. &lt;Aris des Oest.</hi> p. 90.) The annual produce of
                    wine in the Austrian dominions is estimated at from 36,000,000 to 40,000,000 of
                    cimers (each equal to fourteen English gal-ļons),. of which Hungary furnishes
                    nearly two thirds, lhis is rather more than one half of the produce of the
                    french vineyards. Galicia is the only province in which there are no vines.
                    Hungary and Sclavonia supply 180,000 centners of excellent tobacco. The
                    Ex-Venetian states urnish yearly 1,200,000 pounds of silk; Milan and the Tyrol
                    nearly as much; and altogether this species of culture employs 400,000 persons.
                    Flax, hemp, hops, and fruits, are also extensively cultivated; and the forests,
                    which cover more than one fourth of the empire, furnish an ample supply of wood.
                    The total produce of the vegetable kingdom is valued at 68,500,000 sterling, a
                    small amount, considering the extent of the country; but agriculture, though
                    there are numerous societies for its improvement ιemams in a low state, from the
                    prejudices of the higher classes, and the oppressions to which the peasantry are
                    exposed. The horses in the empire are estimated at 1,800,000, the sheep at
                    12,000,000, and the horned cattle at 10,000,000. The live stock has greatly
                    diminished within the last twenty-five years. The annual produce of the mines is
                    3846 marks of gold (the mark is about three fourths of a pound Troy); 486
                    centners (hundredweights) of silver, 56,000 centners of copper, 30,000 centners
                    of lead, 4890 centners of tin, 1,200,000 centners of iron, and 5300 centners of
                    mercury. About 5,500,000 centners of salt are prepared, the greatest part from
                    salt mines and springs. The annual produce of these minerals in 1802, when it
                    was probahly one third less than the above, was valued at L.4,700,000.<note

                <p>The leading manufactures are linen, cotton, woollen, silk, leather, and works in
                    metal and wood. The linen manufacture existing in all the provinces, but to the
                    greatest extent in Bohemia and Moravia, is supposed to employ 1,200,000 persons;
                    the woollen manufacture 300,000 persons; the cotton 100,000: about 18,000 or
                    20,000 centners of cotton were spun by machinery in 1817, which is three times
                    the quantity spun in 1803. The silk manufacture, which is carried on chiefly in
                    Lombardy, employs 110,000 persons. The most considerable manufactures in metal
                    are in Styria, Carinthia, and Lower Austria. The estimate of the annual products
                    of the Austrian manufactures, given by Crome, is too extravagant to deserve any
                    credit. But those of Bohemia, in 1811, were valued at 158,000,000 of florins;
                    and if we add twice as much for all the other states, the whole produce of the
                    Austrian manufactures may, on this ground, be computed at L.47,000,000 sterling.
                    Even this is probably above the truth. (Lichtenstern, p. 44; Crome,
                    173-176.)</p>
                <p>C The commerce of Austria is extremely trifling. She possesses but a small extent
                    of sea-coast, which is remote from the centre of her territories, is destitute
                    of navigable rivers, and rendered difficult of access by mountains. The numerous
                    rivers that water her dominions afford few advantages to her trade, as,
                    excepting in Italy, she does not command the outlet of any one of them. The
                    whole exports of this large empire are only L.3,000,000, and the imports
                    L.3,200,000. (Lichtenstern, p. 48.)</p>
                <p>The population of the Austrian empire, in 1817, was 28,207,886, of which the
                    Sclavonic race amounted to 13,182,000, the Germans to 5,342,000, the Italians to
                    4,226,000, the Magyars or Hungarians to 4,225,000, the Wallachians to 1,246,000,
                    and the Jews to 487,000. (Lichtenstern, p. 1858.) In 1832 Balbi estimated the
                    population at 32,000,000. There are, besides, considerable numbers of Greeks,
                    Turks, Albanians, and Armenians; so that, except Russia, no state in Europe has
                    such a heterogeneous population. Throughout the Austrian dominions, the nobility
                    and clergy are numerous, and many of them very rich. In Hungary, Galicia, and
                    indeed in the greater part of the empire, these classes are exempt from taxes,
                    and enjoy other pernicious privileges. The Austrian clergy, exclusive of their
                    families, are estimated at 64,000, of whom 56,000 belong to the Catholic church;
                    the nobles <pb break="no" facs="nls:193750666" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0666-0416"/>of
                    both sexes at 475,000; the civil servants of the government, with their
                    families, at 280,000; the military, men, women, children, and servants, at
                    800,000; the burghers and tradesmen, with their families, at 2,333,000; the
                    persons engaged in agriculture at 4,005,000 families, or about 20,025,000
                    individuals. (Lichtenstern, p. 133.) In all the provinces, especially in
                    Bohemia, Moravia, and Hungary, there has been a rapid increase in the numbers of
                    the inhabitants. Though the people are poor and ignorant, the government has
                    been at much pains to provide them with the means of instruction; and the
                    numerous schools and academies established must essentially contribute to the
                    improvement of the country. The Catholic religion, though it predominates,
                    nowhere enjoys that exclusive ascendancy which produces such pernicious
                    consequences in Spain and Italy. The other sects, Greeks, Calvinists, Lutherans,
                    form nearly one third of the inhabitants in the provinces beyond the Alps; and
                    this circumstance, by generating a certain freedom of thought and discussion,
                    must prove favourable to the progress of society.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prussia.</hi></p>
                <p>Prussia is the smallest in extent, and enjoys the fewest natural advantages, of
                    all the European states of the first class. Her territory is not much more than
                    two fifths of that of Austria; it is but indifferently fertile; has few valuable
                    mines, few resources for manufactures; she has, however, pretty large extent of
                    sea-coast, and a considerable commerce. Her possessions are straggling and
                    disjointed; they present an extensive frontier, with little depth, and no
                    natural barriers; and are inhabited by people who speak different languages, and
                    have few common tics or interests. Prussia has sustained her rank chiefly in
                    consequence of the superiority of her internal organization. Her government,
                    unlike those of the other monarchies of Europe, being of very recent origin, is
                    not encumbered by those ancient establishments which the change of circumstances
                    has converted into abuses. The frame of her public institutions was much
                    improved by the Great Frederick, who availed himself of all the lights and
                    philosophy which the age furnished. He established a complete toleration in
                    matters of religion; curtailed the oppressive privileges of the nobles;
                    simplified the administration of justice; and introduced order and economy into
                    every department of the government. He left the kingdom to his successor with a
                    large and well-disciplined army, and a high reputation for policy and prowess.
                    After the misfortunes in which Prussia was involved by the battle of Jena, the
                    present king, aided by his enlightened minister Hardenberg, began a series of
                    most extensive reforms, which have raised the oppressed peasantry to the rank of
                    free farmers, or independent proprietors, reduced still farther the privileges
                    of the nobles, released trade from the weight of incorporations, and created the
                    most ample means of instruction for the whole population. The population of
                    Prussia, of whom two thirds are Protestants, is more intelligent than that of
                    Austria; includes a greater proportion of Germans; and altogether she is more of
                    a German power. The large rivers that water her territories have generally a
                    very level course; and being joined by canals, they afford a great extent of
                    inland navigation. Of all the old provinces, Silesia is the most industrious and
                    flourishing. It doubled its population in the seventy-three years between 1742
                    and 1815. The Westphalian and Rhenish provinces are the most populous; ancient
                    Prussia and the Polish provinces the least. (Russell’s <hi rend="italic">Travels
                    in Germany,</hi> 1824, vol. ii. p. 110.)</p>
                <p>Agriculture has been greatly extended in Prussia, and somewhat improved in recent
                    times. Besides the common species of grain, tobacco, mulberries, vines, flax,
                    and hemp, are cultivated. Great quantities of potatoes arc also raised Horned
                    cattle and sheep are pretty numerous in most of the provinces. Μ. Krug estimated
                    the mean rent of an arpent of corn land, for the whole Prussian states, at 2 <hi

                    produce</hi> of an arpent of corn land at two fifths of the gross produce; but
                    of pasture land at one fourth or one fifth only, including poultry and bees.
                    According to returns made from the different provinces to the government, the
                    whole annual produce of grain in Prussia about 1802, when the population was
                    8,754,000 was 4,500,000 wispel (equal to 9,600,000 quarters); of which wheat
                    formed nine parts in the hundred, rye forty, barley twenty-four, and oats
                    twenty-seven; of this quantity one tenth was exported. The Prussian silver mines
                    yield annually about 20,000 mark of silver; the county of Mani-íîcld alone
                    furnishes 14,588 centners of copper; and Silesia affords 7600 centners of lead,
                    and 405,900 centners of iron. The principal manufactures of Prussia are linen,
                    woollen, cotton, silk, leather, iron, and porcelain, all of which are making
                    progress.</p>
                <p>In proportion as the other great states of Europe improve their natural
                    resources, the importance of Prussia must decline. The time is past when the
                    good order of her finances, and the discipline of her armies, could raise her to
                    an equality with France, and Austria, and Russia; and she can only now support
                    her rank by cultivating still farther those moral advantages which are the real
                    source of her strength.</p>
                <p>In 1791 Prussia acquired the principalities of Anspach and Bayreuth; in 1793 a
                    part of Poland containing 1,136,000 inhabitants; and in 1795 an additional part,
                    containing 860,000. At the peace of Luneville in 1801, she gave up some
                    possessions on the left of the Rhine, and received indemnities in Germany,
                    leaving a balance in her favour. These various acquisitions added 46,000 square
                    miles to her territory, and 2,836,000 to her population, raising the former to
                    116,000 square miles, and the latter to 9,100,000 souls. Such was Prussia in
                    1803. The ruinous campaign of 1806 suddenly deprived her of all her possessions
                    between the Elbe and the Rhine, with four fifths of her share of Poland,
                    reducing her territory and population about one half, the latter being estimated
                    at 4,560,000 in 1808. On the overthrow of Napoleon in 1814, she was restored to
                    more than her ancient splendour. She recovered the greater part of her Polish
                    dominions, gained some districts in Saxony and Lusatia, Swedish Pomerania, and
                    an extensive, rich, and populous country in Westphalia and on the Rhine,
                    including the greater part of the secularised ecclesiastical states, abbey
                    lands, &amp;c. The Prussian monarchy at present embraces an area of 94,000
                    square English miles, and a population of 12,464,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Russia.</hi></p>
                <p>Russia occupies very nearly one half of the surface of Europe; -and yet her
                    territories in this division of the globe are scarcely more than one fifth of
                    her whole dominions. Three fourths of her Asiatic territories, however, consist
                    of sandy deserts or frozen plains, which yield very little for human
                    subsistence; and her possessions in Europe are at present, and perhaps will
                    always be, the most valuable part of the empire. European Russia consists
                    chiefly of an elevated plain, over which numerous rivers flow with a small
                    declivity, so as to allor a greater extent of inland navigation, probably, than
                    exists in all the rest of Europe. Its superficial extent, including Poland, is
                    about 1,990,000 square English miles, which is about ten times the area of
                    France, or sixteen t <hi rend="superscript"> ιrnes</hi><pb break="no"

                    But of this surface, more than one fourth part, lying beyond the parallel of
                    60°, is incapable of cultivation, from the rigour of the climate, or the marshy
                    nature of the soil. In the south, also, there are vast sandy plains, the soil of
                    which, destitute of wood and water, and impregnated with salt, is altogether
                    useless for agriculture. The fertile part of Russia consists chiefly of the
                    country lying between the parallels of 50° and 57°, which contains a great
                    proportion of excellent soil, well watered with navigable streams, and
                    comparatively populous and cultivated. The cultivation of wheat is chiefly
                    confined to this region; and here abundant crops are procured with little
                    labour, and by a very rude species of culture. But farther north slender crops
                    are obtained with so much exertion, that a single peasant cannot cultivate more
                    than from seven to ten acres; and these crops are so precarious, that the rye
                    sometimes will not ripen in the neighbourhood of Petersburg. The lands, however,
                    where corn will not grow yield pasture and wood. Trees are found as far as the
                    sixty-seventh degree, beyond which there are only shrubs.<note anchored="true"

                    amounts to forty parts in the hundred of the whole surface. The crown forests
                    are estimated at 44,500,000 of desiatines, equal to 240,000 square miles. Rye is
                    the grain most extensively cultivated all over Russia; but barley, wheat, and
                    oats, are also raised. In the southern provinces, maize, rice, vines, and even
                    cotton, succeed; and both in the southern and central parts, vast ranges of
                    pasture ground support numerous herds of cattle, the skins and tallow of which,
                    with the peltries of wild animals, are leading articles of exportation. These
                    pastures are generally commons: the quantity of uncultivated lands, says Storch,
                    is so great, that it would be useless to divide them. The number of sheep in
                    Russia has been estimated at 60,000,000. Flax and hemp, however, are the
                    productions in which the soil of Russia has the greatest superiority, and of
                    these she exports great quantities. Some of the less civilized nations are
                    almost supported by bees, and wax and honey are also among the principal
                    articles of exportation. Russia has rich mines of gold, silver, copper, iron,
                    lead, and salt, the best of which are in the Uralian Mountains, and chiefly on
                    the Asiatic side. They employ about half <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> ĩh</hi>
                    million of persons.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of Russia are inconsiderable, though the government has made
                    great exertions to encourage this species of industry. The principal are those
                    of coarse woollens, flax, iron, leather, silk, glass, and brandies. The
                    manufacturing establishments in 1815 amounted to 3262, of which 181 were for
                    cloth, 150 silk, 1348 leather, 247 soap, tallow, and wax, 184 linen, 295 cotton,
                    138 glass, 200 metal. (Crome, p. 70.)</p>
                <p>If confidence might be put in the lists transmitted to government, the annual
                    mortality in Russia is only one in fifty-eight, the births one in twenty-six,
                    and the annual addition to the population one in forty-nine, so that the period
                    of doubling should be thirty-five years. (Storch, i∙ &lt;i82.) But these
                    extraordinary results are irreconcilable with facts. There are in Russia above
                    eighty nations, who speak more than forty different languages; but the Sclavonic
                    race forms seven eighths of the whole European population. According to the
                    official returns in 1783, the peasants belonging to the crown and to the nobles
                    amounted to eighty-three persons in the hundred of the whole population.
                    (Storch, i. 249.) Of all the powers of Europe, Russia is the only one that,
                    during the numerous changes of the last thirty years, has never lost any part of
                    her territories, but has been continually adding to them. Her acquisitions since
                    1770 are as follows:</p>

                <p>The success of the Parisian insurrection in July 1830 roused the Poles to make a
                    new effort for independence, which began in November 1830, and was finally
                    crushed in the following year, after a heroic resistance. The consequence was,
                    that Poland was deprived of its separate constitution, and incorporated with
                    Russia as an integral part of the empire in February 1832.</p>
                <p>Sweden.</p>
                <p>Sweden has sunk in her relative importance in consequence of the rise of Russia;
                    but she still holds a higher place in the scale of power than any other European
                    state with an equal population. Now that Norway is united to her dominions, she
                    has the best military and commercial position of all the northern continental
                    powers. But the soil is poor and rocky; so that, though her territories form one
                    tenth of the surface of Europe, her population amounts to less than one
                    fiftieth. Her principal wealth consists in her rich mines of iron and copper,
                    and in the produce of her forests and her fisheries.</p>
                <p>The agricultural produce of Sweden, which does not suffice for her own
                    consumption, consists chiefly of rye, oats, barley, and potatoes; the soil and
                    climate not admitting of wheat, except in the southern parts. Gothland, the most
                    fertile province, contains one half of the population upon less than one fifth
                    of the surface of the kingdom* The soil actually under corn cultivation in 1810
                    amounted only to 1,091,000 tunnas, or 1,363,838 acres; but the soil capable of
                    cultivation was estimated at 1,818,450 acres, or one sixty-second part of the
                    surface of the country. This is the average of the whole; but in the province of
                    Nordland only one acre in 915 is arable. The lakes cover one eighteenth part.
                    The pasture ground and gardens occupy about twice the quantity of land under
                    corn. The average size of a farm is only about twenty-seven acres. The whole
                    annual produce of grain is estimated at 5,702,835 spans, equal to about
                    1,482,500 quarters, besides 350,000 quarters of potatoes. The general produce of
                    the crops is about five for one. In Norway, the land in cultivation amounts to
                    less than one acre in a hundred, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193750692"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-0692-0418"/>and one'fourth of the grain used is imported.
                    Potatoes are extensively cultivated. In times of scarcity bread is made of the
                    bark of trees, and of the Iceland moss, on which the rein-deer feed.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of Sweden are of little importance. Sixty or seventy ships are
                    built annually, and sold to foreigners. The distillation of brandy consumes
                    700,000 spans of corn a year. The manufactures of paper and glass, and works in
                    metal, supply the internal consumption; those of cotton, wool, and silk, are of
                    small extent. The whole produce of manufactures in Sweden (exclusive of Norway),
                    in 1814, was valued, in an official statement, at 5,622,129 dollars banco, or
                    about L.800,000. (Crome, 123.)</p>
                <p>The exports of Sweden, in 1816, were estimated at seven millions of dollars
                    (exclusive of Norway), and the imports at no less than twenty millions. The
                    supposed national loss arising from this disproportion led to a prohibition of
                    the importation of wine, rum, cotton stuffs, and other articles considered as
                    luxuries. In 1816, Sweden had 1107 merchant ships, whose aggregate burden was
                    64,000 lasts, or 120,000 tons. (Crome, 122, 125.)</p>
                <p>The population of Sweden was estimated at 2,615,800 in 1818; that of Norway, in
                    1803, was 910,000; and from the probable rate of increase there, must now amount
                    to fully one million. In Sweden about one ninth, and in Norway about one twelfth
                    of the people live in towns. This increase in numbers has been attended with an
                    improvement in the condition of the inhabitants. The annual mortality in Sweden,
                    which Malthus, in 1796, estimated at one in thirty-seven, was, in 1811,
                    according to Akrell, one in forty for the southern parts, one in forty-seven for
                    the northern, and one in forty-three for the whole kingdom. In Norway the
                    mortality has always been smaller than in any other European country. In 1815
                    the nobles amounted to 1641 families, or 9523 persons; the clergy, including
                    their families, to 15,202; the burghers to 64,755; and the peasants to
                    1,763,397. Besides these classes, who are represented in the diet, there are
                    about 500,000 persons not represented, consisting of civil and military
                    officers, miners, mechanics, servants, &amp;c. About one fourth of the peasants
                    who are householders, farm their own lands. The established religion is
                    Lutheran, and the number of parochial clergymen in Sweden is 1094, besides 170
                    prebends, eleven bishops, and one archbishop; and the tithes amount to 283,232
                    spans, or about 72,500 quarters of corn. Norway has 467 clergymen, including
                    five bishops. (Crome, 96, 116; Thomson’s <hi rend="italic">Travels,</hi>
                    418.)</p>
                <p>Subsequent to the revolution in 1809, some improvements have been made in the
                    constitution, by enlarging the powers of the diet. The four estates of nobles,
                    clergy, burghers, and peasants, who sit in separate houses, meet necessarily at
                    the end of five years, or oftener if convoked by the king. The consent of three
                    of these houses, with that of the king, gives a proposition the force of law. No
                    taxes can be raised without the authority of the diet, and the persons of the
                    members are inviolable during the session. The conscription, which was
                    introduced in 1809, subjects all males between twenty and twenty-five to
                    military service; and the nobles have been deprived of the exemption they
                    formerly enjoyed from this service and from taxes. The press is declared by the
                    constitution to be free, but is in fact under the control of the police.</p>
                <p>In 1809, Sweden lost hinland, Lapmark, and Pomerania, containing 1,015,000
                    inhabitants, upon a surface of 121,000 square miles. In 1813, she gained Norway
                    from Denmark, with 950,000 inhabitants. This acquisition gave her a better
                    frontier and a more compact territory, and was more than a compensation for her
                    previous losses.</p>
                <p>Spain.</p>
                <p>The vast natural resources of this country present a striking contrast with its
                    political imbecility. It is near-Iy as large as France, but contains little more
                    than a third of the population, though its fertile soil and delicious climate
                    yield in abundance the productions both of the temperate and warm regions of the
                    globe. With its great extent of sea-coast, numerous rivers, and excellent
                    position for trade, and its rich and extensive colonies, nothing but extreme
                    misgovernment could have prevented it from becoming the first commercial state
                    in the world.</p>
                <p>In addition to silk, tobacco, vines, olives, and all the agricultural productions
                    of France and Germany, Spain produces the orange, citron, sugar-cane, cork-tree,
                    dates, figs, and cotton. Wheat is the grain most extensively cultivated. Barley
                    and rye are next in quantity. Very few oats or potatoes are raised, but
                    considerable quantities of maize and rice. Hemp to the value of a million of
                    piastres is raised yearly, and flax is cultivated on a smaller scale. The
                    vineyards, besides supplying the internal consumption, furnish 10,000,000 or
                    11,000,000 gallons of wine for exportation, and half as much brandy. Olive oil
                    is exported to the value of L.600,000 a year. The annual produce of raw silk is
                    valued at L.300,000. But wool is the produce for which Spain is most celebrated.
                    The number of merinos or migratory sheep, which furnish the finest wool, is
                    estimated at 5,000,000; those that are stationary, at 8,000,000; and these
                    13,000,000 of sheep are supposed to afford yearly 45,000,000 pounds of wool. The
                    right of pasture which the migratory flocks have over whole provinces is one
                    great obstacle to agricultural improvement. From this and other causes, one
                    third or one half of the kingdom is left entirely waste, and the part in
                    cultivation is wretchedly managed. Nearly the whole land in the kingdom is
                    locked up by entails in the hands of the nobles and the clergy, and the small
                    portions brought into the market sell so high as not to afford more than one
                    andahalf per cent, upon their price. Agriculture is entirely in the hands of the
                    peasantry, who are poor and ignorant; men of capital never engage in it; and the
                    grandees, who should support and encourage improvements, all reside in the large
                    towns. In the whole of Spain there is scarcely to be seen a villa or gentleman’s
                    seat, except a few that are in ruins. The mines of Spain, like her agriculture,
                    are neglected; but she still derives from her own soil a considerable supply of
                    iron, copper, lead, and mercury. About 5,000,000 centners of salt are annually
                    obtained from mines, springs, or the sea.</p>
                <p>The greatest number of the Spanish manufactures are in Catalonia, but a few are
                    scattered through the other provinces. The most considerable are the woollen,
                    silk, linen, cotton, hemp, leather, paper, and metal; but none of them are
                    sufficient for the internal consumption of the country, and all of them are
                    fettered by vexatious taxes, absurd regulations, and the difficulty of
                    intercourse between the provinces. The manufacture of tobacco is a royal
                    monopoly.</p>
                <p>It is now pretty well ascertained, that the apparent decline of Spain has been
                    the consequence of the rapid progress of her neighbours; and that, down to the
                    end of the eighteenth century, she was advancing both in industry and
                    population. From a combination of circumstances, the causes which check the
                    progress of society have operated more powerfully there than in any other
                    country of Europe except Turkey. Among the greatest evils in the state of the
                    country may be reckoned the excessive number of the nobility and clergy, with
                    their oppressive privileges, and their pernicious influence upon the other
                    classes. In 1788, when the population amounted to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193750705" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0705-0419"/>10 500,000, the number of the
                    secular and regular clergy was 147,722, of the nobles 478,716, of peasants and
                    labourers 1,847,010, of manufacturers and handicrafts 302,000, servants 276,090,
                    merchants 34,030.</p>
                <p>Germany.</p>
                <p>In the early part of the eighteenth century, Germany consisted of about three
                    hundred sovereign states, great and small, which were united into one empire by
                    a very complicated constitution. From time to time some of the smaller
                    principalities have been suppressed, and incorporated with the larger states:
                    but the first radical change in the composition of the Germanic body was made by
                    the treaty ofLuneville, 9th February 1801, when a vast number of bishoprics,
                    abbeys, and free towns, were deprived of their rights of sovereignty, and given
                    as indemnities to princes who had lost their possessions in Belgium and Italy by
                    the French conquests. In 1806 the emperor Francis formally renounced the dignity
                    of head of the empire; the ancient constitution of the empire was dissolved, and
                    a new league formed, with France at its head (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Confederation of the Rhine),</hi> comprehending the most considerable states in
                    the south, to which those in the north were afterwards added. This confederation
                    fell to pieces on the overthrow of the French power in 1813, but it has served
                    as the foundation of the new constitution of the Germanic body. The number of
                    states is now reduced to thirty-nine, including Austria, Prussia, Denmark, and
                    the Netherlands; but these four powers rank as members only for a part of their
                    dominions. The ecclesiastical principalities are entirely abolished; and the
                    free towns, of which there were forty-seven or more in 1800, are now reduced to
                    four. The princes who have lost their sovereignty have been reduced to the rank
                    of nobles, and, no longer holding immediately of the empire, are said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">mediatised.</hi> The titles of royalty conferred by Bonaparte upon
                    Bavaria, Wirtemberg, and Saxony, have been confirmed, and Hanover has since been
                    raised to the same rank. The common concerns of this confederacy are managed by
                    a diet, consisting of deputies from thirty-eight states (Hesse Homberg having no
                    vote), who meet at Frankfort. The pecuniary contributions, fixed in proportion
                    to the population of each state, are voted for a period of five years. lhe
                    military contingents, which are regulated on the same principle, amount to
                    120,000 men in time of peace, and 301,000 in time of war, the latter being at
                    the rate of one in the hundred of the population. The German states, including
                    two sevenths of Austria, four sevenths of Prussia, besides Holstein and
                    Luxemburg, embrace an area of about 237,000 English square miles, with
                    32,000,000 inhabitants; of whom about one half are Catholics; two fifths
                    Lutherans; the rest Reformed, Moravians, Greeks, and Jews. The new Germanic
                    constitution, though less complicated than the old, can scarcely be expected to
                    produce any of the effects of a solid union in such a heterogeneous mass. The
                    states are too unequal in strength to have a proper reciprocal influence; and
                    there is not weight enough in the minor members to control the rival interests
                    and jealousies of Austria and Prussia. The confederation may be considered as
                    recognising, and in some degree regulating, the influence which the great est
                    states must necessarily exercise indirectly over the smaller. <hi

                <p>The political arrangement of the states of Europe established by the peace of
                    1815, has since undergone three material alterations. The Greeks rose in arms
                    against the Porte in 1821, and after a struggle of nine years, the independence
                    of their country was acknowledged by the sultan in February 1830. The new state
                    comprises the Morea, Livadia, Negropont, the Cyclades, with one or two other
                    islands, and contains a population, according to Balbi, of only 600,000 souls.
                    Otho, second son of the king of Bavaria, was appointed king of Greece in
                    1832.</p>
                <p>The mutual antipathy which had long existed between the Dutch and Belgians broke
                    out on the part of the latter into a revolutionary movement, which commenced in
                    Brussels in August 1830, and in a few months spread over all Belgium. The
                    independence of the latter country has since been acknowledged by nearly all the
                    great powers; and Prince Leopold of Saxe Cobourg was chosen king in 1831 by an
                    assembly of the representatives of the people.</p>
                <p>The third change has been already noticed, the incorporation of Poland with
                    Russia in February 1832.</p>
                <p>The following statistical table of Europe is part of a larger one published at
                    Paris by Adrien Balbi in 1828, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Balance
                    Politique du Globe.</hi> He has reprinted it in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abrégé</hi><hi rend="italic">de la</hi><hi rend="italic">Geographie,</hi>
                    published in 1833, with very few alterations except the insertion of the new
                    states since recognised, namely, Greece and Belgium. It refers to the years
                    1826-27, his object being not to give the most recent accounts for each state,
                    which must have varied according to the varying dates of our information, but to
                    exhibit the contemporaneous condition of all the states at one common era, for
                    the purpose of comparison. It presents the most correct view of the statistics
                    of Europe within our reach; and what we have mentioned as to the author’s mode
                    of compiling it, and his object, will explain the discrepancies between it and
                    some of our previous statements.</p>
