                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    >Pamphilus,</hi> a celebrated bishop of Caesarea, in Palestine, and one of the
                    most illustrious men of the Christian church, was born in Palestine, towards the
                    close of the reign of Gallienus, about the year 267 of our era. He was the
                    intimate friend of Pamphilus, who suffered martyrdom under Diocletian in 309,
                    and, after his death, took his name in honour of his memory. He was ordained
                    bishop of Caesarea in 313. He had a considerable share in the contest relating
                    to Arius, whose cause he, as well as several other bishops of Palestine,
                    defended, being persuaded that Arius had been unjustly persecuted by Alexander,
                    bishop of Alexandria. He assisted at the council of Nice in 325, when he made a
                    speech to the emperor Constantine on his coming to the council, and was placed
                    next to him on his right hand. In 330 he was present at the council of Antioch,
                    in which Eustathius, bishop of that city, was unjustly deposed; but though he
                    was chosen by the bishop and people of Antioch to succeed that prelate, he
                    absolutely refused. In 334 he assisted at the councils of Caesarea and of Tyre,
                    by which Athanasius was condemned; and he was present at the assembly of bishops
                    at Jerusalem during the dedication of the church in that city. By these bishops
                    he was sent to the emperor Constantine to defend what they had done against
                    Athanasius; when he pronounced the panegyric composed on. that emperor during
                    the public rejoicings in the beginning of the thirtieth year of his reign.
                    Eusebius survived the emperor but a short time, and died in 338. Ecclesiastical
                    writers, ancient and modern, are much divided in opinion respecting Eusebius.
                    Several have defended him with warmth, in which number are Sozomenes, Socrates,
                    Victorius, and some others. St Jerome, on the other hand, calls him the prince
                    of Arians, Photius accuses him, the seventh council condemns him, and this
                    opinion is generally followed by the moderns. The successor of Eusebius was
                    Acacius, surnamed the One-eyed, a man not less learned or less eloquent, and
                    more enterprising, than his master. Eusebius composed in Greek a multitude of
                    works filled with eloquence and erudition; and those which have reached us,
                    whilst they justify the high reputation of the author, cannot fail to occasion
                    regret that so many have perished. He wrote, 1. the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apology</hi> or Defence <hi rend="italic">of Origen,</hi> in six books; 2. a

                    rend="italic">Concordance of the Four Evangelists.</hi> It appears also that he
                    wrote a <hi rend="italic">Cornmentary on the first Epistle to the
                    Corinthians,</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Accomplishment of the
                    Predictions of Jesus Christ.</hi> The greater number of his works, however, is
                    only known by the testimony of St Jerome, who makes frequent mention of them,
                    cites fragments of them, and appears to have used them very freely in the
                    composition of his own works. Of those which have come down to us, the most
                    considerable is the <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History,</hi> which has
                    been translated into Latin by Rufinus, by Musculus, and by Christopherson. The
                    version of the last-mentioned translator, printed opposite the Greek text,
                    appeared in 1612. This work of Eusebius is of the greatest utility in reference
                    to the history of the Christian church during the first three centuries, and it
                    has earned for its author the honourable title of Father of Ecclesiastical
                    History. In his <hi rend="italic">Chronicle,</hi> which contains the principal
                    actions of great men, and the history of discovery in the arts, Eusebius is
                    supposed to have availed himself of the Chronology composed a century before by
                    Julius Africanus. St Jerome translated the Chronicle into Latin, and continued
                    it till the sixth consulate of Valens and Valentinian. The four books of the
                    Life of Constantine have been printed with the Ecclesiastical History, and
                    translated into French by Cousin. The ten books which remain of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Preparatio Evangelica</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Demonstratio</hi> were published at Paris in 1627, with the versions of Donatus
                    and Vigerus, to which was subjoined the Treatise against Hierocles. It is in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Demonstratio</hi> that the invaluable fragment on
                    Sanctification is contained. The Topography of the Holy Land, which St Jerome
                    translated into Latin, was published in Greek by Bonfrère in 1631: it is also
                    found in several editions of the works of St Jerome. The Commentary on the
                    Psalms was published by Montfaucon; the <hi rend="italic">Opuscula</hi> in Latin
                    by Sirmond; the Letter to Caspianus and the Canons for a Concordance <pb

                    the edition of the Greek New Testament, by Robert Estienne, 1550; the Notes on
                    the Canticles by Meursius; and the fragments on the Lives of the Prophets by
                    Curlerius, in his <hi rend="italic">Commentaries of Procopius on
