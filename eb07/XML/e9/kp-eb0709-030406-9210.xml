                <p><label type="entry">EPHESUS</label>, the chief city of Ionia, in Asia Minor, on
                    the south side, and near the mouth of the river Cayster (now called Kutchuc
                    Mendeι⅞, or Lesser Maeander), was 320 stadia, or forty miles, to the south of
                    Smyrna, and 540, or three days’ journey, from Sardis, the capital of Lydia. It
                    was situated at the extremity of a rich and beautiful plain, called Campus
                    Cilbianus, through which the river flowed, and which still retains its former
                    character, after centuries of Turkish oppression. Ephesus was originally founded
                    by the Leleges and Carians, who were compelled to make way for an Ionian colony
                    led by Androclus, son of Codrus. The inhabitants continued to be distributed
                    over the neighbouring district until the reign of Croesus (560 to 546 B. c.),
                    when, being attacked by that prince, they are said to have dedicated their city
                    to Diana, by fastening a rope from their walls to the temple of the goddess.
                    They gradually deserted the ancient site, and approached the position of the
                    sacred temple, where they are said to have continued until the time of Alexander
                    the Great (330 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.).</hi> Lysimachus having obtained
                    possession of the city (302 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.),</hi> compelled the
                    inhabitants, by inundating the ancient site, to remove higher up to a spot which
                    he surrounded with walls. We find that it was delivered over to the kings of
                    Pergamus by the Romans, after the defeat of Antiochus (190 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.</hi> c.); and, amidst all the changes of government which subsequently took
                    place, Ephesus continued to increase in riches and prosperity, being in the time
                    of Strabo (24 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.)</hi> the emporium of Asia. It was
                    considered by the Romans as the first of the three chief cities of Asia, the two
                    others being Smyrna and Pergamus; and in the later divisions of the country
                    under the Christian emperors, we are told by Hierocles that it was the capital
                    of the important provinces of Asia. Ephesus was lost to the empire at an earlier
                    period than the other parts of Western Asia. Some time before the commencement
                    of the Crusades (1096 <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.),</hi> a chief of the Saracens
                    made himself master of Ephesus; but the crusaders restored it to its ancient
                    master. In the fourteenth century it fell into the hands of a prince of
                    Caramania named Sasan; and from this time it ceased to belong to the Greek
                    empire. It still, however, continued to exist down even to the time of Timur or
                    Tamerlane (1370 <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.),</hi> who for a considerable period
                    had a camp under its walls, and who is supposed to have destroyed it, as he did
                    many other cities.</p>
                <p>Ephesus was more particularly celebrated on account of the temple of Diana,
                    which, according to Pausanias, ex∙ ĩsted even before the arrival of the Ionians.
                    Its architect was Cbersiphron of Cnossus, in Crete, assisted by his son
                    Metagenes; and as the ground on which the temple Was erected was marshy, it is
                    said that he obtained a firm foundation by means of heaps of charcoal and wool,
                    packed closely together in sacks. It was the only temple in Asia which escaped
                    the doom pronounced against them by Xerxes on his return from Greece (480 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c.); but it was burnt to the ground 356 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> by a madman named Eratostratus, who is said to have
                    taken this method of immortalizing his name. This event took place the very
                    night on which Alexander the Great was born; and the temple seems to have
                    remained in ruins till that monarch offered to restore it, on condition that he
                    should be declared the founder. This proposal, however, the Ephesians declined
                    to accept, cunningly soothing the wounded vanity of the hero by saying, “that it
                    was beneath the dignity of one god to erect a temple to another.” Having
                    collected sufficient funds amongst themselves and their neighbours, they
                    entrusted its restoration to the architect Dinocrates, who is reported to have
                    conceived the extravagant project of forming a statue of Alexander out of Mount
                    Athos. The new edifice was much larger, and constructed with more magnificence,
                    than the original temple. It was 425 feet in length and 220 in breadth, with 227
                    pillars, each 60 feet in height. It is said to have been of the Ionic order of
                    architecture. The interior was adorned with numerous pieces of sculpture by the
                    celebrated Praxiteles. Thraso and Scopas were also e±- ployed in its decoration;
                    and there was a picture in it by the celebrated Apelles. The statue of the
                    goddess was more particularly the object of veneration, having been preserved in
                    safety amidst all the vicissitudes to which the temple and city had been
                    exposed. It was of wood, and, according to Pliny, was covered with some unctuous
                    substance, to guard it from decay. The service of the temple was performed by
                    priests called Megabyzae, who were eunuchs, and to whom were added a number of
                    priestesses. The temple was an asylum for criminals of every description.
                    Alexander extended the privilege to a stadium round the edifice; Mithridates
                    fixed it at a bow-shot; and Antony doubled the distance, so that it included
                    part of the town. It may easily be conceived that such a privilege must have
                    been liable to great abuses; and in fact it became at last so dangerous to the
                    peace of the city, that Augustus caused it to be abolished. It was seven stadia,
                    or about an English mile, from the walls of the city; but no modern traveller
                    seems yet to have discovered its remains. Pococke has indeed given a ground plan
                    of what he considered as the temple; but his description by no means agrees with
                    w hat is related of the seventh wonder of the world.</p>
                <p>The ruins of Ephesus are seen half a mile from the Turkish village of <hi
                    rend="italic">Aiasluk,</hi> which seems to have risen about the middle of the
                    fourteenth century. Chandler thus speaks of its present appearance: “Ephesus was
                    situated by the mountains which are the southern boundary of the plain, and
                    comprehended within its walls a portion of Mount Prion and of Corissus. Mount
                    Prion is a circular hill; Corissus a single lofty ridge, extending northward
                    from near Mount Pactyas, and approaching Prion, then making an elbow, and
                    running westerly ţ°‘ wards the sea. We entered Ephesus from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aiasluk</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">¶</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">*·</hi> Mount Prion, and the
                    exterior lateral wall of a stadium which fronted the sea, on our left hand. We
                    measured the area, and found it 687 feet long. The vestiges of the theatre
                    alluded to in the Acts of the Apostle⅛ which was very capacious, are farther on
                    in the side <pb break="no" facs="nls:193749223" xml:id="kp-eb0709-9223-0305"
                    />the same mountain. Going on from the theatre, you come ,to a narrow valley
                    which divides Mount Prion from Co-irissus. Within the valley you find broken
                    columns and pieces of marble, with vestiges of an odeum in the slope jf Prion.
                    Beyond the odeum the valley opens gradually into the plain of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aiasluh.</hi> Keeping round by Prion, you meet with vestiges of buildings, and
                    come to the remains of a large edifice. This was the gymnasium. The street at
                    the entrance of the city from <hi rend="italic">Aiasluk</hi> was nearly of the
                    <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> ength of the stadium. The opposite side was
                    composed of edifices equally ample and noble. The way was between a double
                    colonnade, as ŵe conjectured, from the many pedestals and bases of columns
                    scattered there. This street was covered by one leading from the plain to the
                    valley. It had on the left the front of the stadium, and the theatre with the
                    porticoadjoining. On the right are ample substructures, with pieces of massive
                    wall. These remains reach as far as the portico and have behind them a morass,
                    once the city port. The extent of the city towards the plain, on which side it
                    was washed by the Cayster, cannot now be ascertained; but the mountainous region
                    has preserved its boundary, the wall erected by Lysimachus, which is of
                    excellent masonry. Near the entrance of Ephesus from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aiasluk</hi> are the vaults of several sepulchres, and others along the slope
                    of Corissus show that the Ephesians buried likewise within the city.” <hi
