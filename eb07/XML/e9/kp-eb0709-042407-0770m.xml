                <p><label type="entry">EVAPORATION</label> is that process by which liquids and
                    solids gradually assume the gaseous form, or by which, in certain circumstances,
                    an invisible vapour or gas is continually detached from the surface of water,
                    and perhaps of every other liquid, as also from the surfaces of many, if I not
                    every solid. From this process being generally found to lower the temperature of
                    the evaporating body, an effect which might have been expected from the doctrine
                    of latent heat, it is probable that heat enters largely into the constitution of
                    every vapour, and is therefore supposed to be the principal agent. At a given
                    temperature, a cubic foot or other determinate space, incumbent over a i liquid,
                    cannot contain above a certain quantity of the same kind of vapour; and when it
                    contains that maximum, it is said to be saturated. If, therefore, after this is
                    the case, an additional vapour continue to be thrown off, it must either fall
                    back immediately into the liquid, or, if slightly cooled, may apparently remain
                    suspended in the visible form of a cloud, which, however, is not properly
                    vapour, but minute drops, formed by the cooling of it, and which successively
                    fall back into the liquid. For evaporation continues to go on under the pressure
                    of air or other gas, however dense, but ceases in the presence of any gas,
                    however rare, if already saturated with the same vapour, unless such gas be
                    colder than the evaporating body; m which case, however, the vapour being partly
                    condensed into drops, becomes cloudy, as was just mentioned; and sometimes
                    liquids, while in the act of ebullition, which is rather an extreme case of
                    evaporation, throw up small drops, which may be seen alternately rising and
                    falling m the vapour. Such is a summary of a few of the leading facts, several
                    of which we shall have occasion to touch on more fully, along with other
                    particulars, whilst briefly noticing, as we shall now do, some steps in the
                    history o this inquiry, before proceeding farther.</p>
                <p>The spontaneous disappearance of water, and the drying of humid bodies, or the
                    tendency which moisture has to escape from them and diffuse itself in the
                    atmosphere, an afterwards to descend as rain, snow, dew, &amp;c. must have been
                    familiar to mankind in every age, condition, or climate; but any thing like an
                    approach to a rational explanation<pb break="no" facs="nls:193750783"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-0783-0425"/> of the facts seems to be of very modern date.
                    Some of the ancients, particularly Aristotle, conjectured that fire was
                    concerned in the process; but such of their notions as have come down to us are
                    so little to the purpose, that they need not now be dwelt upon. Halley supposed
                    that aqueous vapour consisted of small hollow spherules, filled with something
                    so very light, that they readily ascended and floated in the air,—a theory not
                    altogether such as might have been expected from the known sagacity of its
                    author; for, though Descartes seems to have hinted at the same thing long
                    before, it scarcely appears to have had the least shade of truth in it. But so
                    completely was Kratzenstein’s imagination filled with this doctrine, that he
                    fancied he could see these vesicles with a spicroscope, and even discern them to
                    be hollow, notwithstanding their being supposed to form a transparent vapour. If
                    he really saw any thing, it was more probably minute drops of water descending
                    in the air. Nay, almost up to the close of the last century, we find many
                    eminent men, and among these the late able mathematician Mr George Atwood,
                    maintaining and speculating on this vesicular theory, as it was called. Halley,
                    it is true, hinted at another theory, which not a few embraced, and for which
                    some have still a predilection, namely, that air holds moisture united to it by
                    chemical solution or affinity; but the first idea of this seems to be due to
                    Hooke. A different explanation was attempted by Desaguliers, who, after pointing
                    out the defects of former theories, showed that water is capable of being
                    converted into a transparent elastic fluid, which he supposed to be many times
                    fighter than air, and that it could therefore ascend and float in the
                    atmosphere; but he some time afterwards inclined to ascribe the ascent of vapour
                    to an electrical attraction of the air. Desaguliers was no doubt greatly
                    mistaken regarding the specific gravity of steam, which, under the same pressure
                    and temperature, is now known only to fall short of that of air in the ratio of
                    five to eight; but he was perhaps the first who thought of identifying pure
                    steam with the attenuated aqueous vapour diffused in the atmosphere. It would
                    seem that prior to Desaguliers advancing this notion, it was not known that
                    steam is always generated in a transparent state, although minute drops of water
                    maybe passing or falling through it; and indeed some are scarcely aware of this
                    at the present day. The fact is, that steam or aqueous vapour preserves its
                    transparency so long as it has neither lost heat nor had its volume enlarged;
                    but so soon as its temperature is lowered, whether from losing heat or from
                    enlargement of volume, it is more or less condensed into minute drops of water,
                    which of course render it opaque. For we can on no account admit the very
                    generally received doctrine of Μ. Clement, that equal weights of steam, if in
                    contact with water, contain equal quantities of heat, whatever be .their volumes
                    or temperatures. On the contrary, we cannot help believing that a given weight
                    of steam requires more heat to maintain it in the transparent elastic form, when
                    under a greater volume, than under a less; and in proof of this, we presume it
                    is only necessary to adduce the following fact. If we open a stop-cock in the
                    cover of a boiler when the pressure is only one atmosphere, the steam which
                    issues preserves its transparency till it get to some distance from the orifice;
                    but when the pressure within amounts to two or three atmospheres, the steam, ļ£
                    allowed to issue freely, is opaque from the very orifice. This clearly shows
                    that the same quantity of heat (we do not mean temperature) which had been amply
                    sufficient to maintain the steam in the transparent form under a smaller volume
                    within the boiler, is quite inadequate to do so when the steam is allowed to
                    enlarge its volume under a reduced pressure. A more capable or satisfactory
                    proof than this, which has been long before the public, is scarcely to be
                    wished; yet we find Dr Lardner not long ago reading a paper to the Royal Society
                    on the heat of steam, and which has for its foundation the untenable theory of
                    Clement. Indeed M. Clement’s mode of experimenting was so fallacious, that it
                    would have given him the same results whether his theory had been true or not.
                    For when the stream of steam is very small, and of course passes through the
                    stop-cock with difficulty, as it must have done in his experiments, it has,
                    while in the act of dilating from under a force of two or three to, that of one
                    atmosphere, the opportunity of absorbing heat from the metal of the scarcely
                    open stop-cock, then much hotter than 212°, the temperature to which the
                    dilating is supposed to reduce the steam. No wonder then that equal weights of
                    steam, at first so different in density, should, when received in equal
                    quantities of cold water, produce equal rises of temperature; as is pointed out
                    more particularly in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine</hi> for July
                    1826, p.38. It is likewise to be remembered, that though in the other experiment
                    the steam must have been absorbing some little heat from the stop-cock, this did
                    not enable it to preserve the transparent form. We have been the more particular
                    in clearing up this point, because we shall shortly have occasion to refer to
                    it.</p>
                <p>From the time of Halley and Desaguliers to about 1770, a variety of essays on
                    evaporation made their appearance, which, however, tended but little towards
                    elucidating the subject, because they were either not founded on experiments at
                    all, or on such as were not sufficiently elementary. Some of these sought to
                    establish the vesicular system, while others advocated that of chemical solution
                    and electrical attraction. At length, in 1783, came forth the well known <hi
                    rend="italic">Essais sur l’Hygrométrie</hi> of Μ. de Saussure, who, though he
                    did not labour so much to establish new theories as to blend together or combine
                    some of those already mentioned, certainly added considerably to the stock of
                    facts. But he at the same time greatly indulged his fancy in supposing aqueous
                    vapour to be capable of existing in four different forms. When it alone occupied
                    a space, he called it <hi rend="italic">pure elastic vapour</hi>; when diffused
                    in a transparent state in the air, he named it <hi rend="italic">dissolved
                    elastic vapour,</hi> imagining it to be chemically dissolved by the air; but
                    after the air was quite saturated with this sort, he thought some of it assumed
                    the form of <hi rend="italic">vesicular vapour,</hi> only differing from that of
                    Halley in being visible. To these he added <hi rend="italic">concrete
                    vapour,</hi> which consisted of liquid drops, such as form clouds and fogs; a
                    real form of moisture to be sure, but one which is not properly vapour at all.
                    In these <hi rend="italic">Essais</hi> we have an account of a variety of
                    experiments, most of them having the advantage of being executed on a great
                    scale; but, on the other hand, they were often deficient in that elementary
                    simplicity which is so important in a research of this nature, if we would avoid
                    sources of fallacy. By inclosing a known weight of caustic alkali in a very
                    large glass balloon, previously filled with thoroughly damp air, Saussure
                    endeavoured to find what quantity of moisture this air contained, from the
                    increase of weight which it communicated to the alkali; and conversely, by
                    weighing a bit of wet linen, and suspending it in the balloon filled with dry
                    air, he estimated how much moisture had evaporated from the linen to render the
                    air thoroughly damp. These two methods not only gave him nearly the same result,
                    but did so whether he used air hydrogen or carbonic acid in the balloon, and
                    even when he employed a mixture of these gases. During these experiments he also
                    observed, by means of a gauge, what change of pressure took place within the
                    balloon from the change of humidity. .</p>
                <p>By operating at different temperatures, he obtained results<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193750796" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0796-0426"/> from which different
                    conclusions might be drawn to suit different theories; for instance, that the
                    quantity of vapour which could exist in the balloon varied in geometrical
                    progression for equal intervals of temperature, and nearly as the square root of
                    the air’s density; and that air of the ordinary density could contain five times
                    as much vapour as a vacuum did; all of which conclusions are now known to be
                    incorrect. Prior to this, Lambert had, from his experiments, drawn a very
                    different but still more erroneous conclusion, that the quantity of moisture
                    varied as the <hi rend="italic">square</hi> of the air’s density.</p>
                <p>It was natural to think that the great discordance between the results of these
                    celebrated philosophers should have raised doubts whether they might not both
                    have deceived themselves by too complex a mode of operating, and, therefore,
                    that neither of them was likely to be correct. Accordingly we find Μ. Deluc, in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Idées sur</hi><hi rend="italic">la</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Meteorologie,</hi> hinting at an incomparably more simple theory, which he
                    afterwards developed more fully in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions</hi> for 1792, viz. that the quantity of vapour which can exist in
                    a given space depends upon the temperature alone, and is independent of the
                    presence or density of air, or of any other elastic fluid with which the vapour
                    forms no chemical combination, being the same as if nothing but the vapour
                    occupied that space. In this speculation he also maintained, as Desaguliers had
                    done, that pure steam and the attenuated aqueous vapour diffused in the air are
                    the same. Something similar to this theory was advanced by Μ. Pictet in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Essai sur le</hi><hi rend="italic">Feu,</hi> and still more so by
                    Dr Dalton in his <hi rend="italic">Meteorological Essays ∙,</hi> and it is not
                    improbable that each might have hit upon the same theory before knowing what the
                    others had done. By inclosing his hygrometer along with a little water under a
                    receiver, Delue found that the indications of that instrument were the same
                    whatever was the density of the included air, or however much he exhausted it;
                    and the same thing held true with other gases. Volta, likewise, from a great
                    variety of experiments, was led to acquiesce in the theory of Deluc.</p>
                <p>The theory was farther investigated, in a much more elementary way, by Dr Dalton,
                    as detailed in the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Memoirs,</hi> vol. V.; but
                    preparatory to noticing it, we shall subjoin his manner of expressing himself on
                    the subject in his <hi rend="italic">Essays,</hi> p. 201, where, from certain
                    experiments and observations, he infers “that the vapour of water, and probably
                    of most other liquids, exists at all temperatures in the atmosphere, and is
                    capable of bearing any known degree of cold without a total condensation, and
                    that the vapour so existing is one and the same thing as <hi rend="italic"
                    >steam</hi> or vapour of 212° or upwards. The idea, therefore, that vapour
                    cannot exist in the open atmosphere at a lower temperature than 212°, unless
                    chemically combined therewith, I consider as erroneous; it has taken its rise
                    from a supposition that <hi rend="italic">air</hi> pressing upon vapour
                    condenses the vapour equally with <hi rend="italic">vapour</hi> pressing upon
                    vapour; a supposition we have no right to assume, and which, I apprehend, will
                    plainly appear to be contradictory to reason and unwarranted by facts; for when
                    a particle of vapour exists between two particles of air, let their equal and
                    opposite pressures upon it be what they may, they cannot bring it nearer to
                    another particle of vapour, without which no condensation can take place, all
                    other circumstances being the same; and it has never been proved that the vapour
                    in a receiver from which the air has been exhausted is precipitated upon the
                    admission of perfectly dry air. Hence, then, we conclude, till the contrary can
                    be proved, that the condensation of vapour exposed to the common air does not in
                    any manner depend upon the pressure of the air.” The method which Dr Dalton took
                    to clear up this question is distinguished by an elegant simplicity. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">first</hi> place, he determined by experiment the expansive force
                    of dry air for each degree of temperature between 32° and 212°; and was the
                    first who did so with any thing like accuracy. He at same time found that 1000
                    cubic inches of air at 32° expanded to 1376 on being heated to 212°, which comes
                    surprisingly near 1375, the result published by Μ. Gay Lussac shortly after. But
                    through some inadvertency Dr Lardner (on Heat, p. 57) makes Dr Dalton’s result
                    1325, and then gravely adds, that “the latter (Gay Lussac’s) determination has
                    been proved by subsequent experiments to be the more correct.” <hi rend="italic"
                    >Secondly,</hi> Dr Dalton ascertained the force of pure steam in contact with
                    water for each degree throughout the same range; and, <hi rend="italic"
                    >thirdly,</hi> he found at what rate dry air expanded, when put in contact with
                    water, and then heated through the various degrees of that range. The result
                    was, that at any particular temperature, the expansive force of dry air in the
                    first case, added to the force of vapour in the second, was exactly equal to
                    their joint expansive force in the third. From this it is obvious that there is
                    either no chemical combination between the air and vapour, or that such
                    combination, if it exist, is quite inert, or goes for nothing so far as this
                    research is concerned. Dr Dalton found, that when other gases were substituted
                    for air, the vapour gave the same results; and similar results were obtained
                    when other vapours were treated as steam. Μ. Desormes, likewise, by; operating
                    in a manner very different from that of Dr Dalton, found the quantity of vapour
                    to be independent of the presence of air or other gases. The question was also
                    examined experimentally by Μ. Gay Lussac, with his well-known accuracy and
                    ability, and his results precisely agreed with those of Dr Dalton. Still more
                    recently Professor Daniell has made a great variety of interesting experiments
                    on mixtures of gases and vapours, in a manner similar to that employed by Deluc,
                    but with the help of an incomparably better hygrometer; and his researches, too,
                    corroborate the theory completely.</p>
                <p>Several objections have been made to this theory; but all of them with which we
                    are acquainted are so nugatory and irrelevant that we do not think they require
                    any refutation. There is, however, a point which the foes as well as the friends
                    of the theory have taken for granted, and which, though extremely probable, it
                    would, for any thing we can see, he very difficult to prove in a direct and
                    unexceptionable manner; viz. that the expenditure of heat in forming a given
                    weight of vapour is the same, whether the process take place in air or other
                    gas, or in a vacuum. Since in most combinations heat is given out, it is a
                    wonder that those who contend for the solution of vapours in gases have not
                    founded some objection on this; for we presume it is the only point on which a
                    doubt could be palmed respecting the theory. It is generally taken for granted
                    too, that the expenditure of heat in forming a given weight of vapour is the
                    same at every temperature; but this assumption we cannot help regarding as very
                    erroneous, because to us it appears quite clear that the expense of heat is
                    greater when the vapour is rarer; and this we maintain for the following reason.
                    The density of steam at 212°, for instance, is about 109 times greater than at
                    32° Fahrenheit; and we have already seen that steam loses in a considerable
                    degree the elastic form by being dilated to two or three times its bulk; how
                    much more then if dilated 109 times? Hence steam rarefied to such a degree would
                    need a large addition of heat to enable it to maintain the gaseous form; in
                    other words, much more heat must be expended or become latent in forming a given
                    weight of vapour at 32° than at 212°. If steam, when kept separate from water,
                    have its temperature raised by compression at the same rate as air has, it might
                    be shown that the expense of heat in forming vapour at 32° would be to that at
                    212° as thirteen to eight nearly, that is, in the ratio of the logarithms of the
                    number of times the steam is rarer than water. See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Magazine</hi> for April 1832, page 246.</p>
                <p>Vapours and gases agree in so many of their properties, that there seems no doubt
                    of their being but one and the; same form of matter. Thus, so far as has been
                    examined, 'every vapour, when kept separate from any sensibly evaporating
                    liquid, expands by heat at the same rate as air and other gases do; and, like
                    gases too, it observes the law of Boyle, by having the force at a given
                    temperature proportional to the density. But since the density of a vapour in
                    contact with its generating liquid increases with the temperature, its force,
                    when so situated, increases much more rapidly than that of air or a mere gas
                    does. However, the precise law which connects the temperature with the density
                    or force seems to be as yet unknown. Dr Dalton having, as already mentioned,
                    ascertained by experiment the force of aqueous vapour between the temperatures
                    of 32° and 212°, deduced from the results what he considered to be the relation
                    between the force and temperature, and for some time it was supposed that by
                    means of it the force could be had for temperatures beyond both limits of that
                    range. Accordingly on this principle he constructed a table which extended from
                    — 40° F. up to 325°; and indeed he was pretty fortunate in the extension below
                    32°, because the half of it has since been so nearly confirmed by the very
                    accurate experiments of Μ. Gay Lussac, which were carried down almost to— 20°
                    <hi rend="italic">cent,</hi> or — 4° F.; but above 212° the supposed law was
                    soon found to give the force too small, and the more so as the temperature is
                    higher. Yet Dr Lardner, in his recent treatise on heat, gives this part of the
                    table expressly as the result of Dalton’s “accurate experiments,” and not as it
                    really was, a mere extension by means of a formula; nor does he warn us of its
                    erring almost two atmospheres at the upper extremity. It is likewise curious
                    that Dr Lardner, while he notices performances of far less merit, is totally
                    silent respecting the labours of the Committee of the Royal Academy of Sciences
                    at Paris in 1829; though they executed by far the most extensive and accurate
                    experiments that ever were made on steam at high temperatures, as will be found
                    detailed in the <hi rend="italic">Annales de Chimie</hi> for January 1830. All
                    the English abstracts from this which we have seen are very incorrect. Dr Dalton
                    has more recently published another table of the force of vapour adapted to some
                    of his theoretical views; but from its differing considerably from the results
                    of others, especially those of Gay Lussac, we do not consider it so correct for
                    low temperatures as his first one, part of which is given farther on in this
                    article.</p>
                <p>The method employed by Μ. Gay Lussac to determine experimentally the force of
                    vapour at low temperatures is particularly commendable, and yet its merits seem
                    to have been very much overlooked, even by those who were engaged in similar
                    researches. It may therefore be useful to give a brief account of it here. Other
                    philosophers had either not carried their experiments below 32° at all, or had
                    mismanaged the matter by allowing water to freeze in the tube in such a manner
                    as to obstruct the free motion of the mercury, and likewise to render its
                    altitude ill defined and difficult to be seen. These inconveniences were
                    dexterously avoided by Gay Lussac, who still employed a barometer tube, but one
                    so much longer than ordinary that a considerable part of it next the sealed end
                    was above the mercury, and a portion of this, being bent to about an angle of
                    60°, was immersed in a cold mixture along with a thermometer. The consequence of
                    this arrangement was, that neither the mercury nor the small portion of water on
                    its top necessarily required to be cooled down at all; because, however moderate
                    their temperature might be, the force of every portion of the included vapour
                    being in equilibrio with the force of that which touched the coldest part of the
                    tube, was just the same as if the whole vapour had been at the temperature of
                    the freezing mixture. A farther advantage was, that after the apparatus had been
                    allowed to remain for a short time in the state now described, the water
                    entirely disappeared from the top of the mercury, having been transferred by
                    evaporation or distillation to the sealed end of the tube, where it was quickly
                    frozen. By this means the mercury became almost as free from moisture as if none
                    had been in the tube. It is, besides, evident that this method could be carried
                    down, not only to and below the freezing point of mercury, but to any
                    temperature, however low, to which the extremity of the tube could be cooled;
                    and that it is applicable to every sort of vapour which does not act upon
                    mercury. In fine, Gay Lussac having placed a barometer tube filled with dry
                    mercury beside and in the same cistern with the one which contained both mercury
                    and moisture, read off the difference in the heights of their mercurial columns
                    with great precision, by means of a microscope which could be shifted up and
                    down a graduated pillar, and the difference was obviously the force of the
                    vapour. Although mercury evaporates at all temperatures, as appears from a bit
                    of gold-leaf becoming white if long suspended over it in a phial, and from the
                    noxious effects of breathing air which has been for some time in contact with a
                    large surface of mercury, yet the force of its vapour is so very small compared
                    with that of steam, that it could not sensibly affect these experiments. Indeed
                    it seems to be a general law, that the forces of vapours from liquids which have
                    high boiling points, are quite inappreciable at low temperatures.</p>
                <p>The most important problem connected with the evaporation of water is to
                    determine the rate at which, under certain circumstances, it escapes from a
                    given surface at a particular temperature. Many cases of this problem are still
                    very imperfectly solved. The experiments of Dr Halley, detailed in No. 189 of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> seem to be among the
                    earliest which were employed for this purpose. He found that water salted to the
                    state of sea water, and exposed to a heat equal to that of a summer’s day, did,
                    from a circular surface of eight inches diameter, evaporate at the rate of six
                    ounces in twenty-four hours. Hence he concludes, that a square degree of
                    sixty-nine miles will evaporate 33,000,000 tuns in a day; and supposing the
                    Mediterranean to contain 160 square degrees, it would evaporate 5,280,000,000
                    tuns daily. This quantity he considers sufficient to supply all the rains,
                    springs, dews, rivers, &amp;c. It would however be of little use to rehearse the
                    whole of this speculation, because the data, as we shall afterwards see, were
                    too loose, and the experiment was on too small a scale, for such a comparison.
                    Dr Lardner, in touching on this subject in his treatise on heat, says, that in
                    the Straits of Gibraltar, instead of an outward current, there is a rapid and
                    never-ceasing inward flow of water, and that he is therefore compelled to
                    conclude that the evaporation from the surface of this sea carries off the
                    enormous quantity of water supplied from this and other sources. Such doctrine
                    from so respectable a quarter rather surprises us; since it is quite well known
                    that, besides the inward current, which is principally in the middle of the
                    surface, there are generally outward currents, likewise at the surface, next the
                    coasts, particularly the south one, and most probably also in the immense deep
                    beneath. According to Professor Robison, the water sometimes flows outward, even
                    in the middle of the surface. Had there been no outward current, the
                    Mediterranean must long ago have become as salt as the brine of the Dead Sea; or
                    rather perhaps have become a rock of salt, as Dr Thomas Young remarked; for, as
                    we shall afterwards see, no common salt or other muriate rises from the sea by
                    evaporation. In <pb break="no" facs="nls:193750822" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0822-0428"
                    />order that the same degree of saltness may continue, the outward currents must
                    just bear away as much salt as the inward current and other sources supply, with
                    the very slight exception of what the wind carries off in the form of spray,
                    water spouts, &amp;c. The waters of the Mediterranean being, as is well known,
                    specifically heavier, especially at a great depth, than those of the Atlantic,
                    will naturally incline to buoy them up, and flow out beneath them in the
                    infathomable depth of the Straits.</p>
                <p>A series of experiments on the evaporation of water at natural temperatures was
                    continued for four years, beginning with 1772, by Dr Dobson, at Liverpool, as
                    detailed in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> vol. lxvii.
                    He took a cylindrical vessel twelve inches in diameter, and having nearly filled
                    it with water, exposed it beside his rain-gauge of the same aperture; and by
                    adding or withdrawing water, as occasion required, he kept the surface at nearly
                    the same height. By comparing the total quantities thus added or taken away with
                    the proceeds of the rain-gauge, the amount of evaporation was ascertained. The
                    mean monthly evaporation for the four years was, in January, 1∙5 inches;
                    February, 1∙77; March, 2∙64; April, 3*3; May, 4*34; June, 4∙41; July, 5T1;
                    August, 5∙01; September, 3 ’ 18; October, 2∙51; November, 1*51; December, 1*49.
                    In all, 36∙78 inches. The mean rain for the same time was 37∙48. For a great
                    deal more in this way, and on the evaporation of ice and snow, see Howard’s
                    excellent treatise on <hi rend="italic">The Climate of London.</hi> That ice and
                    snow evaporate, appears from their losing weight, or even disappearing
                    altogether, if long enough exposed to a brisk and dry wind during frost. But
                    sometimes snow is rendered so much colder by radiation than the incumbent still
                    air, that it condenses the vapour of that air into hoarfrost, and by that means
                    augments its own weight or bulk.</p>
                <p>But the experiments of Dr Dalton and Mr Hoyle, though rather of local
                    application, were no doubt far more accurate for evaporation from the soil.
                    Having got a cylindrical vessel three feet deep and ten inches in diameter,
                    two-pipes were joined to it, and turned downwards for the surplus rain-water to
                    run off into bottles; the one pipe being near the bottom, the other an inch from
                    the top. The vessel was filled up for a few inches with gravel and sand, and the
                    remainder with good fresh soil. It was then put into a hole in the ground, and
                    the space around filled up with earth, except on one side, for the convenience
                    of afterwards joining bottles to the pipes, and registering their contents. The
                    earth in the vessel was now saturated with moisture, by pouring in water till
                    some of it escaped from the pipes; and, lastly, the bottles were put to. During
                    the first year the soil was bare at top; but for the next two years it was
                    covered with grass, like any green field. A regular register was kept of the
                    rain-water which ran off through the upper pipe, and also of what sunk down
                    through the earth to the lower pipe. A rain-gauge of the same diameter was kept
                    close by, to register the quantity of rain for any corresponding time.</p>

                <p>From these experiments it appears, 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>, That the mean
                    annual quantity of water evaporated in the above circumstances is twenty-five
                    inches of rain, to which if we add five for dew, will give thirty inches of
                    water raised annually: 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> That the evaporation
                    increases nearly, though not exactly, in the same ratio as the rain; thus 1797
                    gave most rain, and the greatest evaporation, &amp;c.: 3<hi rend="italic"
                    >dly,</hi> That there is little difference between the evaporation from bare
                    earth of sufficient depth, and that from ground covered with grass. It is
                    however to be observed, that the numbers in the last or right hand column belong
                    to the years 1799, 1800, and 1801; and that on account of accidents with the
                    frost, these numbers are partly conjectural for January, February, March, April,
                    and December. The mean annual evaporation during the same three years from
                    ground covered with grass, exclusive of dew, was 23∙5 inches, which falls a
                    little short of that for the other three, which was twenty-five.</p>
                <p>But there is reason to suspect that a less depth of soil in the vessel would have
                    allowed more water to escape into the bottles, and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> It is therefore in some degree a matter of conjecture that this
                    apparatus indicated the true evaporation from the adjacent fields. Lahire having
                    filled a vessel eight feet deep with soil, and sunk it into the earth, left it
                    there for fifteen years. It had an opening at the bottom for the escape of the
                    water, but never a drop came through. The quantity of rain, to be sure, being
                    less at Paris than at Manchester, will so far account for this.</p>
                <p>In such an article as this it might be expected that, in conformity with custom,
                    we should state the mean evaporation for all England, and a number of other
                    principal countries. This however we are unable to do, because wo are persuaded
                    that to obtain even an approximate estimate would require experiments, such as
                    those of Dr Dalton from the soil, to be made at least within every square mile
                    of surface. The usual estimates being only derived from <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193750835" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0835-0429"/>a vessel with water, as will
                    be noticed more particularly afterwards, afford no measure of evaporation from
                    the soil.</p>
                <p>The following relation between the temperature and the rate of evaporation from
                    water, was discovered by Dr Dalton. Having, as above mentioned, determined
                    experiment İ tally the force through a considerable range, he was natu- rally
                    led to examine whether the quantity of water evaporated in a given time bore any
                    proportion to the force of vapour of the same temperature, and was agreeably
                    surprised to find that they corresponded in every part of the range examined.
                    Thus the forces of vapour at 212°, 180°, 164°, 152°, 144°, and 138°, are equal
                    to 30, 15, 10, 7∙5, 6, and 5 inches of mercury respectively; and the grains of
                    water evaporated per minute are in the same ratio. This Dr Dalton considers as
                    quite in conformity with the laws of mechanics; for the atmosphere seems by its
                    inertia to obstruct the diffusion of vapour, which would otherwise be almost
                    instantaneous, as in vacuo; but this obstruction, which is greater as the air is
                    more dense, is overcome in proportion to the force of the vapour. Did the
                    obstruction arise from the weight of the atmosphere, it would prevent any vapour
                    from rising at temperatures lower than 212°; but according to Dr Dalton it is
                    caused by the inertiae of the particles of air, and is similar to that which
                    water meets with in descending among pebbles.</p>
                <p>The theory of evaporation was thus far settled so much the more easily, because
                    the force of vapour already in the open air being very small compared with what
                    is produced from water at high temperatures, did.not sensibly affect the
                    results; but Dr Dalton found, that if the theory was to be verified by
                    experiments for low temperatures, regard must be had to the force of vapour
                    already in the atmosphere. For instance, if water of 59° were the subject, the
                    force of vapour at that temperature being a sixtieth of the force at 212°, one
                    might expect the quantity of evaporation to be a sixtieth also; but if it should
                    happen, as it sometimes does in summer, that an aqueous atmosphere: to that
                    amount does already exist, the evaporation, in place of a sixtieth, would be
                    nothing at all. On the other hand, if the previously existing vapour were the
                    120th, corresponding to 39° F., then the effective evaporating force would be
                    the 120th of that from , boiling water. In . short, Dr Dalton found that the
                    evaporating force must in every case be equal to that at the temperature of the
                    water diminished by that already existing in the air. To find the force of the
                    aqueous atmosphere, Dr Dalton revived the method which had been employed by
                    Leroy long before. 'He used in summer to take a tall glass jar, and fill it with
                    cold spring water, fresh from the well. If dew was immediately formed on the
                    previously dry outside, he poured the water out, let it stand a little-to rise
                    in temperature, wiped dry the outside of the jar, and then poured the water in
                    again. The like process is to be repeated till dew cease to be formed, and at
                    that instant the temperature of the water is to be carefully noted, for the
                    purpose of obtaining, from a table like that which shortly follows, the
                    corresponding force of vapour. Such temperature is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >dew point,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">point of deposition</hi>; because the
                    air, if cooled to it, would be in a state of saturation with moisture, and of
                    course ready to deposit dew, especially on any thing in the least colder than
                    itself. This operation should be performed in the open air, or at an open
                    window, because the air within is generally more humid than without. Spring
                    water in this country being generally within a degree or two of 50°, will mostly
                    answer the purpose during the three hottest months; -in other seasons an
                    artificial cold mixture may be used. But Leslie’s or Daniell’s hygrometer would
                    be still more convenient at all seasons.</p>
                <p>To observe the evaporation at atmospheric temperatures, Dr Dalton had two light
                    tin vessels; the one six inches diameter and half an inch deep, the other eight
                    inches diameter and three fourths of an inch deep, and both made to be suspended
                    from a balance. Water being put in one of these and weighed, it was placed in an
                    open window or other exposed situation for ten or fifteen minutes, and again
                    weighed to ascertain the loss from evaporation. The temperature of the water was
                    at same time observed, the force of the aqueous atmosphere ascertained as above,
                    and the velocity of the current of air noticed; for with the same evaporating
                    force, a strong wind, by quickly changing the air in contact with the water,
                    will double the effect produced in still air. From a great variety of
                    experiments made during both winter and summer, and when the evaporating force
                    was strong and weak, even in the case of ice, the results were found perfectly
                    conformable with the theory. The same quantity is evaporated with the same
                    evaporating force thus determined as near as can be judged, whatever be the
                    temperature of the air. Thus, if the dew point be 40° while the air is at 60°,
                    the evaporation is the same, as if the dew point were at 60° and the air at 72°;
                    for ∙524 — ∙263, which is the difference of the forces of vapour at 60° and 40°,
                    is nearly equal to ∙770 — •524, the difference of the forces at 72° and 60°; but
                    two such differences could be had exactly equal by using fractions of degrees of
                    temperature, and interpolating between the other numbers.</p>
                <p>The following table exhibits the ratios and quantity of water evaporated at
                    different temperatures, derived from the preceding theory, and confirmed
                    by-experiments. The first column is the temperature; the -second the force of
                    vapour; the rest give the number of grains evaporated from a surface six inches
                    in diameter, supposing the air to be previously dry. The third column is
                    calculated; on the supposition that at the temperature of 212° the evaporation
                    per minute from the said surface is 120 grains; the/fourth, that it is 154
                    grains; the fifth, 189, according to the strength of the wind; for if the air in
                    contact with the water be continually changed, so that the recently moistened
                    portion may be speedily removed and drier air substituted for it, the process
                    will be proportionably expedited. These columns present the extremes and mean of
                    evaporation likely to be noticed when the process goes on in air off the
                    ordinary density. The effects of different densities will be considered
                    afterwards.</p>

                    the first, is 2∙06, and that opposite 65° is 3T6; the difference, IT grain, is
                    the evaporation required. Again, if the evaporation per minute, with a brisk
                    wind, be 1∙7 grain, while the air is at 62°; required the weight of the aqueous
                    atmosphere, and the dew-point. In the fifth column the number opposite 62° is
                    3∙52, being the whole evaporating force at that temperature in perfectly dry
                    air, from which 1∙7 being deducted, leaves 1∙82, which, in the fifth column, is
                    opposite to ∙294 inch of mercury in the second, the weight of the column of
                    vapour, and to 43° the temperature or dew-point. That is by using the nearest
                    numbers in the table. Greater exactness may be had by interpolating between
                    them. In this case, for instance, the weight should more correctly be ∙290, and
                    the dew-point 42° ∙6. Such estimates, however, are liable to uncertainty, where
                    any doubt remains respecting the velocity of the wind.</p>
                <p>Dr Dalton found that the same theory held with regard to the evaporation of other
                    liquids, and was even more easily verified by experiment in their case than in
                    that of water, on account of the air previously containing little or none of
                    their vapours. In short, the evaporation in their case is similar to that of
                    water in perfectly dry air.</p>
                <p>Since vapours, so long as they maintain the gaseous form, expand and contract by
                    change of temperature precisely at the same rate as air does in like
                    circumstances, and since mixtures of air and vapour do the same, it follows,
                    that if at any temperature above the dew-point the pressure of the unconfined
                    air have to that of the vapour in it a certain ratio, it will have the same
                    ratio to it at any other temperature not lower than the dew-point. Hence,
                    because the entire pressure is constant, the force of vapour at the actual
                    temperature of the air is exactly equal its force at the dew-point or
                    temperature at which the air under the original pressure becomes saturated with
                    moisture, and at which all. the moisture in it just barely maintains the gaseous
                    form.</p>
                <p>Dr Anderson, in giving a table of the weight and force of aqueous vapour <hi
                    rend="italic">in vacuo (Edm. Encyc.</hi> xi. 578), says, it is adapted to a
                    pressure of thirty inches, and that when the barometer differs from thirty, the
                    numbers in the table (none of which denote atmospheres, but grains and inches)
                    must be altered in the same ratio as the pressure. It is difficult to conceive
                    how he could fall into such a palpable mistake. Vapour <hi rend="italic">in
                    vacuo</hi> being protected from atmospheric pressure, has obviously nothing to
                    do with its changes or amount; and we have already seen that the maximum force
                    and density of vapour in air, as well as <hi rend="italic">in vacuο,</hi> depend
                    solely on the temperature. Yet Dr Anderson <hi rend="italic">(ibid</hi> p. 581)
                    makes the maximum weight of vapour which can exist in a cubic inch of air at a
                    given temperature to be proportional to the barometric pressure, which is
                    remarkable, considering his professed adherence to Dalton’s theory. It is
                    farther curious that the doctor, not perceiving that the actual force of vapour
                    in the open air must be exactly equal to its force at the dew-point, gives (on
                    same page) a formula for reducing the one force to the other; and he even takes
                    it for granted that Dr Dalton is in the same error, though the very reverse
                    appears from all his writings, and especially those already quoted.</p>
                <p>The rate of evaporation is very different in air of different densities, being
                    greater when the density is less, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Some
                    experiments on this subject are given by Professor Daniell, in the second and
                    much improved edition of his valuable <hi rend="italic">Meteorological
                    Essays,</hi> published in 1827, page 493, from which we make the following brief
                    abstract:—Upon the plate of an air pump was placed a flat dish 7∙5 inches
                    diameter, containing sulphuric acid, and covered by a receiver which but just
                    passed over it, so that the base of the included air rested everywhere on the
                    acid. In the middle of the dish was a stand supporting a vessel 2∙7 inches
                    diameter, and 1 ’ 3 deep, which was filled with water to the depth of an inch,
                    and had a delicate thermometer resting on its bottom. The water, having been
                    previously freed from air, was weighed with a very sensible balance, and then
                    exposed to the action of the sulphuric acid. Its temperature was 45°, and the
                    barometer at 30∙4 inches. At the end of half an hour it was again weighed, and
                    found to have lost 1∙24 grain by evaporation· Having been replaced, and the air
                    rarefied till the gauge stood at 15∙2 inches, it was found to have lost in half
                    an <pb break="no" facs="nls:193750861" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0861-0431"/>hour 2∙72
                    grains, and to have had its temperature reduced to 43°. By repeating the
                    process, continually diminishing the pressure one half, the successive losses
                    from evaporation in intervals of half an hour each, were as follow :—</p>

                <p>When the exhaustion was pushed to the utmost, which was ∙07 inch, the evaporation
                    in the half hour was 87∙22 grains. During this last experiment the water was
                    frozen in about 8 minutes, while the thermometer under the ice was at 37°. There
                    must, however, be some inadvertency respecting the loss from evaporation in the
                    second experiment; because in the table it is 2∙87, and in the account before it
                    only 2∙72, which last, we presume, is the more correct of the two.</p>
                <p>Before inferring from these experiments the rate of evaporation under different
                    pressures, Mr Daniell applied to the results a correction for the variation of
                    temperature. Taking the evaporation as proportional to the elasticity of the
                    vapour, he estimated the latter from the mean of the temperatures at the
                    beginning and end of each experiment, and calculated the amount for a fixed
                    temperature. This might have been supposed to give a near approximation, were it
                    not evident from the last experiment, that, owing to the bulb of the thermometer
                    not being close at the evaporating surface, it indicated often too high a
                    temperature; but file following table presents the results computed on that
                    principle for the temperature of 45°; and here again we suspect the second
                    number 2∙97, being computed from 2∙87, is too great.</p>

                <p>Notwithstanding the slight irregularity of the series, Mr Daniell thinks we can
                    run no risk in concluding that the amount of evaporation is, <hi rend="italic"
                    >cceteris paribus,</hi> in exact inverse proportion to the elasticity of the
                    incumbent air. But perhaps it would be more correct to say, that, <hi
                    rend="italic">cceteris paribus,</hi> the rate of evaporation is inversely as the
                    <hi rend="italic">density</hi> of the air; for that is Dr Dalton’s view of the
                    matter, and is equally conformable to these experiments. It may however be
                    observed, that the rate of evaporation in the first case, which is in air of the
                    ordinary density, is much smaller than that given by Dr Dalton; but the process
                    going on in so small a volume of still and confined air, seems a sufficient
                    reason for this.</p>
                <p>It was hinted above, that evaporation tends to lower the temperature of an
                    evaporating surface, by abstracting heat from it for the formation of vapour.
                    For, from the well known fact, that in the formation of aqueous vapour as much
                    heat is absorbed as would raise the temperature 1000 times its weight of water
                    one degree, it follows, that were it not for the heat derived from surrounding
                    bodies, e vaporization of the 1000th part of a mass of water would lower the
                    temperature of the whole one degree; so that, by the time the 100th part had
                    evaporated, the temperature of the whole would have fallen ten degrees. But
                    surrounding bodies, particularly the air, by participating in the cooling
                    effects, supply heat in such a manner to the water, that a limit is soon set to
                    the fall of temperature. Although this cooling influence has been long known in
                    a general way, it is remarkable how few experiments have been made, or, so far
                    as we know, published, to show the extent of cold produced in different
                    circumstances; and still more remarkable, that those few results of different
                    experimenters should differ so widely, as we shall presently see they do. Dr
                    Anderson, in the article <hi rend="italic">Hygrometry,</hi> in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopcedia,</hi> gives the following as the results
                    of his experiments on the cold produced by the evaporation of water in air of
                    different densities. For this purpose he placed Leslie’s hygrometer, along with
                    a cup of sulphuric acid, under a receiver of the air pump.</p>

                <p>All sealed thermometers stand too low when the pressure of the atmosphere is
                    removed from their bulbs. The two just mentioned were found to be each 1° ∙5 too
                    low in an exhausted receiver. Hence most of the numbers in the second and third
                    columns still require to be more or less corrected for this, according to the
                    degree of exhaustion; but since both thermometers were equally affected, the
                    depressions have nothing to do with it. However, the included air seems to have
                    been really a little cooled from the influence of the cold wet bulb.</p>
                <p>We have always been puzzled to account for the extreme smallness of Dr Anderson’s
                    depressions in the fourth column. Perhaps he had used very weak sulphuric acid,
                    or too small a surface of it; or he might not be aware that the full effect in.
                    a single case is seldom attained in less than half an hour. The pressure and
                    temperature in his first case are nearly the same as in Mr Meikle’s; and yet the
                    depression 4° ∙86 is not half of 11° ∙6. From many trials we know that the
                    weather is by no means very droughty, if a wet thermometer do not fall more than
                    4° ∙86, when only exposed in the open air at 48° ∙5, without any sulphuric acid
                    at all. To increase the cold in a wet thermometer, Dr Lardner recommends
                    exposing it to the sun. But whoever takes the trouble of properly trying this,
                    will find that the sun has quite the contrary effect; and therefore the doctor
                    is just in the same delusion, only on a greater scale, when he directs his
                    readers to wrap wine bottles in wet cloth, and expose them to the sun as a
                    source of greater cold! The sun, like the fire, aids evaporation, by supplying
                    heat, which will more or less counteract the cooling effect, and may even raise
                    the temperature; but common sense revolts at the very idea of the heating rays
                    of the sun being a source of cold.</p>
                <p>In 1827, Professor Daniell published, in the second edition of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Essays,</hi> p. 499, a series of experiments on the cooling
                    effects of evaporation, and which, like Mr Meikle’s, were made by means of two
                    common thermometers, the one dry and the other moist; but he seems only to have
                    read off to the nearest half degree; and his depressions, though not so
                    deficient as those of Dr Anderson, still lean considerably to the same side. The
                    following are his results, arranged as the preceding:</p>

                <p>From repeated experiments we have found that at the temperature of 50°, and under
                    a pressure of about thirty inches, a wet thermometer, when inclosed in a
                    receiver along with a sufficiently large surface of strong sulphuric acid,
                    should fall 12° ∙1 or 12° ∙2, in place of 9°, as Mr Daniell has it. The rest of
                    his depressions are still more deficient; but when we attend to the disposition
                    of his apparatus, our surprise rather is that the depressions should be so great
                    as they are. What we particularly object to is his not only inclosing a vessel
                    with water under the receiver, but interposing it directly between the wet bulb
                    and the sulphuric acid. This he did for the purpose of occasionally dipping that
                    bulb in the water; a precaution which was not only unnecessary, but which, by
                    rendering the air moist, and obstructing the drying of the bulb, must obviously
                    have rendered the whole of his depressions much smaller than they should have
                    been in perfectly dry air. When Mr Meikle made his experiments, and they were
                    published before those of Mr Daniell, he satisfied himself that if the
                    thermometer was properly covered and moistened at first, no renewal of moisture
                    was necessary. This he ascertained by repeating, in a retrograde order, the
                    different cases when he had just completed a series of these experiments; for on
                    finishing with the case in which the air was most rarefied, he readmitted as
                    much air as just brought back the gauge to the next case, which being repeated,
                    he readmitted more air for the next, and so on, till he had got back over the
                    whole series. In every case, the wet thermometer was found to be as much
                    depressed in the backward process as in the forward, a clear proof that there
                    was no lack of moisture. Neither Dr Anderson nor Professor Daniell say whether
                    they made any allowance for the effects of pressure on the bulbs of their
                    thermometers.</p>
                <p>Oil of turpentine is well known to evaporate very quickly, but we have as yet
                    failed to detect any cold that it produces, though we do not therefore suppose
                    it forms any exception to the general law. Some liquids, as alcohol, ether,
                    sulphuret of carbon, &amp;c. both evaporate more rapidly than water does, and
                    produce a greater cold; but the expenditure of heat is greater in vaporizing a
                    given weight of water than of any other liquid yet examined; a fact from which
                    it had often been concluded that alcohol could be vaporized with so much less
                    fuel than water, that its vapour would be an economical substitute for steam as
                    a first mover; nay, this had become a standard doctrine in almost' every
                    scientific compilation. It however involved a fatal oversight, as was first
                    pointed out by Mr Meikle in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine</hi>
                    for July 1826, p. 41, and afterwards by Mr Ainger in Brande’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal of Science</hi> for March 1830; for it is not with equal <hi
                    rend="italic">weights,</hi> but with equal <hi rend="italic">volumes</hi> of
                    these vapours, that the comparison falls to be made; and when this is done, the
                    greater rarity of steam puts it on at least an equal footing with alcoholic
                    vapour, so far as regards the economy of heat. In other respects, steam is
                    decidedly preferable; for, independently of the enormous expense of alcohol, the
                    density of its vapour, being about 2∙5 times that of steam, would prevent it
                    from moving with the same facility through the pipes, valves, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Perhaps it may not be altogether foreign to our subject to mention, that Mr
                    Hutton froze alcohol by condensing’ air on it in a strong vessel, which being
                    very much cooled' by freezing mixtures, was next suddenly opened, when the
                    dilatation of the air, and the consequently rapid evaporation and re-expansion
                    of the alcohol, absorbed so much heat as induced a cold sufficient to freeze
                    it.</p>
                <p>The bad effects of damp clothes, beds, &amp;c. are usually ascribed to the cold
                    attending the evaporation of the damp;* but since considerable injury often
                    follows where scarcely' any cold is felt, we suspect the chief cause lies rather
                    in the moisture suppressing the natural evaporation from the skin. The heavy
                    smell which accompanies most dogs, and the fetid grease upon their hair, show
                    that they perspire in some other shape besides what some suppose the only one
                    from their tongues.</p>
                <p>Various instruments have been employed to measure-the rate at which moisture
                    escapes into the atmosphere. We have already alluded to the method of exposing
                    water in a vessel, and noting the loss. The vessel is generally circular, with a
                    roof a little above it to keep off the rain, &amp;c.; and, for greater accuracy,
                    the contents may either be weighed from time to time, or measured in a graduated
                    tube. When the vessel is brim full, the wind is apt to blow some of the water
                    over; and when not full, the water is in some measure sheltered from the drying
                    effects of the wind. The only use of such an instrument or gauge is to give us a
                    very vague idea of the drying power of the air. It affords no measure whatever
                    of the evaporation from the ground; for when the soil is exceedingly parched,
                    and consequently has next to no moisture to give off, the gauge generally shows
                    the greatest evaporation of all. Yet in stating the particulars of the climate
                    of a place, it is usual to mention the amount of evaporation derived most
                    probably from no better source. But it cannot even be a measure of the
                    evaporation from a lake, because in that case the indications of the gauge
                    depend very much on the direction of the wind; for it is obvious that if a
                    previously dry wind traverse an extensive lake before reaching the gauge, if may
                    by that time have become so humid as to show little or no drying power at all
                    upon the gauge. When, on the other hand, the wind passes first over the <hi
                    rend="italic">gauge,</hi> its indications are to be suspected of erring in
                    excess, because the farther a wind continues to traverse the surface of a lake,
                    the more will its drying power be impaired, an therefore the average rate of
                    evaporation will be less than at the side next the gauge. For this reason the
                    evaporation from a smaller surface of water is, <hi rend="italic">cateris
                    paribus</hi> greater in proportion to the area than from a larger. Whether any
                    general rule could readily apply to this, we are unable to say. Perhaps
                    something like an approximation to the relation between the area and evaporation
                    in such circum<pb break="no" facs="nls:193750887" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0887-0433"
                    />stances would be had by dividing the area by some root of its mean linear
                    dimension taken in the direction of the wind, and multiplying by a constant. But
                    this would not in the least rectify the indications of the gauge. Since similar
                    objections must obviously attach to all gauges employed for this purpose, it
                    would be of little use to give any farther account of them, or of the registers
                    of evaporation with which many works otherwise valuable are so often
                    encumbered.</p>
                <p>It had been long supposed that muriatic acid vapour existed in the atmosphere
                    incumbent over the ocean or on the sea coasts; and various effects were ascribed
                    to its presence. But from experiments detailed in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">de Pharmacie</hi> for November 1833, it appears
                    that such effects are solely owing to minute drops of salt water or spray which
                    have been swept into the atmosphere by the wind; and that, with the exception of
                    the salt drops thus raised, though only when the sea is ruffled by the wind,
                    sea-air contains neither muriates nor uncombined muriatic acid. At first sight
                    we had some doubt whether this would account for the injurious effects of
                    sea-air on vegetation; because the presence of common salt, if not in excess, is
                    known to be beneficial. But perhaps the salt when united with the soil may
                    operate as a cordial to the roots, while it may be noxious when in immediate
                    contact with the stem or leaves, as is often the case with manure injudiciously
                    applied close to the roots of plants.</p>
                <p>In the method of forming ice in India by exposing water during the night to the
                    aspect of a clear sky, the effect was for some time ascribed to evaporation; but
                    Dr Wells ascertained that the water thus exposed gained in place of losing
                    weight. Now it could only gain by being cooled below the dew point of the
                    incumbent air; for it is only in that state that the air could yield a portion
                    of its moisture to the water; and therefore the cold must be the effect of
                    radiation, and not of evaporation. This was farther evident from the
                    circumstance that wind which ought to have increased the evaporation prevented
                    the freezing altogether. But independently of these considerations, water
                    exposed in the open air could never be cooled to the freezing point by
                    evaporation alone in a hot climate. Where such a thing occurs, the air must be
                    unusually dry, even after its temperature scarcely amounts to 40°, or the
                    atmospheric pressure must be very small; because the utmost evaporation that can
                    be produced artificially under the ordinary pressure will little more than cool
                    a wet thermometer from 40° to 32°; and the cooling effect on a vessel with water
                    is not nearly so great, especially in the open air, if care be taken to avoid
                    the influence of radiation under the aspect of a clear sky. It is true that, at
                    Benares for instance, the surface of the ground, after becoming very cold by
                    radiation, sometimes renders the incumbent still air also pretty cold; but this,
                    by bringing the air to a state of saturation with moisture, totally unfits it
                    for aiding the freezing by evaporation.</p>
                <p>So great is the difference of opinion respecting the influence of electricity on
                    evaporation, that we suspect it has not yet been sufficiently investigated. The
                    use of evaporation in the arts and manufactures will be found under the
                    respective articles. In addition to the various works noticed in this article,
