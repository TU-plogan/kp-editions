                    of the most illustrious philologers and theologians of the last century. He was
                    ornon the 4th August 1707, at Tennstadt, of which place is father, likewise a
                    distinguished theologian, was pastor, and superintendent of the electoral
                    dioceses of Thuringia, az, and Sangerhusen. After having received his first ins
                    ruction in the learned languages, under the domestic dis-tip me of his father,
                    and in the gymnasium of his native , <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> " <hi
                    rend="superscript"> n</hi> &gt; he was sent at the age of sixteen to the
                    celebrated axon cloister school of Pforta. Here he continued four J ears. At the
                    age of twenty he entered the university of Wittemberg, where he studied
                    eloquence and ancient life rature under the celebrated Berger, theology under
                    Wernsdorf, and the Wolfian philosophy under Schlosser. From Wittemberg he passed
                    to the university of Leipsig, where he applied himself to the mathematical
                    sciences under Hausen, following the courses of Boerner and Deyling on theology,
                    and the lectures of Gottsched on German eloquence. In 1730 he was made master in
                    the faculty of philosophy. In the following year he accepted the office of
                    conrector in the T homan school of Leipsig, of which J. M <hi rend="superscript"
                    > ,</hi>. Gesner was then rector; and on Gesner’s vocation, as professor of
                    eloquence, to Göttingen, he succeeded him as rector. In this situation, by his
                    erudition, diligence, and the elegance of his methods, he surpassed all his
                    contemporaries, and created an epoch in Germany for the study of the ancient
                    authors. From this office, in opposition to the present custom, which precludes
                    a translation into the universities to the masters of the subordinate schools,
                    he was, in 1742, named as extraordinary professor of ancient literature in the
                    university of Leipsig, and in 1756 promoted to the ordinary professorship of
                    eloquence. In both these chairs he kne¶v how to combine more intellect,
                    philosophy, and taste, than had been done by any of his predecessors. His
                    reputation as a scholar, and his rational treatment of the biblical exegesis,
                    paved the way for his entrance into the theological faculty. Through the
                    elegance of his learning, and his manner of discussion, he co-operated with
                    Baumgarten of Halle in disengaging dogmatic theology from the scholastic and
                    mystical excrescences with which it was then deformed; and thereby contributed
                    greatly to the new revolution in theology, although he himself never deyiated
                    from the ancient system. In these deserving labours, and with unbroken health,
                    he attained an honourable old age; and died, after a short illness, in his
                    seventy-sixth year, on 11th September 1781.</p>
                <p>Whether Ernesti be considered as a philologer or theologian, it is perhaps as
                    much from the impulsion which he gave to sacred and profane criticism in
                    Germany, as from the intrinsic excellence of his own works in either department,
                    that he must derive his reputation. With Gesner, he instituted a new school in
                    ancient literature; and, after Crocus, Melanchthon, and Camerarius, has been
                    perhaps the greatest reformer and promoter of classical learning in Germany.
                    With Semler he partially co-operated in the great revolution of Lutheran
                    theology; though he is guiltless of all participation in the deductions which
                    many of those who profess themselves his disciples have drawn from the
                    principles which he established.</p>
                <p>An enthusiastic and enlightened study of the ancient Greek and Roman authors is
                    the well-merited boast of the present German literature. This commenced, in its
                    existing form, towards the middle of the last century. Not that Germany, before
                    that period, had neglected ancient literature, or could not enumerate her
                    proportion among the great names of classical erudition. No nation, in fact, had
                    produced so many, or more illustrious, scholars immediately after the
                    Reformation; but for a long time polite literature had become deformed, if not
                    neglected, in proportion as religious wars and polemical theology had exhausted
                    and engrossed her governments and universities. The German scholars were chiefly
                    theologians, and theologians who had studied every thing in reference to their
                    peculiar profession. Add to this, that the most disgusting and inefficient
                    methods had been introduced, whereby the spirit of the instruction was at utter
                    variance with the object of the study. Accordingly, during the whole of the
                    seventeenth and the first half of the eighteenth century, Germany was far
                    excelled by Holland in the number and excellence of her nhilologers; and it was
                    not until the appearance<pb break="no" facs="nls:193749964"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-9964-0362"/> of Gesner and Ernesti, with their somewhat
                    earlier contemporaries, Cortius, Daniel Longolius, and Michael Heusinger, that
                    she could oppose above one or two rivals to the great critics of the Dutch
                    schools. Gesner and Ernesti, however, through the influence of their lectures at
                    the greater universities of Göttingen and Leipsig, through the wider extent of
                    their labours in philology, and still more through the greater excellence of
                    their methods, are alone entitled to be held the founders of the new German
                    school of ancient literature. Both excelled their philological countrymen in
                    taste, in the elegance of their Latin style, in a philosophical spirit, and in a
                    wider acquaintance with the subsidiary branches of erudition. Both made an
                    advantageous use of their critical knowledge of the languages; both looked at
                    once to the words and to the subject of the ancient writers, established and
                    applied the rules of a legitimate interpretation, and carefully analysed the
                    meaning as well as the form of the expression. Both contributed effectually to
                    expel the old absurd and disgusting methods of instruction from the schools and
                    universities, and to introduce an improved and more effectual system. To the
                    epoch whfch they formed, many circumstances indeed contributed :—their
                    acquaintance with the Dutch criticism; the universal enthusiasm of the Germans
                    for establishing a national literature, and for becoming at the same time
                    reformers in the departments of ancient learning; and withal the spirit of
                    philosophy which at that period in Germany began more and more to blend itself
                    with every part of science and literature. It is also true that their editions
                    do not possess the complement of erudition and criticism which distinguish those
                    of many of their contemporaries; their commentaries have the precision, but how
                    inferior are they in certainty, copiousness, and depth of illustration, to those
                    of the philologers of Holland? In their editions of the Latin classics, they
                    returned back to the somewhat inconvenient method of Cellarius, collecting their
                    principal illustrations into an <hi rend="italic">Index</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Rerum et Verborum,</hi> as is done by Gesner in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quintilian,</hi> and by Ernesti in his <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> not, however, that they did not possess the means of
                    illustrating their author with a rich critical and philological commentary, of
                    which the former has given ample proof in his editions of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scriptores</hi><hi rend="italic">de Re</hi><hi rend="italic">Rustica,</hi> and
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Claudian,</hi> and the latter in his two most valuable
                    labours, his <hi rend="italic">Suetonius</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tacitus.</hi> Both, but especially Ernesti, have detected grammatical niceties
                    in the Latin tongue, which had escaped all preceding critics; such, among
                    others, are the use of the subjunctive mood after the pronoun <hi rend="italic"
                    >qui,</hi> and the legitimate consecution of the tenses. His canons are,
                    however, not without exceptions. As an editor of the Greek classics, Ernesti
                    deserves hardly to be named beside his Dutch contemporaries, Hemsterhuis,
                    Valkenaer, Ruhnken, or his colleague and enemy the learned and unfortunate
                    Reiske. How insignificant are his own labours in his editions of Homer and
                    Callimachus? In regard to the higher criticism, it was not even attempted by
                    Ernesti. But to him and to Gesner the peculiar praise is owing of having formed,
                    partly by their discipline, and partly by their example, philologers greater
                    than themselves; and to them is due the honour of having so strongly excited in
                    Germany that enthusiasm for ancient learning, which has now, unfortunately, no
                    parallel, in the other countries of Europe.</p>
                <p>As a theologian, Lrnesti is far less conspicuous than as a scholar, and his
                    influence not so marked either on his contemporaries or on his successors.
                    Before the middle of the eighteenth century, the Spenerian pietism had been
                    almost banished from the Lutheran theology; and the professors of that faculty
                    in the Protestant universities of Germany no longer excluded philosophy from all
                    interference in the doctrine of Christian belief. It had then been boldly
                    proclaimed and maintained with pre-eminent ability by Semler, that Luther had
                    commenced and not finished the Reformation of religion; but that this
                    Reformation must still proceed, and that religion, like other branches of
                    knowledge. must become purer and more perfect in proportion to the increase of
                    knowledge and the development of the human mind. At this date, accordingly, the
                    theologians of Germany had begun to disregard the nonconformity of their
                    doctrines with the formula of the Lutheran church; and after this period few
                    were at all apprehensive of openly controverting its tenets when at variance
                    with the results of their own speculations. From the unrestrained freedom of
                    thought in matters of religion which was now indulged, if not even encouraged,
                    by the governments in their different universities, every one was at perfect
                    liberty, without any derogation from his character as a clergyman or instmctor,
                    to maintain and promulgate what opinions in religion he chose; and it must be
                    acknowledged that the theologians have made, and are still making, ex cry use
                    and abuse of this license, and have arrived at every conclusion that piety and
                    learning, as well as presumption, folly, and irréligion can suggest. It was at
                    the commencement of this important era that Ernesti flourished as a
                    theologian.</p>
                <p>Of the three sciences subsidiary to theology, philosophy, history, and
                    grammatical exegesis, the first had been imperfectly applied, and without any
                    interesting result, by Baumgarten, a scholar of Wolf; but the second, the
                    historical interpretation, had, in the hands of Semler, been productive of
                    conclusions subversive of much that had been hitherto held orthodox and even
                    sacred. In the grammatical interpretation of the New Testament some imperfect
                    progress had been made by Bengel; but the new epoch in the biblical exegesis
                    commences with John David Michaelis for the Old, and with Ernesti for the New
                    Testament. It is, indeed, chiefly in <hi rend="italic">hermeneutic</hi> that
                    Ernesti has any claim to the character of a great theologian. But here his
                    merits arc distinguished, and, at the period when his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Institutio Interpretis</hi><hi rend="italic">N.</hi><hi rend="italic">T.</hi>
                    was published, almost peculiar to himself. He applied himself to the
                    interpretation of the sacred Scriptures, after a long and familiar acquaintance
                    with the Greek and Roman writers, and when formed in his mind and taste by a
                    constant study of these patterns. His interpretation of the New Testament bears
                    the character of both these circumstances. It is not only the matter, but at the
                    same time the manner in which it is conveyed,—it is the selection of subjects,
                    with the precision, the pregnant brevity, the elegance and simplicity, in which
                    they are expressed,—that confers on this little book so high and so singular a
                    value. We find in it the principles of a general interpretation, and this
                    without the assistance of any particular philosophy, not even of the Wolfian, to
                    which Ernesti was attached; but consisting of observations and rules, which,
                    though already enunciated, and applied in the criticism of the profane writers,
                    had never rigorously been employed in the biblical exegesis. He admits in the
                    sacred writings only <hi rend="italic">one acceptation,</hi> and that the <hi
                    rend="italic">grammatical,</hi> convertible into and the same with the <hi
                    rend="italic">logical</hi> and <hi rend="italic">historical.</hi> The
                    Scriptures, therefore, having this in common with all other writings, it follows
                    that they can only be explained like mere human compositions; that the rules of
                    interpretation are the same in both; and that only through some peculiar
                    constitution of speech and writing could any possible distinction between these
                    subsist. He therefore justly censures the opinion of those who, in the
                    illustration θ <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> the Scriptures, refer every thing
                    to the illumination of the Holy Spirit ;· as well as that of others who, in
                    contempt <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> all knowledge of the languages, would
                    explain words by things, and thus introduce into the holy writings their
                    peculiar glosses and opinions. The <hi rend="italic">analogy of faith,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> as</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> t</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi> rule of interpretation, he greatly limits, and
                    teaches that it <pb break="no" facs="nls:193749977" xml:id="kp-eb0709-9977-0363"
                    />can never alone afford the explanation of words, but only determine the choice
                    among their possible significations, <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> ∏d must always
                    stand in need of philology as an assistant. The spirit of Ernesti’s
                    interpretation gives no countenance, however, to the results which many of his
                    followers have deduced from the grammatical and historical exegeses. Every
                    principle of his interpretation rests on the assumed inspiration of the holy
                    books; and there is not perhaps a better antidote to the poisonous tenets of
                    many of those who profess to be of his school, than the diligent study of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Interpres,</hi> and the relative <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acroases</hi> of Morus. In the higher criticism of the sacred books Ernesti did
                    nothing. In dogmatic he always expressed great contempt of strict systematic
                    theology; and though he lectured for many years on the Aphorisms of Neumann, it
                    was rather in refutation than in support of his text-book.</p>
                <p>Among his works the following are the more important:</p>

                    by reason of the real excellence of the matter, but more particularly deserving
