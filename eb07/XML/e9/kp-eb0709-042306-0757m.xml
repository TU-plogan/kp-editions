                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">EUTYCHIANS</label>, ancient heretics, who denied the dou- 1
                    ble nature in Christ, and were so denominated from Eu-ι tyches, the
                    archimandrite, or abbot of a monastery at ConI stantinople, who began to
                    propagate his opinion in the year 448. This man, however, did not seem quite
                    steady and i consistent in his sentiments, for he appeared to allow of; two
                    natures, even before the union; a consequence he api parently drew from the
                    principles of the Platonic philosophy, which supposes a pre-existence of souls.
                    Accordingly, he believed that the soul of Jesus Christ had been united . to the
                    divinity before the incarnation; but then he allowed no distinction of natures
                    in Jesus Christ after his incarnation. This heresy was first condemned in a
                    synod held at Constantinople by Flavian, in 448, the proceedings of which were
                    approved by the council of Ephesus, called <hi rend="italic">conventus
                    latronum,</hi> in 449, and re-examined and condemned in the; general council of
                    Chalcedon in 451. The legates of Pope Leo, who assisted at the latter,
                    maintained that it was not enough to define that there were two natures in Jesus
                    Christ; but insisted strenuously, that, in order to remove all equivocations,
                    they must add these terms, “without being changed, or confounded, or
                    divided.”</p>
                <p>The heresy of the Eutychians, which made great progress throughout the East, at
                    length became divided into several branches. Nicephorus makes mention of no
                    fewer than twelve; some called <hi rend="italic">Schematici,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Apparentes,</hi> as only attributing to Jesus Christ a phantom or
                    appearance of flesh; others, <hi rend="italic">Theodosians,</hi> from
                    Theodosius, bishop of Alexandria; others, again, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jacobites,</hi> from one <hi rend="italic">Jacobus</hi> of Syria, which last
                    branch established itself principally in . Armenia, where it still subsists.
                    Others were named <hi rend="italic">Ace-phali,</hi> headless; and <hi
                    rend="italic">Severians,</hi> from a monk called Severus, who seized on the see
                    of Antioch in 513. These last w ere split into five subdivisions, namely, <hi
                    rend="italic">Agnoctae,</hi> who attributed some ignorance to Jesus Christ; the
                    followers of Paul; Mελα∕yo∕, or the black <hi rend="italic">Angeldes,</hi> so
                    called from the place where they were assembled; and lastly, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Adrites</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cononites.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Eutychians</hi> was also the name of another sect, half Arian half Eunomian,
                    which arose at Constantinople in the fourth century.</p>
                <p>It being then a matter of great controversy amongst the Eunomians at
                    Constantinople, whether or not the Son of God knew the last day and hour of the
                    world, particularly with regard to a passage in the gospel of St Matthew (chap,
                    xxiv. ver. 36), or rather to one in St Mark (xiii. 32), where it is expressed
                    that the Son did not know it, but the Father only; Eutychius made no scruple to
                    maintain, even in writing, that the Son did not know it: and this opinion '
                    having displeased the leaders of the Eunomian party, he separated from them, and
                    made a journey to Eunomius, then in exile, who fully acquiesced in Eutychins’s
                    doctrine, and admitted the latter to his communion. But Eunomius having died
                    soon afterwards, the chief of the Eunomians at Constantinople refused to admit
                    Eutychius; who, upon this, formed a sect of such as adhered to him, who were
                    called <hi rend="italic">Eutychians.</hi></p>
                <p>This Eutychius, with one Theophronius, were the occasion of all the changes made
                    by the Eunomians in the administration of baptism; which, according to
                    Nicephorus, consisted in only using one immersion, performed not in name of the
                    Trinity, but in memory of the death of Jesus - Christ. Nicephorus calls the
                    chief of that sect, not <hi rend="italic">Eutychius, bntEupsychius,</hi> and his
                    followers <hi rend="italic">Eunomiaupsychians.</hi></p>
