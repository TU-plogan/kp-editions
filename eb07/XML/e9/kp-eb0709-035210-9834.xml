                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">EQUITES</label>, an order of men in the commonwealth of Rome,
                    to which we can furnish no exact parallel in modern times. They seem, indeed, to
                    have resembled in some degree the gentry of England; with this difference
                    however, that they enjoyed peculiar privileges, and were more of a separate
                    caste than any body of men which can now be pointed out. Their origin goes back
                    to the earliest times of Roman history, though we can perceive, even from the
                    legendary statements of Livy and Dionysius, that their constitution and mode of
                    selection had been changed in the course of ages. During the reign of the kings
                    they evidently appear to have been of noble birth, the younger branches of
                    patrician families. This we may infer from the statement of Polybius (vi. 20),
                    when he says that the knights <hi rend="italic">now</hi> are chosen according to
                    fortune, evidently intimating that their selection had depended on a different
                    principle at a previous period. Romulus is said to have divided them into three
                    centuries; and the very names of Ramnenses, Titienses, and Luceres, by which he
                    designated them, point out distinctly their high origin. Both Tullus Hostilius
                    and Tarquinius added to their number; but it was Servius Tullius (576 B. c.) who
                    first organised them into a distinct body, and compelled the state to contribute
                    annually to their maintenance. It is difficult to perceive in what way we are to
                    explain the statement of Livy (i. 43), that the sum of ten thousand pounds of
                    brass was given to each for the purchase of a horse; an enormous sum, when
                    compared with that at which oxen and sheep were rated in the table of penalties.
                    They were bound of course to be provided with a noble steed, and may have been
                    obliged to replace it if it fell from any casualty in war. The accoutrements,
                    too, and a slave to take charge of it, were possibly all included in this large
                    sum. But whether, when the censor ordered the knight to sell his horse, it was
                    the intention that the outfit money should be refunded to the state, we have now
                    no means of determining. Livy tells us also that a tax was imposed on each <hi
                    rend="italic">vidua,</hi> of two thousand pounds of brass, to maintain a
                    knight’s horse. This certainly sounds very strange; for it seems inconceivable
                    that there should have been such a large number of rich widows; and even though
                    we understand by the word <hi rend="italic">vidua</hi> every single woman,
                    maiden as well as widow, we do not think that we thereby get out of the
                    difficulty.</p>
                <p>As early as 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> we find that a certain fortune
                    was required to enable a man to be raised to the rank of eques. In that year, at
                    the siege of Veii, we are told that those who possessed the requisite fortune,
                    but to whom horses had not been assigned, offered to provide these at their on
                    expense. This proposal was accepted; and then it was, according to Livy (v. 7),
                    that they first received regular pay. In 303 B. c. the censors Q. Fabius and P.
                    Decius established a law, by which it was ordained that every fifth year a
                    procession of the equites should take place, and that those who had misconducted
                    themselves should be degraded from their rank. They now evidently became a very
                    powerful body in the state; yet in 186 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> we find
                    it allowed as a reward to P. Aebutius, that the censor should not assign him a
                    public horse, and thereby compel him to serve as an eques against his will. This
                    proves that the duties must have been burdensome, and regarded by many with
                    distaste. In the later times of the republic they increased in power and
                    consequence, when the judicial functions were transferred from the senate to the
                    body of equites by the Sempronian law, passed by C. Gracchus about 123 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b∙</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> c</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">∙&gt;</hi> and a short time afterwards they became the farmers
                    of the public revenues, which enabled them to amass immense riches. Sylla
                    deprived them of their judicial powers; but they now possessed too much
                    influence in the state to <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> excluded from the
                    higher and more dignified offices. A to <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> his death
                    they were again admitted to their former pofl er, which, however, they shared
                    with the senate.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of the republic, and under the emp <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi>
                    rors, the fortune requisite for an eques seems to have been <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193749847" xml:id="kp-eb0709-9847-0353"/>four hundred sestertia, equal
                    to about L.3229 of our money; and even at this time knights’ horses were
                    furnished by the state, as we find by ancient inscriptions of that period.
