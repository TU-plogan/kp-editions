                    famous scholastic divine, was born about the beginning of the ninth century; but
                    where, is a matter of dispute among authors. Bale and Pitts affirm that he was
                    born at St David’s in Wales; Dempster, Mackenzie, and Henry, that he was a
                    native of Scotland. Dempster contends that he was born in Ayr, and in order to
                    suit the name to the hypothesis, he describes him as Joannes Airigena. Du Pin,
                    Sir James Ware, and Dr Ledwich have with greater probability asserted that he
                    was by birth an Irishman, Ireland being in those days called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scotia,</hi> and by the natives <hi rend="italic">Erin.</hi> Various writers
                    agree in relating that he travelled to Athens, where he acquired a competent
                    knowledge of the Greek and oriental languages; and that he afterwards resided
                    many years in the court of Charles the Bald, king of France, who, on account of
                    his singular abilities, treated him as his intimate friend and companion. He
                    slept frequently in the royal apartment, and was constantly admitted to the
                    king’s table. “We may judge,” says a modern historian, “of the freedom which he
                    used with Charles, by the following repartee. As the king and Scotus were
                    sitting one day at table, opposite to each other, after dinner, drinking a
                    cheerful glass, the philosopher having said something that was not quite
                    agreeable to the rules of French politeness, the king in a merry humour asked
                    him, Pray, what is between a <hi rend="italic">Scot</hi> and <hi rend="italic

                    of Great Britain, vol. i. p. 344.</p></note> During his residence with Charles,
                    he wrote &lt; several books of scholastic divinity, and was not so fortu-: nate
                    as to escape the imputation of heterodoxy. On that &lt; account the pope
                    commanded Charles to send him to Rome, i but the king had too great a regard for
                    his companion to I trust him with his holiness. One of the chief controver-ι
                    sies in which Erigena was engaged, and with which the 1 pope was much offended,
                    was concerning the real presence. His opinion of this weighty matter is
                    expressed in these few words: “What we receive corporally is not the body of òur
                    Lord, but that which feeds the soul, and is only perceived by faith.”</p>
                <p>Whether Erigena ended his days in France is a matter of doubt. Some of our
                    historians tell us that he quitted it in the year 864; and that, after residing
                    about three years in Oxford, he retired to the abbey of Malmesbury, where his
                    scholars stabbed him with their pen-knives. There is no foundation for this
                    story. Probably he died about the year 874; but whether in France or England, is
                    uncertain, and of little importance. Some have related that he was invited to
                    England by King Alfred; but they have apparently confounded him with John abbot
                    of Etheling, who was assassinated in 895; and to this mistake the various
                    accounts concerning Erigena are to be attributed. Besides many other works, he
                    composed the following. 1. <hi rend="italic">Excerpta</hi><hi rend="italic"
