                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">ETOLIA</label>, a country of ancient Greece. On the east it
                    was separated by the river Evenus, now the Fidari, from the Locrenses Ozolae,
                    and on the west from Acarnania by the Achelous; on the north it bordered on the
                    country of the Dorians and part of Epirus, and on the south it extended to the
                    Bay of Corinth.</p>
                <p>The Etolians were a restless and turbulent people, seldom at peace amongst
                    themselves, and ever at war with their neighbours; strangers to friendship or
                    the principles of honour; and ready to betray those who trusted them, upon the
                    least prospect of reaping any advantage from ⅛eir treachery; in short, they were
                    looked upon by the other states of Greece as but little better than outlaws and
                    public robbers. On the other hand, they were bold and enterprising in war,
                    inured to labour and hardships, undaunted in the greatest dangers, and jealous
                    dcŕënders of their liberties, for which they were, on all occasions, willing to
                    hazard their lives, and to sacrifice all that was most dear to them. They
                    distinguished themselves above all the other nations of Greece in opposing the
                    ambitious designs of the Macedonian princes, who, after having reduced most of
                    the other states, were forced to grant them a peace upon honourable terms. The
                    constitution of the Etolian republic was copied from that of the Achaeans, and
                    constructed with a view to form, as it were, a counter alliance; for the
                    Etolians bore an irreconcilable hatred to the Achaeans, and had conceived no
                    small jealousy of the growing power of that state. The Cleomenic war, and that
                    of the allies, called the Social War, were kindled by the Etolians in the heart
                    of the Peloponnesus, with no other view than to humble their antagonists the
                    Achaeans. In the latter contest, this people, with the assistance only of the
                    Eleans and Lacedaemonians, held out for the space of three years against the
                    united forces of Achaia and Macedonia; i but they were at last obliged to
                    purchase a peace, by ceding to Philip the whole of Acarnania. As they parted
                    with this province much against their will, however, they watched; all
                    opportunities of wresting it out of the Macedonian’s hands; and with this view
                    they entered into an alliance with Rome, which proved of great service tυ the
                    Romans i in their war with Philip; but growing insolent on account of their
                    services, they soon made war upon their allies, by whom they were overcome, and
                    only obtained a peace upon severe conditions. After the conquest of Macedonia by
                    Paulus Aemilius, they were reduced to a much worse condition; for not only those
                    amongst them who had openly declared for Perseus, but such as were suspected of
                    having favoured him in their hearts, were sent to Rome, in order to clear
                    themselves before the senate; and there they were detained, and never afterwards
                    suffered to return to their native country. Five hundred and fifty of the chief
                    men of the nation were barbarously assassinated by the partizans of Rome, for no
                    other crime than that of being suspected of wishing well to Pcrseus. The
                    Etolians appeared before Paulus Aemilius in mourning habits, and made loud
                    complaints of this inhuman treatment; but they obtained no redress; and ten
                    commissioners, who had been sent by the senate to settle the affairs of Greece,
                    decreed <hi rend="superscript"> ιat</hi> those who were killed had suffered
                    justly, since it appeared that they had favoured the Macedonian party.</p>
                <p>rom this time the chief honours and employments in the tohan republic were only
                    conferred upon those who were <hi rend="superscript"> nρ</hi> ' <hi
                    rend="superscript"> vn</hi> to prefer the interest of Rome to that of their
                    country; and as such persons were alone countenanced of <hi rend="superscript">
                    0t</hi> ne, all the magistrates of Etolia became the creatures nc mere tools of
                    the Roman senate. In this state of ser- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> c
                    subjection they continued until the destruction of Corinth and the dissolution
                    of the Acĥaean league, when Etolia, with the other free states of Greece, was
                    reduced to the condition of a Roman province, and called the province of Achaia.
                    Nevertheless, each state and city was governed by its own laws, under the
                    superintendence of the praetor whom Rome sent annually into Achaia: the whole
                    nation paid a certain tribute; and the rich were forbidden to possess lands
                    anywhere except in their own country.</p>
                <p>In this state Etolia continued, with little alteration, under the emperors, till
                    the reign of Constantine the Great, who, in his new partition of the provinces
                    of the empire, divided the western parts of Greece from the other, calling them
                    <hi rend="italic">New Epirus,</hi> and subjecting the whole country to <hi
                    rend="italic">Úie praefectus praetorii</hi> for Illyricum. Under the successors
                    of Constantine, Greece was parcelled out into several principalities, especially
                    after the taking of Constantinople by the western princes. At that time
                    Theodorus Angelus, a noble Grecian, of the imperial family, seized on Etolia and
                    Epirus, the former of which he left to Michael his son, who maintained it
                    against Michael Palaeologus, the first emperor of the Greeks, after the
                    expulsion of the Latins. Charles, the last prince of this family, having died
                    without issue in 1430, bequeathed Etolia to his brother’s son, also named
                    Charles, and Acarnania to his natural sons Memnon, Turnus, and Hercules; but
                    great disputes having arisen about this division, Amurath II. after the
                    reduction of Thessalonica, laid hold of the favourable opportunity thus offered,
                    and in 1432 drove them all out. But the Mahommedans were afterwards dispossessed
                    of this country by George Castriot, prince of Epirus; who, with a small army,
                    opposed the whole power of the Ottoman empire, and defeated the Turks in
                    twenty-two pitched battles. Tþat hero, at his death, left the greater part of
                    Etolia to the Venetians; but the latter not being able to make head against the
                    Ottoman power, the whole country was soon reduced by Mahommed II.</p>
