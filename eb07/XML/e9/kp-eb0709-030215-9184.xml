                <p><label type="entry">EPAMINONDAS</label>, son of Polymnis the Theban, born about
                    410 B. c., was one of those distinguished characters whose appearance forms an
                    epoch in the history of their country. The position of Thebes was not such as to
                    enable it to take a prominent part in the affairs of Greece; and, excepting
                    during the short period when Epaminondas and Pelopides were at the head of the
                    government, it seems to have been dependent either on Sparta or on Athens,
                    according as the power of the one or the other prevailed. The earlier years of
                    Epaminondas were spent under the direction of Lysis the Pythagorean philosopher;
                    and, if we may credit the story told by Diodθ rus, he was the fellow-student of
                    Philip of Macedonia. Devoted though he seems to have been to the study of
                    philosophy, he did not neglect those lighter accomplishments which add grace to
                    the character; and Nepos even thinks it necessary to tell us the names of the
                    masters from whom he derived his knowledge of music and dan cing. ...</p>
                <p>At the period when Epaminondas appeared upon the stage, the small republics of
                    Greece were torn to pieces by intestine dissensions; at one time the party of
                    the ∏c and noble prevailed, at another the power of the demθ∙ cracy was
                    predominant. Of the latter party Athens was the main prop, whilst Sparta was the
                    powerful friend o the former. It does not appear that Epaminondas in h <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ιs</hi> earlier years took any prominent part in support of
                    either faction, being probably disgusted by the intrigues and remorseless
                    cruelty which he saw practised by all parties <hi rend="superscript">
                    1,1</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193749197" xml:id="kp-eb0709-9197-0303"/> -the
                    pursuit of whatever object they had in view. He was present indeed at the battle
                    of Mantinea (385 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.),</hi> fought between the Arcadians
                    and Spartans; and it was mainly through his efforts that it was decided in
                    favour of the latter, on the very same ground which was destined a few years
                    afterwards (362 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.)</hi> to witness his own death, and
                    the defeat of his allies.</p>
                <p>During the whole period of his political life his friendship with Pelopidas was
                    uninterrupted, and, according to Plutarch, nothing reflected greater glory on
                    both, than that they never allowed a feeling of rivalry to interfere with their
                    exertions for their common country. Yet no two individuals could possibly be
                    more dissimilar in character, as Pelopidas loved all the pomp and splendour of
                    power, whilst Epaminondas was better pleased to remain in poverty and
                    retirement. The nobles, mistrusting their own strength, received a Spartan
                    garrison (382 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>) into their citadel, and Pelopidas
                    and the chiefs’of the popular party were banished; but Epaminondas, who was
                    supposed to be more engaged in the speculations of philosophy than in the active
                    affairs of life, was allowed to remain. Three years afterwards a conspiracy was
                    formed to recover the independence of Thebes; but though his friend Pelopidas
                    was at its head, Epaminondas refused to join in the attempt, wisely judging that
                    the bloodshed and rapine which would inevitably follow any violent change in the
                    government must more than counterbalance the good anticipated from the success
                    of the popular party. The conspirators succeeded without his assistance, yet
                    prudently adopted the moderate counsels which he recommended. The Spartans made
                    an attempt to recover their power, but, being defeated by Pelopidas, were
                    induced to listen to terms of accommodation. A general diet of all the states of
                    Greece was summoned at Sparta, in order that peace might be established on just
                    and sound principles. Epaminondas was the deputy appointed by Thebes, and the
                    able manner in which he maintained the interests of his country did not
                    disappoint the expectations of his fellow-citizens. He refused to emancipate the
                    cities of Boeotia from the control of Thebes, unless Sparta was prepared to act
                    the same part towards those subject to her in Laconia. Negotiations were broken
                    off, as neither party showed a disposition to yield, and orders were sent to
                    Cleombrotus the Spartan general, then in Phocis, to commence hostilities against
                    the Thebans. It was now that dpaminondas, by the consent of all, was appointed
                    to the chief command, and the measures which he took to protect the country from
                    the incursions of Cleombrotus were so complete that they compelled the Spartan
                    general to ∙etire from Chaeronea, where he had taken up his position.
                    Cleombrotus descended from the mountains to the sea shore, and passing along the
                    difficult and rugged coast at he foot of Mount Helicon, reached without
                    interruption he plains of Leuctra, at no great distance from Thebes. Here he
                    found the troops of the Thebans posted on the <hi rend="superscript"> ler</hi>
                    ghts around; and in the council of war which was held required all the ability
                    of Epaminondas to persuade the ’mcers that the fate of their country ought to be
                    staked on he chances of a general engagement. In this, however, ıe succeeded,
                    and immediately drew out his men in order &gt;f battle.</p>
                <p>The result of his arrangements was <hi rend="italic">a</hi> complete victory,
                    gained in July 371 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c. To</hi> his friends who

                    was corned, however, to retire, by the able generalship of Agesilaus, though not
                    until he had devastated the whole country around. On his return home he was
                    brought to trial, along with Pelopidas and the other generals, tor having
                    retained his command four months beyond the time specified by law. He
                    recommended the other generals to plead as their excuse his superior orders, and
                    then boldly said to the assembly, “I acknowledge that the law condemns me to
                    death; all I ask is, that the sentence passed on me may be couched in these
                    words: Epaminondas was punished for having conquered the Spartans at Leuctra,
                    for having besieged Lacedaemon, and rebuilt Messene.” The boldness of this
                    answer was of course applauded, and Epaminondas acquitted; yet his enemies had
                    sufficient influence with the people to exclude him from all honourable
                    employment. Some time afterwards he redeemed his character by a successful
                    campaign against Alexander, the tyrant of Pherae, in Thessaly, and by delivering
                    his friend Pelopidas from the hands of that unprincipled despot. A war broke out
                    between the Tegeates in Arcadia, who had implored the assistance of the Thebans,
                    and the Mantineans, who were supported by Lacedemon. The two armies met near
                    Mantinea, the modern village <hi rend="italic">oĩ Paleopoli,</hi> when
                    Epaminondas employing a manoeuvre similar to that which had succeeded at
                    Leuctra, gained a complete victory, but was wounded by a javelin, the iron point
                    of which remained in his body. Before he expired, he inquired for the generals
                    Deiphantus and Jollidas, and being told they were dead, he*added, “Then persuade
                    the Thebans to make peace.” In fact, from this moment, Thebes, to use the
                    expression of an ancient writer, was a javelin deprived of its iron point, and
                    ceased to be formidable. Epaminondas died on the 4th July 362 <hi

                    of a great captain, a true patriot, and a philosophic sage.</p>
                <p>His life was written by Plutarch, but it has been unfortunately lost; there are,
                    however, many details of it contained in the lives of Agesilaus and Pelopidas,
                    and also in his moral works. But it is to Xenophon that we are indebted for the
                    chief facts. The life of Epaminondas by Cornelius Nepos has been evidently
                    mutilated. The reader may also consult Diodorus Siculus, x. xvi. xv.; Pausanias,
                    Polybius, Aelian, and Valerius Maximus. A long and uninteresting life has been
                    published by De la Tour, Paris 1739, 12mo; by Meismer, in German, !2mo, Prague,
