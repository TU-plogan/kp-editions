                <p><label type="entry">EXCHANGE</label>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> political economy the term exchange is commonly
                    employed to designate that species of mercantile transactions by which the debts
                    of individuals residing at a distance from each other are either partially or
                    wholly liquidated, without the intervention of money. The object of this article
                    is to explain the nature of these transactions, and the principles on which they
                    are founded.</p>
                <p>This will be best effected by treating, <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> of the
                    exchange between different parts of the same country; and, <hi rend="italic"
                    >secondly,</hi> of that between different and independent countries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Inland Exchange.</hi></p>
                <p>Suppose a merchant of London orders his agent in Glasgow to purchase and send to
                    him a thousand pounds worth of cottons; then, although it should not suit the
                    Glasgow merchant to commission goods of equal value from his London
                    correspondent, the latter may nevertheless be under no necessity of remitting
                    cash to Glasgow to discharge his debt. Among cities, or countries, having a
                    considerable intercourse together, the debts mutually due by each other are
                    round, in ordinary cases, to be nearly equal. And, therefore, the Glasgow
                    merchant, who has shipped the cottons for London, does not transmit the bill
                    drawn by him bn his correspondent for their price directly to London to be
                    cashed, for that would subject him to the expense of conveying the money home
                    from London to Glasgow, but he gets its value from <hi rend="italic">some other
                    merchant i</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> η</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Glasgow,</hi> who has payments to make in London, on account of teas, wines,
                    &amp;c. imported from that city, and who, unless he could procure such a bill,
                    would be obliged to remit their price in money. The bill on account of the
                    cottons is, therefore, either drawn in favour of the person to whom the money
                    for the tea and wine is owing in London, or it is drawn in favour of the tea
                    merchant in Glasgow, and indorsed to him; and this last person, by presenting
                    the bill to the purchaser of the cottons, receives its value, and consequently
                    the price of the cottons, and the price, or part of the price, of his tea and
                    wine, at the same moment. By this simple contrivance the expense and risk
                    attending the double transmission, first, of money from London to Glasgow to pay
                    the cottons, and, second, of money from Glasgow to London to pay the teas and
                    wines, is entirely avoided. The debtor in one place is changed for the debtor in
                    the other; and both accounts are settled without the intervention of a single
                    farthing.</p>
                <p>The bill drawn and negotiated in such a transaction as this is termed an <hi
                    rend="italic">inland</hi> bill of exchange. If the transaction had taken place
                    between London or Glasgow and a foreign city, it would have been termed a <hi
                    rend="italic">foreign</hi> bill of exchange.</p>
                <p>A bill of exchange may, therefore, be defined to be, “an order addressed to some
                    person residing at a distance, directing him to pay a certain specified sum to
                    the person in whose favour the bill is drawn, or his order.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In mercantile phraseology,
                    the person who draws a hill is termed the drawer; the person in whose favour it
                    is drawn the rerrn - ter; the person on whom it is drawn the drawee, and after
                    he has accepted, the acceptor. Those persons into whose hands the bill may pass
                    previously to its being paid, are, from their writing their names on the back,
                    termed indorsers; and the person in whose possession the bill is at any given
                    period, is termed the holder or possessor.</p></note></p>
                <p>The price of bills of exchange fluctuates according to ’ the abundance or
                    scarcity of them in the market, compared with the demand. Thus, to revert to our
                    former example, if we suppose the debts reciprocally due by London and Glasgow
                    to be equal, whether they amount to∣ L. 10,000, L. 100,000, or any other sum,
                    they may all be discharged without the agency of money, and the pnce of&lt;
                    bills of exchange will be at <hi rend="smallcaps">par</hi>; that is, a sum of
                    L.lθθ <pb break="no" facs="nls:193750939" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0939-0437"/>or
                    L.1000 in Glasgow will purchase a bill for L.100 or L.1000 payable in London,
                    and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> But if these two cities are not mutually
                    indebted in equal sums, then the price of bills of exchange will be increased in
                    the city which has the greatest number of payments to make, and will be
                    proportionally reduced in that which has the fewest. If Glasgow owe London L.
                    100,000, whilst the debts due by London to Glasgow only amount to L.90,000, it
                    is clear, inasmuch as the merchants of Glasgow have a larger sum to remit to
                    London than the merchants of London have to remit to Glasgow, that the price of
                    bills on London would rise in Glasgow, because of the increased competition; and
                    that the price of bills on Glasgow would fall in London, because of the
                    proportionally diminished competition. And hence a larger sum would be-required
                    to discharge any given amount of debt due by Glasgow, and a less sum would be
                    required to discharge a corresponding amount of debt due by London; or, which is
                    the same thing, the exchange would be in <hi rend="italic">favour</hi> of
                    London, and <hi rend="italic">against</hi> Glasgow. Bills on London would sell
                    in Glasgow for a <hi rend="italic">premium,</hi> and bills on Glasgow would sell
                    in London ât a <hi rend="italic">discount,</hi> the amount of the premium in the
                    one case, and of the discount in the other, being obviously equal.</p>
                <p>On the supposition that the balance of L.10,000, due by Glasgow, depressed the
                    exchange of that city on London <hi rend="italic">one per cent.,</hi> it would
                    at first sight appear as if it would cost Glasgow L.101,000 to discharge its
                    debt of L.100,000 due to London; and that, on the other hand, L.89,108 would be
                    sufficient to discharge the debt of London to Glasgow. But a very little
                    consideration will serve to show that this could not really be .the case. No
                    exchange transactions can take place between different cities, until there be
                    both debtors and creditors of the one residing in the other. And hence, when the
                    exchange became unfavourable to Glasgow, the premium paid by the Glasgow
                    merchants for bills drawn on London would not go into the pockets of their
                    creditors in that city, but into the pockets <hi rend="italic">of their
                    neighbours in Glasgow, to whom London was indebted,</hi> and from whom the bills
                    had been purchased. The loss to Glasgow would, therefore, be limited to the <hi
                    rend="italic">premium</hi> paid on the balance of L.10,000. Thus, supposing that
                    A of Glasgow owes D of London L.100,000, and that Cof London owes B of Glasgow
                    L.90,000; A will pay to B L.91,000 for a bill, or order, on C to pay D L.90,000.
                    In this way, the L.90,000 London debt at Glasgow would be quite cleared off; the
                    premium, which is lost by the debtor to London in Glasgow, being gained by its
                    creditor in the same place. If the business had been transacted in London, C,
                    with L.89,108, would have purchased of D a bill for L.90,000 payable by A, so
                    that, in this case, the gain would have fallen to the share of the debtor C, and
                    the loss to that of the creditor D, both of London. The complexity of real
                    transactions does not affect the principles on which they are founded; and to
                    whatever extent Glasgow might be indebted to London, or London to Glasgow, the
                    only disadvantage under which either of them would in consequence be placed,
                    would be the unavoidable one of paying the expense of remitting the <hi
                    rend="italic">balance</hi> of debt.</p>
                <p>The expense of transmitting money from one place to another forms the natural
                    limit to fluctuations in the exchange. If20s. sufficed to cover the expense and
                    risk attending the transmission of L.100 from Glasgow to London, it would be
                    indifferent to a Glasgow merchant, whether aθ paid one per cent. <hi
                    rend="italic">premium</hi> for a bill of exchange on London, or remitted money
                    direct to that city. If the premium were less than one per cent, it would be
                    clearly his interest rather to make his payments by means of bills of exchange
                    than by remittances; and that it could not exceed one per cent, is obvious, for
                    every individual would <hi rend="superscript"> ra</hi> ther directly remit
                    money, than incur an unnecessary expense, by purchasing a bill on London at a
                    greater <hi rend="italic">premium</hi> than would suffice to cover the expense
                    of a money remittance. If, owing to the badness of the roads, to disturbances in
                    the country, or to any other cause, the expense of remitting money from Glasgow
                    to London should be increased, the difference in the rate of exchange between
                    them <hi rend="italic">might</hi> also be proportionally increased. But in every
                    case, the extent to which this difference could attain would necessarily be
                    limited by, and could not, for any considerable period, exceed, the cost of m
                    <hi rend="underline">aki</hi> ng remittances in cash.</p>
                <p>Exchange transactions become more complex, when one place, as is very often the
                    case, discharges its debts to another by means of bills drawn on a third place.
                    Thus, although London should owe nothing to Glasgow, if Glasgow be indebted to
                    London, London to Manchester, and Manchester to Glasgow; Glasgow would either
                    wholly or partially discharge its debt to London by a bill drawn on Manchester.
                    It would wholly discharge it, provided the debt due to Glasgow in Manchester was
                    equivalent to the debt due by Glasgow to London. But if this be not the case,
                    Glasgow must either remit money to London to discharge the <hi rend="italic"
                    >balance</hi> of debt, or bills drawn on some other place indebted to her.</p>
                <p>Transactions in inland bills of exchange are almost entirely conducted by
                    bankers, who charge a certain rate per cent, for their trouble, and who, by
                    having a credit in those places to which they are in the habit of remitting
                    bills, are enabled, on all occasions, to supply the demands of their customers.
                    In Great Britain, London, because of its intimate connection with other parts of
                    the country, occasioned partly by its immense commerce, partly by its being the
                    seat of government, and the place to which the revenue is remitted, and partly
                    by its currency consisting of Bank of England paper, for which the paper
                    currency of the country banks is rendered exchangeable, has become the great
                    focus in which all the money transactions of the empire centre, and in which
                    they are ultimately adjusted. In consequence of these various circumstances, but
                    chiefly of the demand for bills on London to remit revenue, and of the superior
                    value of Bank of England currency, the exchange between London and the other
                    parts of the country is invariably in its favour. Bills on London drawn in
                    Edinburgh and Glasgow were formerly made payable at forty days’ date, which is
                    equivalent to a <hi rend="italic">premium</hi> of about one half per cent.; but,
                    owing to the greater facility of communication, this <hi rend="italic"
                    >premium</hi> is now reduced to twenty days’ interest, or to about one fourth
                    per cent. Bills for remitting the revenue from Scotland are now drawn at thirty
                    days; previously to 1819 they were drawn at sixty days.</p>
                <p>What has been already stated is sufficient to show, that, however well fitted
                    bills of exchange may be for facilitating the operations of commerce, and saving
                    the trouble and expense attending the transportation of money, it is impossible
                    to adjust mercantile transactions by their means, except in so far as the
                    accounts mutually balance each other. A <hi rend="italic">real</hi> bill of
                    exchange is merely an order entitling the holder to receive payment of a debt
                    <hi rend="italic">previously contracted</hi> by the person on whom it is drawn.
                    It is essential to the existence of such a bill that an equivalent amount of
                    debt should first be due. And hence, as the amount of the real bills of exchange
                    drawn on any number of merchants cannot exceed the amount of their debts, if a
                    greater sum be owing them than they owe to others, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >balance,</hi> it is obvious, must either be paid in money, or by the delivery
                    of some sort of commodities. If, as in the example just given, Glasgow owe
                    London L.100,000, while London only owes Glasgow L.90,000, a reciprocal transfer
                    of debts may be made to the extent of L.90,000. But the Glasgow merchants cannot
                    discharge <pb break="no" facs="nls:193750952" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0952-0438"/>the
                    additional L.10,000 by means of bills drawn on London; for, by the supposition,
                    London only owed them L.90,000, and they have already drawn for its amount. The
                    balance, therefore, must be discharged by an actual money payment, or by the
                    delivery of some species of commodity, or by bills drawn on some third party who
                    may be indebted to Glasgow.</p>
                <p>We do not mean by this to insinuate that there are no <hi rend="italic"
                    >fictitious</hi> bills of exchange, or bills drawn on persons who are not really
                    indebted to the drawer, in the market. In every commercial country, bills of
                    this description are always to be met with; but they are only a device for
                    obtaining loans, and do not and cannot transfer real debts. A merchant in London
                    may form a connection with a merchant in Glasgow, and draw bills of exchange
                    upon him payable a certain number of days after date, which the latter may
                    retire by selling in Glasgow an equal amount of bills drawn upon his
                    correspondent in London. The merchants who purchase, or the bankers who discount
                    these bills, really advance their value to the drawers, who, as long as they
                    continue, by means of this system of <hi rend="italic">drawing</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">redrawing,</hi> to provide funds for their payment, continue in
                    fact to command a borrowed capital equal to the amount of the fictitious paper
                    in circulation. It is clear, however, that the negotiation of such bills has no
                    effect in the way of transferring and settling the real <hi rend="italic">bona
                    fide</hi> debts reciprocally due between any two or more places. Fictitious
                    bills mutually balance each other. Those drawn by London on Glasgow are exactly
                    equal to those drawn by Glasgow on London, for the one set is drawn to pay the
                    other—the second destroys the first, and the result is nothing.</p>
                <p>The method of raising money by the discount or sale of fictitious bills, has been
                    severely censured by Dr Smith, as entailing a ruinous expense on those engaged
                    in it, and as being resorted to only by projectors, or persons of suspicious
                    credit. When fictitious bills are drawn at two months’ date, it is common, in
                    addition to the ordinary interest of five per cent, to charge a commission of
                    One half per cent., which must be paid every time the bill is discounted, or, at
                    least, <hi rend="italic">six</hi> times in the year. The total expense of money
                    raised in this way could not, therefore, supposing the transaction to be always
                    on account of the same individual, be estimated at less than eight per cent, per
                    annum; and the payment of so high a rate of interest on borrowed capital, in a
                    country where the ordinary rate of mercantile profit is only supposed to average
                    from <hi rend="italic">six</hi> to <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> per cent., could
                    not fail to be generally productive of ruin to the borrower. It seldom happens,
                    however, that in transactions carried on by means of fictitious bills, the whole
                    charge for commission falls on one individual. Loans obtained in this way are
                    almost always on account of two or more persons. Thus, at one time a fictitious
                    bill may be drawn by A of London on B of Glasgow; and, in this case, the Glasgow
                    merchant will, before the bill becomes due, draw upon his London correspondent
                    for the proceeds of the bill, including interest and commission. At another
                    time, however, the transaction will Joe on account of B of Glasgow, who will
                    then have to pay commission to his friend in London; so that each party may, on
                    the whole, as Mr Thornton has observed, gain about as much as he pays in the
                    shape of commission.</p>
                <p>It is often extremely difficult to distinguish between a fictitious bill and one
                    which has arisen out of a real mercantile transaction. Neither does it seem to
                    be of any very material importance. The credit of the persons whose names are
                    attached to the bills offered for discount, is the only real criterion by which
                    either a private merchant or a banker can judge whether he ought to negotiate
                    them. The circumstance of a merchant offering considerable quantities of
                    accommodation paper for discount, ought, unquestionably, if discovered, to
                    excite suspicions as to his credit. But unless in so far as the drawing of
                    fictitious bills may be held to be indicative of over-trading, or of a
                    deficiency of capital to carry on the business in which the party is engaged,
                    there does not appear to be any good reason for refusing to discount them.</p>
                <p>These few observations will, perhaps, suffice to explain the manner in which
                    transactions between different parts of the Same country are settled by means of
                    bills of exchange. They are, in general, extremely simple. The uniform value of
                    the currency of a particular country renders all comparison between the value of
                    money at the place where the bill is drawn and negotiated with its value where
                    it is to be paid, unnecessary; while the constant intercourse maintained amongst
                    the different commercial cities of the same kingdom, by preventing those
                    derangements to which the intercourse between distant and independent countries
                    is always subject, prevents those sudden fluctuations which so frequently occur
                    in the market price of foreign bills of exchange. We shall, therefore, leave
                    this part of our subject, and proceed to investigate the circumstances which
                    influence the course of exchange between different and independent
                    countries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Foreign Exchange.</hi></p>
                <p>The price of foreign bills of exchange depends entirely on two circumstances, <hi
                    rend="italic">first,</hi> on the value of the currency at the place where they
                    are made payable, compared with the value of the currency at the place where
                    they are drawn; and, <hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi> on the relation which the
                    supply of bills in the market bears to the demand.</p>
                <p>If the real and nominal value of the currencies of the different nations having
                    an intercourse together remained invariable, such fluctuations in the price of
                    bills of exchange as arise from the first of these circumstances would be
                    altogether unknown. But as the comparative value of the pound sterling, dollar,
                    franc, guilder, florin, &amp;c. is subject to perpetual variation, the price of
                    bills of exchange must vary accordingly. Such variations, however, as proceed
                    from this cause, affect merely their <hi rend="italic">nominal,</hi> or rather
                    numerical value. It is those only which arise from variations in the supply and
                    demand for bills, or, which is the same thing, in the payments a country has to
                    make compared with those it has to receive, that can be considered as <hi
                    rend="italic">real</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and hence the distinctions of
                    <hi rend="italic">nominal, real,</hi> aŋd <hi rend="italic">computed</hi>
                    exchange. The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> depends on alterations m the value of
                    the currencies compared together; the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> depends on
                    the supply of bills in the market compared with the demand; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">third</hi> or <hi rend="italic">computed</hi> exchange depends on
                    the combined effects of the other two. For the sake of perspicuity we shall
                    treat of these separately.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Bullion being everywhere recognised as the standard currency of the commercial
                    world, the comparative value of the currencies of particular countries must
                    depend, 1st, on the value of bullion in those countries; and, 2<hi rend="italic"
                    >dly,</hi> on <pb break="no" facs="nls:193750965" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0965-0439"
                    />the <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi> of bullion contained in their coins, or on
                    the quantity of bullion for which their paper money, or other circulating media,
                    will exchange.</p>
                <p>I. The real price of commodities being always proportioned not merely to the cost
                    of their production, but also to the cost of their conveyance from where they
                    have been produced to where they are to be made use of, it follows, that if the
                    trade in the precious metals were perfectly free, and if the commodities
                    produced in different countries were nearly all equally well fitted for
                    exportation, the value of bullion in different countries would be chiefly
                    regulated by their respective distances from the mines. Thus, on the supposition
                    that neither England nor Poland had any other commodities except corn to
                    exchange with the South Americans for bullion, it is evident that the precious
                    metals would possess a greater value in Poland than in England, because of the
                    greater expense of sending so bulky a commodity as corn the more distant voyage,
                    and because of the greater expense of conveying the gold to Poland. If Poland,
                    however, had succeeded in carrying her manufactures to a higher pitch of
                    improvement than England, her merchants might be able, notwithstanding the
                    disadvantage of distance, by exporting commodities possessed of great value in
                    small bulk, and on which the expense of freight would be comparatively trifling,
                    to sell bullion on cheaper terms than those of England. But if, as is actually
                    the case, the advantages of skill and machinery were possessed by England,
                    another reason would be added to that derived from her less distance from the
                    mines, why gold and silver should be less valuable in England than in Poland,
                    and why the money price of commodities should be higher in the former. (Ricardo,
                    <hi rend="italic">Principles of Political Economy,</hi> &amp;c. 1st ed. p.
                    175.)</p>
                <p>Hence, after nations have attained to different degrees of excellence in
                    manufacturing industry, the value of bullion in different countries no longer
                    depends entirely on their distance from the mines. But, whatever variations a
                    different progress in the arts may occasion in the value of bullion in different
                    countries, it is certain that it must always be less valuable in those into
                    which it is imported, than in those where it is produced. Bullion, like every
                    other commodity, <hi rend="italic">is exported to find, not to destroy its
                    level.</hi> And unless its value in Europe exceeded its value in America by a
                    sum sufficient to cover the expenses attending its importation, and to yield the
                    ordinary rate of profit to the importer, we should not, although the mines of
                    Mexicoand Peru were infinitely more productive, import from them a single ounce
                    of bullion. It is obviously incorrect, therefore, to lay down as a general
                    proposition, “that the par of exchange between tw <hi rend="superscript"> χ</hi>
                    o countries is that sum of the currency of either of the two, which, in point of
                    intrinsic worth, is precisely equal to a given sum of the other, <hi
                    rend="italic">that contains precisely an equal weight of gold and silver of the
                    same fineness^ (Bullion Report,</hi> p. 22, 8vo ed.) For a given quantity of
                    gold and silver is not always, as is here assumed, of the same intrinsic value
                    in different connues. It ∏ <hi rend="subscript"> la</hi> y <hi rend="subscript">
                    no</hi> t, indeed, differ very materially among nations in the immediate
                    vicinity of each other, and which are all destitute of mines. But although, to
                    use a familiar illustration, the value of sugar approaches nearly to a level in
                    the great trading cities of Europe, it cannot surely be maintained that its
                    value in the West Indies is the same with its value in Bordeaux or Liverpool, or
                    that the exchange would be really at par, if a bill, which cost a hundred
                    hogsheads of sugar in London, only brought a hun-red in Jamaica. Now, this is
                    precisely the case with bul- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> on. I hough the
                    value of gold and silver, as compared with corn, labour, &amp;c. may, and indeed
                    must, vary very °nsiderably among the different European nations, these
                    variations are only the necessary result of their different progress in
                    industry, and of the different quality of their cultivated lands, &amp;c. Such
                    differences of price are in the natural order of things; and bullion has only
                    found its propel level when a quantity has been introduced into those countries
                    which excel in manufactures, sufficient to raise the price of their corn and
                    labour. These variations have, therefore, no effect on the exchange. An ounce of
                    bullion in one country, notwithstanding this difference of price, will, because
                    of the facility of intercourse, be very near equivalent to an ounce of bullion
                    in another; and, supposing the trade in the precious metals to be perfectly
                    free, the exchange will be at true par when bills are negotiated on this
                    footing. But when we compare the values of the precious metals in distant
                    countries, and especially in those where they are produced, with those into
                    which they are imported, it is obvious they must differ considerably. Gold and
                    silver, like iron, coal, tin, &amp;c. are necessarily cheaper in countries
                    possessed of extraordinarily productive mines, than in those possessed only of
                    mines of a secondary degree of fertility, or when they have to be entirely
                    imported from abroad. And the exchange between such places is not at true par,
                    unless adequate allowance be made for this difference of value. Thus, if,
                    because of the expense of carriage, the value of bullion in Great Britain is
                    five per cent, greater than in Rio Jeneiro, a hundred ounces of pure gold in Rio
                    Janeiro would not be worth a hundred ounces of pure gold in London, but five per
                    cent, less; and the exchange would be at true par when bills for a hundred and
                    five ounces of standard bullion payable in Rio Janeiro, sold in London for a
                    hundred ounces.</p>
                <p>The differences in the value of the precious metals in different countries have
                    not been confined to those depending on their respective distances from the
                    mines, or on their different progress in the arts. The opinion formerly so very
                    prevalent, that gold and silver were the only articles that constituted real
                    wealth, induced almost every commercial nation to fetter and restrict their
                    exportation, and to adopt a variety of measures intended to facilitate their
                    importation. But these regulations, even when most rigorously enforced, have
                    been singularly ineffectual; the great value and small bulk of the precious
                    metals rendering it not only extremely advantageous, but also comparatively
                    easy, clandestinely to export them, whenever their relative value declined.</p>
                <p>“When,” says Dr Smith, “the quantity of gold and silver imported into any country
                    exceeds the effectual demand, no vigilance of government can prevent their
                    exportation. All the sanguinary laws of Spain and Portugal are not able to keep
                    their gold and silver at home. The continual importations from Peru and Brazil
                    exceed the effectual demand of those countries, and sink the price of these
                    metals <hi rend="italic">below</hi> their price in the neighbouring countries.
                    If, on the contrary, in any particular country their quantity fell short of the
                    effectual demand, so as to raise their price <hi rend="italic">above</hi> that
                    of the neighbouring countries, the government would have no occasion to take any
                    pains to import them. If it were even to take the pains to prevent their
                    importation, it would not be able to effect it. Those metals, when the Spartans
                    had got wherewithal to purchase them, broke through all the barriers which the
                    laws of Lycurgus opposed to their entrance into Lacedaemon. All the sanguinary
                    laws of the customs are not able to prevent the importation of teas of the Dutch
                    and Gottenburg East India Companies, because somewhat cheaper than those of the
                    British Company. A pound of tea, however, is about a hundred times the bulk of
                    one of the highest prices, 16s., that is commonly paid for it in silver, and
                    more than two thousand times the bulk of the same price in gold, and is
                    consequently just so many times <pb break="no" facs="nls:193750978"

                    Wealth of Nations,</hi> vol. ii. p. 149.)</p>
                <p>But, however ineffectual as a means of entirely preventing the egress of the
                    precious metals, the restrictions on their exportation have nevertheless
                    contributed to occasion some slight variations in their value in different
                    countries. The risk incurred by the clandestine exporters of bullion from Spain
                    is supposed to be equivalent to about two per cent.; or, which is the same
                    thing, it is supposed that the restrictions maintain such an excess of gold and
                    silver in that country as to sink their value two per cent, below their value in
                    countries having a free trade in bullion. In calculating the true par of
                    exchange between Spain and other countries, this circumstance must be taken into
                    account. For to whatever extent the value of bullion in one country may be
                    reduced below its value in those with which it maintains an intercourse, the
                    nominal exchange must necessarily be unfavourable to that extent.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>All restraints on the
                    exportation of the precious metals were abolished in Great Britain in 1819.
                    Their effect for many years previous could not be estimated at above one fourth
                    per cent.</p></note></p>
                <p>It consequently results, that whatever occasions a rise or fall in the value of
                    the precious metals in a particular country, must proportionally affect its
                    nominal exchange with other countries. If more coin, or convertible paper,
                    circulated in Great Britain, compared with the business it has to perform, than
                    what circulates in other countries, its relative value would, in consequence, be
                    diminished. Foreign bills would sell for a premium, the amount of which would be
                    precisely equal to the excess of the value of the precious metals in the foreign
                    market, caused by their redundancy in the home market; and, on the other hand,
                    in the event of the currency becoming relatively deficient, its value would be
                    proportionally increased ;—bills drawn on foreign countries would sell at a
                    discount, the amount of which would measure the excess of the value of the
                    currency of this over that of other countries.</p>
                <p>II. In estimating the quantity of bullion contained in the currencies of
                    different countries, a particular coin of one country, such as the British pound
                    sterling, is selected as an <hi rend="italic">integer</hi> or standard of
                    comparison, and the proportion between it and the coins of other countries,
                    supposing •them to be of their <hi rend="italic">mint standard weight and
                    fineness,</hi> is ascertained by experiment. A par of exchange is thus
                    established, or rather it is ascertained that a certain amount of the standard
                    currency of a particular country contains precisely as much gold or silver of
                    the same fineness, as is contained in the coin or integer with which it has been
                    compared. This relation, or par as it is technically termed, is considered
                    invariable; and allowance is made for subsequent variations in the quantities
                    and purity of the bullion contained in the currencies of countries trading
                    together, by rating the exchange at so much above or below par. In mercantile
                    language, that country, by a comparison with one or other of whose coins the par
                    of exchange has been established, is said to give the <hi rend="italic"
                    >certain</hi> for the <hi rend="italic">uncertain,</hi> and conversely. Thus, in
                    the exchange between London and Paris, London and Hamburg, &amp;c. London gives
                    the <hi rend="italic">certain,</hi> or the pound sterling, for an <hi
                    rend="italic">uncertain</hi> or variable number of francs, florins, &amp;c.
                    Hence, the higher the exchange between any two countries, the more is it in
                    favour of that which gives the <hi rend="italic">certain,</hi> and the lower,
                    the more is it in favour of that which gives the <hi rend="italic"
                    >uncertain.</hi></p>
                <p>On the supposition, which is very near the truth, that twenty-five francs contain
                    the same quantity of standard bullion as a pound sterling (twenty-five francs,
                    twenty centimes, is the exact par), and supposing also that the value of bullion
                    is the same in both countries, the exchange between London and Paris will be at
                    par, when a bill drawn, by a merchant in the one on his correspondent in the
                    other sells at that rate; that is, when a bill of exchange for 2500 or 25,000
                    francs payable in Paris, sells in London, for L.100 or L∙1000, and <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> It is but seldom,, however, that the coins of any
                    country correspond exactly' with their mint standard; unless, when newly issued,
                    they' are all either more or less worn; and whenever this is the* case, an
                    allowance corresponding to the difference between the actual value of the coins
                    and their mint value must be made in estimating “<hi rend="italic">the sum of
                    the existing currency</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> O</hi><hi rend="italic">ĵ
                    either of two countries which contains precisely the same quantity of bullion as
                    is contained in a given sum of the other”</hi> Thus, if the one pound sterling
                    were so worn, clipped, rubbed, &amp;c. as not to contain so much bullion as
                    twenty-five francs, but ten per cent, less, the exchange between London and
                    Paris would be at real par when it was nominally ten per cent, against
                    London;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is necessary
                    to observe, that it is here supposed that the clipped or degraded money exists
                    in such a degree of abundance as on y o pass current at its bullion value. If
                    the quantity of clipped money were sufficiently limited, it might,
                    notwithstanding the' minu ion o weight, pass current at its mint value; and then
                    the par would have to be estimated, not by its relative weight to' reign money,
                    but by the mint price of bullion. This is a principle which must be constantly
                    kept in view.</p></note> and if, on the other hand, the pound sterling was equal
                    to its mint standard, while the franc was ten per cent, less, the exchange
                    between London and Paris would be at real par when it was nominally ten per
                    cent, against Paris and in favour of London. If the currency of both countries
                    were <hi rend="italic">equally</hi> reduced below the standard of their
                    respective mints, then it is obvious there would be no variation in the real
                    par. But whenever the currency of countries trading together is depreciated in
                    an <hi rend="italic">unequal</hi> degree, the exchange is nominally in favour of
                    that country whose currency is least depreciated, and nominally against that
                    whose currency is most depreciated.</p>
                <p>It is almost unnecessary to refer to the history of exchange to show the
                    practical operation of this principle; and we shall content ourselves with
                    selecting the following, from an infinite number of equally conclusive
                    instances.</p>
                <p>In a pamphlet printed in 1604, but written in 1564, it is mentioned, that when
                    Henry VIII. degraded the several species of coin then current, there began to be
                    “<hi rend="italic">some disorder’</hi> in the price of all wares and
                    commodities, which Edward VI. attempted to remedy by diminishing still farther
                    the quantity of pure silver contained in each coin; the consequence was, that
                    <hi rend="italic">the English pound sterling,</hi> which <hi rend="italic"
                    >heretofore exchanged abroad for twenty-six Flemish</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >schillings,</hi><hi rend="italic">became worth no more than thirteen Flemish
                    schillings,</hi> the price of English commodities being at the same time
                    proportionally increased. (Mr John Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of
                    Wool,</hi> vol. i. p. 105, 8vo. ed.)</p>
                <p>Previously to the great re-coinage in the reign of William III., silver being at
                    that time a legal tender, the <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange between
                    England and Holland, calculated according to the standard of their respective
                    mints, was twenty-five per cent, against England; but inasmuch as English silver
                    coins were then, owing to rubbing and clipping, depreciated more than
                    twenty-five per cent, below their mint value, the real exchange may
                    notwithstanding have been in favour of England. The circumstance of the <hi
                    rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange having become favourable to this country as
                    soon as the new coin was issued, renders this conjecture extremely probable. <hi

                <p>Before the reformation of our gold coin in 1774, the guinea contained so much
                    less than its standard weight as <pb break="no" facs="nls:193750991"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-0991-0441"/>to be degraded from two to three per cent, when
                    compared with the current French coins, and the exchange between England and
                    France was computed to be two or three per cent, <hi rend="italic">against</hi>
                    this country. Upon the reformation of the gold coin the exchange rose to par.
                    The Turkish government, in the course of the last forty years, has made three
                    great alterations in the value of its coin. Before these frauds were committed,
                    the Turkish <hi rend="italic">piastre</hi> contained nearly as much silver as
                    the English <hi rend="italic">half crown</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, in
                    exchange, the par was estimated at <hi rend="italic">eight</hi> piastres to the
                    pound sterling. The consequence of these repeated adulterations has been, the
                    reduction of the silver in the piastre to one half, and a fall in the exchange
                    of 100 per cent.; bills on London having been bought in Turkey, in 1803, at the
                    rate of sixteen piastres for every pound sterling.<note anchored="true"

                    were entirely owing to the alterations in the value of the coin, because the

                    the market, might not be constant; yet the exact correspondence of the fall of
                    exchange with the acknowledged degradation of the coin, renders it more than
                    probable that it proceeded almost entirely from that degradation.<note

                <p>When one country uses gold as the standard of its currency, and another silver,
                    the par of exchange between them is affected by every variation in the relative
                    value of these metals. When gold rises in value compared with silver, the
                    exchange becomes nominally favourable to that country which has the gold
                    standard, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> And hence, in estimating the
                    state of the exchange among countries using different standards, it is always
                    necessary to advert to the comparative values of the metals selected for
                    standards.</p>
                <p>“For example,” to use the words of Mr Mushet, “if 34 schillings 11 grotes and ⅛
                    of Hamburg currency be equal in value to a pound sterling, or ĝ¢- of a guinea,
                    when silver is at 5s. 2d. per oz. they can no longer be so when silver falls to
                    5s. Id. or 5s. an oz. or when it rises to 5s. 3d. or 5s. 4d.; because a pound
                    sterling in gold being then worth more or less silver, is also worth more or
                    less Hamburg currency.</p>
                <p>“To find the real par, therefore, we must ascertain what was the relative value
                    of gold and silver when the par was fixed at 34s. 1 lįg. Hamburg currency, and
                    what is their relative value at the time we wish to calculate it.</p>
                <p>“For example, if the price of standard gold was L.3. 17s. 10⅜d. per oz. and
                    silver 5s. 2d., an ounce of gold would then be worth 15∙07 ounces of silver, and
                    twenty of our standard shillings would then contain as much pure silver as 34s.
                    11 grotes and -ļ-Hamburg currency. But it the ounce of gold were L.3. 17s. lOģd.
                    and silver 5s. (which it was on 2d January 1798), the ounce of gold would then
                    be worth 15∙57 ounces of silver. If L.I sterling at par, therefore, be worth
                    15∙07 ounces of silver, thenat lu∙57 it would be at three per cent, premium; and
                    three per cent, premium on 34s. 1 Iļd. is 1 schilling 1 grote and ¶¾, so that
                    the par, when gold is to silver as 15∙57 to 1, will be 36 schillings 1 grote and

                <p>But the principal source of fluctuations in the nominal price of bills of
                    exchange is to be found in the varying value of the <hi rend="italic">paper</hi>
                    currency of commercial countries. The disorders which universally arose in rude
                    ages from the diminution of the quantity of standard bullion contained in the
                    coins of different countries are now reproduced in another form, and often to a
                    still more ruinous extent, in the depreciation of their paper currency.</p>
                <p>The impossibility of retaining a comparatively large quantity of coin or bullion,
                    or of convertible paper, in a particular country, effectually limited the issues
                    of the Bank of England previously to the Restriction Act of 1797, and sustained
                    the value of our currency on a par with that of other countries. When the bank
                    issued less paper than was necessary for this purpose, the value of the currency
                    becoming relatively great, it became profitable to import bullion, and to send
                    it to the mint to be coined. And, on the other hand, when the bank issued too
                    much paper, and thereby depressed its value relatively to gold, it became
                    profitable to demand payment of its notes, and thereafter to export the species
                    thus obtained either in the shape of coin or as bullion. In this way the bank
                    was compelled to limit its issues when excessive, and, consequently, to put a
                    stop to the demand for gold, by rendering its paper of equal value.</p>
                <p>Had the Bank of England, subsequently to the restriction, issued only such
                    quantities of paper as were required to sustain its value on a par with the
                    value of gold, the act of 1797 would not have occasioned any real difference in
                    our monetary system. But after the bank had been released from the obligation to
                    pay its notes, it was not to be expected that it should be very careful about
                    limiting their number. The restriction <hi rend="italic">enabled</hi> the
                    directors to exchange bits of engraved paper, worth perhaps not more than five
                    shillings a quire, for as many, or the value of as many hundreds of thousands of
                    pounds. And under such circumstances, the only thing to be wondered at is, not
                    that paper money became depreciated, but that its value was not more
                    degraded,—that a still greater quantity of bank-notes were not forced into
                    circulation.</p>
                <p>A country with an inconvertible paper currency, of which an undue quantity has
                    been issued, is in the same situation as a country would be in were it possessed
                    of a redundant gold and silver currency, and subjected to laws prohibiting the
                    melting or exportation of the coin that were carried into full effect. Such a

                    cannot, when too abundant, diffuse itself generally amongst others.</p>
                <p>The level of circulation is destroyed; and the value of the currency becoming
                    less than the value of the currency of other countries, the nominal exchange is
                    rendered proportionally unfavourable.</p>
                <p>Supposing that nothing but silver coin of the standard weight and purity
                    (twenty-five francs of which would exchange for a pound sterling of the British
                    mint standard) circulates at Paris, and that the circulating medium of London is
                    composed entirely of paper only worth half its nominal value, or which is
                    depreciated 100 per cent.; in that case the exchange between London and Paris
                    would be at <hi rend="italic">real</hi> par, when it was nominally cent, per
                    cent, against London. Double the amount of such depreciated London currency
                    would be required to purchase a bill of exchange on Paris where the currency
                    retained its value, while half the former amount of Parisian currency would now
                    suffice to purchase a bill payable in London. A depreciation of this sort would
                    have exactly the same effects as an equal reduction in the value of metallic
                    money. While paper money, depreciated 100 per cent, constituted our legal
                    currency, a pound note, instead of being worth 25 francs, would only be worth
                    121; and the nominal or numerical value of the bills of exchange negotiated
                    between this country and France would be regulated accordingly; that is, a biHof
                    exchange for L.100 or L.1000 payable in London, would sell in Paris for 1250 or
                    12,500 francs, and conversely. If, while the currency of London remained steady
                    at 100 per cent, below its mint value, Parisian currency should, either from the
                    coins becoming deficient in weight, or because of an inordinate issue of paper
                    money, become also depreciated, the <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange
                    would be rendered proportionally less unfavourable to London. On the hypothesis
                    that the currency of Paris is depreciated 50 and that of London 100 per cent,
                    the <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange would be 50 per cent, against the
                    latter, and so on. Thus it appears that the <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi>
                    exchange between any two or more places will always be adjusted according to the
                    value of their currencies; being most favourable to that country whose currency
                    approaches nearest to its mint standard, and most unfavourable to that whose
                    currency is most degraded.</p>
                <p>The state of exchange between Great Britain and Ireland, subsequently to the
                    restriction on cash payments in 1797, furnishes a striking proof of the effects
                    which inordinate issues of paper have in depressing the exchange.</p>
                <p>; The nominal value of the Irish shilling having been raised from 12d. to 13d.,
                    or, which is the same thing, L.108. 6s. 8d. of Irish money having been rendered
                    only equal to L.100 of British money, it followed, that when the exchange
                    between Great Britain and Ireland was at 81 per cent, against the latter, it was
                    said to be at par. In the <hi rend="italic">eight</hi> years previous to 1797,
                    when the paper currency both of England and Ireland was convertible into gold,
                    the exchange between London and Dublin fluctuated from 7⅜∙ to 9 per cent, that
                    is, from per cent, in favour of Dublin, to ⅝ per cent, against it. In September
                    1797 it was so low as 6 per cent., or 2X per cent, in favour of Dublin. <hi
                    rend="italic">1</hi> he amount of Bank of Ireland notes in circulation in
                    January 1797 was only L.621,917; but in April 1801 they had increased to
                    L.2,286,471, and the exchange was then at 14 per cent., or 5f per cent, <hi
                    rend="italic">against</hi> Dublin. In 1803, the Bank of Ireland notes in
                    circulation averagedL.2,707,956, and in October of that year the exchange rose
                    to 17 per cent, that is, to 8; per cent, against Dublin!</p>
                <p>The fact of the exchange between London and Dublin having fluctuated so very
                    little from real par for ei&lt;&gt;ht years previous to the restriction, shows
                    that the circulating medium of Great Britain and Ireland had then been adjusted
                    nearly according to the wants of the two countries. But, in these circumstances,
                    it was evidently i <hi rend="subscript"> m</hi>.1 possible, supposing the value
                    of British currency to remain ' stationary, that the quantity of Irish bank
                    paper could be nearly <hi rend="italic">quintupled</hi> in the short space of
                    six years, without rendering the currency of Ireland comparatively redundant,
                    and sinking its value below that of England. Had the Bank of England increased
                    its notes nearly in the same ratio as the Bank of Ireland, then, as the currency
                    of both countries would have been <hi rend="italic">equally depreciated,</hi>
                    the exchange between London and Dublin would have continued at par. But while
                    the notes of the Bank of Ireland were increased from L.621,917 to L.2,707,956,
                    or in the proportion of 1 to 4∙3, those of the Bank of England were only
                    increased from L.9,181,843 (their number on 7th January 1797), to L.16,505,272,
                    or in the proportion of 1 to 1 ’ 8. If the Bank of England had not made this
                    addition to its issues, the exchange would obviously have been still more
                    unfavourable to Dublin.</p>
                <p>In the debates on the Bullion Report, it was contended that the∙increase of Bank
                    of Ireland paper could not be the cause of the exchange becoming unfavourable to
                    Dublin, inasmuch as it had again become favourable to the latter, after the
                    issues of the Bank of Ireland had been still further increased. Nothing,
                    however, can be more inconclusive than such reasoning. To give it the least
                    weight, it must be shown that the currency of Great Britain had in the interim
                    retained its value, or that it had not been depreciated to the same extent as
                    that of Ireland. Unless this be established, the circumstance that the exchange
                    between London and Dublin came to par, while as many notes of the Bank of
                    Ireland circulated as in the period of its greatest depression, will not
                    authorise us to conclude that the increase of Irish bank paper was not the cause
                    of the fall in the exchange previously to 1804. For it is obvious that the
                    depreciation of Irish bank paper might be going on subsequently to 1804; and
                    yet, supposing English bank paper had been depreciated still more rapidly, the
                    exchange would become more favourable to Dublin. This is merely supposing the
                    circumstances which took place in the first six years of the restriction to be
                    reversed in the second six. Let us examine how the fact stands.</p>
                <p>We have seen that, in 1803, when the exchange was nominally ten per cent, against
                    Dublin, the issues of the Bank of England amounted to L.16,505,272, and those of
                    the Bank of Ireland to L.2,707,956. And, by referring to the account of the
                    issues of the Bank of Ireland from 1797 to 1819, annexed to the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Money</hi> in this work, it will be seen that, in 1805, 1806,
                    1807, and 1808, they were rather <hi rend="italic">diminished</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and that, in 1810, they only amounted to L.3,251,750, being
                    an increase of not more than L.543,794 in the space of seven years, or at the
                    rate of two and six-sevenths per cent, per annum; but in the same period (from
                    1803 to 1810) the issues of the Bank of England had increased from L.16,505,272
                    to L.22,54l,52⅝ or at the rate of five per cent, per annum. But this is not all.
                    According to Mr Wakefield <hi rend="italic">(Account of Ireland,</hi> vol. ii.
                    p. 17t), who has left no subject untouched which could throw light on the state
                    of Ireland, there were <hi rend="italic">fifty</hi> registered bankers in that
                    country in 1804, and only <hi rend="italic">thirty di</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ιτee</hi> in 1810, of which fourteen were hew houses, thirty-one
                    o, the old establishments having disappeared; and I believe, says Mr Wakefield,
                    <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">for the most part failed!</hi> This
                    extraordinary diminution of the country paper of Ireland, ftr the reduction of
                    the issues was at least proportional to the reduction in the number of banks,
                    must have greatly raise its value, and would have countervailed a very great <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ltl</hi> ' crease in the issues of the national bank. Now
                    the very reverse of all this took place in Britain. In 180θ there were 386
                    country banks in this country; and in 1810; t <hi rend="superscript"> 15</hi><pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193751017" xml:id="kp-eb0709-1017-0443"/> number, instead
                    of being diminished, as in Ireland, had increased to 721, having at least three
                    times the number of notes in circulation in the latter as in the former
                    period!</p>
                <p>It appears, therefore, that when, in the period between 1797 and 1804, the
                    quantity of paper in circulation in Ireland was increased, and consequently its
                    value depressed, faster than in England, the exchange between London and Dublin
                    became proportionally unfavourable to the latter; and, on the other hand, it
                    appears, that when, in the six years subsequent to 1804, the paper currency of
                    England was increased more rapidly than the paper currency of Ireland, its
                    relative value was diminished, and the <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange
                    became more favourable to Dublin.</p>
                <p>This is sufficiently conclusive; but there is still more decisive evidence to
                    show that the unfavourable exchange of Dublin upon London in 1802, 1803, 1804,
                    &amp;c. was entirely owing to the comparative redundancy or depreciation of
                    Irish bank paper. The linen manufacturers, weavers, &amp;c. and the majority of
                    the other inhabitants of a few counties in the north of Ireland, being, at the
                    period of the restriction, strongly disaffected towards government, almost
                    unanimously refused to receive bank notes, either in payment of commodities or
                    as wages. The landlords, having also stipulated for the payment of their rents
                    in specie, the consequence was, that a gold currency was maintained in the north
                    of Ireland long after it had been entirely banished from the southern part of
                    the island. If, therefore, the depressed state of the exchange between London
                    and Dublin had been occasioned, as was contended by the advocates of the
                    restriction, by an unfavourable balance of trade between Ireland and Great
                    Britain, or by remittances from the former on account of absentee landlords,
                    &amp;c. it would have been equally depressed between London and the commercial
                    towns in the northern counties. But, so far from this being the case, in
                    December 1803, when the exchange of Dublin on London was at sixteen and
                    one-fourth per cent, that of Belfast on London was at five and one-fourth; or,
                    in other words, at the same time that the exchange between Dublin and London was
                    about eight per cent, against Ireland, the exchange between Belfast, <hi
                    rend="italic">which had a gold currency,</hi> and London, was about three per
                    cent, in its <hi rend="italic">favour.</hi> Nor is this all. There was not only
                    a difference of eleven per cent, in the rate of exchange between Dublin and
                    London, and Belfast and London, but the <hi rend="italic">inland</hi> exchange
                    between Dublin and Belfast was, at the same time, about ten per cent, in favour
                    of the latter; that is, bills drawn in Dublin, and payable in the gold currency
                    of Belfast, brought a premium of ten per cent.; while bills drawn in Belfast,
                    and made payable in the paper currency of Dublin, sold at ten per cent,
                    discount.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Farther

                    and of the United States, to corroborate what has been advanced. Such of our
                    readers as wish for detailed information as to these points may have recourse to
                    the fourth volume of the <hi rend="italic">Cours d’Economic Politique</hi> of Μ.
                    Storch, where they will find an able and instructive ccount of the effects
                    produced by the issues of paper on the price of bullion and the exchange, in
                    almost every country of Europe. They are, in every case, precisely similar to
                    those now stated.</p>
                <p>It only remains to determine the effects of fluctuations in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nominal</hi> exchange, on the export and import trade of the country.</p>
                <p>When the exchange is at par, the operations of the merchant are regulated
                    entirely by the difference between foreign prices and home prices. He imports
                    those commodities which can be sold at home for so much more than theiι price
                    abroad as will indemnify him for the expense of freight, insurance, &amp;c. and
                    yield an adequate remuneration for his trouble, and for the capital employed in
                    their importation; and he exports those whose price abroad is sufficient to
                    cover all expenses, and to afford a similar profit. But when the <hi
                    rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange becomes unfavourable to a particular
                    country, the premium which its merchants receive on the sale of foreign bills
                    has been supposed capable of enabling them to export with profit in cases where
                    the difference between the price of the exported commodities at home and abroad
                    might not be such as would have permitted their exportation had the exchange
                    been at par Thus, if the <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange were ten per
                    cent, agains! this country, a merchant who had consigned goods to his agent
                    abroad would receive a premium of ten per cent, or the sale of the bill; and if
                    we suppose freight, insurance, mercantile profit, &amp;c. to amount to six or
                    seven per cent, it would at first sight appear as if our merchants might, in
                    such circumstances, export commodities although their price at home were three
                    or four per cent, higher than in other countries. If, on the other hand, the <hi
                    rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange were in our favour, or if bills <hi
                    rend="italic">on</hi> this country sold at a premium, it would appear as if
                    foreigners would then be able to consign goods to our merchants, or our
                    merchants to order goods from abroad, when the difference of real prices was not
                    such as would of itself have led to an importation.</p>
                <p>But a very little consideration will convince us that fluctuations in the <hi
                    rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange can have no such effect. That fall in the
                    value of the currency which renders the exchange unfavourable, and causes
                    foreign bills to sell at a premium, must <hi rend="italic">equally increase</hi>
                    the price of all commodities. And hence, whatever might be the amount of the
                    premium which the exporter gained by the sale of the bill drawn on his
                    correspondent abroad, it would do no more than indemnify him for the enhanced
                    price of the goods exported. Mercantile operations are in such cases conducted
                    precisely as they would be were the exchange really at par; that is, by a
                    comparison of the real prices of commodities at home and abroad, meaning, by
                    real prices, the prices at which they would be sold provided there were no
                    depreciation of the currency. If those prices be such as to admit of exportation
                    or importation with a profit, the circumstance of the nominal exchange being
                    favourable or unfavourable will make no difference whatever on the
                    transaction.</p>
                <p>“Suppose,” says Mr Blake, who has very successfully illustrated this part of the
                    doctrine of exchange, “the currencies of Hamburg and London being in their due
                    proportions, and therefore the <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange at par,
                    that sugar, which, from its abundance in London, sold at L.50 per hogshead, from
                    its scarcity at Hamburg would sell at L.100. The merchant in this case would
                    immediately export. Upon the sale of his sugar he would draw a bill upon his
                    correspondent abroad for L.100, which he could at once convert into cash by
                    selling it in the bill market at home, deriving from this transaction a profit
                    of L.50, under deduction of the expenses of freight, insurance, commission,
                    &amp;c. Now, suppose no alteration in the scarcity or abundance of sugar in
                    London and Hamburg, and that the same transaction were to take place after the
                    currency in England had been so much increased that the prices <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193751030" xml:id="kp-eb0709-1030-0444"/>were doubled, and,
                    consequently, the <hi rend="italic">riomitial</hi> exchange 100 per cent, in
                    favour of Hamburg, the hogshead of sugar would then cost L.100, leaving
                    apparently no profit whatever to the exporter. He would, however, as before,
                    draw his bill on his correspondent for L.100; and, as foreign bills would bear a
                    premium of 100 per cent, he would sell this bill in the English market for
                    L.200, and thus derive a profit from the transaction of L.100 depreciated, or
                    L.50 estimated in undepreciated currency, deducting, as in the former instance,
                    the expense of freight, insurance, commission, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>“The case would be precisely similar, <hi rend="italic">mutatis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mutandis,</hi> with the importing merchant. The unfavourable <hi
                    rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange would appear to occasion a loss amounting to
                    the premium on the foreign bill which he must give in order to pay his
                    correspondent abroad. But ií the difference or <hi rend="italic">real</hi>
                    prices in the home and foreign markets were such as to admit of a profit upon
                    the importation of produce, the merchant would continue to import,
                    notwithstanding the premium; for that would be repaid to him in the advanced <hi
                    rend="italic">nominal</hi> price at which the imported produce would be sold in
                    the home market.</p>
                <p>“Suppose, for instance, the currencies of Hamburg and London being in their due
                    proportions, and, therefore, the <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange at par,
                    that linen, which can be bought at Hamburg for L.50, will sell here at L.100.
                    The importer immediately orders his correspondent abroad to send the linen, for
                    the payment of which he purchases at L.50 a foreign bill in the English market,
                    and on the sale of the consignment for L.100, he will derive a profit amounting
                    to the difference between L.50 and the expense attending the import.</p>
                <p>“Now, suppose the same transaction to take place without any alteration in the
                    scarcity or abundance of linen at Hamburg and London, but that the currency of
                    England has been so augmented as to be depreciated to half its value, the <hi
                    rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange will then be 100 per cent, against England,
                    and the importer will not be able to purchase a L.50 foreign bill for less than
                    L.100. But as the prices of commodities here will have risen in the same
                    proportion as the money has been depreciated, he will sell his linen to the
                    English consumer for L.200, and will, as before, derive a profit amounting to
                    the difference between L.100 depreciated, or L.50 estimated in undepreciated
                    money, and the expenses attending the import.</p>
                <p>“The same instances might be put in the case of a favourable exchange; and it
                    would be seen in the same manner that <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> prices and
                    the <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange being alike dependent on the
                    depreciation of currency, whatever apparent advantage might be derived from the
                    former would be counterbalanced by a loss on the latter, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >vice versa.” ( Observations,</hi> &amp;c. p. 48.)</p>
                <p>It appears, therefore, that fluctuations in the <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi>
                    exchange have no effect on export or import trade. A fall in the exchange
                    obliges the country to which it is unfavourable to expend a larger <hi
                    rend="italic">nominal</hi> sum in discharging a foreign debt than would
                    otherwise be necessary; but it does not oblige it to expend a greater <hi
                    rend="italic">real</hi> value. The depression of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nominal</hi> exchange can neither exceed nor fall short of the comparative
                    depreciation of the currency. If the depreciation of British currency amounted
                    to 10 or 100 per cent, the <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange would be 10
                    or 100 per cent, against us; and we should be compelled, in all our transactions
                    with foreigners, to give them 22s. or 40s. for what might otherwise have been
                    procured for L.l. But as neither 22s. nor 40s. of paper, depreciated to the
                    extent of 10 or 100 per cent, would be more valuable than L.l of undepreciated
                    paper, payment of a foreign debt might, it is evident, be as easily made in the
                    one currency as in the other; and mercantile transactions would, in such
                    circumstances, be conducted exactly as they would have been had the currency
                    been undepreciated, and the <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange at par.</p>
                <p>It is necessary, however, before dismissing this part of our subject, to examine
                    the effects of fluctuations in the <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange on
                    the importation and exportation of <hi rend="italic">bullion.</hi> In certain
                    cases they form an exception to the general principle we have been endeavouring
                    to elucidate.</p>
                <p>If the <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange were unfavourable to a country
                    which had entirely discarded the precious metals from! its circulation, Mr
                    Blake’s opinion that the fall of the ex-’ change has no effect on the export and
                    import of bullion, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> more than of any other
                    commodity, would be perfectly well <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> founded. In
                    this case the price of all sorts of commodities, and of bullion among the rest,
                    w ould be increased pre-; cisely according to the depreciation of the currency;
                    and the merchants who should, under such circumstances, attempt to export
                    bullion, would find that its increased price in the home market w ould be
                    exactly equivalent to whatever premium they might gain by the sale of the bills
                    drawn on their agents abroad for its price. But when the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nominal</hi> exchange becomes unfavourable to a country whose currency consists
                    entirely of the precious metals, or partly of them and partly of paper, a
                    different effect is produced.</p>
                <p>In this case the depreciation necessarily adds to the stock of bullion in the
                    country. For as soon as the currency has been depreciated to such an extent as
                    to render the excess of the market above the mint price of bullion sufficient to
                    cover the very trifling expenses attending the melting of the coin, and to
                    afford some little remuneration for the trouble of the melters, they immediately
                    set about converting it into bullion. If, indeed, it were possible to realize a
                    greater profit by the exportation than by the fusion of the coins, they would
                    not be converted into bullion, and, of course, its real price would continue
                    stationary. But this is very seldom the case. The operation of melting is so
                    extremely simple, and requires so very little apparatus, that it may, in almost
                    every instance, be carried on at a less expense than would be necessary to
                    export the coins. The cost attending the conveyance of gold to Paris varies in a
                    season of peace, from one to two per cent.; while a profit of one fourth or one
                    half per cent, is sufficient to indemnify the melters of guineas or sovereigns.
                    It is obvious, therefore, that of the two modes of restoring the value of the
                    currency when it becomes depreciated, or relatively redundant, that of fusion
                    will be generally resorted to in preference to exportation. Should the
                    redundancy of the currency be inconsiderable, all the addition which the
                    operations of the melters could make to the supply of bullion, would most
                    probably be insufficient to occasion any perceptible fall in its <hi
                    rend="italic">real</hi> price. But, in every case in which the redundancy or
                    depreciation of the currency is considerable, the fusion of the coined money
                    never fails to increase the quantity of bullion beyond the effectual demand,
                    and, consequently, to occasion a fall in its <hi rend="italic">real</hi> price,
                    and to render it a profitable article of export. The demand for bullion, though
                    it must always vary with the varying wealth and riches of the community,
                    fluctuates very little in periods of limited duration; and no considerable
                    addition can ever be made to the stock on hand in a particular country, without
                    sinking its value and causing its egress.</p>
                <p>Mr Blake contends that this exportation of bullion is the effect of the melting
                    of the coin, and not the cause of it 5 and in so far he is certainly right. But
                    we do not see how this in the least strengthens his opinion, that fluctuations
                    in the <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange, even in those cases in which the
                    currency consists either wholly or partially of the precious metals, have no
                    influence on the export and import of bu - lion. Surely it is impossible to deny
                    that the fusion of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751043"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-1043-0445"/>coin, of which Mr Blake admits the exportation of
                    bullion is , a necessary consequence, is occasioned by a redundancy of the
                    currency, or by the same cause which occasions an unfavourable <hi rend="italic"
                    >nominal</hi> exchange.</p>
                <p>Bullion, therefore, forms an exception, and it is the only one, to the general
                    principle that a fall in the value of the currency, or an unfavourable <hi
                    rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange, has no effect on importation or
                    exportation. But this exception does not take place, except in those cases in
                    which the currency consists either in <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> or in <hi
                    rend="italic">part</hi> of the precious metals. When the currency consists <hi
                    rend="italic">entirely</hi> of paper, or of any commodity other than gold or
                    silver, its depreciation has no influence whatever on the importation of
                    bullion.</p>
                <p>SECT. II REAL EXCHANGE.</p>
                <p>Having thus endeavoured to trace the effects which variations in the value of the
                    currencies of countries maintaining an intercourse together have on the
                    exchange, we now proceed to consider how far it is influenced <hi rend="italic"
                    >by fluctuations in the supply and demand for hills.</hi> To facilitate this
                    inquiry, we shall exclude all consideration of changes in the value of money;
                    or, which is the same thing, we shall suppose the currencies of the different
                    countries having an intercourse together to be all fixed at their mint
                    standards, and that each has its proper supply of bullion.</p>
                <p>When two nations trade together, and each purchases from the other commodities of
                    precisely the same value, their debts and credits will be equal, and, of course,
                    the real exchange will be at par. The <hi rend="italic">bills</hi> drawn by the
                    one are, in such a case, exactly equivalent to those drawn by the other, and
                    their respective claims may be adjusted without the transfer of bullion, or
                    other valuable produce. But it very rarely happens that the debts reciprocally
                    due by any two countries are equal. There is almost always a balance owing on
                    one side or other; and this balance must affect the exchange. If the debts due
                    by London to Paris exceeded those due by Paris to London, the competition in the
                    London market for bills on Paris would, because of the comparatively large sum
                    which our merchants had to remit to France, be greater than the competition in
                    Paris for bills on London; and, consequently, the <hi rend="italic">real</hi>
                    exchange would be in favour of Paris and against London.</p>
                <p>The expense of the transfer of bullion from one country to another constitutes
                    the limit within which the rise and fall of the <hi rend="italic">real</hi>
                    exchange between them must be confined. In this respect, as in most others,
                    transactions between foreign countries are regulated by the very same principles
                    which regulate those between different parts of the same country. We have
                    already shown how the fluctuations in the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exchange
                    between London and Glasgow could never exceed the expense of transmitting money
                    between those cities. The same principle holds universally. Whatever may be the
                    expense of transmitting bullion,—the money of the commercial world,—between
                    London and Paris, Hamburg, New York, &amp;c., it is impossible that the <hi
                    rend="italic">real</hi> exchange of the one on the other should, for any
                    considerable period, be depressed to a greater extent. For a merchant will not
                    pay a greater premium for a bill to discharge <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi>
                    debt abroad, than would suffice to cover the expense of transmitting bullion to
                    his creditor.</p>
                <p>Hence it appears that whatever has a tendency to obstruct or fetter the
                    intercourse among different countries, must also tend to widen the limits within
                    which fluctuations in the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exchange may extend. This
                    enables us to account for its varying so much more in time of war than in time
                    of peace. The amount of the bills drawn on a country engaged in hostilities is,
                    from various causes which we shall afterwards notice, liable to be suddenly
                    increased, though it is certain that whatever may be the amount of the bills
                    thus thrown upon the market, the depression of the exchange cannot, for any
                    length of time, 1 exceed the expense of conveying bullion from the debtor to the
                    creditor country. But during war this expense is increased; the charges on
                    account of freight, insurance, c. being then necessarily augmented. It appears,
                    from the evidence annexed to the <hi rend="italic">Report of the Bullion
                    Committee,</hi> that the expense of conveying gold from London to Hamburg,
                    which, prior to the war, only amounted to two or two and a half per cent, had,
                    in the latter part of 1809, increased to about seven per cent.; showing that the
                    limit vithin which fluctuations in the real exchange were confined in 1809 were
                    about three times as great as those within which they were confined in 1793.</p>
                <p>This principle also enables us to account for the greater steadiness of the real
                    exchange between countries in the immediate vicinity of each other. The expense
                    of transmitting a given quantity of bullion from London to Dublin or Paris, is
                    much less than the expense of transmitting the same quantity from London to New
                    York or Petersburg. And, as fluctuations in the <hi rend="italic">real</hi>
                    exchange can only be limited by the cost of transmitting bullion, they may
                    consequently extend much farther between distant places than between those that
                    are contiguous.</p>
                <p>It will now be proper to investigate the circumstances which give rise to a
                    favourable or an unfavourable balance of payments, and to appreciate their
                    effects on the real exchange, and on the trade of the country in general. As
                    this is one of the most important inquiries in the whole science of political
                    economy, it will require to be discussed at some length.</p>
                <p>A very great, if not the principal, source of the errors into which practical
                    merchants, and the majority of writers on the subject of exchange, have been
                    betrayed, appears to have originated in their confounding the sum which imported
                    commodities are worth in the home market, with the sum which they cost in the
                    foreign market. It is obviously, however, by the amount of the latter only, that
                    the balance of payments, and consequently the <hi rend="italic">real</hi>
                    exchange, is influenced. A cargo of iron, for example, which cost L.1000 free on
                    board at Gottenburg, might be worth L.1200 or L.1300 when imported into England;
                    but the foreign merchant would not be entitled to draw on London for more than
                    its original cost, or L.1000. It is clear, therefore, on the slightest
                    consideration, that the circumstance of the value of the imports exceeding the
                    value of the exports, does not authorise the conclusion that the balance of
                    payments is unfavourable. A favourable or an unfavourable balance depends

                    imported from abroad being less or more than the sum due <hi rend="italic"
                    >by</hi> them for the commodities they have purchased; but it has nothing to do
                    with the prices eventually obtained for the imported or exported
                    commodities.</p>
                <p>The great object of the <hi rend="italic">mercantile</hi> system of commercial
                    policy, a system which still continues to preserve a considerable influence in
                    this and in every other country in Europe, is, the creation of a favourable
                    balance of payments, and consequently of a favourable <hi rend="italic"
                    >real</hi> exchange, by facilitating exportation and restricting importation. It
                    is foreign to the object of this article to enter into any examination of the
                    principles of this system, except in so far as they are connected with the
                    subject of exchange; but we hope to be able to show, in opposition to the
                    commonly received opinions on the subject, that, under ordinary circumstances,,
                    the value of the imports must always exceed the value of the exports; and that
                    this excess of importation has not, speaking generally, any tendency to render
                    the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exchange unfavourable.</p>
                <p>It is the business of the merchant to carry the various <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193751056" xml:id="kp-eb0709-1056-0446"/>products of the different
                    countries of the world from those places where their value is least, to those
                    where it is greatest; or, which is the same thing, to distribute them according
                    to the effective demand. It is clear, however, that there could be no motive to
                    export any commodity, unless the commodity which it was designed to import in
                    its stead was of greater value. When an English merchant orders a quantity of
                    Polish wheat, he calculates on its selling for so much more than its price in
                    Poland as will be sufficient to pay the expense of freight, insurance, &amp;c.;
                    ’and to yield, besides, the common and ordinary rate of profit on the capital
                    employed in the business. If the wheat did not sell for this sum, its
                    importation would obviously occasion a loss to the importer. No merchant ever
                    did or ever will export, but in the view of importing a greater value in return.
                    And so far from an excess of exports over imports being any criterion of an
                    advantageous commerce, it is quite the reverse; and the truth is,
                    notwithstanding all that has been said and written to the contrary, that unless
                    the value of the imports exceeded that of the exports, foreign trade could not
                    be carried on. Were this not the case—were the value of the exports always
                    greater than the value of the imports, merchants would lose on every transaction
                    with foreigners, and the trade with them would either not exist at all, or, if
                    begun, would be speedily relinquished.</p>
                <p>In England, the rates at which exports and imports are valued were fixed so far
                    back as 1696. But the very great alteration that has since taken place, not in
                    the value of money only, but in the cost of most part of the commodities
                    produced in this and other countries, has rendered this <hi rend="italic"
                    >official</hi> valuation, though valuable as a means of determining their
                    quantity, of no use whatever as a criterion of the true value of the imports and
                    exports. To obviate this defect, an account of the <hi rend="italic">real</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">declared</hi> value of the exports is annually prepared
                    from the declarations of the masters, and laid before parliament. There is,
                    however, no such account of the imports; and, owing to the difficulties which
                    high duties throw in the way, it is, perhaps, impossible to frame one with any
                    thing like accuracy. It has also been alleged, and apparently with some
                    foundation, that merchants have not unfrequently exaggerated the value of
                    articles entitled to drawbacks on exportation; but the recent extension and
                    improvement of the warehousing system, and the decrease in the number of
                    drawbacks, must materially lessen whatever fraud or inaccuracy may have arisen
                    from that source. Indeed, as most articles are charged with an <hi rend="italic"
                    >ad valorem</hi> duty of 10s. per cent, on exportation, the fair presumption is,
                    that their value will be underrated. We believe, however, that the declared
                    value of the exports comes pretty near the truth, at least sufficiently so for
                    all practical purposes.</p>
                <p>But if perfectly accurate accounts could be obtained of the value of the exports
                    and imports, there can be no manner of doubt that in ordinary years the latter
                    would always exceed the former. The value of an exported commodity is estimated
                    when it is shipped, <hi rend="italic">before</hi> its value is increased by the
                    expense incurred in transporting it to the place of its destination; but the
                    value of the commodity imported in its stead is estimated <hi rend="italic"
                    >after</hi> it has arrived at its destination, and, consequently, after it has
                    been enhanced by the cost of freight, insurance, importer’s profit, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>It is of very little importance, in so far at least as the interests of commerce
                    are concerned, whether a nation act as the carrier of its own imports and
                    exports, or employ others. A carrying nation appears to derive a comparatively
                    large profit from its commercial transactions; but this excess of profit is
                    nothing more than a fair remuneration for the capital it employs, and the risk
                    it incurs, in transporting commodities from one country to another. Were the
                    whole trade between this country and France carried on in British bottoms, our
                    merchants, in addition to the value of the goods exported, would also receive
                    the cost of their carriage to France. This, however, would not occasion any loss
                    to that country. The French merchants must pay the freight of the commodities
                    they import; and if the English can afford it on cheaper terms than their own
                    countrymen, there is no good commercial reason, though there may be others of a
                    different kind, why they should not employ them in preference.</p>
                <p>In the United States the value of the imports, as ascertained by the customhouse
                    returns, always exceeds the value of the exports. And although our practical
                    politicians have been in the habit of considering the excess of exports over
                    imports as the only sure criterion of an advantageous commerce, “it is
                    nevertheless true, that the real gain of the United States has been nearly in
                    proportion as their imports have exceeded their exports.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Pitkin on the Commerce of the United States.
                    2d ed. p. 280.</p></note> The great excess of American imports has been in part
                    occasioned by the Americans generally exporting their own surplus produce, and
                    consequently receiving from foreigners, not only an equivalent for their
                    exports, but also for the cost of conveying them to the foreign market. “In
                    1811,” says the author just quoted, “flour sold in America for nine dollars
                    fifty cents per barrel, and in Spain for fifteen dollars. The value of the cargo
                    of a vessel carrying 5000 barrels of flour would, therefore, be estimated, at
                    the period of its exportation, at 47,500 dollars; but as this flour would,
                    because of freight, insurance, exporter’s profits, &amp;c. sell in Spain for
                    75,000 dollars, the American merchant would be entitled to draw on his agent in
                    Spain for 27,500 dollars more than the flour cost in America, or than the sum
                    for which he could have drawn had the flour been exported on account of a
                    Spanish merchant. But the transaction would not end here: the 75,000 dollars
                    would be vested in some species of Spanish or other European goods fit for the
                    American market; and the freight, insurance, &amp;c. on account of the return
                    cargo, would perhaps increase its value to 100,000 dollars; so that in all, the
                    American merchant might have imported commodities worth 52,500 dollars more than
                    the flour originally sent to Spain.” It is as impossible to deny that such a
                    transaction as this is advantageous, as it is to deny that its advantage
                    consists entirely in the excess of the value of the goods imported over the
                    value of those exported. And it is equally clear, that America might have had
                    the balance of payments in her favour, though such transactions as the above had
                    been multiplied to any conceivable extent.</p>
                <p>Instead, therefore, of endeavouring to fetter and restrict the trade with those
                    countries from which we should otherwise import a greater value than we
                    exported, we ought to give it every possible facility. Every man considers that
                    market as the best in which he is able to obtain the highest price, or the
                    greatest value in exchange for his goods; why then should he be excluded from
                    it? .Why compel a merchant to dispose of a cargo of muslin for L.10,000 rather
                    than L.12,000? The wealth of a state is made up of the wealth of individuals;
                    and we have yet to learn that any more effectual method of increasing individual
                    w calth can be devised than to permit every person to make his purchases in the
                    cheapest and his sales in the dearest market.</p>
                <p>It would be difficult to estimate the mischief which absurd notions relative to
                    the balance of trade have occasion-cd<pb break="no" facs="nls:193751069"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-1069-0447"/> in almost every commercial country. In Great
                    Britain they have been particularly injurious. It is principally to the
                    prevalence of prejudices to which they have given rise, that the restrictions
                    imposed on the trade between this country and France are to be ascribed. The
                    great, and, indeed, the only argument insisted on by those who prevailed on the
                    legislature to declare the trade with France a <hi rend="italic">nuisance
                    (^Prohibition Act,</hi> Isŕ <hi rend="italic">William and Mary),</hi> was
                    founded on the fact, that the value of the imports from that kingdom
                    considerably exceeded the value of the exports. The balance was termed a <hi
                    rend="italic">tribute</hi> paid by England to France; and it was sagaciously
                    asked, what had we done that we should be obliged to pay so much money to our
                    deadly enemy? It never occurred to these wise persons, that no merchant would
                    import any commodity from France, unless it brought a higher price in this
                    country than the commodity exported in its stead; and that the profit of the
                    merchant, or, which is the same thing, the national gain, would depend on this
                    excess of price. The reason assigned for prohibiting the trade, affords the best
                    proof of its having been a lucrative one. There cannot, indeed, be a doubt, that
                    an unrestricted freedom of intercourse between the two countries would be of the
                    greatest service to both. The peculiarities in the soil and climate, and in the
                    national character of the people, of Great Britain and France, enable the one to
                    produce various species of raw and manufactured commodities at a cheaper rate
                    than they can be produced by the other. If we were allowed freely to purchase
                    and import under moderate duties, the silks, the wines, and the brandies of
                    France, those things which we can supply cheaper than our ingenious neighbours
                    would be taken in payment. An extensive market would thus be created for a vast
                    variety of articles, and a natural and powerful stimulus would be applied to the
                    industry of both countries. Nobody denies that the trade with America, Portugal,
                    and the Baltic is advantageous; and if so, why is the trade with France to be
                    considered as prejudicial? Supposing the trade between the two countries were
                    perfectly free, does any one imagine that our merchants would export or import
                    any commodity to or from France, provided they could either sell or buy it on
                    better terms anywhere else? If the restrictions on the French trade be not
                    really injurious, that is, if the trade with France be either a losing or a less
                    advantageous one than that with other countries, we may rest assured that the
                    throwing it open would not make-a single individual engage in it.</p>
                <p>As the real price of commodities is always proportioned not only to the expense
                    of their production, but also to the expense necessarily incurred in conveying
                    them to the place where they are to be consumed, it is plain that a nation which
                    prohibits trading with the countries in her vicinity must pay a higher price for
                    her imported commodities, and be obliged to exact a higher price for those which
                    she exports, than would be necessary were she able to procure the one or to
                    dispose of the other in her immediate neighbourhood. If the same sort of wine
                    could be bought at Bordeaux equally cheap as at Lisbon, the difference of
                    freight would enable it to be sold cheaper in London. It is this principle, in
                    fact, which renders the home trade pe-ιliarly advantageous. The parties engaged
                    in it live near each other, and consequently each obtains the commodity °t which
                    he stands in need at its cheapest rate, and without being obliged to pay any
                    great additional sum on account of carriage. When, therefore, we restrict the
                    trade with countries in our immediate vicinity, we act in the seth of that very
                    principle which is, in every other case, admitted to be advantageous. We compel
                    such of our Pθople as purchase foreign commodities, to buy them at a
                    comparatively high price; while, by raising the price of the commodities we
                    export, the market for them is injuriously contracted.</p>
                <p>But the partisans of the exclusive or mercantile system will perhaps tell us,
                    that they do not mean to contend that it is profitable to export a greater value
                    than is imported, but that, by exporting an excess of raw and manufactured
                    commodities, the balance of payments is rendered favourable, and that this
                    balance (which they consider as representing the entire net profit made by the
                    country on its transactions with foreigners) is always paid in <hi rend="italic"
                    >bullion.</hi></p>
                <p>It will, however, be easy to show that this statement is altogether erroneous;
                    that a balance, whether on the one side or the other, is seldom or never
                    cancelled by means of bullion; and that this balance is not a measure, and has
                    in fact nothing to do with the profit or loss attending foreign commercial
                    transactions.</p>
                <p>1. So long as the premium on foreign bills is less than the expense attending the
                    transit of bullion from a country which has an unfavourable real exchange, no
                    merchant ever thinks of subjecting himself to an unnecessary expense, by
                    exporting bullion to pay a foreign debt. But though the premium on foreign bills
                    had increased, so as to equal the cost of exporting the precious metals, for it
                    cannot <hi rend="italic">exceed</hi> this sum, it does not by any means follow
                    that they would therefore be exported. That depends entirely on the fact,
                    whether bullion be, at the time, the cheapest exportable commodity, or, in other
                    words, whether a remittance of bullion be the most advantageous way in which a
                    debt may be discharged. If a London merchant owe L.100 in Paris, he sets about
                    finding out the cheapest method of paying it. On the supposition that the <hi
                    rend="italic">real</hi> exchange is two per cent, below par, and that the
                    expense of remitting bullion, including the profit of the bullion merchant, is
                    also two per cent., it will be indifferent to him whether he pay L.2 of premium
                    for a bill of L.100 payable in Paris, or incur an expense of L.2, by remitting
                    L.100 worth of bullion directly to that city. If the prices of cloth in Paris
                    and London be such, that it would require L.103 to purchase and send as much
                    cloth to Paris as would sell for L.100, he w ould undoubtedly prefer buying a
                    bill or exporting bullion. But if, by incurring an expense of L.101, the debtor
                    be able to send as much hardware to Paris as would sell for L.100, he would as
                    certainly prefer paying his debt by an exportation of hardware. By doing so, he
                    saves one per cent, more than if he bought a foreign bill or remitted bullion,
                    and two per cent, more than if he exported cloth. If there had been any other
                    commodity that might have been exported with more advantage, he would have used
                    it in preference.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, therefore, that the exportation of bullion is regulated by
                    precisely the same principles which regulate the export and import of other
                    commodities. It is exported when its exportation is most advantageous; that is,
                    when it is less valuable at home and more valuable abroad than any other
                    commodity; and it cannot be otherwise exported. The balance of payments might be
                    a hundred millions against a country, without depriving it of a single ounce of
                    bullion. No merchant would remit L.100 worth of gold or silver from England to
                    discharge a debt in Paris, if he could invest L.98, L.99, or any smaller sum in
                    any other species of merchandise which, exclusive of expenses, would sell in
                    France for L.100. Those who deal in the precious metals are, we may depend upon
                    it, as much under the influence of self-interest as those who deal in coffee or
                    indigo. But w ho would attempt to discharge a foreign debt, by exporting coffee
                    which cost L.100, it he could effect the same object by sending abroad indigo
                    which cost only L.97? No person in his senses would export a hat to be sold for
                    20s. provided he could sell it at home for a guinea; nor would any person export
                    an <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751082" xml:id="kp-eb0709-1082-0448"/>ounce of
                    bullion, if its value were not less in the export- ∙ing than in the importing
                    country, or if there were any other commodity whatever that might be exported
                    with greater advantage.</p>
                <p>2. It is in vain to contend, that by permitting an unrestricted freedom of trade,
                    one country might become indebted to another, which had no demand for any sort
                    of ordinary merchandise, and which would only accept of cash or bullion in
                    exchange for its exports. Such a case never did, and never will occur. A nation
                    which is in want of money must also be in want of other things; for men only
                    desire money because of its being the readiest means of increasing their command
                    over the necessaries and enjoyments of life. The extreme variety, too, in the
                    soil and climate, in the machinery, and in the skill and industry of the
                    artisans belonging to different countries, must always occasion a considerable
                    difference in the prices of their products. And until the cost of production be
                    equalized, there must always be a foreign demand for those commodities which can
                    be produced cheaper at home than abroad; and until the desire to accumulate be
                    banished from the human breast, there must always be an inclination to send
                    commodities from those countries where their exchangeable value is least, to
                    where it is greatest.</p>
                <p>3. In treating of the <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange, we endeavoured to
                    show, that it is impossible that any country should be able, for any length of
                    time, to import or export a greater quantity of bullion than may be necessary to
                    preserve the value of bullion in it in its proper relation to the bullion of
                    other countries; or, which is the same thing, to have the <hi rend="italic"
                    >real</hi> exchange either permanently favourable or unfavourable. But though
                    this principle be strictly true in reference to its <hi rend="italic"
                    >aggregate</hi> exchanges, it is incorrect when the state of its exchange with
                    one country only is considered. Great Britain, for example, may constantly have
                    the exchange in her favour with Portugal, provided she have it constantly, and
                    to an equal extent, against her with the East Indies, or some other country,
                    “She may,” to use the words of Mr Ricardo, “be importing from the north the
                    bullion which she is exporting to the south. She may be collecting it from
                    countries where it is relatively abundant, for others where it is relatively
                    scarce, or where, from some particular causes, it is in great demand. Spain, who
                    is the great importer of bullion from America, can never have an unfavourable
                    exchange with her colonies; and as she must distribute the bullion she receives
                    among the different nations of the world, she can seldom have a favourable
                    exchange with the countries with which she trades.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>It was by this principle that Lord King ingeniously, and, we think, successfully
                    accounted for the nearly continued favourable exchange between this country and
                    Hamburg, from 1770 to 1799. His Lordship showed that the importation of bullion
                    from Hamburg and other countries was only equivalent to the quantity exported to
                    the East Indies and consumed at home; that the demand corresponded to the
                    supply; and that its value remained pretty stationary. The extraordinary influx
                    of bullion into this country from the Continent at the era of the bank
                    restriction in 1797, and the very favourable state of the exchange, were
                    undoubtedly owing, in a very great degree, to the reduction in the issues of
                    bank paper, and to the diminution of the gold currency caused by the hoarding of
                    guineas, &amp;c. In 1797 and 1798, above <hi rend="italic">five</hi> millions of
                    guineas were coined at the mint; and this extraordinary demand for gold is of
                    itself abundantly sufficient to account for the very favourable exchange of that
                    period, and for the length of time which it continued. But, at the same time
                    that the demand for <hi rend="italic">gold</hi> bullion for the mint was thus
                    increased, the demand for <hi rend="italic">silver</hi> bullion, for the purpose
                    of exportation by the East India Company, had also been proportionally
                    augmented. In 1795, the quantity exported on account of the Company, and of
                    private persons, amounted to only 151,795 ounces.</p>

                <p>From this period the exportation of silver to the East Indies was very much
                    reduced; and, in the years in which the exchange was most unfavourable, it had
                    almost entirely ceased.</p>
                <p>Instead, therefore, of the extraordinary importation of bullion from Hamburg in
                    1797 and 1798 affording, as Mr Bosanquet and others have supposed, a practical
                    proof of the fallacy of the opinion of those who contend that it is impossible,
                    for any length of time, to destroy the natural equality in the value of bullion
                    in different countries, it is a striking example of its truth. Without this
                    influx, bullion in this country could not have maintained its proper value, as
                    compared with that of other countries. We imported it, because, owing to the
                    reduction of the paper currency, and the increased exports by the East India
                    Company, its value was rendered higher here than on the Continent; and,
                    consequently, because the Continental merchants found it advantageous to send
                    bullion to us, in the same manner as they would have sent corn, or any other
                    commodity for which there happened to be an unusual demand in Great Britain.
                    For, however favourable the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exchange between Hamburg
                    and London might have been to the latter, we should not have imported a single
                    ounce of bullion, had it not been, at the time, the most advantageous article
                    with which Hamburg could discharge its debt to London.</p>
                <p>O -</p>
                <p>4. In the absence of all other arguments, it would be sufficient to state, that
                    it is physically impossible that the excess of exports over imports, as
                    indicated by the custom-house returns, should be paid in bullion. Every country
                    in the world, with the single exception of the United States, has its apparently
                    favourable balance; and of course, if they really existed, they would have to be
                    paid by an influx of bullion from the mines correspondent to their aggregate
                    amount. It is certain, however, that the entire produce of the mines, though it
                    were increased in a <hi rend="italic">tenfold</hi> proportion, would be
                    insufficient for this purpose’. 1his of itself is decisive of the degree of
                    credit which ought to be attached to the commonly received opinions on this
                    subject.</p>
                <p>5. In the last place, the profit on transactions with foreigners does not consist
                    in the quantity of bullion imported from abroad, but in “the excess of the value
                    of the imports over the value of the exports.” If, in return for exported
                    commodities worth <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> or <hi rend="italic">twenty</hi>
                    millions, we import such as are worth <hi rend="italic">fifteen</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">thirty,</hi> we shall gain 50 per cent, by the transaction, though
                    the exports should consist entirely of bullion, and the imports of corn, sugar,
                    coffee, &amp;c. It is a ridiculous prejudice that would mak( us import bullion
                    rather than any other commodity, nut whatever the partisans of the exclusive
                    system may say about its being a <hi rend="italic">preferable product,</hi> a
                    <hi rend="italic">marchandise</hi><hi rend="italic">P</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ατ</hi><hi rend="italic">excellence,</hi> we may be assured that
                    it will never appear in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751095"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-1095-0449"/>the list of exports or imports, while there is any
                    other commodity with which to carry on trade that will yield a larger
                    profit.</p>
                <p>Thus it appears that the excess of exports over imports, instead of being any
                    proof of an advantageous commerce, is distinctly and completely the reverse
                    ;—that a commercial country may, and almost always does, import commodities of
                    greater value than it exports, without rendering itself indebted to foreigners
                    ;—and that when a balance of debt has been contracted, that is, when the sum <hi
                    rend="italic">payable to</hi> foreigners for imported commodities is greater
                    than the sum <hi rend="italic">receivable from</hi> them for exported
                    commodities, the balance will not be paid by sending bullion from the debtor to
                    the creditor country, unless it be at the time the most profitable article of
                    export.</p>
                <p>We have, in the previous <hi rend="italic">section,</hi> shown that fluctuations
                    in the nominal exchange have no effect on foreign trade. When the currency is
                    depreciated, the premium which an exporter derives from the sale of the bill
                    drawn on his correspondent abroad, is barely equivalent to the increase in the
                    price of the goods exported, occasioned by the depreciation. But when the
                    premium on a foreign bill is not a consequence of a fall in the value of money,
                    but of a deficiency in the supply of bills, there is no rise of prices, and
                    under such circumstances the unfavourable exchange undoubtedly operates as a
                    stimulus to exportation. As soon as the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exchange
                    diverges from par, the mere inspection of a price current is no longer
                    sufficient to regulate the operations of the merchant. If it be unfavourable,
                    the premium which an exporter receives on the sale of bills must be included in
                    the estimate of the profit he is likely to derive from the transaction. The
                    greater that premium, the less will be the difference of prices necessary to
                    make him export. And hence an unfavourable <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exchange
                    has exactly the same effect as a bounty on exportation equal to the premium on
                    foreign bills.</p>
                <p>But for the same reason that an unfavourable <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exchange
                    increases exportation, it proportionally diminishes importation. When the
                    exchange is really unfavourable, the price of foreign commodities brought to our
                    markets must be so much under their price at home, as not merely to afford,
                    exclusive of expenses, the ordinary profit on their sale, but also to pay the
                    premium which the importer must give for a foreign bill, if he remit one to his
                    correspondent, or for the discount, added to the invoice price, if the latter
                    draw upon him. A much less quantity of foreign goods will therefore suit our
                    markets when the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exchange is unfavourable; and fewer
                    payments having to be made abroad, the competition for foreign bills is
                    diminished, and the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exchange rendered proportionally
                    favourable. In the same way, it is easy to see that a favourable <hi
                    rend="italic">real</hi> exchange must operate as <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> on
                    exportation, and as a <hi rend="italic">bounty</hi> on importation.</p>
                <p>It is thus that fluctuations in the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exchange have a
                    necessary tendency to correct themselves. They can never, for any considerable
                    period, <hi rend="italic">exceed</hi> the expense of transmitting bullion from
                    the debtor to the creditor country. But the exchange cannot continue permanently
                    favourable or unfavourable to this extent. When favourable, it corrects itself
                    by restricting exportation and facilitating importation; and when unfavourable,
                    it produces the same effect by giving an unusual stimulus to exportation, and by
                    throwing obstacles in the way of importation. 1he true <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >par</hi> forms the centre of these oscillations; and though the thousand
                    circumstances that daily and hourly affect the state of debt and credit, prevent
                    the ordinary course of exchange from being almost ever precisely at par, its
                    fluctuations, whether on the one side or the other, are confined within certain
                    limits, and have a constant tendency to disannear.</p>
                <p>The natural tendency which the exchange has to correct itself is powerfully
                    assisted by the operations of the bill merchants.</p>
                <p>England, for example, may owe an excess of debt to Amsterdam, yet, as the
                    aggregate amount of the debts <hi rend="italic">due</hi> by a commercial
                    country, is generally balanced by the amount of those which it has to receive,
                    the deficiency of bills on Amsterdam in London will most probably be
                    countervailed by a proportional redundancy of them in some other quarter. Now,
                    it is the business of the merchants who deal in bills, as of those who deal in
                    bullion or any thing else, to buy them where they are cheap, and to sell them
                    where they are dear. They therefore buy up the bills drawn by other countries on
                    Amsterdam, and dispose of them in London; and, by so doing, prevent any great
                    fall in the price of bills on Amsterdam in those countries in which the supply
                    exceeds the demand, and any great rise in Great Britain and those countries in
                    which the supply happens to be deficient. In the trade between Italy and this
                    country, the bills drawn on Great Britain amount almost invariably to a greater
                    sum than those drawn on Italy. The bill merchants, however, by buying up the
                    excess of the Italian bills on London, and selling them in France, Holland, and
                    other countries indebted to England, prevent the <hi rend="italic">real</hi>
                    exchange from ever becoming very much depressed.</p>
                <p>An unusual deficiency in the supply of corn, or of any other article of prime
                    necessity, the demand for which could not be immediately contracted, by causing
                    a sudden augmentation of the imports from abroad, materially affects the state
                    of debt and credit with foreign countries, and depresses the exchange. In time
                    of war the balance of payments is liable to be still further deranged; the
                    amount of the bills drawn on a country carrying on foreign hostilities, being
                    increased by the whole expense of its armaments abroad, and of subsidies to
                    foreign powers. But neither the conjoined nor separate influence of both or
                    either of these causes can exert any permanent influence over the exchange. A
                    sudden increase in the accustomed supply of bills must, in the first instance,
                    by glutting the market, occasion their selling at a discount; but this effect
                    can only be of temporary duration. The unusual facilities which are then
                    afforded for the exportation of manufactured produce to the foreign market, and
                    the difficulties which are thrown in the way of importation, never fail speedily
                    to bring the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exchange to par.</p>
                <p>In a period of profound peace we may, by exporting an excess of raw or
                    manufactured produce, overload the foreign market, and occasion such a decline
                    in the price of British goods abroad, as to render the imported less valuable
                    than the exported commodities with which they have been purchased. ‘ But such a
                    state of things speedily effects its own cure. The distress which it necessarily
                    occasions leads to an immediate diminution of exports; and the supply of British
                    commodities in the foreign market being thus rendered more nearly commensurate
                    with the demand, they of course sell for an adequate profit; and the value of
                    the imports again exceeds, as it always ought to do, the value of the exports.
                    But whenever a country has a large foreign expenditure to sustain, its exports
                    are proportionally augmented. Such an expenditure can only be discharged either
                    by the government directly sending abroad an equivalent amount of commodities,
                    or by means of bills of exchange drawn against produce exported by private
                    individuals. Supposing the foreign expenditure of Great Britain during the late
                    war to have amounted to ten or twenty millions a-year, it is evident we must
                    have annually exported an equal amount of the produce of ou land, capital, and
                    labour, for which payment would be received, not, as in ordinary cases, by a
                    corresponding importation<pb break="no" facs="nls:193751108"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-1108-0450"/> of foreign commodities, but from the treasury at
                    home. This is strictly true, even though it were admitted that the expenditure
                    had, in the first instance, been entirely discharged by remittances of bullion;
                    for the increased supply of bullion which was thus required could be obtained
                    only by an equally increased exportation of other produce to the countries
                    possessed of mines, or from which it could be advantageously imported. Foreign
                    expenditure, by increasing exports precisely in proportion to its own amount, is
                    incapable of exerting any permanent effect on the exchange.</p>
                <p>Thus it appears that a <hi rend="italic">really</hi> great excess of exports,
                    instead of being any criterion of increasing wealth at home, is only a certain
                    indication of great expenditure abroad. “When,” says Mr Wheatley, “the exports
                    exceed the imports, as they must do when there is a large foreign expenditure,
                    the equivalents for the excess are received abroad in as full and ample a manner
                    as if the produce which they purchased were actually imported and entered in the
                    custom-house books, and afterwards sent to the seat of war for consumption. But
                    from the circumstance of its not being inserted in the custom-house entries as
                    value received against the produce exported for its payment, the latter is
                    deemed to constitute a favourable balance, when it is in reality exported to
                    liquidate a balance against us.” (Wheatley <hi rend="italic">On the Theory of
                    Money,</hi> p. 219.)</p>
                <p>But however conclusive this reasoning may appear, it has nevertheless been
                    contended, that it is at <hi rend="italic">variance with the fact</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and that the rise of the exchange in autumn ] 814, and its
                    restoration to par in 1816, when the restriction on cash payments at the bank
                    was in full operation, is a practical and convincing proof that its previous
                    depression had not been a consequence of the depreciation of the currency, but
                    of the excessive supply of bills on London in the foreign market, occasioned by
                    the expensive contest in which we were then engaged. According to our view of
                    the matter, however, this fact leads to a precisely opposite conclusion. It is
                    of no use to tell us that the exchange came to par while the restriction act was
                    unrepealed. It was never contended that the fact of such law being in existence
                    had any effect on the currency. The restriction was justly condemned, because it
                    <hi rend="italic">enabled</hi> the Bank of England to deluge the country with
                    paper. If the bank had never abused that power,—if the proprietors had
                    sacrificed their own individual interests to those of the public, and had
                    constantly kept their paper on a level with bullion,—the restriction act, though
                    unwise, would, as to consequences, have been the same as if it had never
                    existed. The question is not, therefore, whether the exchange came to <hi
                    rend="italic">par</hi> while the restriction continued, but <hi rend="italic"
                    >whether it came to</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">par</hi><hi rend="italic">while as
                    many notes circulated as in the period of its greatest depression</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">?</hi> If this could be shown, and if it could also be shown that
                    the effective demand for paper had not, at the same time, been proportionally
                    increased, the argument would be conclusive; and we should be compelled to admit
                    that a great comparative increase of paper money has no tendency to diminish its
                    value, or to render the <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange
                    unfavourable!</p>
                <p>But it would be worse than idle to set about proving by argument a fact so
                    notorious as the prodigious diminution of bank paper in 1814, 1815, and 1816. In
                    that period above 240 country banks stopped payment; and ninety-two commissions
                    of bankruptcy were issued against these establishments; being at the rate of <hi
                    rend="italic">one</hi> commission against every <hi rend="italic">seven and a
                    half</hi> of the total number of banks existing in 1813! The Board of
                    Agriculture estimated, that in the county of Lincoln alone above <hi
                    rend="italic">three</hi> millions of bank paper had been withdrawn from
                    circulation; and the total diminution of the currency during the three years in
                    question has seldom been estimated at less than from <hi rend="italic"
                    >sixteen</hi> to <hi rend="italic">twenty</hi> millions, though it probably
                    amounted to a great deal more. Mr Horner, the accuracy and extent of whose
                    information cannot be called in question, made the following statement on this
                    subject, in his place in parliament:</p>
                <p>“From inquiries he had made, and from the accounts on the table, he was convinced
                    that <hi rend="italic">a greater and more sudden reduction of the circulating
                    medium had never taken place in any country than had taken place since the ρeaee
                    in this country,</hi> with the exception of those reductions that had taken
                    place in France after the Mississippi scheme, and after the destruction of the
                    assignats. The reduction of the currency had originated in the previous fall of
                    the prices of agricultural produce. That fall had produced a destruction of
                    country-bank paper, to an extent which would not have been thought possible,
                    without more ruin than had actually ensued. The Bank of England had also
                    restricted its issues. As appeared by the accounts recently presented, the
                    average amount of its currency was not, during the last year, more than between
                    L.25,000,000 and L.26,000,000; while two years ago it had been nearer
                    L.29,000,000, and at one time even amounted to L.31,000,000. But without looking
                    to the diminution of Bank of England paper, the reduction of the country paper
                    was enough to account for the rise which had taken place in the exchange.”</p>
                <p>Here, then, is the cause of the exchange coming to par in 1815 and 1816. It had
                    nothing to do with the cessation of hostilities, but was entirely a consequence
                    of the increased value of our currency, caused by the sudden reduction of its
                    quantity. Instead, therefore, of being at variance with the principles we have
                    been endeavouring to elucidate, this fact affords the strongest confirmation of
                    their perfect correctness. And having been sanctioned by the fullest experience,
                    they may be considered as beyond the reach of cavil and dispute.</p>
                <p>An objection of a different sort has been made, by a very able economist, to
                    another part of the theory maintained in this <hi rend="italic">section,</hi> of
                    which it may here be proper to take some notice.</p>
                <p>When the exchange becomes unfavourable, the premium, procured by the sale of the
                    bill drawn on a foreign ∣ merchant to whom bullion has been consigned, is no <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> greater than would be obtained by consigning to him J
                    coffee, tea, sugar, indigo, &amp;c. of equal value. An unfa·, vourable <hi
                    rend="italic">real</hi> exchange permits a merchant to export <hi
                    rend="subscript"> i</hi> commodities which could not be exported were the <hi
                    rend="italic">reak</hi> exchange at par, or favourable; but the advantage still’
                    remains of exporting those commodities in preference,! whose price in the
                    country from which they are exported, <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> compared with
                    their price in the country into which they <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> are
                    imported, is lowest. Suppose, for example, that thei expense of transmitting
                    bullion from this country to France ♯ is <hi rend="italic">three</hi> per cent.,
                    that the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exchange is <hi rend="italic">four</hi> per
                    cent/ against us, that the price of bullion is the <hi rend="italic">same</hi>
                    in h° <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> ^ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> countries,
                    and that coffee, exclusive of the expenses of carriage, is really worth <hi
                    rend="italic">four</hi> per cent, more in France than in England. In such a
                    case, it is obvious, the exporter of bullion would realize only a profit of <hi
                    rend="italic">one</hi> per cent., while the exporters of coffee would realize,
                    inclusive of the premium on the sale of the foreign bill, a profit of <hi
                    rend="italic">seven</hi> per cent. And hence the opinion maintained by Colonel
                    Torrens (<hi rend="italic">Comparative Estimate,</hi> &amp;c.)&gt; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t</hi> ^ <hi rend="superscript"> ιat</hi> when the exchange
                    becomes unfavourable, those commodities which contain the greatest value in the
                    smallest bulk, or on which the expense of carriage is least, would be exported
                    in preference, appears to rest on no good foundation. The prices of the
                    commodities which nations trading together are in the habit of exporting and <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193751121" xml:id="kp-eb0709-1121-0451"/>importing, are
                    regulated not merely by the cost of their production, but also by the expense
                    necessarily incurred in carrying them from where they are produced to where they
                    are consumed. If Great Britain were in the constant habit of supplying France
                    with corn and bullion, the average price of corn in France, because of the
                    expense required to convey it from this country, would plainly be from ten to
                    fifteen per cent, higher than in Britain; while, because of the comparative
                    facility with which bullion might be transported from the one to the other, its
                    value in Paris would not exceed its value in London more than one or two per
                    cent. Now, supposing that when the prices of both corn and bullion in Great
                    Britain and France are adjusted according to their natural proportions, the <hi
                    rend="italic">real</hi> exchange becomes unfavourable to us; it is clear, that
                    this fall in the exchange gives no more advantage to the exporters of bullion
                    than to those of corn. The rise in.the price of foreign bills does not increase
                    the expense attending the exportation of corn or bullion. It leaves the cost of
                    producing and transporting these commodities exactly where it found it. During
                    the depression of the exchange, the exporters of both articles derive a premium
                    from the sale of the bills drawn on their foreign correspondents. But there can
                    be no inducement to export bullion in preference to corn, unless the real price
                    of bullion should increase more rapidly in France, or decline more rapidly in
                    Great Britain, than the real price of corn.</p>
                <p>Whatever, therefore, may be the depression of the exchange, the merchant
                    invariably selects those commodities for exportation, which, exclusive of the
                    premium, yield the greatest profit on their sale. If bullion be one of these
                    commodities, it will of course be exported; if not, not. Bullion, however, of
                    all commodities, is that of which the value approaches nearest to an equality in
                    different countries, and hence it is the least likely to be exported during an
                    unfavourable exchange. The demand for it is comparatively steady, and no great
                    surplus quantity could be imported into one country without reducing its value,
                    or exported from another without raising its value, so as to unfit it either for
                    exportation or importation. A very small part only of an unfavourable balance is
                    ever paid in bullion. The operations of the bullion merchant are chiefly
                    confined to the distribution of the fresh supplies which are annually dug from
                    the mines proportionally to the effective demand of different countries. Its
                    price is too invariable, or, which is the same thing, its supply and demand are
                    too constant, to admit of its ever becoming an important article in the trade
                    between any two countries neither of which possesses mines.</p>
                <p>In corroboration of this argument, we may mention that, according to the official
                    statement laid on the table of the House of Commons, it appears that the
                    expenses incurred by this country on account of the armies acting m Portugal and
                    Spain during the following years, were as under:</p>

                    and 1814, not more than L.300,000 was sent in bullion, the rest being made up by

                    >(Edinburgh Peview</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> vol. xxvi. p. 154.)
                    The high market price of gold and silver in 1809, 1810, &amp;c. could not,
                    therefore, be owing to the purchases made by government, for they were not
                    greater than the sums exported by the East India Company in 1798 and 1799, and
                    in 1803, 1804, and 1805, when there was scarcely any perceptible rise in the
                    price of bullion. The immense additions made to the paper currency of the
                    country in 1809, 1810, &amp;c. sunk its value compared with bullion, and was the
                    true cause of the unfavourable <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange of that
                    period.</p>
                <p>SECT. III. COMPUTED EXCHANGE.</p>
                <p>Having thus endeavoured to point out the manner in which variations in the
                    comparative value of the currencies of nations trading together, and in the
                    supply and demand for bills, separately affect the exchange, it now only remains
                    to ascertain their combined effect. It is on this that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >computed</hi> or actual course of exchange depends.</p>
                <p>From what has been already stated, it must be obvious, that when the nominal and
                    real exchange are both favourable or both unfavourable, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >computed</hi> exchange will express their <hi rend="italic">sum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and that when the one is favourable and the other
                    unfavourable, it will express their <hi rend="italic">difference.</hi></p>
                <p>When, for example, the currency of Great Britain is of the mint standard and
                    purity, and the currency of France five per cent, degraded, the <hi
                    rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange will be five per cent, in favour of this
                    country. But the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exchange may, at the same time, be
                    either favourable or unfavourable. If it be also favourable to the extent of
                    one, two, three, &amp;c. per cent, the computed exchange will be six, seven,
                    eight, &amp;c. per cent, in favour of this country. And, on the other hand, if
                    it be unfavourable to the extent of one, two, three, &amp;c. per cent, the <hi
                    rend="italic">computed</hi> exchange will be only four, three, two, &amp;c. per
                    cent, in our favour. When the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exchange is in favour
                    of a particular country, provided the <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange be
                    equally against it,* the <hi rend="italic">computed</hi> exchange will be at
                    par, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi></p>
                <p>A comparison of the market with the mint price of bullion affords the best
                    criterion by which to ascertain the state of the exchange at any particular
                    period. When no restrictions are imposed on the trade in the precious metals,
                    the excess of the market over the mint price of bullion affords a pretty
                    accurate measure of the depreciation of the currency. If the market and mint
                    price of bullion at Paris and London exactly corresponded, and if the value of
                    bullion was the same in both countries, the <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi>
                    exchange would be at par; and whatever fluctuations the computed exchange might
                    exhibit, must, in such a case, be traced to fluctuations in the <hi
                    rend="italic">real</hi> exchange, or, which is the same thing, to the supply and
                    demand for bills. If, when the market price of bullion in Paris is equal to its
                    mint price, it exceeds it ten per cent, in London, it is a proof that our
                    currency is ten per cent, depreciated, and consequently the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nominal</hi> exchange between Paris and London <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be
                    ten per cent, against the latter. Instead, however, of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >computed</hi> or actual course of exchange being ten per cent, against London,
                    it may be against it to a greater or less extent, or in its favour. It will be
                    more against it provided the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exchange be also
                    unfavourable,—it will be less against it provided the <hi rend="italic"
                    >real</hi> exchange be in favour of London, though to a Jess extent than the
                    adverse <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange,—and it will be in favour<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193751134" xml:id="kp-eb0709-1134-0452"/> of London, should
                    the favourable <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exceed the unfavourable <hi
                    rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange. Thus, if while British currency is ten per
                    cent, depreciated, and French currency at par, the computed or actual course of
                    exchange between Paris and London were twelve or fifteen per cent, against the
                    latter, it would show that the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exchange was also
                    against this country to the extent of two or three per cent. And if, on the
                    other hand, the computed exchange was only five or six per cent, against London,
                    it would show that the. <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exchange was four or five
                    per cent, in its favour, and so on.</p>
                <p>It has already been shown, that, in so far at least as the question of exchange
                    is involved, the differences in the value of bullion in different countries are
                    limited by the expense of its transit from one to another. And hence, by
                    ascertaining whether a particular country exports or imports bullion to or from
                    other countries, we are able to determine its comparative value in these
                    countries. Suppose, for example, that the expense of conveying bullion from this
                    country to France, including the profits of the bullion dealer, is two per
                    cent.; it is clear, inasmuch as bullion is only exported <hi rend="italic">to
                    find its level,</hi> that whenever our merchants begin to export it to France,
                    its value there must be two per cent, greater than in England; and, on the
                    contrary, when they import bullion from France, it must be two per cent, more
                    valuable here than in France. In judging of the exchange between any two
                    countries, this circumstance must always be attended to. If no bullion be
                    passing from the one to the other, we may conclude that its value is nearly the
                    same in both; at all events, it is certain that the difference of its value is
                    not greater than the expense of transit. On the supposition that the entire
                    expense, including profit, &amp;c. of conveying bullion from Rio Janeiro to
                    London is five per cent., and that the London merchants are importing bullion,
                    then it is clear, provided the real exchange be at par, and that the currency of
                    both cities is at the mint standard, that the <hi rend="italic">nominal,</hi>
                    or, which in this case is the same thing, the <hi rend="italic">computed</hi>
                    exchange, will be five per cent, in favour of London. But if the currency of
                    London be five per cent, depreciated, or, in other words, if the market price of
                    bullion at London be five per cent, above its mint price, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >computed</hi> exchange between it and Rio Janeiro, supposing the <hi
                    rend="italic">real</hi> exchange to continue at par, will obviously also be at
                    par. It may therefore be laid down as a general rule, that as soon as bullion
                    begins to pass from one country to another, <hi rend="italic">the expense of
                    transit,</hi> provided the mint and market price of bullion in the <hi
                    rend="italic">exporting</hi> country correspond, will indicate how much the
                    value of bullion in it falls short of its value in the country into which it is
                    imported; or, which is the same thing, will be equal to its unfavourable <hi
                    rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange; and that, when the market exceeds the mint
                    price of bullion in the <hi rend="italic">exporting</hi> country, the expense of
                    transit <hi rend="italic">added</hi> to this excess will give the total
                    comparative reduction of the value of the precious metals in that country. The
                    converse of this takes place in the country <hi rend="italic">importing</hi>
                    bullion. When its currency is of the mint standard, the expense of transit
                    measures the extent of its favourable <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange;
                    but when its currency is relatively redundant or degraded, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >différence</hi> between the expense of transit and the excess of the market
                    above the mint price of bullion, will measure the extent of the favourable or
                    unfavourable <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange. It will be favourable when
                    the depreciation is less than the expense of transit, and unfavourable when it
                    is greater.</p>
                <p>From 1809 to 1815 inclusive, Great Britain continued to export gold and silver to
                    the Continent. During this period, therefore, we must add the expenses attending
                    its transit to the excess of the market over the mint price of bullion, in order
                    to ascertain the true relative value of</p>
                <p>British currency, and the state of the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exchange. Mr
                    Goldsmid stated to the bullion committee that, during the last five or six
                    months of the year 1809, the expense of transporting gold to Holland and
                    Hamburg, inclusive of freight, insurance, exporter’s profits, &amp;c. varied
                    from four to seven per cent. But at the same time that the relative value of
                    bullion in Britain was at five and a half (medium of four and seven) per cent,
                    below its value in Hamburg, the market price of gold bullion exceeded its mint
                    price to the extent or sixteen or twenty per cent, or eighteen per cent, on a
                    medium; so that the currency of this country, as compared with the currency of
                    Hamburg, which differed very little from its mint standard, was really
                    depreciated to the extent of twenty-three and a half per cent. Now, as the <hi
                    rend="italic">computed</hi> or actual course of exchange varied, during the same
                    period, from nineteen to twenty-one per cent, against London, it is clear that
                    the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exchange could not be very different from par.
                    Had the <hi rend="italic">computed</hi> exchange been less unfavourable, it
                    would have shown that the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exchange was in favour of
                    London; had it been more unfavourable, it would, on the contrary, have shown
                    that the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> exchange was decidedly against London.</p>
                <p>Provided an accurate account could be obtained of the expense attending the
                    transit of bullion from this country to the Continent during the subsequent
                    years of the war, we have no doubt it would be found, notwithstanding the
                    extraordinary depression of the <hi rend="italic">nominal,</hi> that the <hi
                    rend="italic">real</hi> exchange fluctuated very little from par; and that the
                    exportation of gold and silver was a consequence, not of the balance of payments
                    being against this country, but of its being advantageous to export bullion,
                    because of its being less valuable here than on the Continent. No person will
                    contend that, in 1809, 1810, &amp;c. there was such a redundancy of gold or
                    silver currency in this country as to sink the relative value of these metals.
                    Any such supposition is altogether out of the question. During the period
                    referred to, the precious metals were sent out of the country, because the
                    depreciation of the paper currency exceeded the cost of the transit of bullion;
                    and hence, because it was every body’s interest to pay their debts in the
                    depreciated currency, and to export that which was undepreciated to other
                    countries where there was no law to prevent its passing at its full value as
                    coin, or in which there was a greater demand for bullion. It is indisputably
                    certain that, if our <hi rend="italic">paper currency</hi> had been sufficiently
                    reduced, the supply of gold in the kingdom in 1809, 1810, &amp;c. compared with
                    the demand which must, under such circumstances, have been experienced, was so
                    very small, that, instead of exporting, we should have imported the precious
                    metals from every country in the world.</p>
                <p>It has been very generally supposed, that the extraordinary exportation of
                    British goods to the Continent during the latter years of the war, was in a
                    great measure owing <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to the depression of the
                    exchange. But, in so far as this∣ depression was occasioned by the redundancy or
                    déprécia- <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> tion of the currency,· it could have no
                    such effect. It <hi rend="superscript"> ιsι</hi> impossible', indeed, to form
                    any opinion as to the influence <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> of fluctuations
                    in the <hi rend="italic">computed</hi> exchange on export and&lt; import trade,
                    without previously ascertaining whether they <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> are a
                    consequence of fluctuations in the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">nominal ↑</hi> exchange. It· is only by an unfavourable <hi
                    rend="italic">real</hi> exchange&lt; that exportation, is facilitated; and it
                    may be favourable at <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> the very moment that the <hi
                    rend="italic">computed</hi> exchange is decidedly unfavourable. “Suppose,” to
                    use an example given by Mr Blake, “the computed exchange between Hamburg and
                    London to be one per cent, against this country, and that this arises from a <hi
                    rend="italic">real</hi> exchange which is favourable to the amount of four per
                    cent, and a nominal exchange unfavourable to the extent of five per cent.; let
                    the real <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751147" xml:id="kp-eb0709-1147-0453"/>price
                    of bullion at Hamburg and London be precisely the same, and, consequently, the
                    <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> prices different by the amount of the <hi
                    rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange or five per cent; now if the expenses of
                    freight, insurance, &amp;c. on the transit of bullion from Hamburg are three per
                    cent., it is evident that a profit would be derived from the import of that
                    article, notwithstanding the <hi rend="italic">computed</hi> exchange was one
                    per cent, against us. In this case the merchant must give a premium of one per
                    cent, for the foreign bill, to pay for the bullion: L.100 worth of bullion at
                    Hamburg would therefore cost him L.101, and the charges of importation would
                    increase the sum to L.104. Upon the subsequent sale, then, for L.105 of
                    depreciated currency in the home market, he would derive from the transaction a
                    profit of L.l. This sum is precisely the difference between the <hi
                    rend="italic">real</hi> exchange and the expenses of transit, that part of the
                    <hi rend="italic">computed</hi> exchange which depends on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nominal</hi> producing no effect; since whatever is lost by its unfavourable
                    state is counterbalanced by a corresponding inequality of <hi rend="italic"
                    >nominal</hi> prices.” <hi rend="italic">( Observations,</hi><hi rend="italic

                    though the <hi rend="italic">computed</hi> be favourable, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >real</hi> exchange may be unfavourable; and that, consequently, it might be
                    really advantageous to export, when it was apparently advantageous to import.
                    But it would be tedious to multiply instances, which, as the intelligent reader
                    will readily conceive, may be infinitely varied, and which have been
                    sufficiently explained in the foregoing sections.</p>
                <p>The real cause of the extraordinary importation of British produce into the
                    Continent in 1809, 1810, &amp;c. notwithstanding the anticomercial system of
                    Napoleon, is to be found, not in the state of the exchange; for, inasmuch as
                    that was occasioned by a fall in the value of the currency, it could have no
                    effect whatever either in increasing or diminishing exportation; but in the
                    annihilation of the neutral trade, and our monopoly of the commerce of the
                    world. The entire produce of the East and of the West was placed at our
                    disposal. The continental nations could neither procure colonial produce nor raw
                    cotton for the purposes of manufacturing, except directly from England. British
                    merchandise was thus rendered almost indispensable; and to this our immense
                    exportation, in spite of all prohibitions to the contrary, is to be ascribed.

                <p><hi rend="italic">Negotiation of Bills of Exchange.</hi></p>
                <p>In conducting the business of exchange, a direct remittance is not always
                    preferred. When a merchant in London, for example, means to discharge a debt due
                    by him in Paris, it is his business to ascertain not only the state of the
                    direct exchange between London and Paris, and, consequently, the sum which he
                    must pay in London for a bill on Paris equivalent to his debt, but also the
                    state of the exchange between London and Hamburg, Hamburg <hi rend="subscript">
                    ι</hi> and Paris, &amp;c.; for it frequently happens, that it will be more
                    advantageous for him to buy a bill on Hamburg, Amsterdam, or Lisbon, and to
                    direct his agent to invest the proceeds in a bill on Paris, rather than remit
                    directly to the latter. This is termed the <hi rend="smallcaps">arbitration</hi>
                    of exchange. An example or two will suffice to show the principle on which it is
                    conducted.</p>
                <p>Thus, if the exchange between London and Amsterdam be 35s. Flemish per pound
                    sterling, and between Paris and Amsterdam Is. 6d. Flemish per franc, then, in
                    order to ascertain whether a direct or indirect remittance to Paris ' <hi
                    rend="superscript"> v</hi> °uldbe most advantageous, we must calculate what
                    would <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> * <hi rend="superscript"> 31e</hi> value of
                    the franc in English money if the remittance were made through Holland; for if
                    it be less than <hi rend="superscript"> lat</hi> resulting from the direct
                    exchange, it will obviously be the preferable mode of remitting. This is
                    determined by stating, as 35s. Flem. (the Amsterdam currency in a pound
                    sterling): Is. 6d. Flem. (Amsterdam currency in a franc):: L.l.: 10d. the
                    proportional or <hi rend="italic">arbitrated</hi> value of the franc. Hence it
                    the English money or bill of exchange, to pay a debt in Paris, were remitted by
                    Amsterdam, it would require 10d. to discharge a debt of a franc, or L.l to
                    discharge a debt of 24 francs: and, therefore, if the exchange between London
                    and Paris were at twenty-four, it would be indifferent to the English merchant
                    whether he remitted directly to Paris, or indirectly <hi rend="italic">via</hi>
                    Amsterdam; but if the exchange between London and Paris were <hi rend="italic"
                    >above</hi> twenty-four, then a direct remittance would be preferable; while,
                    if, on the other hand, the direct exchange were less than twenty-four, the
                    indirect remittance ought as plainly to be preferred.</p>
                <p>“Suppose,” to borrow an example from Dr Kelly (<hi rend="italic">Universal
                    Cambist,</hi> vol.ii. p. 137), “the exchange of London and Lisbon to be at 68d.
                    per milree, and that of Lisbon on Madrid 500 rees per dollar, the arbitrated
                    price between London and Madrid is 34d. sterling per dollar; for as 1000 rees:
                    68d.:: 500 rees: 34d. But if the direct exchange of London on Madrid be 35d.
                    sterling per dollar, then London, by remitting directly to Madrid, must pay 35d.
                    for every dollar; whereas, by remitting through Lisbon, he will pay only 34d.;
                    it is, therefore, the interest of London to remit indirectly to Madrid through
                    Lisbon. On the other hand, if London draws directly on Madrid, he will receive
                    35d.'sterling per dollar; whereas, by drawing indirectly through Lisbon, he
                    would receive only 34d.; it is, therefore, the interest of London to draw
                    directly on Madrid. Hence the following rules:</p>
                <p>“1. Where the <hi rend="italic">certain price</hi> is given, draw through the
                    place which produces the lowest arbitrated price, and remit through that which
                    produces the highest.</p>
                <p>“2. Where the <hi rend="italic">uncertain price</hi> is given, draw through that
                    place which produces the highest arbitrated price, and remit through that which
                    produces the lowest.”</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Compound Arbitration,</hi> or when more than <hi
                    rend="italic">three</hi> places are concerned, then, in order to find how much a
                    remittance passing through them all will amount to in the last place, or, which
                    is the same thing, to find the arbitrated price between the first and the last,
                    we have only to repeat the different statements, in the same manner as in the
                    foregoing examples.</p>
                <p>Thus, if the exchange between London and Amsterdam be 35s. Flem. for L.l
                    sterling; between Amsterdam and Lisbon 42d. Flem. for 1 old crusade; and between
                    Lisbon and Paris 480 rees for 3 francs, What is the arbitrated price between
                    London and Paris?</p>
                <p>In the first place, as 35s. Flem.: L.l:: 42d. Flem.: 2s. sterling, = 1 old
                    crusade.</p>
                <p>Second, as 1 old crusade, or 400 rees: 2s. sterling:: 480 rees: 2s. 4∣d.
                    sterling, — 3 francs.</p>
                <p>Third, as 2s. 4∣. sterling: 3 francs:: L.l sterling: 25 francs, the arbitrated
                    price of the pound sterling between London and Paris.</p>

                    for a common dividend. Arithmetical books abound with examples of such
                    operations.</p>
                <p>The following account of the manner in which a very large transaction was
                    actually conducted, by indirect remittances, will sufficiently illustrate the
                    principles we have been endeavouring to explain.</p>
                <p>In 1804 Spain was bound to pay to France a large subsidy; and, in order to do
                    this, three distinct methods presented themselves;</p>
                <p>1. To send dollars to Paris by land.</p>
                <p>2. To remit bills of exchange directly to Paris.</p>
                <p>3. To authorise Paris to draw directly on Spain.</p>
                <p>The first of these methods was tried, but it was found too slow and expensive;
                    and the second and third plans were considered likely to turn the exchange
                    against Spain. The following method by the indirect or circular exchange was
                    therefore adopted.</p>
                <p>A merchant, or <hi rend="italic">banquier,</hi> at Paris, was appointed to manage
                    the operation, which he thus conducted: He chose London, Amsterdam, Hamburg,
                    Cadiz, Madrid, and Paris, as the principal hinges on which the operation was to
                    turn; and he engaged correspondents in each of these cities to support the
                    circulation. Madrid and Cadiz were the places in Spain from whence remittances
                    were to be made; and dollars were, of course, to be sent to where they bore the
                    highest price, for which bills were to be procured on Paris, or on any other
                    places that might be deemed more advantageous.</p>
                <p>The principle being thus established, it only remained to regulate the extent of
                    the operation, so as not to issue too much paper on Spain, and to give the
                    circulation as much support as possible from real business. With this view
                    London was chosen as a place to which the operation might be chiefly directed,
                    as the price of dollars was then high in England, a circumstance which rendered
                    the proportional exchange advantageous to Spain.</p>
                <p>The business was commenced at Paris, where the negotiation of drafts issued on
                    Hamburg and Amsterdam served to answer the immediate demands of the state; and
                    orders were transmitted to these places to draw for the reimbursements on
                    London, Madrid, or Cadiz, according as the course of exchange was most
                    favourable. The proceedings were all conducted with judgment, and attended with
                    complete success. At the commencement of the operation, the course of exchange
                    of Cadiz on London was 36d.; but, by the plan adopted, Spain got 39∣d. or above
                    eight per cent, by the remittance of dollars to London, and considerable
                    advantages were also gained by the circulation of bills through the several
                    places on the Continent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>In the dating of bills the new style is now used in every country in Europe with
                    the exception of Russia.</p>
                <p>In London, bills of exchange are bought and sold by' brokers, who go round to the
                    principal merchants, and discover whether they are buyers or sellers of bills. A
                    few of the brokers of most influence, after ascertaining the state of the supply
                    and demand for bills, suggest a price at which the greater part of the
                    transactions of the day are settled, with such deviations as particular bills,
                    from their being in very high or low credit, may be subject to. The price fixed
                    by the brokers is that which is published in Wettenhall’s list; but it is stated
                    by Mr Goldsmid, that the first houses generally negotiate their bills on a half,
                    one, one and a half, and two percent better terms than those quoted. In London
                    and other great commercial cities, a class of middlemen speculate largely on the
                    rise and fall of the exchange, buying bills when they expect a rise, and selling
                    them when a fall is anticipated.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Advantages of Bills of Exchange.</hi></p>
                <p>It is not easy to discover the precise era when bills of exchange were first
                    employed to transfer and adjust the· mutual claims and obligations of merchants.
                    Their in-∣ vention has been ascribed to the Arabians and the Jews, of the middle
                    ages; but it seems certain that bills were in use in remote antiquity. Isocrates
                    states that a stranger who brought some cargoes of corn to Athens, furnished a
                    merchant of the name of Stratocles with an order or bill of exchange, on a town
                    on the Pontus Euxinus, where money was owing to him; and, because the person who
                    had drawn the bill had no <hi rend="italic">fixed domicile,</hi> Stratocles was
                    to have recourse on a merchant in Athens, m the event of its being protested.
                    The merchant, says Isocrates,-who procured this order found it extremely
                    advantageous, inasmuch as it enabled him to avoid risking his fortune on seas
                    covered with pirates and the hostile squadrons of the Lacedaemonians. (De Pauw,
                    <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur les Grecs,</hi> i. 258.)</p>
                <p>There is also unquestionable evidence to show that the method of transferring and
                    cancelling the debts of part∣&lt; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751173"

                    credit, or, which is in effect the same thing, by means of bills of exchange,
                    was not unknown to the Romans. Cicero, in one of his epistles to Atticus <hi
                    rend="italic">(Epist. ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Atticum,</hi> χfi. 24), inquires
                    whether his son must carry cash to defray the expense of his studies along with
                    him to Athens, or whether he might not save this trouble and expense <hi
                    rend="italic">by obtaining αη assignment for an equivalent sum from a creditor
                    in Borne on his debtor there.</hi> It is evident, from a subsequent epistle of
                    Cicero’s, that the latter method had been preferred, and that the transference
                    of the money had in consequence been rendered unnecessary. <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Mr Macpherson states <hi rend="italic">(Annals of Commerce,</hi> ĩ. p. 405), that
                    the first mention of bills of exchange in modern history occurs in 1255. The
                    pope having quarrelled with Manfred, king of Sicily, engaged, on Henry III. of
                    England agreeing to indemnify him for the expense, to depose Manfred, and raise
                    his second son Edmund to the Sicilian throne. The enterprise misgave. But the
                    merchants of Sienna and Florence who originally advanced the money to carry it
                    into effect, or rather to gratify the pope’s rapacity, were paid by bills of
                    exchange drawn on the <hi rend="italic">Prelates</hi> of England, who, although
                    they protested they knew nothing at all about the transaction, were nevertheless
                    compelled, under pain of excommunication, to pay the bills and <hi rend="italic"
                    >interest!</hi></p>
                <p>Capmany, in his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> respecting the Commerce, &amp;c.
                    of Barcelona, gives a copy of an ordonnance of the magistracy, dated in 1394,
                    enacting that bills should be accepted within twenty-four hours after their
                    presentation;—a sufficient proof that they were in general use in the beginning
                    of the fourteenth century.</p>
                <p>But whatever be the era of the introduction of bills of exchange, very few
                    inventions have redounded more to the general advantage. Without this simple and
                    ingenious contrivance, commerce could not have made any considerable progress.
                    Had there been no means of settling and adjusting the mutual claims of debtors
                    and creditors otherwise than by the intervention of metallic money (for bank
                    paper is only another species of bills of exchange), a very great
                    proportion,—many hundreds of millions,—of that capital which is now setting
                    productive labour in motion in every quarter of the globe, and ministering to
                    the wants and the enjoyments of mankind, must have been devoted to the
                    expediting those exchanges which are much better accomplished by the agency of a
                    few quires of paper. Instead of a perpetual importation and exportation of gold
                    and silver, necessarily attended by an immensity of trouble and expense, a few
                    bills of exchange, possessing little or no intrinsic worth, and which maybe
                    transferred with the utmostfacility, suffice to adjust the most extensive and
                    complicated transactions. But the mere setting free of an immense productive
                    power, engaged in a comparatively disadvantageous employment, is only one of the
                    many benefits we owe to the use of bills <hi rend="superscript"> 01</hi>
                    exchange. By cheapening the instruments by which commerce is carried on, they
                    have materially reduced the prices of most commodities; and have, in
                    consequence» increased the command of all classes over the necessaries and
                    luxuries of life, and accelerated the progress of civilization, by occasioning a
                    much more extensive intercourse and intimate connection between different and
                    independent countries, than could otherwise have taken place.</p>
                <p>In a political point of view their effects have been equally salutary. They
                    enable every individual imperceptibly to transfer his fortune to other
                    countries, and to preserve it safe alike from the rapacity of his own government
                    and the hostile attacks of others. The security of property has, in consequence,
                    been prodigiously augmented. And though we should concede to the satirist that
                    papercredit has “lent corruption lighter wings to fly,”<note anchored="true"

                    render subjects less dependent on the policy, and less liable to be injuriously
                    affected by injudicious measures on the part of their rulers. In countries in a
                    low stage of civilization, the inhabitants endeavour, by burying all the gold
                    and silver they can collect, to preserve a part of their property from the
                    despots by whom they are alternately plundered and oppressed. This was
                    universally the case in the middle ages; and in Turkey, India, Persia, and other
                    eastern countries, the practice is still carried on to a very great extent. Some
                    economists have endeavoured to account for the long-continued importation and
                    high value of the precious metals in India, by the loss which necessarily
                    attends the practice of hoarding; and undoubtedly this locking up of capital is
                    one of the main causes of the extreme poverty of these countries. But the
                    security afforded by bills of exchange is infinitely greater than any derived
                    from the barbarous expedient of trusting property to the bosom of the earth.
                    “Pregnant with thousands flits the <hi rend="italic">scrap</hi> unseen,” and in
                    a moment places the largest fortune beyond the reach of danger 1 Mr Harris was,
                    therefore, right in saying, “that the introduction of bills of exchange was the
                    greatest security to merchants, both as to their persons and effects, and
                    consequently the greatest encouragement to commerce, and the greatest blow to
                    despotism, of any thing that ever was invented.” (Harris <hi rend="italic">on

                <p>Previously to the peace of Paris in 1763, Amsterdam, because of its commerce, the
                    wealth and punctuality of its merchants, and their intimate connection with all
                    the other great trading cities of the world, was the chief place where the
                    accounts of the different commercial countries were balanced and adjusted. But
                    the entire loss of foreign trade, and the other vexations to which Holland was
                    subjected during the ascendancy of the French, nearly divested Amsterdam of all
                    share in this business. London has now become the trading metropolis of Europe,
                    and of the world. The vast extent of its commercial dealings has necessarily
                    rendered it the great mart for bills of exchange. Its bill merchants, a class of
                    men remarkable for their shrewdness, and generally possessed of laŗge capitals,
                    assist in trimming and adjusting the balance of debt and credit between the most
                    remote countries. They <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751186"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-1186-0456"/>buy up bills where they are cheap, and sell them
                    where they are dear; and, by the extent of their correspondence and the
                    magnitude of their transactions, give a steadiness to the exchange, which it
                    could not otherwise attain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Laws and Customs Respecting Bills and Notes.</hi></p>
                <p>A bill of exchange may be defined to be an open letter of request or order from
                    one person, the <hi rend="italic">drawer,</hi> to another person, the <hi
                    rend="italic">drawee,</hi> who is thereby desired to pay a sum of money, therein
                    specified, to a third person, the <hi rend="italic">payee.</hi> When the <hi
                    rend="italic">drawee</hi> obeys the request or order, by subscribing the
                    document, he becomes <hi rend="italic">acceptor.</hi> If the contrary do not
                    appear on the face of the bill, it is presumed that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >drawee</hi> has funds of the <hi rend="italic">drawer s</hi> in his hands to
                    the amount of the bill, and that the drawer is indebted to theyjayee to that
                    extent. The bill thus operates as a transfer ormercantile assignment to the
                    payee, of the drawee’s debt to the drawer. But a bill may also be drawn payable
                    to the <hi rend="italic">drawer</hi> or his order, in which case, when accepted,
                    the document is not an assignment, but merely the acknowledgment or constitution
                    of a debt. This is also accomplishable by <hi rend="italic">promissory
                    note,</hi> which is a promise by one person, the <hi rend="italic">maker</hi>
                    (Scoticĕ <hi rend="italic">granted),</hi> to pay a sum to another person, the
                    <hi rend="italic">payee</hi> (Scoticé <hi rend="italic">granted).</hi> The bill
                    and the promissory note have now equally the privilege of being <hi
                    rend="italic">assignable</hi> or <hi rend="italic">transferable</hi> from one
                    person to another by indorsement, that is, by the <hi rend="italic">payee</hi>
                    subscribing his name on the back of the document. In this case the <hi
                    rend="italic">payee</hi> becomes an <hi rend="italic">indorser,</hi> and the
                    person in whose favour the indorsement is made is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >indorsee,</hi> who may again indorse to another; and in this manner the bill or
                    note may pass from hand to hand without limitation. Each indorsation may be made
                    <hi rend="italic">in full</hi> or <hi rend="italic">in blank</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> in full, by filling up the name and description of the
                    party in whose favour it is made, which is attended with several advantages if
                    the document should be lost or stolen; in blank, by merely subscribing the
                    indorser’s name, which is equivalent to making it payable to the <hi
                    rend="italic">bearer.</hi> All the indorsements, or any one of them, may also be
                    <hi rend="italic">qualified</hi> by the words <hi rend="italic">without
                    recourse</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and when this is done, neither the
                    indorsee nor any subsequent <hi rend="italic">holder</hi> of the bill or note
                    can have recourse on the indorser who thus qualifies his indorsation. If none of
                    the indorsations be so qualified, the <hi rend="italic">last holder</hi> for
                    value, and <hi rend="italic">in bona fide,</hi> has all the prior indorsers and
                    other parties to the bill or note bound to him jointly and severally. He may
                    select any one of them, or proceed against them all at the same time; and if all
                    were to become bankrupt, he could claim on the estate of each for the whole
                    debt, and be entitled to receive dividends from ail the estates until he
                    obtained <hi rend="italic">full payment,</hi> but which he must not exceed. An
                    indorser may also qualify his indorsation by the condition that his indorsee
                    shall not have the power of making an indorsement from himself.</p>
                <p>From the negotiability thus conferred upon them, bills have been compared to bags
                    of money; but it should be remembered that, in the former case, we transfer only
                    <hi rend="italic">a right,</hi> in the latter the <hi rend="italic">property
                    itself.</hi> The comparison is best supported in those transferences which are
                    made without recourse, since, in those instances, the bill passes from hand to
                    hand without any alteration in the rights and duties of those interested in it,
                    and without any one acquiring an additional security. In the simplest case,
                    however, the rights arising on a bill may be preserved or lost by the conduct of
                    the holder; and where there has been even one unqualified indorsation, the
                    duties of the holder are of a delicate and important nature. But these will be
                    more readily understood after we have pointed out the requisites of a bill.</p>
                <p>The general requisites of a bill are, that it must be payable at all events; that
                    it must be for payment of money only; and that the money must not be payable
                    from any particular fund. Of the more special requisites, <hi rend="italic">the
                    fast</hi> is, that any bill or note drawn or made in Great Britain (though dated
                    abroad<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Chitty, õth edit.
                    p. 70, 7 T. 11. G01, 4 Camp. La-x, 2G9.</p></note>) or in its colonies, is, that
                    it be written on paper <hi rend="italic">stamped</hi> according to the law of
                    the mother country or colony, as it happens to be drawn in the one or the other.
                    The stamp-duty varies according to the sum in the bill, and the extension of the
                    term of payment: but for these particulars, and the mode of complying with the
                    provisions of the law, reference should be made to the statutes in force at the
                    time. The present regulating statute is that of 55 Geo. III. c. 184, both as to
                    <hi rend="italic">inland</hi> bills and notes, and bills of exchange drawn here
                    <hi rend="italic">on</hi> foreign countries. As to bills truly drawn in foreign
                    states, not colonies of Great Britain, on traders in this country, our law takes
                    no cognizance of them as to whether they are or are not stamped; but <hi
                    rend="italic">promissory notes</hi> made <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of Britain
                    are declared <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be negotiable or payable unless
                    stamped agreeably to our laws. Bills drawn at home must also be written on the
                    stamp appropriated for bills. If on a stamp of another denomination, though of
                    equal or superior value, they are invalid if not got re-stamped, which they may
                    be for payment of the duty and a penalty of 40s. when carried to the
                    stamp-office before they are due, but when after due, the penalty is L.10. If
                    written on a stamp below the proper value, a penalty is incurred of L.50, and
                    the bills, besides, are <hi rend="italic">null</hi> (Bell’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Com. on Bankrupt Law,</hi> vol. ii. p. 249); but it has been found with us in
                    England, that if a bill be <hi rend="italic">not</hi> properly stamped, a
                    neglect to present for acceptance or payment will not relieve parties who are
                    <hi rend="italic">otherwise</hi> liable in the <hi rend="italic">original
                    debt</hi> in respect of which the bill was granted. The relief in this case is
                    granted by a court of equity, but this relief is not extended to remote
                    indorsers not responsible for the original debt. Relief, however, is given when
                    a party has bound himself to grant a valid note or bill, but gives one by
                    mistake or design on a defective stamp. Negotiable bills under L.5 must, by 37
                    Geo. III. c. 32, be payable within twenty-one days, and bear the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">place</hi> where they are made, without which also <hi
                    rend="italic">checks</hi> on bankers are liable to stamp-duty. Penalties are
                    likewise imposed on the post-dating of such <hi rend="italic">checks,</hi> or of
                    bills, for the purpose of reducing the duty by apparently shortening the term of
                    payment; and there are provisions in those laws respecting bills drawn in sets
                    or otherwise, with which every trader should make himself acquainted. This,
                    however, it is very difficult to do in all its bearings, since the penalties and
                    provisions of the prior statutes are retained in every subsequent one, except as
                    therein specially altered. This is one great evil in our fiscal regulations.
                    Where the law cannot be known, transactions are rendered uncertain, property
                    insecure, and litigation is increased to a mischievous extent. But the worst
                    evil is, that this state of the law increases in a prodigious degree the
                    influence of the crown, by the power over traders which is thus placed in the
                    hands o solicitors of stamps, excise, customs, and other crown or-ficers∙</p>
                <p>The other requisites of a bill are, 2&lt;Ŵ/, That it should bear the name of the
                    place at which it is made or drawn, and if the street and number of the house be

                    distinctly marked, and, if <hi rend="italic">written</hi> at length, a higher
                    protection would be afforded against accidental or intentional alterations and
                    vitiations. If a bill have no date, the date of issuing will be held as the date
                    of the bill, <hi rend="italic">⅛thly,</hi> The time of payment should be clearly
                    expressed, and a <hi rend="italic">time certain</hi> is necessary to make the

                    say, the payment must not depend on an event that may never happen, such as the

                    be made both for acceptance and payment. If no place be mentioned, the place of
                    doing business, if the acceptor have one, or otherwise his dwelling-house,
                    becomes the place of presentment. <hi rend="italic">Qthly,</hi> The sum payable
                    should be clearly written in the body of the bill, and the superscription of the
                    sum in figures will aid an omission in the body. This sum must in all cases be
                    above 20s.; and if payable more than twenty-one days after date, it must exceed
                    L.5. <hi rend="italic                         superscript"> t</hi><hi

                    >bona fide</hi> holder, and will not prevent the payee from recovering on the

                    in England, recover interest and damages against the drawer and indorser in

                    these to indorsements; and 3 and 4 Anne, c. 9, it is thought, extends the same
                    to notes. (Chitty, p. 196.) <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    accidents and litigation. But traders, we fear, have too generally a prejudice
                    in favour of that brevity which approaches to looseness of expression, and
                    against that precision which alone can keep them out of difficulties.</p>
                <p>When a bill, check, or note, is payable <hi rend="italic">on demand,</hi> or then

                    them. If rawn at one or more days after sight, the days of grace must be
                    allowed. The day on which a bill is dated is not reckoned one; but all bills

                    such as the Jews Sabbath, the noticeswill be good if given on the next day.
                    Calendar months are always un- ' derstood with respect to bills; and if dated on
                    the 29th, 30th, or 31st of January, payable <hi rend="italic">one month</hi>
                    after date, they will fall due on the <hi rend="italic">last day of</hi>
                    February·, from which the days of grace are to be calculated. Presentments of
                    bills should be made within business hours. These are generally * considered to
                    be in London from nine morning to six even-í ing, but a protest has been held
                    good against an ordinary trader when made at eight. This would not have been
                    good in the case of bankers, whose hours (from nine to five in London) must be
                    attended to. In Edinburgh, bankers’ hours are from ten to three; traders from
                    ten to three and from six to eight; but there are no Scotch decisions holding
                    these as the only business hours. A verbal notice of the dishonour of an <hi
                    rend="italic">inland</hi> bill is good; but as such notice is always matter of
                    parole evidence, it is better in every case to give notice in writing, and the
                    regular mode of doing so is by post. Such notice, if put into the general
                    post-office, or an authorized receiving-house, is good though it miscarry,
                    provided the letter be regularly booked, and reasonable proof be made of its
                    having been put into the post-office. If given only to a bellman in the street,
                    it would not in such a case be good. When there is no post, the ordinary mode of
                    conveyance, such as the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> ship or carrier, is
                    sufficient. As to <hi rend="italic">foreign bills,</hi> notices of dishonour,
                    with the respective protests, must be dispatched by post on the day when the
                    bills become due, or on which the acceptance was refused, if any post or
                    ordinary conveyance set out that day, and if not, by the next earliest
                    conveyance. (Chitty, 291.) As to <hi rend="italic">inland</hi> bills, notice
                    should be made by the first post after the expiry of a day, when the parties
                    reside at a distance; if in the same town it is enough if the notice be made so
                    as to be received within business hours of the following day, and this may be
                    done by the twopenny or penny post, if receivable within the time mentioned.
                    When a holder deposits his bill at his banker’s, the number of persons entitled
                    to notice is increased by one; and each party in succession is entitled to <hi
                    rend="italic">twenty-four hours</hi> for giving notice (6 East. 3 Bell, 263.)
                    Such notice, as to inland bills, is necessary in England for preserving recourse
                    as to the principal sum only. If protest be made and notice given within
                    fourteen days, the recourse is preserved as to <hi rend="italic">interest,</hi>
                    damages, and expenses. In Scotland a protest is necessary in every case, and
                    there is no distinction made as to the mode of recourse between principal and
                    interest; but intimation to the drawer within <hi rend="italic">fourteen</hi>
                    days preserves recourse for the whole (Bell, vol. ii. p. 265); and it has been
                    decided, that notice of an indorser may be good even after the fourteen days, if
                    there has been no unnecessary delay. <hi rend="italic">(Fac. Col.</hi> 2d June
                    1812.) But this applies only to <hi rend="italic">inland</hi> bills, and a bill
                    drawn from Scotland upon England is in Scotland held to be foreign. (Bell, vol.
                    ii. p. 265.) Every bill should be presented for payment on the day upon which it
                    falls due, unless that be rendered impossible by some unforeseen and <hi
                    rend="italic">inévitable</hi> accident, such as shipwreck, or sudden illness, or
                    death. To preserve recourse, the accident, and the presentment of the bill as
                    soon as possible afterwards, must be intimated without delay, and, if denied,
                    proved by the party who seeks recourse. The same doctrine will hold as to
                    presentments for non-acceptance and notices of dishonour. But the loss or
                    destruction of a bill is no excuse for not demanding payment and protesting; the
                    protest in that case being made upon a copy or statement of the bill, if the
                    party who has right to hold the bill has it in his power to make such a
                    statement. If the destruction of the bill can be proved, action will be
                    sustained<pb break="no" facs="nls:193751212" xml:id="kp-eb0709-1212-0458"/> in a
                    court of law; if not, the ι edress is got upon giving an indemnity in a court of
                    equity; but as equity will not interfere where law can, it is of importance in
                    such a case, and indeed in all cases of difficulty, to resort at once to the
                    best professional advice. Inconsiderate attempts to remedy neglects, or cure
                    what is defective, generally make the case worse, and often implicate character.
                    Cases of great hardship and difficulty frequently arose on bills granted partly
                    for <hi rend="italic">usurious</hi> consideration. A mighty benefit, however,
                    has now been conferred by the statute 58 Geo. III. c. 93, which enacts, “That
                    <hi rend="italic">no bill</hi> of exchange or promissory note that shall be
                    drawn or made after the passing of this act shall, though it may have been given
                    for a usurious consideration, or upon a usurious contract, <hi rend="italic">be
                    void</hi> in <hi rend="italic">the hands of an indorsee for valuable
                    consideration,</hi> unless such an indorsee had, at the time of discounting or
                    paying such consideration for the same, <hi rend="italic">actual notice</hi>
                    that such bill, &amp;c. had been originally given for a usurious consideration,
                    or upon a usurious contract.” It is much to be regretted that the same
                    protection was not extended by this statute to the <hi rend="italic">innocent
                    holder</hi> of a bill granted for a game debt. Such bills are still void in the
                    hands of a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> indorsee. In Scotland it has been
                    decided otherwise, (25th January 1740, Nielson; Bell, vol. ii. p. 210.) The rage
                    for legislation has not yet extended itself to lawyers, who, as a body, can
                    hardly be expected to display an anxiety to remedy defects which add to their
                    emoluments and consequence. How much of the learning of this profession is
                    wasted on niceties and difficulties that would readily yield to the spell of an
                    act of parliament! To the law, however, we owe this sound maxim, that “unless it
                    has been so expressly declared by the legislature, as it formerly was in the
                    case of usury, and still is as to bills for <hi rend="italic">game</hi> debts,
                    illegality of consideration will be no defence in an action at the suit of a <hi
                    rend="italic">bona fide</hi> holder, without notice of the illegality, unless he
                    obtained the bill after it became due.” (Chitty, 105.) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Υ</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">nxs forgery</hi> does not
                    vitiate a bill. The forged document is good to and against all parties but those
                    whose names are forged. Against one whose name is forged, it is true, it will
                    neither support an action nor ground a claim; “yet if he have given credit to
                    acceptances or indorsations as binding on him, forged by the same hand, he will
                    be liable.” (3 Esp'. N. P. 60; 2 Bell, 250.) Subsequent approbation also does
                    away an objection on the head of forgery or fraud, and generally all sorts of
                    objections otherwise competent. This doctrine holds as to vitiations when the
                    stamp laws are not concerned; but without the consent of parties all vitiations
                    or alterations of bills in material parts are fatal. (2 Bell, 252.) A clerk or
                    servant may accept a bill for his master if authorized so to do; and authority
                    will be inferred from a sanctioned practice. The law on this point is dangerous,
                    and would require legislative revision. If the servant or agent do not explain
                    the character in which he acts, but subscribes his own name simply, he will bind
                    himself, not his employer. An acceptor may enlarge the term of payment, or
                    accept for a part, or under any other condition not expressed in the bill; but
                    in that case it is optional in the holder to take the acceptance as thus
                    offered, or to proceed as if no such offer had been made; if rejected, the
                    protest should bear the condition, and the rejection of it; it should also be
                    kept in view, that a <hi rend="italic">holder</hi> who accepts of a limited or
                    conditional acceptance, liberates the drawer and prior indorser, unless he have
                    their consent. Blank indorsements are held to be of the date of the bill, until
                    the contrary is proved. Indorsements after the term of payment, though for
                    value, do not protect the indorsees like indorsements before maturity; very
                    slight evidence is admitted as proof of knowledge of dishonour, and the holder
                    in that case becomes liable to all exceptions which can be stated against the
                    right of his immediate indorser, or the person who held the bill when it became
                    due. When acceptance is refused, and the bill returned with protest, action may
                    be raised immediately against the drawer, though the regular time of payment is
                    not arrived. His debt, in such a case, is considered as contracted the moment
                    the bill was drawn· if the date of the bill be prior to that of a commission of
                    bankrupt, the debt, in such a case, may be claimed upon. As to current bills and
                    contingent claims, the case is unfortunately different; in these respects
                    England mi+t derive great help from the law of Scotland.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">drawee,</hi> who, having funds, refuses to accept, is
                    responsible for the consequences to the <hi rend="italic">drawer,</hi> and may
                    also be sued for payment by the payee or holder, the presentment and protesting
                    of the bill for non-acceptance operating as an intimated assignment and complete
                    transfer of the debt <hi rend="italic">to the holder,</hi> who in Scotland is
                    preferred to any subsequent arrester. The <hi rend="italic">drawee</hi> who has
                    no funds is not bound to accept; but, after protest for non-acceptance, he may
                    accept supra-protest, for the <hi rend="italic">honour</hi> of the drawer and
                    indorsers, or either of them. A <hi rend="italic">third party</hi> may thus
                    accept for <hi rend="italic">honour</hi> supra-protest ;'and whoever does so, if
                    he give immediate notice, and send off the protest, may have immediate recourse
                    on the party or parties for whose honour he has interfered.</p>
                <p>It is the duty of a <hi rend="italic">payee,</hi> when directed by the drawer,
                    and of every one who is merely an agent for the owner, though acting
                    gratuitously, to present a bill for acceptance. The time thought reasonable for
                    this purpose is twenty-four hours, or at least within business hours of the day
                    following that on which the bill was received. It is prudent in all holders of a
                    bill to present for acceptance within this period; and <hi rend="italic">in all
                    cases</hi> where a presentment is made, and acceptance refused, notice should be
                    given to all against whom it is meant to preserve recourse. A draught may be
                    left twenty-four hours with the drawee, if no post go out in the mean time; but
                    if he intimate within that time that he will not accept, or ask <hi
                    rend="italic">more time</hi> to consider, <hi rend="italic">notice should be
                    given.</hi> (Chitty, 288, 289.) A verbal acceptance, if it can be proved, or one
                    by a separate writing, binds the drawee; but in Scotland none but a written
                    acceptance on the bill will authorize the usual summary diligence. (Chitty,
                    217-270; 2 Bell, 69-240.) If the drawee had no funds, notice to the drawer is
                    not necessary; but as the not having fundsis a matter of fact to be proved, it
                    is safer in this, and indeed in all other cases, to give the usual and regular
                    notice. When <hi rend="italic">a</hi> bill is drawn at some certain time <hi
                    rend="italic">after sight,</hi> presentment is <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi>
                    to fix the term of payment. Respecting bills of this description, both foreign
                    and inland, the general rule is, that <hi rend="italic">due diligence must be
                    used,</hi> foreign bills, so drawn, may be put into the circulation without
                    acceptance as long as the convenience of the successive holders requires; and it
                    has been found not to be <hi rend="italic">laches</hi> (in Sçotland <hi
                    rend="italic">mora,</hi> or undue delay) to keep a bill (at three flays’ sight)
                    out in the circulation for twelve months; but if, instead of circulating, a
                    holder were to lock it up, this would be <hi rend="italic">laches.</hi> An
                    unacceptable inland bill may also be put into circulation; and any holder, who
                    does not circulate it, has a reasonable time, such as the fourth day respecting
                    a bill drawn within twenty miles of London, for presenting it there for
                    acceptance. Dispatch and attention, however, are always advisable. It is said
                    that when a bill has been already protested for non-acceptance, and due notice
                    thereof given, it is not necessary to protest or to give notice on account of
                    non-payment, but it is usual to do so, and the safer practice. Ibe same rules
                    and the same time should be observed as to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751225"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-1225-0459"/> non-payment, that are observed as to protest and
                    notice, in the case of non acceptance. When inland bills are made payable on a
                    day named and fixed in the bills, it is common to delay presenting them for
                    acceptance, until they can also be presented for payment, and then, if
                    necessary, to protest for both; but it is better to make a presentment for
                    acceptance as soon as it can be done in the ordinary course of business. It has
                    already been stated, that notice either of non-acceptance when a presentment has
                    been made, or for non-payment, <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be given <hi
                    rend="italic">io all the parlies</hi> to whom the <hi rend="italic">holder</hi>
                    intends to resort for payment. Bankruptcy is no excuse for neglecting any step
                    in the negotiation of a bill. If a party be bankrupt, notice of recourse should
                    be given to him and his assignees; if cføw/, to bis executor or administrator;
                    if abroad, the notice should be left at his place of residence, if he have one,
                    and a demand of acceptance or payment (when that is necessary) should be made of
                    his wife or servant. Notice should also be made to one who merely guarantees
                    payment; and a person who subscribes a bill not addressed to him is held to be a
                    collateral security. If notice be made to one indorser, he may give notice to
                    prior indorsers, or to the drawer; and if done timeously, it will be available
                    to the bolder; but notice by a party, not party to the bill, nor agent for a
                    party, will not be available.</p>
                <p>Accommodation bills are subject to the same rules as other paper, except among
                    those who agree to lend their names or credit. Among them the rule is, that he
                    for whose use the money is to be raised shall provide for the bill; but as all
                    the others have an action of relief when forced to pay, they are entitled to
                    notice. In Scotland this has been extended to the drawer when he is not the
                    party for whom the credit was intended. With respect to cross paper, it is held
                    that mutual accommodations exchanged are good considerations for each other;
                    that in case of bankruptcy, a dividend from any one estate is to be held as
                    payment of all that can be demanded in respect of that debt; and that there can
                    be no double ranking of the same debt. But questions often arise in such cases,
                    which require the utmost professional skill to comprehend and decide. In a short
                    digest of this nature it is impossible to enter.into the niceties of legal
                    questions; and we can only observe generally, that parties should never act in
                    cases of difficulty, without taking the best professional assistance.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">law</hi> respecting bills of exchange is more consonant to
                    reason than almost any other branch of our law, since, where it is silent,
                    recourse is had to the custom of merchants.</p>
                <p>The best authorities respecting the law of bills are the treatises of Chitty and

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Exchange</hi> also signifies a place in most considerable
                    trading cities, where the merchants, agents, bankers, brokers, interpreters, and
                    other persons concerned in commerce, congregate on certain days, and at certain
                    times of the day, to confer and treat together of matters relating to exchanges,
                    remittances, payments, adventures, assurances, freightments, and other
                    mercantile negotiations, both by sea and land.</p>
                <p>In Flanders, in Holland, and in several cities of France, these places are called
                    <hi rend="italic">Bourses</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> at Paris and at Lyons,
                    <hi rend="italic">Places de Change</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in the Hanse
                    Towns, <hi rend="italic">Borsenhalle.</hi> These assemblies are held with so
                    much exactness, and merchants and traders are so indispensably required to
                    attend at them, that a person’s absence alone makes him suspected of a failure
                    or bankruptcy. The most considerable exchanges in Europe are, first, that of
                    Amsterdam, and, secondly, that of London, called the Royal Exchange.</p>
                <p>Even in the time of the ancient Romans, there were places for merchants to meet,
                    in most of the considerable cities of the empire. That which is said by some to
                    have been built at Rome in the year of the city 259, or 493 years before Christ,
                    under the consulate of Appius Claudius and Publius Servilius, was called <hi
                    rend="italic">Collegium</hi><hi rend="italic">Mercatorum,</hi> of which it is
                    pretended there are still some remains, called by the modern Romans <hi
                    rend="italic">Loggia</hi> or the Lodge, and now usually the place of St George.
                    This notion of a Roman exchange is supposed to be countenanced by the authority
                    of Livy.</p>
