                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">EUSTATHIUS</label>, archbishop of Thessalonica, and
                    commentator on Homer, flourished at Constantinople in the twelfth century.
                    Before his promotion to the see of Thessalonica, he was master of requests and
                    master of orators, two ecclesiastical offices, the latter of which (namely, that
                    of the orators or <hi rend="italic">rhetores)</hi> had for its object to expound
                    the sacred writings to the people. It was during this first part of his public
                    career that he wrote his commentaries on Homer and on Dionysius Periegetes. His
                    remarks on Dionysius have been frequently printed along with the text of that
                    author, and Politi has given a Latin translation of them, Geneva, 1741, in 8vo.
                    But these, however useful and deserving of commendation, are in no degree
                    comparable to the <hi rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> on the Iliad and Odyssey,
                    which embody an immense treasure of literary and grammatical erudition, chiefly
                    extracted and compiled from preceding scholiasts and commentators, as Apion,
                    Herodorns, Demosthenes of Thrace, Porphyry, and some others, the ad ditions made
                    to their observations by Eustathius himself being neither very considerable nor
                    very important. To these <hi rend="italic">Commentaries,</hi> as well as to his
                    <hi rend="italic">Annotations</hi> on Dionysius, the learned commentator has
                    given the modest title of <hi rend="italic">Parecbolae</hi> or Extracts;
                    desirous, no doubt, that those who might neglect to read his preface should
                    learn from the title alone the nature of his work, and thus be prevented from
                    attributing a disproportionate share of merit to the compiler. The commentaries
                    of Eustathius on the Iliad were printed for the first time at Rome, 1542-1560 in
                    four vols. folio, including the beautiful table of Devaris. But as this edition
                    is exceedingly scarce and high-priced, that of Bale, printed by Froben,
                    1559-1560, in three vols. folio, which is the next in point of authority, may be
                    advantageously consulted by scholars, in default of the former. It must not be
                    confounded, however, with an <hi rend="italic">Abridgment</hi> of Eustathius, of
                    which Hadrian de Jonghes was editor, and which appeared at Bale, from the press
                    of the same Froben, 1558, in one volume. Claude Capperonier, who had promised a
                    new Greek and Latin edition of the <hi rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> of
                    Eustathius, died without having published any part of it; but Politi, whom we
                    have already named, undertook this great work, of which he published at
                    Florence, 1730-1735, three vols. folio, containing the first five books of the
                    Iliad. It is to be regretted, however, that Politi took the trouble to translate
                    into Latin a work which is only suitable to those who are deeply versed in the
                    Greek language, and for whom the aid of a translation is superfluous; and it was
                    probably this useless addition which caused the interruption of the enterprize.
                    With reference to the extracts from the Commentaries of Eustathius which Müller
                    and Clarke have given in their respective editions of the Iliad, it is only
                    necessary to mention here, that these have, in each case, been made upon a
                    principle of selection adapted to the peculiar nature and object of the
                    undertaking. It is of more importance to observe, that at the period when
                    Eustathius lived original literature had almost disappeared, and that
                    consequently this vast and important compilation secured to him an immense
                    reputation. Intended at first for the bishopric of Myra in Lycia, he was soon
                    afterwards appointed archbishop of Thessalonica, and in the exercise of his high
                    functions displayed a dignified and respectable character. The year of his death
                    is unknown; but he was alive in 1194, and it may be conjectured that he died
                    after 1198, at a very advanced age. Eustathius appears, from his Notes on the
                    <hi rend="italic">Canons</hi> of Joannes Damascenus, to have composed several
                    works besides those which we have already mentioned; particularly a Commentary
                    on Pindar, which is almost entirely lost; Homilies, Discourses, Remarks on the
                    Canons of St John of Damascus, and Letters which are preserved in different
                    libraries. Manutius has also inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Gardens of
                    Adonis</hi> a little treatise of Eustathius on the dialects of Homer, but this
                    tract is merely an insignificant extract from the grammatical observations
                    contained in that Life of Homer which some attribute to Plutarch, and others to
                    Dionysius of Halicarnassus. *</p>
