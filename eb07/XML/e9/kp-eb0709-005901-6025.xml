                    science which treats of the history and habits of the insect tribes. Its
                    subjects are the most numerous and diversified of any of those topics which
                    engage the attention of the student of nature; and as they exemplify in a most
                    surprising and admirable manner, both by their structure and instincts, the
                    wisdom of the author and creator of all things, and form a highly interesting
                    department of human knowledge, we deem their elucidation deserving of a
                    lengthened dissertation.</p>
                <p>The English term insect is no doubt derived from the Latin word <hi rend="italic"
                    >insectum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">intersectum,</hi> signifying <hi
                    rend="italic">cut into</hi> or intersected, in allusion to the obvious divisions
                    of head, thorax, and abdomen, of which their general forms consist. The Greek
                    word bears the same signification.</p>

                    <p>DEFINITION OF INSECTS—THEIR ORDERS EXPLAINED—AND THEIR STUDY DEFENDED.</p>
                    <p>In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Animal Kingdom</hi> of this work (see
                        vol. iii. p. 179), we have given a view of the primary divisions of the
                        subjects of zoological science. The third primary division, that of the
                        articulated animals, consists of four great classes:—!. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Annelides,</hi> such as serpulae, nereids, leeches, earthworms, &amp;c.; 2.
                        <hi rend="italic">Crustacea,</hi> such as crabs, lobsters, and shrimps; 3.
                        <hi rend="italic">Arachnides,</hi> such as spiders, scorpions, and mites;
                        and 4. <hi rend="italic">Insecta,</hi> or true insects, such as beetles,
                        butterflies, and moths. The class Insecta of Linnaeus included not only
                        those last named, but also Crustacea and Arachnides, and was thus almost
                        co-extensive with what we now regard as a primary division under the term
                        <hi rend="italic">Articulata.</hi> We have, however, already discussed those
                        two branches as distinct classes, under their respective titles (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Arachnides</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Crustacea),</hi>
                        and we shall not repeat the important characters by which they are
                        distinguished from genuine insects.</p>
                    <p>The term insect was anciently applied to a much more extended series of
                        beings than are now included under that designation. It seems to have
                        comprised whatever was destitute of an internal skeleton, and exhibited a
                        body composed of articulated parts. In this sense it accords with its
                        application in the writings of Aristotle and Pliny, with certain
                        restrictions however, for these authors were in advance of their successors,
                        in as far as they distinguished the Crustacea from insects. Swammerdam and
                        Ray adopted the definition of the ancient authors, but erred in classing the
                        Vermes or worms with insects, a combination which does not appear for
                        certain to have entered into Aristotle’s views. Linnaeus wisely separated
                        these two classes, but at the same time injudiciously joined the Crustacea
                        with insects, placing them in his order <hi rend="italic">Aptera,</hi> along
                        with spiders and scolopendrae. Fabricius in that respect followed the same
                        general plan, and included all those living creatures in the same class,
                        notwithstanding the better example shown by Brisson, who had separated all
                        the species possessed of more than six feet, that is, the Crustacea and
                        Arachnides of Lamarck. Since the death of the great Swedish naturalist, our
                        improved knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the invertebrated
                        classes has thrown a clearer light upon the subject, and many modifications
                        have taken place in the arrangement of the insect tribes.</p>
                    <p>Insects, properly so called, may be defined as <hi rend="italic">animals
                        without vertebra:, six-footed, with a distinct head furnished with two
                        antenna and a pair of composite immoveable eyes, and breathing through
                        stigmatic openings which lead to interior tracheae.</hi><note

                        excludes those many-footed species called <hi rend="italic">Juli</hi> and

                        modern writers among insects, were established as a distinct class by Dr

                        referred to (art. <hi rend="smallcaps">Animal Kingdom),</hi> we think that
                        the removal of the two genera lust named from the Insecta is advisable, as
                        it leaves the latter in a state to be more clearly defined, as well as
                        actually-composed of more natural constituent parts or, as MM. Audouin and

                        the general reader, we deem it advisable, instead of taking his knowledge
                        for granted, to commence with a brief enumeration and explanation of the
                        various <hi rend="italic">orders</hi> in Entomology, so that their names,
                        when subsequently brought forward, may be associated with some definite
                        idea. We shall consider all insects as included under eleven different
                        orders, as follows.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Coleoptera</hi> (from Koafoj, <hi rend="italic">a
                        sheath,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">πτιaa, wings),</hi> including all those
                        kinds commonly called <hi rend="italic">beetles</hi> Their membranous wings,
                        which are the true organs of flight, are protected by a superior and
                        anterior pair of harder consistence, called elytra. They are all
                        masticators, and are provided with mandibles and maxillae. Plates
                        CCXXI-VII.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Orthoptera</hi> (from ogoof, <hi rend="italic"
                        >straight,</hi> and ¢rr¶a, <hi rend="italic">wings),</hi> including
                        crickets, grasshoppers, locusts, &amp;c. The upper wings are of the
                        consistence of parchment, reticulated, and more or less incumbent. The mouth
                        is provided with mandibles and maxillae. Plate CCXXVIII.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="smallcaps">Hemiptera</hi> (from r&gt;&lt;rυ, <hi rend="italic"

                        cimices or bugs, the water scorpions, cicadae or froghoppers, aphides,
                        &amp;c. A portion of their upper wings is frequently membranaceous, or of
                        the same consistence as the inferior pair. The mandibles and maxillae are
                        replaced by a sheath and sucker. Plate CCXXIX.</p>

                        reticulated, as in the preceding order. The mouth is furnished with
                        mandibles and maxillae, and the abdomen of the female is terminated either
                        by an ovipositor· or sting. Plates CCXXXI-H.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="smallcaps">Lepidoptera</hi> (from Xsw/ç, <hi rend="italic">a

                        containing all butterflies and moths, and generally characterized by the
                        farinaceous or sealyaspect of the organs of flight, and the tubular or
                        thread-like extension of the parts of the mouth. Plates CCXXXIII-VII.</p>
                    <p>7. <hi rend="smallcaps">Stkepsiptera</hi> (from <hi rend="italic"

                        species belonging to the genera stylops and xenos. This order corresponds to
                        the <hi rend="italic">Rldpiptera</hi> of Latreille, but we adopt Mr Kirby’s
                        denomination, as possessing a prior claim. Plate CCXXXI.</p>

                        including the house fly, and other two-winged kinds. The mouth is furnished
                        with a proboscis, and there are two organs called poisers or balancers <hi

                    <p>The study of the structure and habits of this numerous and diversified class
                        of beings has long been a favourite occupation with men of science in all
                        the continental countries of Europe, and has assumed of late years in the
                        southern parts of our own island a character of considerable and increasing
                        importance. Works have been recently published in this country which need
                        fear no comparison with the most finished examples of pictorial
                        representation; and when we consider how sparingly the subject of Entomology
                        has been hitherto patronized by the-public, we cannot sufficiently esteem
                        the exertions of those who have thus devoted their time and talents to a
                        pursuit which brings with it no other reward than the delight which every
                        instructed mind necessarily draws from the contemplation of a favourite
                        subject. Entomology, in truth, still stands in a difficult and somewhat
                        dubious position, and presents itself to many under a far less inviting
                        aspect than its beautiful sister-science of Botany. In connection with the
                        latter study, the very mass of mankind, even the <hi rend="italic">profanum
                        vulgus,</hi> however ignorant of the technical details, have many early
                        formed, and therefore pleasing associations. Every country-house has its
                        flower parterres, and numerous cottages their glowing borders,—botanic
                        gardens have been formed in the vicinity of most of the larger cities, while
                        nursery grounds are frequent in the neighbourhood even of provincial towns,
                        —to say nothing of the “flower enamelled meads” which each sparkling spring
                        and gorgeous summer calls into fleeting but constantly renewed existence. In
                        addition to the more attainable nature of this popular pursuit, some bota
                        nical knowledge is also regarded as a requisite branch of medical education;
                        and although a tin box and a microscope do not constitute a man of science,
                        still the subject derives advantage from that general though it may be
                        superficial culture. But in Entomology every thing exists in a different
                        order of relation. No “trivial fond regards” come in aid of the impaler of
                        insects; and even the creatures themselves are too often regarded with such
                        abhorrence, that one feels the more inclined to admire how those who
                        endeavour to hand them down to an ungrateful posterity, should themselves be
                        accused of cruelty.</p>
                    <p>The time however is surely gone by when an apologetical defence of the study
                        might be required, or in which the works of Omnipotence were regarded as
                        important in proportion either to their magnitude or immediate subservience
                        to the human race ;—and although we desire not to fall into an opposite
                        error by maintaining the greater beauty and excellence of the more minutely
                        elaborated designs of the Creator, we yet feel that they are fully more
                        calculated to awaken our wonder and admiration. It would be easy to say that
                        the richest and most elegant apparel which adorns the human race is the
                        product of a caterpillar; that the blistering medicines so essential to the
                        practice of the sanitory art are compounded from a beetle; that honey and
                        wax, so valuable as articles of domestic economy, are derived from the glad
                        labours of a hymenopterous fly; and that even that splendid and regal dye
                        the “Tyrian purple” of ancient days, supposed to have been obtained from the
                        <hi rend="italic">Purpura</hi><hi rend="italic">patula,</hi> a shell-fish of
                        the Mediterranean, is superseded by the tinctorial uses of the cochineal, a
                        small and obscure insect, which nevertheless the skill of the chemist has
                        rendered indispensable even to the garment of kings. But in truth far higher
                        and more delightful results ensue from these researches, than can ever be
                        named in the “cui bono” catalogue of a mere economist; for whatever tends to
                        elevate the mind of youth above the grosser pleasures of sense, or even
                        occasionally to disconnect our maturer years from the more turbulent
                        occupations and harassing cares which life is heir to, assuredly carries
                        along with it its own reward. We doubt not that a more sedulous and frequent
                        attention to natural history would in active minds pre-occupy the place
                        which is otherwise in after years too often devoted to more perilous
                        courses. Even the pursuits of literature are often vague and objectless, and
                        not unfrequently engender a sickly sentimentalism, or other morbid affection
                        in nowise akin to genius. But the objects which attract the attention of the
                        naturalist are not the melancholy creations of the human intellect, which
                        present so often but a lurid brightness, or a dim eclipse, in which noble
                        thoughts are obscured by the “darkening scales” of vice or folly. They are
                        the work of <hi rend="smallcaps">Him</hi> w ho cannot err, and who has
                        doubtless not only peopled the teeming earth and the translucent waters of
                        the “great deep” with all their innumerable and varied wonders, for a wise
                        and beneficent purpose, of which our instruction and amusement form at least
                        a portion, but has, by the implantation of that strong instinctive love of
                        nature which all ingenuous minds possess, demonstrated his desire that we
                        should ennoble our humanity by magnifying his manifold works, the “wondrous
                        works of him that is perfect in knowledge.”</p>
                    <p>While the beautiful simplicity and regular order observable in those
                        phenomena which proceed under the superintendence of omnipotence, commonly
                        called the operations <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746051"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0709-6051-0061"/> of nature, are well adapted to the
                        comprehension of understandings laying no claim to the highest order, the
                        more complex relations of the subject present a vast field for speculative
                        or theoretical exercise,· sufficient to occupy the faculties of the most
                        powerful minds. It is thus that, in its totality, the subject of natural
                        history holds out to each capacity the allurement of an occupation suited to
                        every gradation of intellectual power; for while in its mysterious
                        interconnection with other branches of natural science, as well as in its
                        own peculiar complexities, it cannot be effectively grasped by mere human
                        understanding, its manifold minor features may be scanned with intelligence
                        by whoever desires so to do.</p>
                    <p>If indeed the value of a pursuit is to be estimated by the comparative ease
                        with which it may be followed by persons of the most moderate fortunes, few
                        can rank higher than Entomology. While the specimens sought for by the
                        mineralogist and student of geology are frequently heavy and cumbrous, and
                        not seldom extremely expensive, and while that sad representative of the
                        beauties of the living Flora, called a <hi rend="italic">Hortus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Siccus,</hi> is but a frail and fleeting memorial of the “days
                        of other years,” presenting, even after a tedious and troublesome process of
                        preservation (by courtesy so called), no trace of their original brightness,
                        the most exquisite examples of entomological beauty, if not too roughly
                        handled at the period of their capture, remain, with the most ordinary
                        attention, for a lifetime in their pristine state,—and what that state
                        actually is, all may satisfy themselves in the course even of the most
                        superficial examination,—</p>

                    <p>Exceeding in amount of species all the other subjects of zoology,—unrivalled
                        in the dazzling brilliancy of their colours, which combine the clearness and
                        decision of tint possessed by flowers, with the exquisitely varied markings
                        of the feathered race, and the metallic splendour of the mineral
                        kingdom,—surpassed by no other work of creation in the wonderful structure
                        of their parts, and certainly surpassing all in the adaptation of that
                        structure to the perfect fulfilment of those natural though to us still
                        mysterious instincts, which in every age have excited the admiration of
                        mankind,—is it to be wondered at that the study of insects should occupy a
                        prominent place in our pursuit of knowledge ? Much more do we wonder that
                        thousands of the best educated, and in other respects most enlightened
                        minds, should still feel averse to a study which unfolds such a world of
                        unseen wonders.</p>
                    <p>The subject, too, is literally inexhaustible; and while some who love to
                        methodize, and thereby to circumscribe, the subjects of human knowledge, or
                        who err in their estimate of the perceptive powers of the human mind as
                        applied to other matters of enquiry, may be deterred by the vague boundaries
                        of such a field, a greater number, and with more propriety it is hoped, may
                        be induced to enter it, from the very consideration of such a rich and
                        unreaped harvest. While a fragment of inert matter, which chemical analysis
                        determines to differ in its constituent proportions from other fragments
                        previously examined, is once in a lustre dignified by the name of a new <hi
                        rend="italic">species,</hi> and the name of a Haiiy or a Dolomieu is
                        bestowed on the unconscious mass,—and while, even in the richer domain of
                        British botany, the student of that science, however much he may extend our
                        knowledge of the localities of plants, labours with but a feeble chance of
                        adding to the actual list even of indigenous species, and ha⅜ probably no
                        chance at all of ever refreshing his eyes with the sight of a plant which
                        nobody ever saw before,—it is far otherwise with the innumerable tribes of
                        insect life. The “gilded summer flies” are numerous as leaves in
                        Vallumbrosa. No recess of the forest so obscure but there the “winged
                        messengers” are seen to sport and play; and each summer sunbeam falls not
                        alone on the dewy herbage of the open glades, but lights up the gorgeous
                        hues of those bright creatures which a mystical philosophy has ennobled as
                        the types of the disencumbered human soul, and which even the sombre Dante
                        has named <hi rend="italic">angelical.</hi></p>

                        chosen abode of thousands of living creatures, of small dimensions it is
                        true, but of singular beauty both of form and structure, and often adorned
                        with hues,</p>

                    <p>Even the pastoral melancholy of the green mountains is enlivened by the
                        occurrence of many interesting species. One of the most beautiful of
                        European coleopterous insects <hi rend="italic">{Carabus nitens)</hi> occurs
                        among the peat <hi rend="italic">hags,</hi> and other places where heath and
                        turf abound, and where its sparkling coat of gold and green, tinged with a
                        brighter lustre than that of rubies, is singularly contrasted with the
                        blackness of the soil in which it seems imbedded. The desolate and
                        cloud-piercing summits of the highest hills produce several species, which
                        are the more highly prized from their scarcity, and the difficulties with

                        confined to the species of a district. Of course the collector of foreign
                        insects labours under some disadvantage, from the more multifarious nature
                        of his subjects, their larger size, higher price, and more scattered
                        localities. But the home collector, especially of the Coleoptera, is more
                        favourably situated.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                        Entomology of most districts may be amply illustrated within the bounds of a
                        cabinet of a few feet square, and the most ordinary attention and regularity
                        suffice for its preservation. Most districts produce species which are
                        comparatively rare in other quarters, and thus by means of interchanges
                        nume-. rous additions may be made from time to time: so that with a moderate
                        share of assiduity and perseverance, a large collection may be amassed with
                        little or no pecuniary outlay. In these and many other pleasant particulars,
                        on which we need not here dilate, Entomology possesses advantages over all
                        the kindred branches of natural history. We shall now pass to a short
                        exposition of some of the more characteristic features in the structure and
                        functions of insects.</p>

                        when we consider with how small a number we have any accurate acquaintance.
                        It may even be doubted whether we are completely informed of the history of
                        any one species within the entire range of Entomology. Of some we know the
                        perfect state, but have never seen the larva; of others the larvae are well
                        known, but the perfect insect remains in obscurity, so that when we consider
                        the numerous changes which these creatures undergo, from their first
                        hatching to their final metamorphosis, we need scarcely wonder that even the
                        most familiar species present points in their history, which it is by no
                        means easy to unravel.</p>
                    <p>It is otherwise however with the classification of insects, which, depending
                        mainly on an attentive examination of external characters, is so far
                        independent alike of anatomical investigation and the study of manners,
                        although these, when ascertained, form of course the truest test by which to
                        appreciate the difference between a natural and an artificial system.</p>
                    <p>The period is comparatively recent during which the internal structure of
                        insects began to be regarded as a subject of interest. Their external
                        characters were the first to attract attention; and as a communicable
                        knowledge of these was necessary for all the practical purposes of
                        classification, as well as to establish the means of mutual understanding
                        among naturalists, it is well that that branch has been rendered so complete
                        and satisfactory. In former times, whatever facts of interest might have
                        been ascertained, were too often but of slight avail, in consequence of our
                        vague knowledge of the species to which they applied. But the most ordinary
                        attention on the part of the anatomist, to the systematic works of modern
                        times, will now suffice to inform him of the place which his subject
                        occupies in the scale of nature; and hence the importance, not seldom
                        overlooked by the physiologist, of even the minutest external characters,
                        when accurately ascertained and clearly described. It has indeed been stated
                        as a truism, that whoever attempts to deduce the real affinities of the
                        animal kingdom from a consideration of the external characters alone, will
                        in most cases mislead both himself and others.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Wilson’s <hi rend="italic">Illustrations

                        admitted, that comparative anatomists have too frequently an idea that
                        nothing is or can be of importance which extends beyond the sphere of their
                        own exertions. They forget that the general form and covering, and, in
                        short, the whole of the external characters, however they may labour under
                        the misfortune of being obvious to a common observer, are just as much a
                        part of an animal’s organic constitution, as the nerves, viscera, muscles,
                        blood-vessels, and bones, or whatever else is most mysterious and recondite;
                        and that, in fact, without a precise knowledge of the former, the
                        information conveyed by the latter would be uncertain, or of no avail. The
                        chief advantage of the internal structure is, that it is less liable to
                        variation from the influence of local or accidental circumstances: its chief
                        disadvantage results from the difficulty of its ascertainment, and the
                        contrariety of opinion which exists among physiologists regarding the uses
                        of the organs, even after their conformation has been ascertained. A mere
                        knowledge of external character is perhaps nearly as useful as an
                        acquaintance, however intimate, with anatomical structure, when nothing is
                        either known or sought for respecting the external appearance, as a
                        necessary guide to the higher knowledge of animal instincts and modes of
                        life, the uses of living creatures in the general economy of nature, their
                        exquisite adaptation to the circumstances under which they are placed, their
                        distribution over the earth’s surface, and other points of philosophical
                        investigation. The mere anatomist may smile at the mere collector of shells
                        and butterflies; and with just as much propriety may the mere naturalist or
                        virtuoso smile in return at him who, knowing, or supposing that he knows,
                        every convolution of a viscus, or ramification of an artery, is yet unable
                        to recognise, amid the perplexingly multiplied varieties which may be
                        presented to him, the precise animal which has been the subject of so much
                        anxious and careful investigation. But when anatomy and natural history go
                        hand in hand, the obscure labyrinth of nature, so far as human capacity can
                        penetrate, receives its noblest illumination.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding the meritorious labours of Swammerdam, Malpighi, Reaumur, and
                        Lyonnet, who were the first greatly to signalise themselves in the difficult
                        field of insect anatomy; in spite of the more recent and scarcely less
                        successfill exertions of Cuvier, Comparettι, Ramdohr, Treviranus, Gaede,
                        Sprengel, Savigny, Marcel de Serres, Geoffroy St Hilaire, Carus, Meckel,
                        Audouin, and Dufour (to make no mention of many others who yet deserve to be
                        held in remembrance),—such is the immense extent and variety of this
                        wonderful class of beings, that we fall infinitely short of possessing any
                        thing like a general or completed knowledge of their structure. In this
                        paucity of well-established facts under which we labour, it would indeed be
                        unphilosophical to attempt the induction of general rules; and all that we
                        shall here attempt shall be to record such observations as seem likely to
                        bear substantially upon the subject, and to have formed an actual advance in
                        our knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of insects.</p>
                    <p>The study of the interior structure of these creatures does not at first
                        sight hold out the promise of much that is either interesting or useful. The
                        enormous distance which seems to separate all ιnvertebrated animals from
                        man, and even from the lower mammiferous and other vertebrated tribes, has
                        induced the belief that no practical results can ever spring from such a
                        source. But the philosophical observer, who knows how important is
                        frequently the connection between the greatest and the least of things, and
                        how, like the thread of Ariadne, the tracing of a slender chain may lead to
                        unforeseen conclusions of the highest value, will not despise the lights
                        which a better knowledge even of insect anatomy may be one day destined to
                        throw upon some of the many still obscure points in the physiology of man.
                        The observations of Μ. Dufour and others have already shown us what an
                        admirable simplicity presides in these despised tribes over the exercise of
                        those most important functions, which in red-blooded animals require such a
                        complicated organic structure as to be almost incomprehensible. But as we
                        descend in the scale of nature, we see more clearly the distinction between
                        what is necessary, or merely accessory or superfluous, and thus by degrees
                        we may attain to a knowledge of the essential characters of things.</p>
                    <p>Even in its more superficial bearings on natural history, the dissection of
                        insects is necessary to ascertain several disputed points regarding the
                        sexual distinctions of species, and to verify our views of the structure of
                        the organs of the mouth, the antennae, tarsi, and other external parts, on
                        which our establishment of tribes and genera mainly depends. When it is
                        desired to dissect an insect, it ought to be placed on a piece of cork,
                        immersed in pure water; and the various parts, as they float in the liquid,
                        may be fixed in their most appropriate position by means of needles. With a
                        view to prevent deception from any alteration in the relative position of
                        the internal organs, it is desirable <pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:wu.89119129559&amp;seq=73" xml:id="kp-eb0709-9559-0063"/> to fix
                        the insect in its natural horizontal posture, and to commence the dissection
                        from the dorsal region downwards.</p>
                    <p>The following observations on the dissection of the minuter animals may be of
                        service to the student. “The first thing that I have to observe is, that all
                        dissections of small and soft objecte, <hi rend="italic">e.</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">g.</hi> worms, zoophytes, insecte, mollusea, &amp;c. where it
                        is desirable to obtain even tolerably accurate results, should be performed
                        <hi rend="italic">under water,</hi> by which the parte are kept floating and
                        separated from each other, and consequently present themselves more
                        distinctly. A very simple contrivance for investigations of this kind may be
                        prepared in the following manner: A mass of tough wax (not too soft) is to
                        be laid upon one or more porcelain saucers or capsules of different sizes,
                        which are then to be put in a warm place until the wax melts so as to cover
                        the surface evenly to the depth of a half or a third of an inch. If the
                        object to be examined be laid upon this surface, it may be fixed by needles
                        in any position that is wished; and, when covered with clear water,
                        developed and dissected by means of suitable instruments. Of these, the best
                        are very delicate forceps; pointed, well made, sharpcutting scissars; and
                        small knives like cataract needles, some round, others with cutting edges,
                        and fixed in slender wooden handles. For separating parte I have also
                        employed small horn probes and fine brushes; whilst for examining them a
                        good magnifying glass is frequently indispensable. If it is wished to
                        preserve a preparation thus made, wax coloured at pleasure, as for the
                        purpose of injections, is to be formed into little tablets about a quarter
                        of an inch thick; one of them is then to be placed upon the saucer or
                        capsule containing the preparation; the latter may then be transferred to
                        it, arranged suitably upon it, fixed there by means of short needles, and
                        both together placed in alcohol. Nor must I forget to mention, that the
                        examination of very delicate organizations may frequently be conducted with
                        greater facility and accuracy, if the object be previously allowed to remain
                        some time in spirit, and thereby to become harder and contracted. This
                        applies particularly to the dissection of nervous organs, and to the
                        examination of very small embryos, of mollusea, and worms. There are various
                        ways of destroying worms, insects, &amp;c. for the purpose of dissecting,
                        without injuring their organization. Mollusea, snails for example, as
                        Swammerdam has remarked, are to be allowed to die in water, because by that
                        means their body swells, and all the parts become more distinctly visible;
                        they may afterwards be kept in spirit (though not too long) for dissection.
                        Worms, the larger zoophytes (for the smaller must be examined whilst alive),
                        caterpillars, &amp;c. are best destroyed by means of spirit; insects, on the
                        contrary, by being dipped rapidly in boiling water, or in oil of
                        turpentine.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Carus’s

                        <p>SECT. I. THE EXTERNAL COVERING OF INSECTS.</p>
                        <p>Our knowledge of die structure and anatomy of this class may be said to
                            be still in its infancy; for although many important facts have been
                            legitimately generalized, we are still in ignorance of the formation of
                            a thousand species for every one which has been examined. As the harder
                            parts of insects, to which the muscles are attached, are superficial,
                            the class has been described as bearing their skeletons externally; and
                            a transcendental anatomy has not scrupled to determine the exact analogy
                            which each portion of their covering bears to the bony frame-work of the
                            vertebrated tribes. This comparison has been instituted by Μ. Geoffroy
                            St Hilaire, an eminent physiological naturalist of France, who
                            maintains, with many of his countrymen, that all animals are
                            vertebrated. The doctrine, whatever may be its other merits, is not
                            entitled to the credit of novelty, as an English writer of the name of
                            Willis had, so far back as the year 1692, published his opinion that the
                            external envelope of the body of insects represented the internal
                            articulated column of the vertebrated tribes. Μ. de Blainville, on the
                            other hand, regards the corneous covering of insects rather as analogous
                            to the skin or cutaneous system of the higher classes.</p>
                        <p>The hardness of the calcareous or homy envelope of the greater number of
                            insects is owing, in Latreille’s opinion, to the consistence of the
                            excretion interposed between the dermis and the epidermis, or what is
                            termed in man the <hi rend="italic">mucous tissue.</hi> This excretion
                            also contains the brilliant and varied colours which add so greatly to
                            the beauty of the class.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            composition of the harder parts of insects, the substance of this
                            envelope is of a peculiar nature. He has named it <hi rend="italic"
                            >chitine.</hi> He observes that the phosphate of hme forms the great
                            proportion of all the salts contained in the teguments of insects, while
                            that ingredient is but trifling in the covering of the Crustacea,
                            although the latter abounds in the carbonate, which is not found in the
                            other class.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                            rend="italic">Mem. de la Soc. d’Hist. Nat.</hi> t. 1. p. 29.</p></note>
                            The facte stated by him militate against the analogies attempted to be
                            established on the subject; and the observations of Μ. Straus go far to
                            demonstrate that those teguments do not form a true skeleton, but really
                            represent the skin of the vertebrated classes. When we use the word
                            skeleton, then, in relation to insects, the reader will understand its
                            application merely to the external covering.</p>
                        <p>On analysing the elytra of the cockchafer, Μ. Odier ascertained the
                            existence, l <hi rend="italic">st</hi>, of albumen; 2<hi rend="italic"
                            >d</hi>, of an extractive matter, soluble in water; 3<hi rend="italic"
                            >d</hi>, of a brown-coloured animal substance, soluble in potass and
                            insoluble in alcohol; 4 <hi rend="italic">th,</hi> of a coloured oil,
                            soluble in alcohol; 5 <hi rend="italic">th,</hi> of three salts, viz.
                            subcarbonate of potass, phosphate of lime, and phosphate of iron; 6 <hi
                            rend="italic">th,</hi> of a peculiar substance which constitutes a
                            fourth part in weight of the elytron. Albumen is so generally
                            distributed among the animal organs that its presence was to be
                            expected. But the oil is deserving of further experimental observation.
                            Robiquet found it of a green colour in cantharides; while, according to
                            Odier, it is brown in the cockchafer, and red in a species of crioceris.
                            Now as each of these insects is itself of a corresponding hue, it is
                            natural to suppose that the oil is the colouring matter. The peculiar
                            substance which forms so large a proportion of the elytra is named <hi
                            rend="italic">chitine</hi> by Μ. Odier. If we plunge a coleopterous
                            insect into a solution of potassium, and keep up a pretty high
                            temperature, we shall observe that the so-called skeleton neither
                            dissolves nor changes its form; it merely becomes discoloured during the
                            operation, while all the viscera and interior muscles disappear; and
                            whatever remains of the insect is <hi rend="italic">chitine.</hi> This
                            substance exists in the whole of the envelope, and is also found to
                            occur in the more solid covering of the Crustacea.</p>
                        <p>If however we compare the preceding results with those obtained by Μ.
                            Chevreul in the course of his experiments on crustaceous animals, we
                            shall perceive some remarkable distinctions in the constitution of their
                            harder parts. The presence of subcarbonate of potass is a sinking
                            character among insects. It does not occur in the class Crustacea. The
                            phosphate of lime, a sparing ingredient among the latter, <pb break="no"
                            facs="nls:193746090" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6090-0064"/> forms a
                            preponderating part of the salts in the envelope of insects, while the
                            carbonate of lime is absent, although it forms the base of the carapace
                            or covering of crabs and lobsters. It has been stated as a regulating
                            law in animal chemistry, that the bones of the higher orders have more
                            of the phosphate and less of the carbonate of lime in their composition,
                            while the proportions were reversed among the inferior tribes. But the
                            observations of Μ. Odier show the inadequacy of chemical character to
                            serve as a basis on which to found our analogies of organization; for if
                            strictly applied to insects, that class must be removed from the place
                            which they now occupy in our system, and be combined with others of a
                            higher nature, with which in truth they have no connection.</p>
                        <p>The harder and more solid parts of insects are certainly to thém what the
                            internal skeleton is to the vertebrated tribes. They form the support
                            and frame-work of the body. It is on this account that the <hi
                            rend="italic">term skeleton,</hi> though not Strictly applicable, has
                            been used, both in ancient and modern times, to designate the <hi
                            rend="italic">corneous external system</hi> of these creatures. This
                            comparatively solid system is itself formed by the union of many parts,
                            which however have received no general name; so that, while in
                            discussing the vertebrated tribes we merely say that their skeleton is
                            formed of bone, all that we advance in regard to insects is, that it is
                            composed of pieces. In the higher tribes each individual bone is well
                            known by its own distinctive name; but the insect tribes in that respect
                            have been but obscurely defined. Guided by the light of human anatomy,
                            observers have sought to discover in insects all those parts to which
                            they could apply previously established names; but analogies based upon
                            mere appearance are incapable of great or useful extension; and insects
                            would certainly have been better known had they been studied in the
                            first place individually, and no farfetched comparisons instituted till
                            after a more ample knowledge of actual organization. But instead of
                            this, the best determined functions of the superior animals have been
                            assumed as points of departure, and all the parts of insects which <hi
                            rend="italic">seemed</hi> to fulfil the same purposes have been
                            deter-τninately regarded as analogous. Now it is quite admissible to
                            say, that in insects, as among the vertebrated tribes, there is
                            progression, vision, manducation, &amp;c. because these are the
                            attributes, more or less general, of all living beings; but it has not
                            always been demonstrated that particular and more special functions are
                            always performed by the same or apparently corresponding parts. Μ.
                            Dufour, how- ’ ever, has announced the following results in relation to
                            the ^articulated animals themselves: Isí, that the skeleton of the
                            Crustacea and Arachnides (two important classes already described in
                            this work) does not differ from that of insects except by the mode of
                            growth of the rings of which it is composed; 2&lt;7, that those two
                            classes of animals ∙ and insects themselves do not differ among each
                            other, but by the greater or less extent in the development of the parts
                            of which they are composed. , ∙.∙ «</p>
                        <p>The same may be asserted in regard to the disparities observable between
                            the different conditions of insects in the larva,- the chrysalis, and
                            the perfect state. The various forms under which the same species is
                            exhibited, and the singular and sometimes sudden transformations to
                            which at is subjected, are found to result, when analysed, from the
                            growth of parts. This has been demonstrated by the writings of
                            Swammerdam and other modern writers on the anatomy of caterpillars, as
                            well as by the beautiful and more recent observations of Savigny on the
                            mouths of Lepidoptera in the perfect state, compared with the same parts
                            in their earliest condition.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                            type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Mémoires sur les Animaux sans
                            Vertèbres.</hi></p></note> The observation is particularly applicable to
                            the solid parts of insects. In the larva each segment exists under a
                            nearly uniform development, while in the perfect state several of these
                            segments have acquired a prodigious increase. This is the cause of the
                            vast difference in their exterior envelope at different periods of their
                            existence. The nymph or chrysalis is in the intermediate condition, and
                            is formed, like the larva, of simple rings, which, however, no longer
                            exhibit an equal degree of uniformity. But the perfect insect is the
                            final term of transformation. Considered in a general way, its covering
                            does not essentially differ from that of the larva; but the three
                            segments next the head have acquired a great increase of bulk, to enable
                            them to support the appendages of legs and wings, which were merely
                            rudimentary, or scarcely existent, in its first condition; and the
                            distinction of head, thorax, and abdomen becoming strongly visible, the
                            entire aspect of the insect has undergone a change.</p>
                        <p>It is highly interesting to observe the influence which the decrease or
                            development of one portion of structure exercises upon another; in other
                            words, the constant and intimate relation of the proportion of parts.
                            The maximum of increase in the metathorax is always in relation to the
                            rudimentary state of the mesothorax, while, on the contrary, the
                            development of the latter produces or accompanies the decrease of the
                            former. Thus also the parts of the mouth, as demonstrated by Μ. Savigny,
                            are sometimes free, and capable of varied movement, for the purposes of
                            mastication; while in several tribes they are brought close together,
                            lengthened, and as it were amalgamated in the form of trunk or sucker;
                            and so the segments of the thorax, in the different orders, more or less
                            disunited among themselves, support the wings, the balancers, the
                            elytra, according to the various kinds. From these and similar
                            considerations have been deduced the conclusion that the increase of one
                            portion exercises over the neighbouring portions a peculiar influence,
                            which explains whatever differences may be remarked in the individuals
                            of each order, family, and genus. And this general consequence, which
                            results from numerous observations, necessarily includes and accounts
                            for that incoherent series of anomalies so puzzling to the superficial
                            inquirer, but which are only regarded as such, because the labourers in
                            the field of anatomy have but seldom taken into their consideration the
                            totality of the articulated animals, and have more seldom still thought
                            fit to occupy themselves in a careful comparative analysis of the parts
                            which enter into the composition of the external skeleton of these
                            despised tribes.</p>
                        <p>We shall here briefly consider the essential characters of the so-called
                            skeleton among the articulated tribes. It is composed of segments, which
                            are themselves formed by a determinate number of pieces; but their most
                            obvious character is, that they are provided with a pair of feet, and
                            with two openings to the respiratory organs. But along with such
                            segments as present these parts, we may usually observe many others
                            which are not so provided, or at least in which the feet are wanting;
                            and they may either differ in their size and proportions, or closely
                            resemble each other in those respects. In the latter case, the most
                            simple form is exhibited; and if we ascertain the Composition of a
                            single segment, and their amount, we have a knowledge of the entire
                            animal. This simplicity of form, however, is not often observable; for
                            it more frequently happens that the same individual presents great
                            disparity in the size and composition of its segments, and in the
                            appendages with Which they are furnished.</p>
                        <p>The Scolopendrae (belonging to the class <hi rend="smallcaps"
                            >Myriapoda)</hi> ex<pb break="no" facs="nls:193746103"
                            xml:id="kp-eb0709-6103-0065"/>hibit, according to Μ. Dufour, one of the
                            most simple forms of the articulated classes, in as far as they present
                            the greatest uniformity of character in the parts of which they are
                            composed. Even in them, however, we may observe, at the anterior
                            portion, some pairs of feet, which are rudimentary, and crowded together
                            towards the head; so that it would be possible to figure an animal still
                            more uniformly composed, by supposing that the feet thus thrown together
                            had been developed uniformly with the appendages of the ensuing
                            segments. We should then have had to recognise merely a head, and a
                            certain number of rings, all of a like nature. But it might be possible
                            still further to reduce and simplify the proposition, by regarding the
                            head itself as an assemblage or union of segments, bearing appendages
                            merely analogous to the feet. Thus, to realize the supposition of a
                            skeleton uniformly constructed throughout all its parts, nothing more
                            would be necessary than to give to the segments of the head a
                            development equal to that of the others, and to restore to its
                            appendages (the feet) their essential usage, that of locomotion, instead
                            of the secondary usage to which they had been subjected. This view has
                            been presented in order to exhibit what has been regarded as the
                            fundamental plan of insect formation; for it is in truth the
                            corresponding or unequal increase of the segments, the union or division
                            of the pieces of which they are composed, the maximum of development in
                            some, the rudimentary condition of others, that form the agreements or
                            differences of character in the entire series of articulated
                            animals.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                            the development is uniform, or nearly so, in each segment, we have the

                        <p>The importance of studying the skeleton of insects is greater than even
                            among the higher classes, because, being essential, it forms a genuine
                            basis, and being at the same time external, it offers to the eye of the
                            zoologist a ready mode of determination.</p>
                        <p>While engaged in the consideration of the various organs of insects, a
                            numerous list of disparities in structure might no doubt be collected,
                            and the term <hi rend="italic">anomaly,</hi> according to its frequent
                            but by no means philosophical application, brought into constant use.
                            That fatal word, however, has been too often substituted in place of an
                            explicit interpretation of phenomena not in any way difficult of
                            solution, certain general principles being kept in view. Of these, one
                            of the most importance is, that all the differences exhibited by
                            insects, and all the so-called anomalous organs which they present, are
                            the result of a greater or less development of certain parts existing
                            generally throughout the entire class.<note anchored="true"

                            partly from a discordance in the use of terms, and partly from the
                            organs themselves not being submitted to a careful analytical
                            investigation. It is thus, for example, that the names of <hi
                            rend="italic">sternum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">scutellum,</hi> in
                            place of being bestowed on portions of which the contours have been
                            precisely determined, have only been applied when these portions
                            happened to exhibit certain accidental and conventional characters. By
                            this means we read in almost every page of classification, that one
                            insect possesses a scutellum and that another does not; or that a
                            particular genus is characterized by its existence, and another by its
                            absence; while the fact is, that these parts exist in all insects,
                            although the names in their usual application have been bestowed only
                            upon peculiar and not very important variations in the <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>SECT. II. THE EXTERNAL CHARACTERS OF THE PRINCIPAL</p>
                        <p>SEGMENTS OF AN INSECT’S BODY, VIZ. THE HEAD, THORAX, AND ABDOMEN.</p>
                        <p>The form of the external covering of insects, even of the same species,
                            differs greatly according to the existing condition of the individual.
                            The segments of which the bodies of larvae are composed are generally of
                            a uniform size when compared with each other, and the singular phenomena
                            presented by metamorphosis consist chiefly in the greater development
                            assumed by certain segments than by others. The nymph (called chrysalis
                            among the Lepidoptera) exhibits the intermediate or transitionary state.
                            Its segments are unequally developed, and this inequality is greatly
                            increased on the assumption of the final state, in which certain
                            segments are prodigiously enlarged, while others suffer a corresponding
                            diminution. In the imago, or complete condition, the three segments next
                            the head undergo the most notable alteration ; for, besides their
                            increase of bulk, they become furnished with wings and articulated legs,
                            which had previously existed in a very rudimentary condition. In that
                            state also the relative proportions of the segments are so changed that
                            the identity of several becomes difficult to recognise, and the most
                            obvious divisions henceforth consist of <hi rend="italic">head,
                            thorax,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">abdomen.</hi> These parts are
                            severally characterized by peculiar attributes, the nature of which we
                            shall now endeavour to explain.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">head</hi> is by far the most complicated portion,
                            and it is necessary that its structure should be well understood, as it
                            furnishes the most important characters on which modern genera are
                            founded or made known. The parts most deserving of attention are the <hi
                            rend="italic">mouth, antennoe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">eyes.</hi></p>
                        <p>The organs of the mouth present in their different combinations a great
                            variety of form among the articulated classes. In relation to all such
                            animals as are provided with a head, more particularly the vertebrated
                            tribes, the term mouth is never of ambiguous application, but refers to
                            those parts which are placed exteriorly at the entrance of the
                            intestinal canal, and effect the process of mastication ; but in regard
                            to the acephalous or nearly headless tribes, such as annelides, worms,
                            and the radiated animals, its application is less definite and precise.
                            Among the great series of living beings included by Linnaeus in the
                            class of insects, all of which are furnished with a head, the parts of
                            the mouth are no longer doubtful. It has been remarked, however, that
                            the sucker of the larvae. in the last family of the dipterous order
                            being entirely interior when not in use <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>
                            presents a singular approximation in that particular to the intestinal
                            worms.</p>
                        <p>It will be readily conceived that the mouth of insects must be adapted to
                            the particular manners of life peculiar to each natural group, and must
                            therefore vary in accordance with their instinctive habits. It was thus
                            that even the earliest naturalists perceived and expressed the
                            distinction between insects provided with teeth or cutting jaws, and
                            those furnished with trunks or suckers. The use of the microscope in
                            modern times, and the deep desire which prevailed towards the conclusion
                            of the seventeenth and commencement of the eighteenth centuries, to
                            illustrate the mysteries of animal organization, produced much more
                            detailed and exact accounts of the parts of the mouth in insects than
                            were previously possessed. The works of Lecuwenhoeck<pb
                            facs="nls:193746116" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6116-0066"/>, Swammerdam, and
                            Réaumur are mines of information ; while Scopoh and Degeer still further
                            generalized the observations of these illustrious naturalists. Scopoli,
                            we believe, was the first to apply the knowledge of these parts in
                            characterizing the genera of the hymenopterous and dipterous orders ;
                            but it is to a celebrated disciple of Linnaeus, John Christian Fabncius,
                            that we owe the first general theory of the parts of manducation, and
                            its application to entomology in general.</p>
                        <p>The alimentary substances sought for by insects are either comparatively
                            hard and solid, or of a more soft and fluid nature. Thence we find upon
                            examination numerous tribes of insects provided with a mouth so
                            constructed as to tear and masticate the substances on which it is
                            designed to act ; while many others are characterized by a tube-hke
                            mouth, or one resembling a delicate tongue extended when m action, and
                            spirally rolled upon itself when in repose. Hence the great primary
                            distinctions among the orders of insects, and their recognised division
                            into masticators <hi rend="italic">(mandibulata)</hi> and suckers (<hi
                            rend="italic">haustellata),</hi> the former living on solid substances,
                            the latter on such as are fluid. Whatever may be the structure of the
                            mouth in insects, it is to one or other of those types of form that each
                            must be referred. We are indebted to the beautiful researches of Savigny
                            (1814) for the first accurate analysis and elucidation of these parts,
                            and of their relationship throughout the articulated tribes. Latreille,
                            however, had previously instituted a slighter comparison between the
                            mouths of the suctorial and mandibulated tribes, as Lamarck has admitted
                            in his report on Savigny’s work.</p>
                        <p>Savigny divides insects formerly so named into two groups, the <hi
                            rend="italic">hexapodes,</hi> or such as have six feet, and the <hi
                            rend="italic">apiropodes,</hi> or such as possess a greater number. The
                            mouth of the latter forms two proper types distinct from those of the
                            former ; but it is with the polymorphous hexapodes, or such as undergo
                            transformations, that is, insects properly so called, that we are now
                            concerned. We shall first consider the parts of the mouth in the
                            masticating tribes. They are essentially as follows : The <hi
                            rend="italic">labrum,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">mandibles,</hi> the <hi
                            rend="italic">maxilla·,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">palpi,</hi> the <hi
                            rend="italic">labium,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">mentum,</hi> the
                            two latter, according to the views of different observers, sometimes
                            passing under one and the same name. The reader may here consult Plate
                            CCXX. fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">a, b, c, d.</hi><note anchored="true"

                            and capable of moving upwards and downwards, or vertically. It is
                            variable in form, but is usually somewhat square, often wider than long,
                            and frequently notched or biful. It is of a horny consistence, sometimes
                            coriaceous, or even approaching to what may be named membranous in
                            certain tribes, and is attached to the anterior portion of the head by a
                            very short articulation.</p>
                        <p>The mandibles or upper jaws <hi rend="italic">(mandibula,</hi> fig. 1,
                            <hi rend="italic">bb)</hi> are two strong horny pieces, generally of a
                            triangular form, more or less curved, convex externally, concave on
                            their inner surfaces, and frequently toothed or serrated on their
                            interior edge. They are placed on each side of the mouth by insertion on
                            the sides of the head, immediately beneath the labrum or upper lip,
                            which usually covers their base. They are each composed of a single
                            piece of a hard consistence, and may be said to correspond to the jaws
                            of the vertebrated tribes, the process of mastication being principally
                            performed by them. They differ, however, m this respect, that their
                            motion, instead of being vertical, is horizontal, or from within
                            outwards, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> They vary greatly both
                            in their actual size and relative dimensions, being small and slender in
                            the glow-worm <hi rend="italic">(Lampyris),</hi> and very large,
                            projecting, and antler-like in the stag beetle <hi rend="italic"
                            >{Lucanus cervus),</hi> the specieswhich we have selected for our
                            engraved illustration. These internal surfaces are frequently parallel,
                            but their dentations are not always the same in each, the projections of
                            the one being however frequently so arranged as to enter the concavities
                            of the other in order to admit of their closer union. But this is not
                            seldom prevented by the curvature of the tips ; and in several
                            instances, where the mouth is wide, and the mandibles rather remote from
                            each other at the base, the blades cross each other a little beyond the
                            centre. The dentations of the mandibles, though sometimes called teeth,
                            are merely projecting parts, although in the orthopterous tribes a
                            coriaceous lamina seems in some respect to distinguish them from the
                            body of the mandible to which they are attached, thus exhibiting an
                            approach to that mode of fixture called <hi rend="italic"
                            >gomphosis,</hi> in which one bone is fixed within another, as in the
                            teeth of the higher tribes. The mandibles are more variable in their
                            forms than the maxillae, and may occasionally be observed to differ (as
                            in the genus <hi rend="italic">Lucanus)</hi> even in the sexes of the
                            same species.</p>
                        <p>Immediately beneath the mandibles are situated the <hi rend="italic"
                            >maxillae</hi> or under jaws (fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">cc),</hi> which
                            are likewise placed on each side of the mouth, and take their origin
                            from the inferior and internal part of that cavity, near the origin of
                            the under lip. Like that of the preceding parts, their action is
                            horizontal, but their texture is less rigid, approaching to membranous,
                            their colour usually paler, and their internal edges toothed, or finely
                            fringed with hairs. The different portions of the maxillae have received
                            different names, such as the <hi rend="italic">cardo or</hi> hinge, the
                            <hi rend="italic">stipes</hi> or stalk, and the <hi rend="italic"
                            >lobus</hi> or lobe (one or more) which forms the terminal portion. The
                            last named is the most important portion, as it acts upon the food when
                            preparing for deglutition, and when armed with teeth its substance is as
                            hard as that of the mandibles. “ This part,” says Mr Kirby, “ is either
                            simple, consisting only of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> lobe, as you will
                            find to be the case with the <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera, Dynastidoe,
                            Nemognatha,</hi> and several other beetles; or it is compound,
                            consisting of two lobes. In the former case, the lobe is sometimes
                            very-long, as in the bee tribes, and at others very short, as in hister,
                            &amp;c. The bilobed maxillae present several different types of form.
                            Nearest to those with one lobe are those whose lower lobe is attached
                            longitudinally to the inner side of the stalk of the organ, above which
                            it scarcely rises. Of this description is the maxilla in the common dung

                            formation is where the lower lobe is only a little shorter than the
                            upper ; this occurs in a kind of chafer (<hi rend="italic">Macraspis
                            tetradactyla,</hi> Macleay). A third is where the upper lobe covers the
                            lower as a shield ; as you will find in the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Orthoptères</hi> order, and the <hi rend="italic">Libellulina,</hi> and
                            almost in <hi rend="italic">Meloe.</hi> A fourth form is where the upper
                            lobe somewhat resembles the galeate maxilla just named, but consists of
                            two joints. This exists in <hi rend="italic">Staphylinuloe,</hi> &amp;c.
                            The last kind I shall notice is when the upper lobe not only consists of
                            two joints, but is cylindrical, and assumes the aspect of a feeler or
                            palpus. This is the common character of almost all the predaceous
                            beetles <hi rend="italic">(Entornophagι,</hi> Latr.)."<note

                        <p>Most of the predaceous beetles have the inner lobe of the maxillae armed
                            with a terminal claw, which, among the Ci-cmdehdae, is articulated and
                            moveable, but hxed in the other carabideous kinds. The maxillae are
                            chiefly serviceable in holding the food, and preventing its falling from
                            the mouth during the action of the mandibles, although in certain cases
                            they no doubt also act their part in comminution. They are more fixed in
                            their forms than the mandibles, and are of more essential service to the
                            naturalist for the purposes of classification. Fabricius, indeed, has
                            deduced the principal diagnostic of ten out of the thirteen orders (or
                            classes, as he terms them), of which his system is composed, from these
                            important parts.</p>
                        <p>We shall now briefly notice certain appendages of the maxillae, the
                            existence of which forms another distinction between them and the
                            mandibles or upper jaws, which are never so provided. Towards the middle
                            of the outer edge of the maxillae are attached two slender articulated
                            filiform processes, known under the name of palpi (see the figure above
                            referred to) ; the longer pair being the external, the others the
                            internal palpi. Both are called <hi rend="italic">maxillary,</hi> to
                            distinguish them from the <hi rend="italic">labial</hi> palpi,
                            afterwards mentioned. According to the view expressed by Mr Kirby in the
                            preceding quotation, the reader will perceive that each maxilla may be
                            regarded as properly possessing only one palpus, although in certain
                            tribes the upper lobe being jointed and <hi rend="italic"
                            >palpiform,</hi> has occasioned its being regarded as one of these
                            organs. The palpi are distinctly articulated, or composed of several
                            jointed parts, and are capable of rapid and extended motion. They derive
                            their name from a Greek word, which signifies to feel, and are supposed
                            to constitute one of the principal organs of touch. Their uses, however
                            in the insect economy have been variously interpreted. Bonsdorf regarded
                            them as the organs of smell ; while Knock, agreeing in that opinion so
                            far as regards the <hi rend="italic">maxillary</hi> palpi, conceives
                            that those of the <hi rend="italic">labium</hi> exercise the faculty of
                            <hi rend="italic">taste.</hi> Cuvier and Kirby favour touch as their
                            true function, and this view is confirmed by the constant use which
                            numerous species make of these organs while walking, by applying them
                            perpetually to the surface of whatever objects they pass over. That they
                            perform that function is rendered extremely probable by their structure,
                            which is beautifully adapted, by its peculiar pliancy, to the
                            examination of the substances with which they come in contact. They are
                            in some respects analogous to the articulated extremities which form the
                            principal seat of the sense of touch in vertebrated animals. It has also
                            been noticed that several aquatic beetles, while swimming, bend back
                            their antennae, and stretch forward their palpi, as if to explore their
                            way through the ambiguous and weedy waters. As accessory to the
                            maxillae, they are no doubt also employed in the selection of the most
                            suitable alimentary portions of whatever substances have been previously
                            seized upon by the more powerful parts of the mouth. In many insects
                            there is only a single palpus to each of the maxillae.</p>
                        <p>As the mouth is covered above by the <hi rend="italic">labrum,</hi> or
                            upper lip, so it is closed below by the under lip, or <hi rend="italic"
                            >labium</hi> (fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">d</hi>). The latter differs in
                            its structure from the labrum, being more complex than that organ, and
                            composed as it were of two portions joined together. It varies in its
                            form, is usually notched in front, and frequently furnished with a
                            triangular tooth in the centre, which is sometimes biful. Mr Kirby
                            defines the labium as a moveable organ, often biarticulate, which,
                            terminating the surface anteriorly, covers the mouth from beneath, and
                            is situate between the maxillae. It includes the mentum and labial
                            palpi. The more uncovered portion of the labium, or that which projects
                            from the basal portion, is now named <hi rend="italic">languette</hi> or
                            <hi rend="italic">ligula</hi> by Latreille, in consonance with the
                            nomenclature of Fabricius. The <hi rend="italic">mentum,</hi> or chin,
                            is the lower joint of the labium when the latter is jointed ; in other
                            cases its base.</p>
                        <p>Some contrariety of opinion seems to exist in the nomenclature of these
                            parts. Mr Macleay bestows the name of <hi rend="italic">mentum</hi> on
                            the middle piece of the lower apparatus of the mouth. Its anterior
                            portion, to which the palpi are so frequently attached, he calls the <hi
                            rend="italic">labium,</hi> while the basal part of the mentum is
                            designated the <hi rend="italic">stipes.</hi> In this view the labium of
                            Macleay corresponds to the <hi rend="italic">ligula,</hi> or rather
                            tongue, of Kirby, while the mentum of the latter is analogous to the
                            stipes of the former ; for it appears that the term mentum is only
                            applied by the author of the <hi rend="italic">Introduction to
                            Entomology</hi> to the lower division of the labium, when that organ (as
                            in <hi rend="italic">Hydrous piceus)</hi> appears to consist of two
                            joints or pieces. When there is no apparent division, or the only
                            separation consists in a transverse elevated line (as in some
                            lamellicorn beetles), or an obtuse angle formed by the meeting of the
                            two parts, then the entire piece (the <hi rend="italic">mentum</hi>
                            merging in it) is regarded by Mr Kirby as the <hi rend="italic"
                            >labium.</hi></p>
                        <p>Among the greater proportion of masticating insects there is placed
                            anteriorly at each side of the ligula a small supporting piece or
                            article, which takes its rise a little above the pharynx, and is
                            terminated by a projecting appendage. These parts were named <hi
                            rend="italic">paraglossoe</hi> by liliger; and Μ. Latreille regards them
                            as the true representatives of the tongue of the higher tribes. The
                            labial palpi (Fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">d),</hi> are inserted on each
                            side of the ligula, and are usually longer than the internal and shorter
                            than the external maxillary palpi. These palpi have never more than four
                            articulations, in which they also differ from the external maxillary,
                            which range from four to six. They are called labial palpi, because in
                            many cases they derive their origm from the labium strictly so called;
                            but in reference to Mr Kirby’s nomenclature of the parts, they might
                            with equal propriety be denominated lingual palpi, since they not
                            unfrequently emerge from what that excellent observer considers as the
                            tongue. Among the predaceous Coleoptera, indeed, their source seems
                            common to both these parts, as their base on its upper side is attached
                            to the labium, on its under to the hgula or tongue.</p>
                        <p>In some insects, such as the Orthoptera and dragon-flies, the membranous
                            portion with which the anterior or internal face of the ligula is
                            furnished, is thick and dilated near the centre, in the form of a little
                            tongue, and is often divided near the middle by a groove. This portion,
                            in the opinion of Latreille, probably occupies the place of the <hi
                            rend="italic">paraglossa;</hi> for these latter, in the instances
                            referred to, are wanting, or not to be recognised.</p>
                        <p>These are the principal parts of the mouth among the masticating insects.
                            At the anterior root of the ligula, and a little lower than the middle
                            of the interior space which intervenes between the mandibles, is placed
                            the <hi rend="italic">pharynx.</hi> In many Hymnenoptera this orifice of
                            the oesophagus opens and shuts by means of an appendage, previously
                            noticed by Reaumur in humble bees, and taken by Latreille for the
                            labrum, in his observations on the structure of wasps. Savigny has since
                            paid particular attention <pb facs="nls:193746142"
                            xml:id="kp-eb0709-6142-0068"/> to it, and has named it the <hi
                            rend="italic">epipharynx</hi> or <hi rend="italic">epiglossa.</hi>
                            La-treilie conceives it would be more simple to call it the <hi
                            rend="italic">sublabrum,</hi> because ,it is inserted beneath the
                            anterior and superior margin of the head, immediately after the origin
                            of the labrum. It, is. formed of∣ two. flattened portions, entirely or
                            in great pärt membranous, applied the one upon the other, and of a
                            triangular form. The upper portion is the most advanced. .This
                            epipharynx, instead of being peculiar, as some have supposed, to tlje
                            Hymenoptera, may be safely regarded as existing.in the other masticating
                            insects, particularly the Coleoptera, among which it· seems represented
                            under a mödified form of structure by the membrane which clothes the
                            corresponding portion of the head.</p>
                        <p>Although the hymenopterous tribes differ from the other mandibulatech
                            orders, by the prolongation of the maxillae and,labium, and the valvular
                            aspect of the former, yet the parts of the mouth do not present any
                            essential distinction. A remarkable characteristic of these orders,
                            however, consists, as Savigny informs us, in the absence of the mentum
                            properly so called. They also exhibit this disagreement from the other
                            masticators, in as far as their maxillae embracing! longitudinally the.
                            sides of the labium, these parts unite, together só as to form a tubular
                            body or trunk <hi rend="italic">(promuscis),</hi> serving for suction.
                            As their aliments consist of softish śubstances, or of nectaroüs juices,
                            which, passing between <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> the maxillae and the
                            labium, by means of the successive pressure&lt;of the former parts upon
                            the latter, eventually arrive at the pharynx, they may in truth be
                            regarded as semi-suctorial. Even the Rhinchophori among the Cołe-optera,
                            and: the Panorpati in the neuropterous order, are furnished with, an
                            apparent trunk or prolongation of the muzzle.. <hi rend="italic"
                            >(prorostr&gt;ιm)</hi>; but that peculiarity is nothing more than an
                            extension of the anterior portion of the head ; and the organs: tì£
                            manducation, placed at its extremity, though of diminished size, in no
                            way differ in structure from those of the other groups of their
                            respective orders. We may add, that the labium or lower lip in the
                            hymenopterous tribes is generally .moveable at its base, as may be
                            observed in the corresponding tribes of the suctorial insects.</p>
                        <p>In the suctorial or haustellated orders, properly so called, the organs
                            of the mouth appear at first sight to differ entirely from those above
                            described. The parts which are regarded aš analogous to the maxillae,
                            and frequently even those which represent the mandibles, are fixed and
                            immoveable, either entirely so, or towards their base, and (in regard to
                            the maxillae) as far as the origin of the palpi.’ When the terminal
                            portion is moveable, it is long, narrow, linear, sometimes in the form
                            of a thread or bristle, sometimes resembling a dart or lancet, and
                            fitted for piercing. The pharynx is the central point: around which
                            these portions arrange themselves after the tubiflar form. Sometimes the
                            lower lip, united with the inferior portion of the maxillae, and fixed
                            like it, closes the cavity of the mouth, and the maxillae then
                            constitute a kind of spiral tongue. In other Cases it iŝ~greatly
                            prolonged, and assumes the form of an, articuļated tube, or of an
                            elbowed trunk, usually terminated by two lips susceptible of dilatation.
                            In either of the latter'states it serves as a sheath to certain portions
                            of a sealystructure and piercing nature, in the form of a bristle or
                            lanċet, arid representing the other parts’of the mouth. Spmetimes this,
                            sheath (as in <hi rend="italic">PRulx)</hi> is bivalvular, but it more
                            frequently consists of a single piece laterally folded so as to form a
                            tube open on the upper surface. In this longitudinal canal or gutter,
                            the preceding parts are lodged, and compose by their general union the
                            sucker, or <hi rend="italic">haustellum.</hi> In some instances the
                            palpi have disappeared, in others only two are visible. When there are
                            four of these parts, two of them, the maxillary, are extremely small, or
                            almost imperceptible. Sometimes, as among the pupiparous Dipt era, the
                            lower lip is either nonexistent or rudimentary, and the palpi become the
                            sheath of the sucker. Though we make frequent use of the latter terra,
                            it may be remembered that its application is not strictly correct, as it
                            is not by suction, or the production of a vacuum, that the alimentary
                            juices mount towards the pharynx, but rather by the continuous pressure
                            of the parts upon each other.</p>
                        <p>Of all the suctorial or haustellated tribes the Lepidoptera are those
                            which differ least from the type of the mandibulated orders in the

                            Savigny, the tongue or hypopharynx. The two superior filaments of the
                            sucker, or those which are exterior, replace, or rather represent, the
                            mandibles, while the two others may be regarded as maxillae. Finally,
                            the tubular sheath assimilates to the labium or lower hp, even in regard
                            to its articulations. Sometimes the sheath is biful, as in <hi

                            divided into two plates, as in <hi rend="italic">PRulx.</hi> The first
                            of these genera is stated by Latreille to be the only one in which he
                            has discovered palpi. He thinks that the parts taken for such by Savigny
                            in <hi rend="italic">Nepa Neptunia</hi> (see Plate CCXX. fig. 6, as

                            articulation of the sheath. Germar indeed admits four palpi as
                            characteristic of a new hemipterous genus of the family of Cicadanae,

                            dilatable, striated, exhibiting through the microscope a great number of
                            tracheal ramifications ; sometimes coriaceous, and either small and
                            slightly distinct from the stalk, or slender, elongated, and forming a
                            more obvious article, almost as long as die preceding division (as in
                            genus <hi rend="italic">Myopa).</hi> The support is remarkable in this,
                            that it results from the prolongation of the cutaneous membrane of the
                            anterior and superior portion of the head, or the epistoma, united with
                            the parts representing the labrum, to die mandibles, the maxillae, and
                            the inferior portion of die labium, as far as the mentum inclusive. This
                            character particularly distinguishes the present tribes from those of
                            the hemipterous order. In other respects the sheath may be said to be

                            gutter for the reception of the sucker. The number of pieces in the

                            of which die difference is always two—2, 4, 6 ; but in all cases there
                            are always two portions which are not paired, the one superior,
                            representing the labrum ; the other inferior, placed behind the pharynx,
                            and the analogue of the tongue or hypopharynx. Among the Diptera, as
                            well as in the suctorial tribe <hi rend="italic">(Pulex),</hi> the
                            latter portion is always sealyand piercing, and contributes, in common
                            with the others, to the purposes of nutrition. It is otherwise with the
                            Hemiptera, and this distinction forms a new character of separation
                            between that order and the insects now under consideration. The parts
                            representing the maxillae always exist, and are frequently accompanied
                            each by a palpus; but these maxillae are soldered to the support, and
                            are indistinct, except where their apical portion becomes moveable and
                            elongated, and presents the form of a seta or homy lancet. This always
                            takes place when the sucker consists of from four to six pieces. In the
                            latter case two of them represent the mandibles ; in the other, or where
                            the sucker is composed of only four setae, these are wanting, or merely
                            rudimentary. Sometimes also the labrum, almost always vaulted and large,
                            seems to offer the vestiges of another piece, which, under a fuller
                            development, might no doubt be regarded as the epipharynx. Sometimes the
                            support is very short, and in this case the pieces of the sucker leave
                            the cavity of the mouth, and the maxillary palpi are inserted on the
                            sides. The Hippoboseae, or pupiparous Diptera, differ from all the rest
                            in the absence of the sheath ; for the palpi, under the form of two
                            coriaceous elongated blades, perform its functions, and advancing in a
                            parallel direction, cover and protect the sucker.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the observations of Latreille, as well as with those
                            of Savigny, Leclerc de Laval, and Professor Nitzsch, regarding the
                            structure of the mouth in such of the hexapod insects as undergo no
                            metamorphosis <hi rend="italic">(hexapodes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                            >homotenes),</hi> the general plan of organization seems in these to be
                            the same as among the polymorphous orders. In <hi rend="italic"
                            >Pediculus,</hi> properly so called, the only known suctorial species of
                            that division, the trunk <hi rend="italic">(rostellum)</hi> consists of
                            a small inarticulate tube, inclosing a sucker, and withdrawing itself at
                            pleasure within a muzzle-shaped advancement of the anterior portion of
                            the head. But the organization of these parasitical species requires a
                            renewed and more careful examination. The genus <hi rend="italic"
                            >Ricinus,</hi> although furnished with mandibles, maxillae, and an
                            inferior hp, has these parte greatly concentrated, after the manner of
                            the Suctoria; and the labrum seems to perform the office of a cupping
                            glass, a character unique and unexampled in this class of animals, and
                            one which, in combination with certain other features, indicates a
                            peculiar type<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                        <p>These are the principal modifications exhibited in the <pb
                            facs="nls:193746168" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6168-0070"/> structure of the
                            mouth by hexapod or true insects. In the opinion of Marcel de Serres,
                            the parts named palpi (the antennulae of some authors) enjoy, at least
                            in the Orthoptera, a peculiar property, that of being the organ of the
                            sense of smell. Lamarck again looks upon the palpi as exercising the
                            faculty of taβte. Latreille regards these opinions as ill-founded, so
                            far as concerns a great number of insects, such as those in which the
                            palpi are non-existent, undeveloped, or extremely minute ; but he views
                            them in a more favourable light in reference to certain other species.
                            Thus, among the Coleoptera of the sub-family of <hi rend="italic"
                            >Xylotrogi,</hi> the maxillary palpi of the males are lacinated or
                            pectinated like some antennae. In many other kinds the last article of
                            the palpi is greatly dilated, and terminated by a pulpy substance.</p>
                        <p>We have not hitherto attended to the singular order Strepsiptera of kirby
                            (Rhipiptera, Lat.), the characters of which were first given in the <hi
                            rend="italic">Linnaan Transactions.</hi> If we regard the insects of
                            this order as possessed of genuine mandibles, we must of course include
                            them among the masticating tribes ; but as in many of the preceding
                            orders, in which the parts of the mouth are feebly developed, the
                            mandibles are observed to have become obliterated, there is reason to
                            suspect that the parts regarded as such in Strepsiptera are rather
                            maxillary, in which case the structure would approach that of the
                            lepidopterous kinds.</p>
                        <p>We have entered into the preceding details in consequence of the great
                            importance which is now attached to the study of the parts of
                            manducation. Latreille indeed seems to be of opinion, that whenever it
                            is possible to characterize genera by more obvious organs, the minuter
                            parts should not be had recourse to ; and he deems the principles of the
                            Fabncian system liable to abuse, especially when Clairvilles example is
                            departed from of employing only the mandibles and palpi. But the truth
                            is, that the use of the compound microscope is scarcely ever required in
                            these examinations ; and it cannot be denied that a knowledge of such
                            essential parts is indispensable in the formation of natural generic
                            groups. The general physiognomy is frequently deceptive, and we can
                            rectify our views only by recurring to influential organs. Thus the <hi
                            rend="italic">Sphex spirifer,</hi> and some analogous species which
                            differ from their congeners in the mode of providing for their young,
                            and which therefore form a good natural group, are also distinguished by
                            an alteration in the structure of the mouth, but could scarcely be
                            separated from the primitive genus by characters drawn from any other
                            parts.</p>
                        <p>Besides the parts of the mouth, the head of insects presents some other
                            component portions which have received particular names. What Mr Kirby
                            calls the nose is that upper and anterior portion to which the labrum is
                            attached, and which corresponds to the <hi rend="italic">clypeus</hi> of
                            Fabricius. (See Plate CCXX. fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> upper
                            portion.) The latter term was originally applied metaphorically to the
                            expanded or shield-like covering of the head of the Scarabacidae, and
                            the expression was not inapt ; but when it came to be used as a general
                            term in relation to the structure of all other kinds, it lost its
                            propriety of application. Hence the term <hi rend="italic">nasus</hi> or
                            <hi rend="italic">nose</hi> has been substituted, as well as that of <hi
                            rend="italic">epistoma,</hi> which signifies the <hi rend="italic">part
                            above the mouth.</hi> Between the nose and the labrum we find in many
                            species the nostril piece or <hi rend="italic">rhinanum</hi> of Kirby.
                            It is very obvious in a New Holland beetle, <hi rend="italic"

                            seen under the form of a triangular piece, below the antennae and above
                            the nose, and separated from the latter and from the front by a deeply
                            impressed line. It is very distinct in that splendid Chinese beetle the
                            <hi rend="italic">Sagra</hi><hi rend="italic">purpurea.</hi> The <hi
                            rend="italic">frons</hi> or front of insects is the middle part of the
                            face, bounded laterally by the eyes, anteriorly by the nose or
                            after-nose and the cheeks, and posteriorly by the vertex. The <hi
                            rend="italic">vertex</hi> is the crown of the head, and is bounded
                            laterally by the hinder part of the eyes and the temples, and
                            posteriorly by the occiput, when that part exists. It is the ordinary
                            region of the stemma-tic eyes, although these peculiar organs are
                            sometimes found to occur likewise upon the frons. The <hi rend="italic"
                            >occiput,</hi> or hind head, is that part which either forms an angle
                            posteriorly with the vertex, or slopes downwards from it. It is bounded
                            laterally by the temples, and posteriorly by the orifice of the head, or
                            by the neck itself. The cheeks. <hi rend="italic">gena,</hi> according
                            to Kirby, usually surround the anterior part of the eyes, lying between
                            them and the mandibles, or their representatives. The temples, <hi
                            rend="italic">tempora,</hi> form a continuation of the cheeks to the
                            posterior limit of the head, forming its sides and posterior

                        <p>The next appendages of the head to which we have to direct the reader’s
                            attention are the <hi rend="italic">antenna.</hi> These are moveable
                            articulated organs, never exceeding two in number in genuine insects,
                            although their form, and the amount of articulated portions, are
                            extremely various. Their primary use in the animal economy has not yet
                            been ascertained ; at least a great diversity of opinion is maintained
                            on the subject. In numerous tribes they seem to exercise a faculty
                            analogous to that of touch, being employed in exploring the depth of
                            crevices, and in ascertaining by contact the nature of any opposing
                            obstacle ; while, on the other hand, their extreme shortness in most
                            Diptera, and in many of the neuropterous and hemipterous tribes, does
                            not accord with that usage. Although of considerable importance in our
                            systematic arrangement of insects, the development of the antennae does
                            not seem subjected to any general or conformable rules, and is therefore
                            of less value than that of several other parts of structure. For
                            example, we frequently find a considerable difference to exist in the
                            form of the antennae among species in other respects intimately allied ;
                            and even between the sexes of the same species a great disparity in size
                            and structure is observable. Where a difference exists, those of the
                            male are generally more developed than those of the female.</p>
                        <p>The antennae of insects are usually composed of small cylindrical
                            articulations, containing nervous threads, muscles, tracheae, and
                            cellular tissue. Various terms are in use to express their form,

                            articles are flattened from the summit to the base, and appearing as if
                            strung on a thread through the centre (it is usually the terminal
                            portion of the antennae that is so characterized) ; <hi rend="italic"
                            >imbricated,</hi> when the articles are threaded as above mentioned, and
                            concave at their summit, so that each covers the base of that which
                            follows ; <hi rend="italic">clavated</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                            >club-shaped,</hi> when thick or swollen towards the summit. The club is
                            <hi rend="italic">solid</hi> when its parts are not separated by any
                            apparent space ; <hi rend="italic">perfoliated,</hi> when composed of
                            threaded articulations; <hi rend="italic">lamellated</hi> or <hi
                            rend="italic">foliated,</hi> when the parts of the club are connected
                            laterally, and admit of being opened and closed like the leaves of a

                            >hatchet-shaped,</hi> when the last articulation assumes the form of a
                            compressed triangle, free at the base, but articulated by the apex.
                            Antennae are also said to be <hi rend="italic">uncinated</hi> or <hi
                            rend="italic">hooked</hi> when the extremity suddenly bends itself
                            towards the base ; <hi rend="italic">biful,</hi> when divided into two ;
                            <hi rend="italic">obtuse,</hi> when terminated by a round or blunted

                            branched on either side, like a feather. Many other terms are in use to
                            express the modifications of these important organs, most of which,
                            however, are of a sufficiently familiar derivation to explain
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>The antennae of the coleopterous order usually consist of ten or eleven
                            distinct articulations. The latter number is the most frequent, although
                            several genera present much fewer joints, as for example <hi
                            rend="italic">Paussus,</hi> in which there are only two. Others again
                            have many more, such as a species of Prionus, of which the antennae of
                            the female have nineteen joints, of the male twenty. In some
                            orthopterous kinds these articulations amount to a hundred and fifty.
                            The antennae are inserted on the front of the head, anterior to and
                            rather beneath the region of the eyes. Their particular position varies,
                            but they are always either in the space between the eyes, or that below
                            them. As their various forms, as characteristic of particular groups of
                            species, will be afterwards described in the systematic part of the
                            present treatise, we shall not here enter into further details of
                            structure. The uses of these singular organs are variously viewed by
                            naturalists, and there seems even yet to be more hypothetical reasoning
                            on the subject than precise induction from facts. Some regard them as
                            the seat of smell, others of hearing, a greater number as the organs of
                            the sense of touch. The indurated nature of the outer covering in most
                            insects would certainly lead us, <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> to
                            expect a special provision for the reception of the last-named sense. It
                            is, however, extremely difficult, in the present state of our knowledge,
                            to come to any general conclusion oh the subject. We shall state the
                            prevailing opinions when we come to treat of the senses of insects ; and
                            under that head we shall likewise explain the structure of the eyes.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">thorax</hi> forms the second principal portion of
                            an insect’s body. It is itself divisible into three parts, and its
                            component segments vary greatly in their relative proportions in the
                            different tribes; the division which is merely rudimentary in one
                            particular group, being sometimes highly developed in another. These
                            parts are named the <hi rend="italic">prothorax,</hi> the <hi
                            rend="italic">mesothorax,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                            >metathorax.</hi></p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">prothorax</hi> (from <hi rend="subscript"> ff</hi>
                            jo, <hi rend="italic">before,</hi> and to <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>
                            αξ, <hi rend="italic">thorax·)</hi> is the antenor segment, and
                            corresponds to the <hi rend="italic">corselet</hi> or collar of Μ.
                            Latreille ; the second segment is named <hi rend="italic"
                            >mesothorax</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">μιβος, middle)</hi><hi
                            rend="italic">;</hi> and the third is known as the <hi rend="italic"
                            >metathorax</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">μοτ</hi><hi rend="italic
                            subscript"> a</hi><hi rend="italic">, after.)</hi> Each segment may
                            likewise be distinguished in reference to its inferior, its lateral, and
                            its superior portions ; and the whole united constitute the <hi
                            rend="italic">thorax,</hi> commonly so called. But although the general
                            name of thorax is applied to the parts just named, yet the posterior
                            two, that is, the mesothorax and the metathorax, are the most dependent
                            on each other, and are always intimately united ; while the prothorax,
                            as exemplified in the Coleoptera, is often comparatively free and
                            distinguishable. It is this last-mentioned segment which bears the
                            anterior pair of feet, and it considerably exceeds the others in extent.
                            In the coleopterous order, indeed, it is the only part that is visible
                            on the upper surface, the other segments, with the exception of the
                            scutellum, being connected beneath it and the elytra. The mesothorax and
                            metathorax unite strictly with the base of the abdomen, and serve as the
                            points of attachment to the other pairs of feet. Of the mesothorax or
                            central portion, the most obvious characters consist in its serving as a
                            support to the second pair of feet, and to the elytra or first pair of
                            wings. Its form, size, and consistence are extremely various. Slightly
                            developed in the Coleoptera and Orthoptera, it is larger in the
                            Hemiptera, the Neuroptera, and more especially in the Hymenoptera, the
                            Lepidoptera, and the Diptera. Its excessive increase is always
                            associated with a condition more or less rudimentary of the other
                            segments. Thus, in the three orders last named, the prothorax and
                            metathorax are very restricted ; while, on the contrary, they are large
                            in the Coleoptera, among which it is observable that the mesothorax is
                            always compressed and narrow. The metathorax serves as the point of
                            attachment to the third pair of feet, and to the second or membranous
                            pair of wings.</p>
                        <p>We have said that each segment may be described in relation to its
                            inferior, its lateral, and its superior parts. A piece named the <hi
                            rend="italic">sternum</hi> constitutes the whole of what is called the
                            <hi rend="italic">inferior</hi> portion. This is not, as too often
                            supposed, an occasional projection, merely characteristic of certain
                            tribes. It occurs in all insects, and forms a distinct character, though
                            more or less defined and perspicuous, according to the genus. It may be
                            regarded as generally composed of three distinct pieces, resembling in
                            this respect the human sternum, which anatomists describe as consisting
                            originally of three bones. Each of these pieces, according to Mr Kirby,
                            is appropriated to a pair of legs, and each of them has been called the
                            <hi rend="italic">sternum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> thus, in Elater
                            the <hi rend="italic">prosternunt,</hi> in the Cetoniadae the <hi
                            rend="italic">mesosternum,</hi> and in Hydrophilus the <hi rend="italic"
                            >metasternum,</hi> have alike been distinguished by the name. Each of
                            the ordinary <hi rend="italic">lateral</hi> portions of the thorax is
                            formed of two principal pieces, which, in combination with the sternum,
                            is by some named the <hi rend="italic">pectus</hi> or breast. The
                            anterior piece rests upon the sternum, and is hence called <hi
                            rend="italic">episternum</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">tsr!, upon).</hi>
                            The posterior lateral portion, called the <hi rend="italic"
                            >epimera,</hi> is connected with the preceding ; it also adheres to the
                            superior portion, and rests in certain cases on the sternum ; but it
                            bears a constant relation to the haunches of the segment to which it
                            belongs, and to these it articulates by means of a little piece
                            afterwards mentioned by the name of <hi rend="italic">trochantim.</hi>
                            It derives its name from ιw∕, and ^o <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>, <hi
                            rend="italic">thigh.</hi> Lastly, there exists on these same lateral
                            parts a third piece, in general slightly developed, and sometimes
                            imperceptible. It bears relation to the wing and episternum, always
                            supports itself on the latter, is sometimes prolonged inferiorly along
                            its anterior margin, or, becoming free, passes in advance of the wing,
                            or even places itself above it. It bears the name of <hi rend="italic"
                            >paraptera,</hi> from wαjα, <hi rend="italic">near to,</hi> and wr⅛ov,
                            <hi rend="italic">icing.</hi> Three other portions of some importance
                            may likewise be considered as belonging to the general <hi rend="italic"
                            >pectus.</hi></p>
                        <pb facs="nls:193746194" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6194-0072"/>
                        <p>1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>, Above the sternum, on its internal face, that
                            is, within the body of the insect, there exists a piece sometimes
                            remarkable for its size. It is placed on the median line, and generally
                            takes its rise from the posterior extremity of the sternum. It assumes
                            various secondary forms, and is generally divided into two branches.
                            Cuvier named it the Y-formed portion, on account of his having observed
                            it assume the shape of that letter. It is called <hi rend="italic"
                            >entothorax</hi> by Μ. Audouin, from <hi rend="italic">f</hi><hi
                            rend="italic">∣∣</hi><hi rend="italic">rος, within,</hi> because it is
                            always placed in the interior of that organ. It occurs in each segment
                            of the thorax, and seems to be in some measure a dependent on the
                            sternum. Its uses are supposed to be the protection of the nervous
                            system, and its isolation in many cases from the digestive apparatus and
                            the dorsal vessel. The entothorax exists not only in the thorax, but in
                            the head, in which case it is named <hi rend="italic"
                            >entocephalus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> it has even been noticed in
                            the first ring of the abdomen in the genus <hi rend="italic"
                            >Cicada,</hi> and the portion named <hi rend="italic">triangle
                            écailleux</hi> by Réaumur may safely be regarded as its analogue. In
                            this last condition it is denominated <hi rend="italic"
                            >entogaster.</hi></p>
                        <p>2<hi rend="italic">d,</hi> On the anterior edge of the epistcrnum,
                            sometimes of the sternum, and even on the superior part of the body, a
                            stigmatic opening is observable, surrounded by a small piece, of which
                            the texture is frequently corneous. This is the <hi rend="italic"
                            >peritrema,</hi> so called from <hi rend="italic">¶ig, round about,</hi>
                            and <hi rend="italic">τοημa, a hole.</hi> It is not always perceptible,
                            both on account of its being sometimes too closely connected with the
                            neighbouring pieces, and because the stigmatic opening is itself
                            sometimes obliterated. But when visible, it is necessary that it should
                            be distinguished, as its position is of importance, and becomes a useful
                            auxiliary in the comparison of parts and in the determination of
                            analogies.</p>
                        <p>3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, Lastly, it has been already stated in relation
                            to the epimera, that it is connected with the rotule by means of a small
                            articulation, of which the existence was first made known by Μ. Audouin.
                            This is not an essential part of the thorax ; but as it accompanies the
                            epimera, and is associated with the parts of the leg, all of which have
                            received particular denominations, its first describer has thought
                            proper to bestow upon it a name. He calls it <hi rend="italic"
                            >trochantin,</hi> in distinction to <hi rend="italic">trochanter,</hi>
                            or that portion of the leg which is associated with the rotule and the
                            thigh. The trochantin is sometimes concealed in the interior of the
                            thorax, and is sometimes visible externally, according as the rotule is
                            itself more or less prolonged in its internal portion. The ascertainment
                            of this piece, according to Μ. Audouin, admits of a direct comparison
                            between the limbs of insects and those of the Crustacea. Hitherto there
                            were only five parts in the former (the tarsi being regarded as one),
                            while there were six in the latter. But the trochantin completes the
                            number six likewise among the insect tribes.</p>
                        <p>We have now detailed the structure of the chest or pectus of insects ; so
                            that whoever desires to view one of these creatures anatomically,
                            should, after dividing the thorax into three segments, seek to
                            ascertain, on the inferior and middle portion of each, the existence of
                            a sternum, and on the flank or lateral portion, an episternum, a
                            paraptera, and epimera. He will also study the structure of the
                            entothorax, of the peritrema, and of the trochantin. Sometimes, however,
                            the union of one or more of these parts with another is so intimate that
                            they cannot be isolated or distinguished ; but when we elsewhere, in
                            such numerous cases, perceive that the pectus is formed of a certain
                            number of elementary parts, it is more rational to believe that in all
                            instances these same elements are made use of, than to suppose the
                            frequent requirement of new.</p>
                        <p>We shall next discuss the superior portion of the thorax of insects. In
                            the coleopterous tribes the prothorax, as before mentioned, constitutes
                            the principal portion, and its upper part may be called the <hi
                            rend="italic">thoracic shield.</hi> The only other part sufficiently
                            distinguished prior to the time of Μ., Audouin, was the <hi
                            rend="italic">scutellum</hi> or escutcheon. It is highly developed in
                            the Scutellerae, and rudimentary in most of the Hymenoptera, Diptera,
                            Lepidoptera, and some other orders. Its apparent position between the
                            wings has occasioned its being regarded too exclusively as a kind of <hi
                            rend="italic">point d</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi
                            rend="italic">appui</hi> in flight. It is usually of a triangular form
                            in the Coleoptera, and projects backwards from the mesothorax, with its
                            point interposed between the elytra and the wings. The scutellum was
                            adopted by Geoffroy as the basis of his arrangement of the genus <hi
                            rend="italic">Scaraboeus.</hi> It is, however, by no means a well-chosen
                            characteristic of the greater divisions in entomology ; for the accurate
                            distinction is not, as is usually supposed, whether the scutellum does
                            or does not exist in a lamellicorn insect, but whether it is or is not
                            apparent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                            rend="italic">Iloroe Eìitomologiccc,</hi> part i. p. 9.</p></note> It
                            occurs very obviously among many of the coleopterous tribes, but is most
                            conspicuously developed in that genus of the hemipterous order called
                            <hi rend="italic">Scιιtellera,</hi> of which <hi rend="italic">Cimex
                            lineatus</hi> may serve as an example. Naturalists have erred in
                            regarding this portion as characteristic of the mesothorax alone. It is
                            often greatly developed in the posterior segment. Numerous and varied
                            researches have led Μ. Audouin to conclude that this superior portion of
                            the thorax is composed of four principal pieces, frequently isolated,
                            sometimes intimately united, usually distinct. He has deduced the
                            following nomenclature from their relative position in regard to each
                            other. The anterior portion is named the <hi rend="italic"
                            >praescutum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> it is sometimes very large, and
                            is usually concealed in whole or in part in the interior of the thorax.
                            The second piece is called the <hi rend="italic">scutum</hi><hi
                            rend="italic">;</hi> it is an important element, often strongly
                            developed, and always articulates with the wings when these exist. To
                            the next piece the original term <hi rend="italic">scutellum</hi> is
                            applied; it consists of the projecting angular point, generally so
                            denominated by entomologists. The fourth and last piece is called the
                            <hi rend="italic">postscutellum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> it is
                            almost always entirely concealed within the thorax, sometimes united to
                            the internal face of the scutellum, and confounded with it, sometimes
                            free, and not adhering to the other portions, except by its lateral
                            extremities. These are the parts which constitute the superior portion
                            of the thorax, and to which the general term <hi rend="italic"
                            >tergum</hi> may be applied. Thus we may speak of the tergum of the
                            prothorax, of the mesothorax, or of the metathorax ; but when the word
                            tergum alone is used, we are then understood to signify the union of the
                            superior parts, that is, the entire space comprised between the head and
                            the first segment of the abdomen.</p>
                        <p>We come now to the <hi rend="italic">abdomen</hi> itself, an important
                            portion in the animal economy. Anatomists iň general appear to have
                            advanced from the study of the human frame to that of animals, or at
                            least to have applied to the parts of the latter the same terms which
                            they had previously bestowed upon the former. In so doing, however, they
                            have been guided rather by the analogy of form than of function, and
                            hence the vague nature of many terms, as applied to the inferior orders,
                            and which, however correct in their original signification, become
                            either obscure, or altogether inapplicable in regard to other
                            classes.</p>
                        <p>The abdomen, among insects, is that part of the body which is attached to
                            the posterior extremity of the thorax, composed of five or six rings or
                            segments, unprovided with locomotive organs, and always containing
                            within it a portion of the digestive canal. If, as many suppose, its
                            existence depends upon that of the thorax, then the entire class of
                            Annelides or red-blooded worms may be said to be deprived of it, as the
                            thorax itself does not exist in that class.</p>
                        <pb facs="nls:193746207" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6207-0073"/>
                        <p>The term body is then made use of to designate generally the whole of the
                            animal. Although the abdomen cannot well exist without the thorax, the
                            converse does not appear to hold good, for the latter in many species
                            seems to constitute the whole body. Many of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Ñyriapoda,</hi> such as Iulus and Scolopendra, are examples of this ;
                            for they are composed of a series of segments, all furnished with feet
                            except the last, which has therefore by some been regarded as the
                            abdomen.</p>
                        <p>But among genuine insects, that is, the hexapod or six-footed kinds, the
                            abdomen is obviously developed, and, especially among the winged tribes,
                            is very distinguishable from the thorax. Among the apterous species the
                            distinction is less perceptible ; and the same may be said of most
                            insects in the larva state. Among the hymenopterous kinds, such as
                            wasps, bees, &amp;c. it appears as if it were pediculated or attached to
                            the posterior part of the thorax by means of a slender stalk ; but
                            minuter and more accurate observation demonstrates that this neck-like
                            restriction actually takes place on the second segment of the abdomen,
                            the first of which is much more spacious, but so closely attached to the
                            thorax by its anterior edges as to become undistinguishable. In the
                            coleopterous order the abdomen is usually convex, and of a harder
                            consistence beneath, where it is exposed ; but it is soft, and either
                            flattish or concave above, where it is covered by the folded wings and
                            elytra. On both sides of its segments there is a small roundish opening
                            called the <hi rend="italic">stigma,</hi> which serves for the
                            introduction of air for the purposes of respiration, and of which we
                            shall treat in detail when we come to the consideration of that
                            function.</p>
                        <p>It has been noted that if an insect is naturally more habituated to
                            walking than flying, the breast or lower portion of the thorax is
                            expanded, and is furnished with more powerful muscles than the back ;
                            whereas, if flight is the more frequent mode of locomotion, an increase
                            is observable in the dorsal muscles. The locomotive organs are of course
                            the wings and legs, on which we shall now bestow a brief
                            consideration.</p>

                            <p>These organs exist, effectively, in insects only in the perfect
                                state; for the larvae do not offer externally any trace of them, and
                                when apparent in the nymph or intermediate condition, they are
                                merely rudimentary. No insect has more than four wings, many have
                                only a single pair, and others are entirely destitute of these
                                parts. When four in number they may be regarded as <hi rend="italic"
                                >anterior</hi> or <hi rend="italic">superior,</hi> and as <hi

                                rend="italic">;</hi> and we likewise talk of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >first</hi> or of the <hi rend="italic">second pair</hi> of wings.
                                The coleopterous order presents some peculiarities in relation to
                                these organs. The anterior pair (in all cases, as already mentioned,
                                united to the mesothorax) consist of a hard or horny substance
                                similar to the envelope of the thorax, and are called <hi
                                rend="italic">elytra.</hi> When closed, their junction usually forms
                                a straight central line called the <hi rend="italic">suture,</hi>
                                which is rather apparent than real in certain species in which the
                                inferior wings are wanting, and the elytra form a single undivided
                                piece. They are convex above and concave below, are fixed to the
                                mesothorax, and cover and protect the genuine wings, which are of a
                                much more delicate structure. These latter derive their origin from
                                the metathorax, and are the actual organs of flight. They are
                                membranous and transparent, and when unemployed are transversely
                                folded beneath their horny covering. We shall here describe the
                                structure of wings, and explain the terms made use of to express the
                                principal modifications which they undergo in their various degrees
                                of development in the different orders.</p>
                            <p>The wing of an insect consists of two thin flexible membranous
                                transparent plates or leaves, the one superimposed upon the other,
                                and variously intersected by darker lines of a horny consistence,
                                usually known by the name of nervures. These nervures, which at
                                first sight appear like superficial threads, of which the larger
                                follow the longitudinal direction of the wing, are interposed
                                between its membranes, and present two faces, of which the upper,
                                frequently rounded and very horny, adheres closely to the
                                corresponding leaf, and the under, of less firm consistence, and of
                                a flatter form, may by skilful dissection be removed from that
                                portion of the wing by which it is covered. In the opinion of Μ.
                                Audouin, these threads are in fact so many tubes, which diminish in
                                diameter as they approach the summit of the wing, and each of which
                                contains, throughout its entire extent, a spirally rolled vessel, by
                                some regarded as a genuine trachea. These tracheae receive air from
                                the interior of the body, and their formation, according to
                                Swammerdam, whose views have more recently been confirmed and
                                adopted by Jurine and Chabrier, is to strengthen the wing by
                                distending it during the action of flight. They are said to
                                experience no sensible dilatation during their progress, whereas the
                                corneous tubes which contain them present in that respect some
                                curious modifications,—for they sometimes spread out suddenly, in
                                such a way as to exhibit, for a short space, a comparatively broad
                                diameter. The colouring matter being then disseminated over a wider
                                surface, assumes so pale an aspect that the nervure which leads into
                                one,of those little expansions appears as it were interrupted. Hence
                                the name of <hi rend="italic">bulles</hi><hi rend="italic"
                                >chair,</hi> or air-bubbles, bestowed upon the latter by the French
                                entomologists. They occur most frequently in the cubital nervures of
                                many Hymenoptera, and their chief use is supposed to be to
                                facilitate the formation of certain foldings of the wing during the
                                periods of repose. The largest of the nervures arise from the base
                                of the wing, that is, from the point of its insertion in the thorax.
                                A most skilful observer, the late Μ. Jurine of Geneva, has described
                                the wings of hymenopterous insects with great accuracy, in a memoir
                                to which we shall make more special allusion when we come to treat
                                of that particular order.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            <p>The general character in respect to form and aspect of the wings of
                                insects has received a great variety of names. They are sometimes
                                <hi rend="italic">equal,</hi> that is, all four of similar size; or
                                <hi rend="italic">unequal,</hi> when one pair prevails over the
                                other; <hi rend="italic">lanceolate,</hi> when they become narrow,
                                both at the base and apex; <hi rend="italic">falcated,</hi> when
                                curved like a scythe or reaping-hook; <hi rend="italic">linear,</hi>
                                when narrow, with nearly parallel edges; <hi rend="italic"
                                >clavated</hi> or <hi rend="italic">club-shaped,</hi> when linear in
                                their general extent, but perceptibly enlarged towards their
                                extremity; <hi rend="italic">rounded,</hi> when they approach a more
                                circular form; <hi rend="italic">oblong,</hi> when more lengthen-,
                                ened than broad, and describing an elongated ellipse, obtuse at both
                                ends; <hi rend="italic">rhomboidal,</hi> when they are longer from
                                the posterior angle, to the summit than from that angle to the
                                base,; <hi rend="italic">deltoid,</hi> when they assume-the
                                triangular form of the, Greek letter delta; <hi rend="italic"
                                >exserted,</hi> when the. inferior wings pass beyond the elytra; <hi
                                rend="italic">covered,</hi> when entirely protected by those organs;
                                <hi rend="italic">plaited,</hi> when, longitudinally <pb break="no"

                                the manner of a fan; <hi rend="italic">replicated,</hi> when, after
                                being plaited as just mentioned, they are again folded transversely
                                upon themselves; <hi rend="italic">incumbent,</hi> when the
                                posterior margin of one covers that of the other; <hi rend="italic"
                                >extended,</hi> when, in a state of repose, they are stretched on
                                either side, leaving the abdomen visible; <hi rend="italic"
                                >erect,</hi> when, in a state of repose, they are raised
                                perpendicularly to the surface of the body; <hi rend="italic"
                                >deflexed,</hi> when the summits and outer margins form as it were a
                                kind of inclined plane from the base and inner margins. These are
                                the principal variations as to form and attitude, or position. The
                                following terms are of frequent use in entomology, when the surface
                                or superficial structure of the wings is sought to be described.
                                They are <hi rend="italic">striated,</hi> when certain raised lines
                                are perceptible, forming slight parallel and longitudinal furrows;
                                <hi rend="italic">reticulated,</hi> when these lines are disposed
                                like lace or network; <hi rend="italic">veined,</hi> when distinct
                                longitudinal nervures are observable, ramifying into more delicate
                                branches; <hi rend="italic">squamous</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                                >scaly,</hi> when covered with minute powdery particles, which, when
                                examined with a glass, are found to be small scales imbricated or
                                imposed on each other like slates or tiles on a house top; <hi
                                rend="italic">farinose,</hi> when sprinkled more irregularly with
                                fine particles resembling flour, and easily removeable by the
                                finger; <hi rend="italic">pilose</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                                >hairy,</hi> when the surface is more or less covered by minute
                                hairs; <hi rend="italic">naked,</hi> when there is no covering of
                                either hairs or scales. Other characters are deduced from the
                                markings of the wings in regard to tint and colour. They are <hi
                                rend="italic">concolorous,</hi> when similar or unvaried in their
                                hue; <hi rend="italic">vitreous</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                                >windowed,</hi> when, opake over their general surface, certain
                                translucent spots are here and there observable; <hi rend="italic"
                                >ocellated,</hi> when they present circular spots of different
                                colours, resembling an eye; <hi rend="italic">pupillated,</hi> when
                                the eye-like spot has a coloured point in its centre; <hi
                                rend="italic">Jdsciated,</hi> when there are broad coloured lines or
                                bands,—and these are distinguished as transverse, longitudinal,
                                oblique, lanceo-lated, &amp;c. according to their prevailing
                                direction and characteristic form.</p>
                            <p>The margins or edges of the wings have likewise received a
                                considerable variety of designations, according to the peculiar
                                characters which they exhibit. They are <hi rend="italic"
                                >crenated,</hi> when they present an alternation of slight incisions
                                and obtuse projections; <hi rend="italic">dentated</hi> or <hi
                                rend="italic">toothed,</hi> when these incisions are deeper and
                                narrower, and the projections sharper and more defined; <hi
                                rend="italic">fimbriated,</hi> when the marginal processes are
                                lengthened, pointed, and close; <hi rend="italic">cloven,</hi> when
                                the incisions are few and deep; <hi rend="italic">digitated,</hi>
                                when the parts cut into assume the aspect of a hand; <hi
                                rend="italic">emarginate,</hi> when the incision is slight, and
                                seems merely to have scooped out a small portion of the wing; <hi
                                rend="italic">caudated</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tailed,</hi> when
                                the posterior margin presents a more lengthened appendage; <hi
                                rend="italic">ciliated,</hi> when the wings are bordered by
                                close-set hairs resembling eye-lashes. The points of the wings are
                                <hi rend="italic">obtuse,</hi> when terminated by a rounded outline;
                                <hi rend="italic">truncated,</hi> when they appear as if cut; <hi
                                rend="italic">acute,</hi> when ending in a point; <hi rend="italic"
                                >acuminated,</hi> when that point is sharp and prolonged.</p>
                            <p>These details, we doubt not, like all the other technicalities of a
                                complex branch of science, must seem irksome to the general reader.
                                Nevertheless, as they frequently form important and sometimes
                                indispensable elements of knowledge, we must continue their
                                enumeration. The wings, in fact, have furnished the characters from
                                which the names and definitions of the orders in entomology have
                                been derived, and a knowledge of their forms and functions is
                                required during almost every step of our progress. A transcendental
                                anatomy has no doubt thrown its ambiguous light <hi rend="italic"
                                >ficus a non lucendd)</hi> upon these and other portions of animal
                                economy; and the wings, which in former times were thought
                                sufficiently defined when merely named as the organs of flight, are
                                now regarded by some as legs, and by others as lungs. We still see,
                                however, that they carry the creatures through the air, and we shall
                                therefore rest satisfied by viewing them in accordance with our
                                accustomed associations.</p>
                            <p>Among the more remarkable of the modifications experienced by the
                                upper wings, is that corneous condition in which they are known
                                under the name of <hi rend="italic">elytra.</hi> These are
                                particularly characteristic of the coleopterous order, and derive
                                their name from sλurgov, a sheath or covering, because they protect
                                the membranaceous wings. They are attached by their base, by means
                                of several small pieces, to the mesothorax. The opposite extremities
                                are called the points or summits, and the margins are known as
                                anterior or external, posterior, and interior,—the last named, when
                                the parts are closed, and meeting over the back, forming what is
                                called the dorsal suture. As to their proportions, they are <hi
                                rend="italic">elongated,</hi> when they exceed the abdomen; <hi
                                rend="italic">abbreviated,</hi> when shorter than that organ; and
                                various other terms of obvious application are made use of to
                                express their different degrees.</p>
                            <p>The elytra differ in their consistence, being sometimes almost <hi
                                rend="italic">membranous,</hi> or scarcely firmer than the under
                                wings; or they are <hi rend="italic">coriaceous,</hi> or of the
                                texture of leather; <hi rend="italic">semi-coriaceous,</hi> when, as
                                among many Hemiptera, the elytra are composed of two parts of
                                different texture; <hi rend="italic">pergameneous,</hi> or like
                                parchment; <hi rend="italic">flexible,</hi> when, yielding to a
                                slight impression, they yet return again immediately to their
                                original shape; or <hi rend="italic">soft,</hi> when they yield to
                                the same impression, but retain the alteration of form for a longer
                                time. As to form, many of the terms already enumerated in relation
                                to the w ings in general, apply equally to the elytra. They are also
                                <hi rend="italic">gibbous,</hi> when greatly rounded or
                                hemispherical; <hi rend="italic">dilated,</hi> when more flatly
                                expanded; <hi rend="italic">attenuated,</hi> when they diminish in
                                breadth from the base to the apex. The surface of these parts
                                presents many characters of great importance in the discrimination
                                of species, and even in the formation of sections or subdivisions of
                                genera. They are said to be <hi rend="italic">chagrined,</hi> when
                                covered by minute <hi rend="italic">raised</hi> spots; <hi
                                rend="italic">punctated,</hi> when these spots are distinct and <hi
                                rend="italic">hollowed</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                                >tuberculated,</hi> when the elevations are distinct and irregular;
                                <hi rend="italic">scabrous,</hi> when the elevations are distant and
                                unequal; <hi rend="italic">verrucose</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                                >warty,</hi> when they are large, cicatrised, and resembling warts;
                                <hi rend="italic">striated,</hi> when marked with regular
                                longitudinal lines; <hi rend="italic">striato-punctate,</hi> when in
                                each stria there are depressed points; <hi rend="italic"
                                >punctato-striate,</hi> when the striae are themselves formed by a
                                consecutive series of these impressed points; <hi rend="italic"
                                >sulcated</hi> or furrowed, when the impressed lines are deep and
                                broad; <hi rend="italic">ribbed,</hi> when between the furrows there
                                are raised lines; <hi rend="italic">rugose,</hi> when the raised
                                lines are irregular, and divided in all directions; <hi

                            <p>We have already mentioned, that in many of the hemipterous order the
                                anterior wings are <hi rend="italic">semi∙elytrous,</hi> that is,
                                comparatively solid in one part of their extent, and membranous in
                                the other. In fact, the order derives its name from that character,
                                as already mentioned in our introductory definitions. In the
                                orthopterous order the anterior wings, though much more
                                membranaceous than those of beetles, yet approach the nature of
                                elytra, and serve as a protection to the under pair, which are more
                                delicate. Among neuropterous insects both pairs of wings are alike
                                in their general character of texture and reticulation, and the same
                                may be said of the hymenopterous order. Those of the Lepidoptera are
                                also similar to each other in their substance and covering. With a
                                few exceptions, in which the wings are clear or diaphanous, in the
                                last-named gorgeous group they are thickly coated with minute scales
                                of various colours, which when removed exhibit the membranous
                                structure of the parts. They present several other peculiarities,
                                which we shall notice when we treat of the generalities of the
                                greater divisions of which the order is composed.</p>
                            <p>The wings, regarded throughout the entire series of hexapod insects,
                                are thus extremely varied in their form, consistence, development,
                                and efficiency. The distinctions, both of form and texture, show
                                themselves, as it were, by gradation, and present no striking
                                disparity among species otherwise nearly allied. But the uses, and
                                degrees of development, of these organs, vary greatly not only among
                                species of the same genus, but even between the sexes of the same
                                species; for while the males of several kinds are efficiently
                                winged, the females are entirely apterous. When the anterior wings,
                                as in the Coleoptera, are <hi rend="italic">elytrous</hi> (if we may
                                use the expression), they scarcely serve for the purposes of flight.
                                In the neuropterous and hymenopterous orders both pairs are equally
                                efficient, while in the dipterous or two-winged tribes the inferior
                                wings have disappeared. In some cases, as among the female ants, the
                                wings fall off immediately after the sexual union.</p>
                            <p>The development of the wings always bears a relation to that of the
                                superior arc of the thorax by which they are supported. It has been
                                already noted, that if an insect is more habituated to walking than
                                flying, the breast or lower portion of the thorax is extended, and
                                is furnished with more powerful muscles than the back; whereas if
                                flight is the means of locomotion, an increase of power is
                                observable in the dorsal muscles.</p>
                            <p>One of the laws laid down by Μ. Straus Durckheim as regulating
                                organic structure is the following :—that when one organ governs
                                another, or several others, these follow the march of the dominating
                                organ; and that when the latter disappears, those which were
                                subordinate to it immediately assume their primitive form. This law
                                may be exemplified by the influence of the wings upon the thorax. In
                                proportion as the two pairs of wings change in form and size, the
                                two segments of the thorax which support them follow the same
                                progression, and become more and more united to each other; but no
                                sooner do the wings disappear in the Aphaniptera (Pulex), than the
                                two segments of the thorax regain their primitive form, and
                                separating from one another, present the same appearance as in
                                Lepisma. The wings being first introduced amongst the Coleoptera,
                                and the thorax of these as yet differing but little from that of the
                                Thysanura, it can easily return to the form it possessed previously
                                to its undergoing any modification, f It thence follows, that in
                                such species as are deprived of wings, the thorax returns more or
                                less to its primitive form. This is particularly remarkable in the
                                females of many species of <hi rend="italic">Lampyris,</hi> which
                                possess neither wings nor elytra; and this return is moreover
                                occasioned in the Coleoptera without wings by another cause, which
                                acts in this case on that part of the body; it is the diminution of
                                the solidity of the integuments in those parts which are covered by
                                the elytra.</p>
                            <p>In the other order of insects, according to the views of the
                                last-named author, the two segments which bear the wings having
                                already experienced a very "considerable change of form, it would
                                require a very powerful cause to bring them back to their primitive
                                form; for this reason the return does not take place in <hi

                                so called) is only specific. In the Aphaniptera, on the contrary,
                                which we may in some respects consider as wingless Diptera, the
                                transformation of the thorax takes ∣&gt;lace in consequence of a
                                complete absence of the wings, brought about by the degradation
                                which these organs have éxpe-rienced in passing through the whole of

                                also endeavoured to explain the laws which regulate the different
                                changes of structure in passing from one group to another. The most
                                general law in the organization of animals which he has recognised
                                is, that all the systems of organs are subjected to a constant
                                variation of form, and even of function, while passing from one
                                family to another. The first more special or particular law which he
                                evolves from the subdivision of the former is the following: That
                                the organs at one extremity of the scale always exercise a very
                                evident function; whilst at the other extremity they are constantly
                                rudimentary and without function, and at last entirely disappear. He
                                here distinguishes two kinds of cases. In the first, the organs
                                present themselves at the head of the scale developed to the highest
                                degree of which they are susceptible, and decrease insensibly, until
                                they arrive at the other extremity of the scale. Thus, for example,
                                the posterior w ings of insects are “introduced suddenly” into the
                                organization of that class at the highest point bf perfection in the
                                Coleoptera, where <hi rend="italic">they</hi> alone serve for
                                flight. In the Orthoptera and Hemiptera they already begin to divide
                                their function with the elytra, and go on diminishing gradually
                                until they exist merely as rudiments in the Diptera, where they are
                                represented by the halteres.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                                rend="italic">Philosophica.</hi> This opinion, however, is believed
                                by others, and we think with reason, to be founded rather on the
                                position which these organs bear in relation to the anterior wmgs,
                                than on their connection with the metathorax and its different
                                parts. Tatreille, a great authority in such matters, maintains that
                                the balancers do not correspond to or represent the second pair of
                                wings, but are rather vesicular appendages connected with two
                                posterior tracheae of the thorax, and analogous in some measure to
                                the processes which accompany the respiratory organs of the Aphro

                                of the aquatic larvae of Ephemerae and the genus Gyrinus. He founds
                                his opinion chiefly on this, that the inferior wings always take
                                their origin from the lateral and anterior summits of the third
                                thoracic segment, at a very short distance from the superior wings,
                                and always in advance of the two posterior stigmata of the thorax,
                                whilst the balancers are inserted lower down at the internal
                                extremity of these air-conduits, or close by them. (See Latreille’s
                                observations in the 7th and 8th volume of the <hi rend="italic"

                                they entirely disappear in the Aphaniptera. In the second instances,
                                the organs do not appear at the head of the scale in their most
                                perfect state of development, and only acquire it by degrees. Such
                                is the case with the elytra, or first pair of wings, which follow a
                                course exactly contrary to that of the inferior wings. They only
                                appear at first as organs slightly accessory to flight, in which
                                state they remain nearly throughout the whole Coleoptera. In the
                                Orthoptera and Hemiptera they begin already to take a very active

                                primitive use. In the Neuroptera, particularly the Libelluhna, they
                                attain the development of the inferior wings, from which they differ
                                but very slightly. From this point they continue to surpass them,
                                until in the Diptera they become the sole organs of flight, and of
                                course have there attained their highest degree of perfection.
                                Arrived at this culminating point, they suddenly diminish in
                                Hippobosea, and entirely disappear in Pulex.</p>

                                characteristic of the dipterous tribes, and may be regarded as
                                appendages of the anterior wings, the sole pair in that particular
                                order. Their attachment to the scutellum and the postscutellum of
                                the mesothorax is sufficient evidence that they are not the
                                rudiments of a posterior pair; for these, if they existed, would
                                derive their origin from the metathorax. They usually consist of two
                                concave-convex pieces, intermediate as it were between the wing and
                                the poisers, and folded the one upon the other, like the parts of a
                                bivalve shell when the insect is at rest, but stretched or extended
                                during flight. Their special uses are not yet known.</p>
                            <p>The poisers or balancers (Aα/ter«) have been sufficiently described
                                in the preceding note. Audoum regards them as the rudiments of the
                                second pair of wings, of which the extreme tenuity in the Diptera
                                accords in his opinion with the evanescence of the metathorax.<note

                                like that of the last-named organs, seems not to have been
                                satisfactorily determined. Dr Derham and others have thought that,
                                like the pole of a rope-dancer, they keep the body steady in flight;
                                while some connect them with the noises produced by insects, and
                                maintain that they act upon the membrane of the winglet, as a
                                drumstick acts upon its proper organ, thus producing sound.
                                Shelter’s opinion is probably more correct, that they are connected
                                with the function of respiration.<note anchored="true"

                                organs of flight, we shall next request the reader’s attention to
                                those other organs of motion, the legs of insects. With the
                                exception of the Mynapoda (<hi rend="italic">Centipedes,</hi>
                                &amp;c.), which, with Latreille and Dr Leach, we shall form, as
                                already noted, a separate class, the number of legs in insects is
                                precisely six. They are composed of the following parts: ls⅛ The <hi

                                which plays in the socket (see Plate CCXX. fig. 2, a); 2<hi

                                means of which it inosculates with the coxa (Ibid, <hi rend="italic"

                                or thigh, which is long, and usually compressed (c); 4√A, the <hi
                                rend="italic">tibia</hi> or shank, generally the longest joint of
                                the leg, and frequently notched on its edges, and terminated by
                                spur-hke appendages (&lt;Z); <hi rend="italic">bth,</hi> the <hi

                                from three to five among the Coleoptera and the majority of insects
                                (e). The last articulation of the tarsus bears the <hi rend="italic"
                                >ungues</hi> or claws (∕). Μ. Audouin and some other French
                                naturalists seem to use the <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> term
                                haunch <hi rend="italic">(hanche)</hi> as a collective designation,
                                including an internal portion formerly noticed, called <hi
                                rend="italic">trochantin,</hi> along with the <hi rend="italic"
                                >rotule</hi> (our coxa), and the trochanter. In accordance with this
                                view, the parts of the leg in insects may be said to amount to six
                                pieces, instead of the five which we have just enumerated. These
                                terms apply strictly to the intermediate and hind legs. The anterior
                                pair are by some writers regarded as <hi rend="italic">brachia</hi>
                                or arms. The first joint of the brachium, answering to the coxa of
                                the legs, is named <hi rend="italic">clavicula,</hi> or the
                                clavicle, by Mr Kirby; its second joint, answering to the trochanter
                                of the other limbs, is called the <hi rend="italic">scapula</hi><hi
                                rend="italic">;</hi> the third and elongated joint, corresponding to
                                the femur, is designated the <hi rend="italic">humerus;</hi> while
                                the articulations of the tarsus are known as the <hi rend="italic"
                                >manus</hi> or hand. However, the majority of authors seem not to
                                express any distinction between the parts of the fore legs and those
                                of the intermediate and hind ones. The anterior pair, we may
                                observe, are in some cases convertible into organs of prehension,
                                and their tarsi are frequently dilated in the male sex. The number
                                of articulations of the tarsi varies in the different tribes, and is
                                not always the same in the different pairs of legs in the same
                                insect. Their amount on each limb has been assumed as a basis for
                                the formation of the great sectional divisions of the coleopterous
                                order, as originally proposed by Μ. Geoffroy, and so generally
                                adopted by the continental naturalists. The character, though
                                arbitrarily chosen, and not seldom artificial in its results, has
                                proved upon the whole more compatible with a natural arrangement
                                than usually happens on the selection of a single and uninfluential
                                organ. We shall enter into further details in relation to this
                                matter in our introduction to the coleopterous order, and shall
                                merely observe in the mean time, that pentamerous species, or those

                        <p>The nervous system of animals in general, it has been remarked, is one of
                            the most wonderful and mysterious works of the Creator. Its pulpy
                            substance is the visible medium by which the governing principle (To <hi
                            rend="italic">' Hγιμονι×oν)</hi> transmits its commands to the various
                            organs of the body, which instantaneously obey the impulsive mandate;
                            yet tins appears to be but the conductor of some higher principle, or

                            more ethereal essence (language is ransacked in vain tor an appropriate
                            term), which can be more immediately acted upon by the mind and will.
                            But this supposed principle, by whatever fond or fantastical name it may
                            be known, whether as a nervous <hi rend="italic">fluid</hi> or a nervous

                            undoubtedly the centre from which all power and function flow; and
                            during the absence of worthier substitutes we need not challenge the
                            vague abstractions of some metaphysical inquirers.</p>
                        <p>The nervous system of insects consists of a homogeneous pulp, usually
                            disposed in twelve successive ganglions, connected by a double cord. We
                            first observe a double or bilobed mass, which, as it is placed in the
                            head, may be called the brain. It is surrounded by strong muscles, and
                            from its anterior portion nerves arc distributed to the eyes, antennae,
                            and mouth. Posteriorly two delicate recurrent nerves proceed towards the
                            dorsal vessel, and inferiorly two larger nerves, after having formed by
                            their branching a kind of ring, which embraces the oesophagus, unite in
                            the form of a ganglion beneath the last-named organ. From the posterior
                            part of this latter ganglion a pair of nervous cords proceed for a
                            space, and then by their union produce a second inferior ganglion, from
                            which the nervous cords again branch off posteriorly, and so uniting and
                            ramifying from space to space, they extend through the different
                            segments of the thorax and abdomen. The number of these ganglia varies;
                            sometimes they correspond to the divisions of the body, while in many
                            instances they are of smaller amount. In the larva of the
                            rhinoceros-beetle, for example, the whole spinal cord (so called from
                            its supposed analogy to the part known by that name among the vertebrate
                            kinds) presents the appearance of a single ganglion, divided merely by
                            transverse furrows,—while in that of a dragon-fly, six have been
                            observed in the thorax, and seven in the abdomen. In the great
                            water-beetle <hi rend="italic">(Hydrous</hi><hi rend="italic"
                            >piceus)</hi> the head exhibits one ganglion, the thorax six, and the
                            abdomen only two. In the honey-bee there are three ganglia in the
                            thorax, and four in the abdomen. When we examine these knots
                            attentively, we may perceive that, in addition to the double and
                            longitudinal nervous cord by which they are connected, they throw off
                            laterally on either side small nervous trunks, which divide into
                            branches, and finally ramify over the muscles, the intestinal canal, the
                            tracheae, and other parts. This nervous system differs considerably in
                            the larva and perfect insect. In the latter the ganglia are usually less
                            numerous, and the posterior appear formed by the close approximation of
                            several others.</p>
                        <p>The principal ganglia of the nervous system of insects are frequently
                            thus disposed. The position of the upper or cervical ganglion has been
                            already mentioned. The others rest beneath the intestines, ranging along
                            the inferior face of the body. There are three in what may be called the
                            chest; that is, one in the prothorax, which sends nerves to the anterior
                            legs; one in the mesothorax, which supplies the elytra or the upper
                            wings, and the middle legs; and one in the metathorax, which distributes
                            its filaments to the second pair of wings and the last pair of legs. The
                            other ganglia belong to the abdomen. Insects are characterized by the
                            ganglionic distribution of the nervous system, in common with the
                            Crustacea and Arachnides on the one hand, and with the Vermes or worms
                            on the other. But in insects the ganglia are larger and less numerous
                            than in the still lower tribes, which gives a more decided character of
                            centricity to their nervous system. Indeed the highest manifestation of
                            this character is usually presented only as the ultimate result of
                            several metamorphoses; so that while the larva exhibits a closer
                            agreement with the nervous system of worms, that of the imago or perfect
                            insect assumes a higher development. It does not however appear that the
                            brain or upper ganglion of insects acts in the capacity of a <hi

                            warmblooded animals, such as mammiferous quadrupeds and birds; for many
                            insects will live for a considerable time, and even exercise their
                            faculties of flight, after the loss of parts which among the other class
                            we justly regard as of vital importance. The tenacity of life in
                            horse-flies, for example <hi rend="italic">(Hippobosea</hi><hi

                            upon a horse, they will be perceived to run backwards and forwards and
                            sideways, with apparently the same ease as prior to their
                            decapitation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                        <p>The ganglions themselves frequently exhibit a bilebed structure, which

                            however, given rise to many conflicting opinions. “Among the various
                            suggestions on this point, are that of Ackermann ami Reil, who viewed,
                            the nervous system of Articulata as corresponding to the sympathetic
                            system of vertebral animals ;—of XV alther, who compared it in the
                            Mollusea to the par vagum, and in the Articulata to the spinal
                            marrow;—the most generally received opinion, however, is that supported
                            by the authority of Meckel, Cuvier, Blumenbach, Gall, and Spurzheirn,
                            who compare it in the Articulata to the cerebrospinal cord of vertebral
                            animals. The latter gentlemen, in particular, have furnished a strong
                            proof of the correctness of this idea, by demonstrating that the spinal
                            cord of the superior animals actually consists of a series of ganglia
                            with intermediate contiactions,—a structure most fully developed in the
                            Articulata. Rudolphi <hi rend="italic">(Physiologic,</hi> b. ii. s. 8,
                            1823) adopts the .same opinion, and notices the fact, that in Mollusea,
                            Crustacea, Insects, &amp;c. we find nerves of sense arising from the
                            cerebral ganglia,—which by no means accords with the character of the
                            sympathetic system.” (See Note to Carus’s <hi rend="italic">Comparative

                            first to suggest that the ganglia on the knotted spinal cord o.
                            articulated animals correspond to the intervertebral ganglia of the
                            spinal nerves of the higher classes, rather than to the segments of
                            which their spinal marrow is composed.</p></note> In the primitive state
                            of larva he deems the nervous system to consist of two distinct
                            portions, a right and a left; and he maintains that the formation of the
                            nervous system in all animals proceeds from the circumference to the
                            centre, and not, as usually supposed, from the centre to the
                            circumference. We know well, from the observations of Carus and
                            Tiedeman, that the organs of the inferior animals repeat, as it were,
                            the forms which present themselves only in the <hi rend="italic"
                            >embryo</hi> condition of the higher tribes. Μ. de Serres endeavours to
                            show that it is by the progress of successive developments that the
                            portions of the nervous cord in insects approach each other,—that they
                            first join around the oesophagus, then at the opposite extremity towards
                            the inferior ganglions, and lastly in the central parts. He thus admits
                            three distinct embryo states in the condition of the larvae; first, that
                            in which the two portions of the nervous system are entirely isolated
                            and distinct; secondly, that in which the oesophagian ganglia are alone
                            united; and, thirdly, that in which the opposite extremities are joined
                            together. By means of this distinctive view, the French physiologist
                            connects the nervous system of insects with that of the Mollusea, the
                            latter presenting the embryo con-dition<pb break="no"

                            is, being permanently distinguished by a characteristic which is only
                            temporary among the articulated tribes. This may probably be regarded as
                            an additional argument in favour or what we shall afterwards endeavour
                            to maintain,—the general superiority in the scale of organization of the
                            annulose classes over the molluscous kinds. We shall conclude by
                            observing, that besides the general protection afforded by the external
                            envelope of insects to their nervous system, it is specially protected
                            by the Y-shaped portion formerly described.</p>
                        <p>As the nerves constitute the principal media of sensation in all animals,
                            we shall here give a short sketch of the different senses of the insect
                            class.</p>
                        <p>Of the senses in general, as they exist in man and the higher beings,
                            physiologists and metaphysicians alike enumerate the following <hi
                            rend="italic">five·,</hi> viz. <hi rend="italic">touch, taste, smell,
                            hearing,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sight.</hi> All of these, we doubt
                            not, exist in the class now under consideration, although we are not in
                            every ease acquainted with the special organ by which each particular
                            function is exercised.</p>
                        <p>The sense of <hi rend="italic">touch</hi> is usually regarded as
                            affording animals, and man especially, a more intimate and assured
                            communication with the external world than those of either sight or
                            hearing, in as far as no intermediate substance comes between us and the
                            subjects of perception. The perfection of the sense depends on the
                            quality of the skin, the extent and nature of its surface, the number of
                            its nerves, its freedom from insensible parts, and the delicacy of those
                            appendages which are more particularly destined to the examination of
                            bodies. As touch is the most important of all the senses, it may
                            naturally be inferred to be finely developed in the human race; and we
                            know that, of all the vertebrated animals, man in that respect is one of
                            the most highly organized. But among the invertebrate kinds the sense of
                            touch improves in proportion as the others degenerate’; and those which
                            have no other sense possess it so exquisitely that some of them seem
                            even to <hi rend="italic">feel the light.</hi><note anchored="true"

                        <p>Among insects the sense of touch varies remarkably according to the
                            condition in which they happen to exist for the time,—their exterior
                            surface, in which the function exists, or at least through which it must
                            be manifested, being itself subject to great variation, even among
                            individuals of the same species. When soft, as in the larva state, the
                            skin is extremely delicate in its perceptions, and capable of
                            transmitting the most lively sensations; while in the imago or perfect
                            condition, more especially among the Coleoptera, its harder consistence
                            renders it chiefly serviceable as a protecting covering. In this case
                            the feet, palpi, and, as many suppose, the antennae, seem the principal
                            organs of the sense of touch.</p>
                        <p>The sense of <hi rend="italic">taste,</hi> which some regard as an
                            exalted modification of the perception of touch, is very obvious among
                            insects. We see many species, while searching after food, reject or only
                            partially consume whatever is disagreeable or unexpected, while they
                            gloat over a more favourite morsel. The organ in which the sense is
                            placed is not, however, so easily determined. Some regard the palpi, and
                            others the pharynx, as its principal seat. That portion of the labium
                            which the French naturalists name the languette or ligula, has also been
                            regarded as exercising the sense of taste. It is certain that distinct
                            nerves are distributed to that quarter, as represented by Lyonnet in his
                            great work on the caterpillar of the cossus.</p>
                        <p>The sense of <hi rend="italic">smell</hi> is exquisitely developed in the
                            insect tribes. No sooner has an animal fallen, from age or sickness,
                            even on the loneliest and most barren moor, wlrere perhaps no vestige of
                            insect life was previously perceptible, than troops of flies and
                            carcass-eating beetles assemble from every quarter, led by the emanation
                            of the tainted air.</p>
                        <p>It was in truth the influence of the sense of smell that in ancient times
                            no doubt gave rise to so many erroneous ideas regarding the origin of
                            insect life. Every animal body in a state of decay being seen to present
                            a crowd of small larvae or worms, these were regarded as the <hi
                            rend="italic">produce</hi> of corruption, whereas they resulted
                            naturally, and according to the usual course, from eggs previously
                            deposited by parent flies or beetles, which had been attracted by the
                            putrid effluvia. It is not two hundred years since Redi proved for the
                            first time, by conclusive experiments, that this was true. It is also
                            known that bees will discover and hover around a box containing honey,
                            though their prized treasure is screened from sight; and both flies and
                            beetles are so affected by the perceptions of this sense, that even
                            their peculiar and all but unerring instincts are occasionally deceived
                            by its influence. They will deposit their eggs on plants which are
                            characterized by a foetid smell (for example, on the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Phallus</hi><hi rend="italic">impudicus),</hi> misled by the
                            resemblance of their flesh-like odour, which the experience of the sense
                            of sight cannot rectify.</p>
                        <p>The scent of many flowers is cadaverous, and is thus the means of
                            assembling around their deceptive petals numerous insects which feed on
                            putrid matter. It is thus that the spathes of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Arum</hi><hi rend="italic">dracunculus,</hi> and the corolla of the <hi
                            rend="italic">Stapelia</hi><hi rend="italic">variegata,</hi> are
                            frequently found covered by Silphae, flesh-flies, and other species,
                            which not only attempt to feed upon them, but also deposit their eggs in
                            what they conceive to be a fitting station. But the seat of this
                            indispensable faculty is likewise still involved in obscurity. On a
                            subject so difficult of solution, and which can only be solved by a
                            consummate knowledge of anatomical structure, viewed in relation to the
                            uses of physiology, it would not become us to offer an opinion, or do
                            more than report the sentiments of those who are necessarily more
                            experienced than ourselves. Many agree with Dumeril in maintaining that
                            in insects the sense of smell is effected, as among the higher animals,
                            through media in very intimate connection with the process of
                            respiration; in other words, that either the <hi rend="italic"
                            >tracheoe</hi> or stigmatic openings are the seat of its exercise.
                            Others again suppose, that for the exercise of so important a function,
                            a more special and concentrated organ is required; and proceeding upon
                            the analogical relation of mere position, they regard the antennae as
                            its seat. These receive the first pair of nerves, and so far correspond
                            to the olfactory organs of the higher animals, which are likewise
                            connected with the brain by means of the first pair. The question is one
                            which is extremely difficult of determination, especially in reference
                            to the singular experiments of Huber on bees, which <hi rend="italic"

                            hymenopterous species, is placed in the cavity of the mouth.</p>
                        <p>Christian maintained that insects exercised the sense of smell in
                            relation to distant objects through their antennae, and in regard to
                            near ones by means of their palpi; while Comparetti imagines that in the
                            different tribes of insects different instruments are subservient to
                            that end. Cuvier, at least in his earlier works (and we are not aware of
                            any recorded change in his sentiments) favoured the opinion aheady
                            alluded to regarding the respiratory organs. “As the organ of smell,” he
                            observes, “in all animals which respire air, is situated at the entrance
                            of the organs of respiration, the most probable conjecture that has been
                            proposed<pb break="no" facs="nls:193746285" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6285-0079"

                            several naturalists, who placed it in the mouths of the tracheae or
                            air-tubes. In addition to the reasons hitherto stated in support of this
                            opinion, we may observe that the internal membrane of the tracheae
                            appears very well calculated to perform this office, being soft and
                            moistened, and that the insects in which the tracheae enlarge, and form
                            numerous or considerable vesicles, are those which seem to possess the
                            most perfect sense of smell. Such are the Scarabaei, flies, bees,
                            &amp;c. The antennae, which other anatomists have supposed to be the
                            seat of smell in nsects, do not appear to us to possess any of the
                            conditions for that organ.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        <p>Huber’s experiments, undertaken with a view to ascertain the seat of
                            smell in bees, consisted in presenting successively to all parts of
                            their bodies a hair pencil dipt in oil of turpentine, an article which
                            they particularly abominate. When made to approximate the head, trunk,
                            or abdomen, it produced no particular effect, and the odour appeared to
                            be equally disregarded by the antennae and proboscis. But when he
                            brought the point of a fine hair pencil saturated in the oil almost into
                            contact with the cavity of the mouth, above the insertion of the
                            proboscis, the bee started back in an instant, quitted its food, clapped
                            its wings, and would have taken immediate flight had not the pencil been
                            removed. A repetition of the experiment produced the same signs of
                            discomposure; and similar results, but more prompt and sure, follov∙ed
                            the use of oil of marjoram. The indefatigable Genevese observer then
                            stopt up the mouths of several bees with paste, which soon became
                            comparatively hard and dry. In this state they were quite insensible to
                            those odours which had previously produced such painful effects.<note

                        <p>Mr Kirby maintains an opinion different from any we have yet alluded to,
                            though more allied to the last than to the others. As the nose of an
                            insect evidently corresponds with the part so named in the Mammalia, not
                            only in its situation, but frequently in its form, and as a constant
                            connection may be observed to obtain between the senses of smell and
                            taste, he felt convinced in the first place that the argument from
                            analogy was wholly in favour of the nose, or anterior portion of the
                            head formerly mentioned under that name. The common burying beetle <hi
                            rend="italic">(Necrophorus</hi><hi rend="italic">vespillo'}</hi> is an
                            insect remarkable for its extreme accuracy and acuteness of smell. While
                            examining the nose of this nsect, Mr Kirby observed in the middle of its
                            anterior part a subtrapezoidal space, as it were cut out and filled with
                            a paler piece of a softer and more membranous texture. On dividing the
                            head horizontally, he perceived beneath the nose, and partly under the
                            space just mentioned, which he calls the <hi rend="italic"
                            >rhinarium</hi> or nostril piece, a pair of circular pulpy cushions,
                            covered by a membrane transversely striated with beautifully fine lines.
                            These are what our learned author regards as the organs of smell, and he
                            noted that they remained distinctly visible in a specimen which he had
                            had by him for more than fifteen years.<note anchored="true"

                            >Hearing</hi> is perceptibly acute in some insects, and of more doubtful
                            existence in others. The frequent and various sounds to which many
                            species give utterance have been adduced in proof of their being endowed
                            with this· perception; for we cannot but suppose that the shrill voice
                            of the grasshopper, and the evening song of the cricket, are subservient
                            to some essential end, which they cannot well be if unheard by their
                            blythe companions. The small wood-devouring beetle called the death-tick
                            <hi rend="italic">(Anobium),</hi> answers its neighbour’s call as
                            regularly as a cock crows a response to its pugnacious rival; and
                            Derham, when he kept these insects in captivity, by imitating their tiny
                            call, could make them click when he pleased. What, is called the voice
                            in insects is usually produced by the friction of certain hard and horny
                            parts of the limbs upon some other portion of the body of a like
                            consistence. In others it is effected by a rapid vibration of the wings;
                            and a few beetles seem to give utterance to a shrill and sometimes
                            plaintive cry by rubbing the terminal segments of the abdomen against
                            the curved points of the elytra. This power of voice, as we call it for
                            want of a better name, is often possessed by the males alone; and as it
                            is used as a call of love in spring and summer (most obviously so among
                            the C cadae), we infer the sense of hearing in the females of that
                            family, and consequently in the class of insects.</p>
                        <p>Brunelli kept some large green grasshoppers <hi rend="italic">(Aerida
                            vi-ridissim(i)</hi> in confinement. They used to sing all day in a
                            closet, but ceased when any one gave a rap upon the door. He learned by
                            degrees to imitate their chirping call. At first a few of the boldest
                            would answer him, and then gradually the whole band would strike in and
                            sing with all their might. On one occasion he inclosed a male in his
                            garden, and gave the female her liberty; but no sooner did the husband
                            begin to solace his captivity with a song than his quondam partner
                            recognised the accustomed voice, and flew towards him without
                            delay.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lehmann,

                            makes the following curious observation. “Since there is nothing in the
                            constitution of the atmosphere to prevent vibrations much more frequent
                            than any of which we are conscious, we may imagine that animals like the
                            <hi rend="italic">Grylli,</hi> whose powers appear to commence nearly
                            where ours terminate, may have the faculty of hearing still sharper
                            sounds, which at present we do not know to exist; and that there may be
                            other insects, hearing nothing in common with us, but endued with a
                            power of exciting, and a sense that perceives, vibrations indeed of the
                            same nature as those which constitute our ordinary sounds, but so remote
                            that the animals who perceive them may be said to possess another sense,
                            agreeing with ours solely in the medium by which it is excited, and
                            possibly wholly unaffected by those slower vibrations of which we are
                            sensible.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                        <p>The precise position, however, of the organ of hearing in insects has not
                            been determined with precision. In the Crustacea it is found at the base
                            of the large antennae; and Latreille has satisfied himself of its
                            existence in a similar situation in an orthopterous insect called <hi
                            rend="italic">Gryllus lineola.</hi> Mr Kirby is of opinion that the <hi
                            rend="italic">primary</hi> use of the antennae is to exercise a function
                            analogous to that of hearing, and Mr Rennie entertains a similar
                            sentiment.</p>
                        <p>The sense of <hi rend="italic">sight</hi> is too obvious in this class to
                            require demonstration. The eyes of insects are, however, of a very
                            different nature and construction from the exquisitely formed visual
                            organs of the higher tribes. They consist of two kinds, the <hi

                        <p>The composite eyes generally form, as it were, the lateral portions of
                            the head. They are either entire, notched, or even occasionally so
                            completely divided by a little corneous stalk, as to exhibit (for
                            example in the genus <hi rend="italic">Gyrinus)</hi> the appearance of a
                            pair on either side. In other respects theiι forms are extremely
                            variable—their surfaces more 01 less convex. These compound eyes are
                            composed externally of a hard and transparent membrane (softer in the
                            dipterous tribes), which presents an infinity of small hexagonal
                            surfaces, disposed with the most exquisite regularity. This peculiar
                            structure prevails equally on the concave or inter-nal, as on the convex
                            or external surface. The structure and composition of the eyes of
                            insects have been carefully studied and explained by Lecuwenhoeck,
                            Swammerdam, Cuvier, and more lately and laboriously by Marcel de Serres.

                            thickish, generally encased in a groove of the head, and exhibiting many
                            thousand regularly disposed, hexagonal facettes, each of which is in
                            itself a perfect eye. These are sometimes so numerous that not fewer
                            than 34,650 lenses have been counted in the head of a butterfly, and the
                            coleopterous genus <hi rend="italic">Dynastes</hi> of Macleay is
                            supposed to be still more wonderfully and exuberantly supplied. 2d, An
                            opaque, slightly liquid matter, variously coloured, frequently deep
                            violet or black, but sometimes red or green, tenaciously adherent to the
                            inner face of the cornea, and distinct from the deep-black varnish of
                            the choroid. It is by no means rare to observe various colours united in
                            the same eye, which then appears beautifully mottled, as in many species
                            of the orthopterous, neuropterous, and dipterous orders. These tints,
                            however brilliant in the living state, speedily vanish after death. They
                            are always owing to this peculiar coating of the cornea. 3<hi
                            rend="italic">d</hi>, A true choroid, covered by a dark varnish, which
                            may be regarded as a <hi rend="italic">pigmentum nigrum.</hi> The
                            lynx-eyed Swammerdam failed to distinguish this coating from that of the
                            cornea; but, in the opinion of Marcel de Serres, it is really different.
                            The choroid and its pigment do not always exist in insects. They are
                            wanting in the <hi rend="italic">Blattae,</hi> and in all the lucifugous
                            or light shunning species, such as those of the genera <hi rend="italic"

                            >Pedinus.</hi> In these cases, it has been remarked that the covering of
                            the cornea is much deeper than usual. The choroid membrane is fixed by
                            its circumference to all the margin of the cornea, of which it follows
                            the contour, and is intimately connected with the tracheae, which are
                            there so numerous, <hi rend="italic">⅛th,</hi> Air vessels which play an
                            important part. They take their rise from larger trunks which are
                            situated in the head, and form around the eye a circular trachea, which
                            sends forth an infinity of branches, producing by bifurcation a number
                            of isosceles triangles. These triangles, of which the base is outwards,
                            are placed around the optic cone, and receive, in each angular interval
                            which separates their summits, a nervous filament, which traverses the
                            choroid, and reaches the external surface of the covering of the cornea.
                            Ί he assemblage of tracheae and nervous threads forms at the
                            circumference of the eye a peculiar kind of network, of which the aspect
                            is beautiful to look upon. The tracheae themselves are so abundant on
                            the choioid, that that membrane appears to be composed of them; and it
                            may also be noted, that in those genera in which the choroid is wanting,
                            the circular trachea is likewise absent.<note anchored="true"

                            and forms a kind of cone more or less extended, of which the base is
                            towards the transparent cornea. Numerous nérves proceed from that base,
                            mingle with the tracheae of the choroid, traverse both that membrane and
                            its pigment, penetrate the lining of the cornea, and finally terminate

                            them after having traversed only the last-named organ. This disposition

                            the nerves are placed deeper in the eye, and do not receive the rays of
                            light till these have passed through media of different densities.</p>
                        <p>The simple or <hi rend="italic">stemmatic eyes</hi> of insects are
                            usually three in number, and are placed on the crown of the head,
                            between the genuine organs of sight, from which their structure differs.
                            In spite of their extreme minuteness, Marcel de Serres has succeeded in
                            detecting the following component parts. ∙1sr, A transparent cornea,
                            formed by an external membrane, hard, convex externally, and smooth,
                            that is, exhibiting no appearance of facettes. 2r∕, Of a
                            variously-coloured matter, which lines the internal face of the cornea,
                            but which is perhaps not essentially distinct from the varnish of the
                            choroid. It varies in colour, being almost always black in Hymenoptera,
                            usually whitish in Orthoptera, and, in many caterpillars, yellow, red,
                            or green. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, A kind of choroid, rather thick,
                            more extended on the surface than the cornea itself, sometimes of a
                            black colour, more frequently red, and occasionally of a peculiar
                            whitish hue. <hi rend="italic">⅛th,</hi> Tracheae, which do not derive
                            their origin from a circular air vessel, and do not, as it were,
                            constitute the choroid, but appear to be distributed over its surface.
                            <hi rend="italic">5th,</hi> Nerves proceeding either directly from the
                            brain or upper ganglion, or from another more considerable nerve or
                            common trunk, according as these simple eyes are separate from each
                            other, as in perfect insects, or closely approached, as among larvae. In
                            their passage towards the eyes they are attached to the neighbouring
                            parts by tracheae or air vesicles, and do not appear to present any
                            swelling; they pass between the motive muscles of the different parts of
                            the head, traverse the choroid and its varnish, and expand upon the
                            internal face of the cornea, where they are surrounded by the layer of
                            pigment belonging to that membrane. Thus, on examining the simple or
                            stemmatic eyes of insects, and proceeding írom the circumference to the
                            centre, we meet with a transparent cornea,—a pigment, which lines its
                            inner face,—∙ the termination of the optic nerves,—the pigment of the
                            choroid, when distinct from that of the cornea,—and the choroid itself,
                            which frequently rests upon a large trachea. The principal character of
                            these simple eyes consists in this, that each is a single organ, whereas
                            the composite eyes, as the name implies, are formed by the union of
                            many. 1he one kind is most characteristic of the larva state, the other
                            of the perfect insect; but several orders, even in the last-mentioned
                            condition, possess both organs.</p>

                        <p>Thus, with few exceptions, the Orthoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera,
                            Neuroptera, and Diptera, possess both simple and compound eyes. Dr Carus
                            however states that the stemmata do not exist either in beetles or
                            butterflies; a most erroneous opinion in regard to the latter, in which
                            they exist universally, although not always detected; and incorrect as
                            to the former, in several of which they have been distinctly seen. They

                            science, gave any explanation of the uses of the stemmata, there can be
                            no doubt that Swammerdam and Réaumur were correct in regarding them as
                            genuine eyes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                            writer supposes that the compound organs have the power of magnifying,

                            possess little of that power, and are employed on objects close at hand.
                            Blumenbach is also of opinion that the polyhedral eyes are for viewing
                            distant objects, and the simple ones for such as are near.<note

                            in some measure confirmed by the fact, that while most insects in the
                            perfect state have large compound eyes, caterpillars and other larvae
                            have usually small myopic ones. On the other hand, the Mole cricket (<hi
                            rend="italic">Grfilotalpa),</hi> a truly subterranean species, is
                            furnished with both kinds. Réaumur’s experiments on the visual organs of
                            bees are extremely important in relation to our present subject. He
                            smeared the compound eyes with paint, when the insects, instead of
                            directing their flight towards the hive, ascended in the air till they
                            were lost to sight. He then treated the stemmatic cyes in the same
                            manner, and placing his patients near their hive, they winged their way
                            on all sides among the surrounding flowers, but neither ascended into
                            the air, nor flew far from home. From these experiments it has been
                            supposed that the compound eyes are for horizontal sight, and the
                            stemmatic for vertical.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            insects.</hi></p>
                        <p>Though insects respire air, they do not receive it, like the majority of
                            vertebrated animals, through nostrils or other orifices in the head, but
                            by means of numerous small openings along the sides of the body, and
                            which lead not to lungs, but to a system of air vessels ramified <hi
                            rend="italic">ad infinitum</hi> through every part of the body. The
                            respiratory organs of this class are composed of <hi rend="italic"
                            >stigmata, tracheae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bronchiae.</hi> The
                            first, called also spiracles or breathing pores, consist of small
                            perforations of various forms, placed along the lateral portions of the
                            body, and generally incased externally in a small corneous ring, though
                            sometimes pierced in the membrane which separates the dorsal from the
                            ventral surface. These stigmatic openings occur both on the thorax and
                            abdomen, and lead inwards to the tracheae. Their number varies according
                            to the species, and even in the same species according to the temporary
                            condition of the individual. They are wanting on the second and third
                            segments of the body of the larva; and as it is from these segments that
                            the wings are developed, Μ. de Blainville has been induced, probably by
                            that circumstance, to regard the organs of flight as reversed and
                            expanded tracheae. The existence, however, of stigmatic openings on the
                            thorax of the perfect insect simultaneously with the wings, militates
                            against this theory; for if these parts were convertible, would they not
                            be likewise each exclusive of the other ?</p>
                        <p>Parallel with the sides of the body of most insects, and extending its
                            whole length, run two cylindrical tubes, which communicate with the
                            spiracles, and give issue, at points opposite to those organs, to other
                            tubes, the ramifications of which are distributed over all the
                            membranes, penetrate the muscles, and pervade even the legs and wings.
                            They also envelope the dorsal vessel and digestive organs, and
                            demonstrate that the ultimate aim of respiration is assimilation, or the
                            increase and reproduction of organic molecules, by the decomposition of
                            food. The first of these tubes are called the tracheae, the latter the
                            bronchiae. This structure, however, cannot be regarded as universal, as
                            in many of the lamellicorn beetles the bronchiae spring directly from
                            the spiracles, the interior mouth of which is lined by a membrane from
                            which they proceed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                            But a volume would scarcely suffice to describe the beautifully varied
                            features of the respiratory system in insects. Among those tribes
                            especially which pass their early stages under water, the changes in
                            form and position in these organs cannot be sufficiently admired.
                            Several common species of gnat, the larvae of which abound during the
                            summer season in all our ponds and marshes, will afford a familiar
                            illustration. When one of these is examined, a singular tunnel-shaped
                            organ, terminating in a radiated point like a star, will be perceived,
                            forming an angle with the penultimate segment of the body. In the
                            interior of this organ is a tube, which conveys the air to the tracheae,
                            and communicates with the atmosphere by means of several perforations in
                            the centre of the star. The diverging rays of the star suspend the
                            animal at the surface of the water, with its head downwards, till it
                            wishes to descend. It has no sooner assumed the pupa state, than the
                            respiratory tail disappears, and the insect (still an inhabitant of the
                            water) then breathes through two projecting horns, each resembling a
                            little cornucopia, which proceed from the upper part of the trunk. Ere
                            long the skin of the pupa bursts asunder, and the perfect gnat, or
                            winged insect, makes its appearance, with neither caudal nor thoracic
                            appendages, but breathing by means of numerous lateral pores (the
                            stigmata above mentioned), after the usual manner. The <hi rend="italic"
                            >rat-tailed worm</hi> in this respect is still more extraordinary. In
                            the larva state it breathes through a tail formed of retractile tubes,
                            like a telescope, and capable of being extended many times the length of
                            the body. This also terminates in a star-like process, which, when
                            viewed in a strong light, forms a perceptible dimple on the surface of
                            the water; and as the body of the insect lies in the mud below, the tail
                            is contracted or extended according to the varying depth of its stagnant
                            habitation. On assuming the pupa state, in which it is no longer an
                            aquatic animal, the respiratory tail is cast off, and its function
                            performed by four horns, which spring from the upper part of the thorax.
                            It afterwards becomes one of those bee-like flies so remarkable for the
                            rapid vibratory movement of their <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746324"
                            xml:id="kp-eb0709-6324-0082"/> wings, by which, during calm sunshine,
                            they are often seen suspended in the air like hawks, without any
                            perceptible motion. In this last stage respiration is carried on by
                            spiracles or breathing-pores.</p>

                            circulating system, of insects.</hi></p>
                        <p>We shall next endeavour to explain the construction and physiological
                            uses of the organ known by the name of <hi rend="italic">dorsal
                            vessel.</hi></p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">primary</hi> use of the heart of animals is the
                            elaboration of the nutritive fluid by which the general system is
                            strengthened and sustained; its <hi rend="italic">secondary</hi> use is
                            to effect the circulation of that fluid, a process by which important
                            changes are produced in its nature or attributes. The dorsal vessel,
                            which corresponds to the heart in insects, certainly effects the primary
                            purpose; its performance of the secondary one is, as we shall see, a
                            matter of greater dubicty.</p>
                        <p>When an insect is dissected with due precaution from its inferior
                            surface, and we remove the nervous system, which first presents itself,
                            and then the intestines and other viscera, we shall observe running
                            along the back, a peculiar vessel, of which the most obvious powers are
                            those of contraction and dilatation. It is of a cylindrical form,
                            narrowed at either end, and extends from the head to the anal extremity.
                            This constitutes the <hi rend="italic">heart,</hi> frequently so called,
                            of the class of insects. A closer examination shows that it is composed
                            of two membranes, one internal and muscular, the other external and
                            cellular, and pervaded by a close interlacement of tracheae or
                            air-vessels. When opened, its interior presents a transparent coagulable
                            liquid, which dries rapidly, and then exhibits the aspect of gum, of a
                            colour seldom deeply defined, but sometimes greenish, orange yellow, or
                            sombre brown. Masses of fat frequently surround this vessel, and partake
                            of the tint by which it is pervaded. If, as Marcel de Serres has noted,
                            the <hi rend="italic">dorsal vessel</hi> (for so this organ is often
                            named) were a genuine heart, or centre of a circulating system, it would
                            be necessarily open at one or other of its extremities, and would
                            present vascular ramifications in certain points of its extent. But,
                            according to the minute and laborious investigations of the last-named
                            author, no such openings arc observable. The same view was taken by
                            Swammerdam; and Lyonnet, so unrivalled in his examination of the
                            structure of insects, was foiled in his attempts to demonstrate -the
                            ramifications of the dorsal vessel. Comparetti no doubt took another
                            view of the subject; and if the assurance of his readers was equal to
                            his own, less suspicion would exist of the possibility of his having
                            mistaken biliary for sanguineous vessels.</p>
                        <p>Anatomists, however, are greatly divided in opinion regarding the
                            essential nature of this organ. It has been dissected and injected by
                            Marcel de Serres in a variety of species; but in none could he discover
                            its divisions or ramifications. Even when he removed it entirely from
                            the insect, no drop of the liquid which it contained was observed to
                            escape, which he thinks it must have done on the cutting away of open
                            vessels during dissection, had - these existed. The <hi rend="italic"
                            >beating</hi> of this dorsal vessel was not explicable, otherwise than
                            by the contraction of its tissue, or the movement of the fluid which it
                            contained; and such movement was not itself conceivable except in the
                            case of circulation, which the alleged closure and non-division of the
                            organ forbade us to suppose. Its contractions also appeared irregular,
                            and scarcely ever isochronic; that is, the same number of pulsations, if
                            they may be so called, did not take place in an equal time. They varied
                            singularly in different species. Thirty-six per minute were counted in
                            the caterpillar of the <hi rend="italic">Pavonia Major,</hi> eighty-two
                            at least in grasshoppers, and a hundred and forty in one of the ground
                            bees. While endeavouring to discover the cause of these contractions,
                            Marcel de Serres came to the conclusion that they bore a relation, 1≠ to
                            the quantity of adipose tissue by which they were surrounded; 2√Zy, to
                            the energy of the muscular fibres which were inserted on the vessel, and
                            were the means of fixing it to the rings of the abdomen; 3√Zy, to the
                            number of tracheae or air conduits by which it was supplied. He was not
                            of opinion that the nerves exercised any strongly marked influence on
                            these contractions, although we know that special nerves arc directed to
                            the dorsal vessel. The fact, however, which he deemed the most clearly
                            established, was the influential action of the muscles. When any of
                            these were removed, the pulsations became less frequent,—on a farther
                            removal they still diminished; and when the muscles were almost all
                            withdrawn, the pulsations ceased. The appropriate function of this
                            disputed organ, according to the last-named author, is the secretion of
                            fat. Baron Cuvier also denies to it the character of a genuine
                            heart.</p>
                        <p>Meckel and Herold, on the other hand, regard the dorsal vessel as a
                            heart, and they conceive that the use of its movement is to agitate the
                            fluid contained in the cavity of the insect’s body; but they do not
                            admit the existence of posterior or anterior openings for the reception
                            or rejection of that fluid. It is long since Lyonnet informed us that it
                            contained a gummy matter of an orange colour; and some recent
                            observations have led Latreille to admit the existence of certain very
                            minute accessory vessels. In addition, however, to the fact that this
                            circulation must be extremely partial, insects would still greatly
                            differ in that respect from the Crustacea, inasmuch as the blood does
                            not return to the heart. Herold is of opinion that the triangular
                            muscles of the dorsal vessel serve for its dilatation, while the systole
                            movements are effected by the muscular fibres, which form the proper
                            tunic. Straus is also of opinion that the dorsal vessel is the true
                            heart in the class of insects, and that it serves, as in the higher
                            animals, as the motive organ of the blood, which, however, instead of
                            being contained in vessels, permeates in the general cavity of the body.
                            According to his views, it terminates anteriorly by a single unramified
                            artery, which conveys the blood to the head, where it pours it out, and
                            from whence it returns again to the abdomen, to re-enter the dorsal
                            vessel. He thus limits the circulating system of insects to a single
                            artery without branches (there are not any veins); and he combats the
                            sentiments of Herold regarding the muscular nature of the wings of the
                            heart, which, he maintains, are only simple fibrous ligaments, by which
                            it is maintained in its proper place. The heart itself, that is, the
                            abdominal portion of the vessel, he describes as divided interiorly into
                            eight successive chambers (as in the common cockchafer, <hi
                            rend="italic">Melolontha vulgaris),</hi> separated from each other by
                            two convergent valvules, which permit the transmission of the blood or
                            circulating fluid from behind forwards, and from one chamber to another,
                            up to the artery which conducts it to the head, but prevent its
                            retrograde motion. Towards the lateral and anterior portion of each
                            chamber arc two transverse fissures, which communicate with the
                            abdominal cavity, and through which the blood contained in the latter
                            enters the heart. Each of these apertures is provided internally with a
                            little semicircular valve, which presses on it during the systole of the
                            organ. When the posterior chamber dilates, the fluid contained in the
                            abdominal cavity penetrates into it by the transverse fissures, called
                            <hi rend="italic">auriculo-ventriculaires</hi> by Μ. Straus. When the
                            chamber contracts, the blood, unable to return into the abdominal
                            cavity, forces the ŵZer-ventricular valve, and passes into the second
                            chamber, which dilates to receive it, <pb break="no"
                            facs="nls:193746337" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6337-0083"/> along with an
                            additional quantity which enters by the true • auriculo-ventricular
                            openings. The second chamber then contracts in a similar manner, and
                            forces the fluid into the third, which at the same time also receives a
                            supply from the lateral openings; and thus the blood is forced from one
                            chamber to another by successive contractions, till it reaches the
                            artery. These are said to constitute the movements so distinctly
                            perceptible through the dorsal skin of many caterpillars.</p>
                        <p>Mr Bowerbank has recently published some observations on the circulation
                            of the blood in insects.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                            type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Entomological Magazine,</hi> No.
                            III. p∙ 239.</p></note> The instance detailed was that of the larva of
                            an Ephemera <hi rend="italic">{E.</hi><hi rend="italic">marginata).</hi>
                            In fixing the insect for examination (under water), especial care must
                            be taken not to compress the body, which impedes or interrupts the
                            circulation of the lateral vessels, and that of the tail, legs, and
                            antennae. When the larva is fixed, with its dorsal aspect towards the
                            observer, a truly beautiful sight is said to present itself. The blood,
                            abounding in flattened oat-shaped particles, will be seen circulating in
                            every part of the body, not in a continuous stream, but at regular
                            points, in accordance with the pulsations of the great dorsal vessel.
                            The latter, which is of great comparative magnitude, extends nearly the
                            whole length of the body, and is furnished at regular intervals with
                            double valves, nearly equal in amount to the segments of the body. Both
                            above and below each of these sets of valves there is a pair of
                            irregular-looking appendages, which are probably nervous ganglions,
                            auxiliary to the motions of the vessel, but so extremely translucent as
                            to be scarcely definable in their form, even through the medium of the
                            highest power which we can apply. The action of the valves is singularly
                            interesting. While in their greatest state of collapse, the point of the
                            lower valve is seen closely compressed within the upper one. At the
                            commencement of the expansion of the artery, the blood is seen flowing
                            in from the lateral aperture, and at the same time the stream in the
                            artery commences its ascent. When it has nearly attained its greatest
                            state of expansion, the sides of the lower valve are forced upwards by
                            the increased flow of the blood from the section below the valve, the
                            lateral openings are closed, and the main current of the blood is
                            projected through the two valves. The structure of the upper valve
                            appears to consist of a duplication inwards and upwards of the inner
                            coat of the artery; that of the under, of a contraction and projection
                            of the like parts of a portion of the artery beneath, so as to come
                            within the grasp of the lower part of the valve above it. The exterior
                            portion or continuation of the artery is perceptible in the form of an
                            exceedingly fine and transparent membrane. The so-called blood does not
                            appear to be confined within any specific vessels prior to its entering
                            the lateral openings just mentioned, because, as soon as they expand,
                            the particles are seen converging towards them. The whole of the fluid
                            received throughout the course of the dorsal vessel is conveyed to the
                            extremity of the anterior part of the body, where the vessel makes a
                            curve inwards, and is lost to view. To all appearance the main current
                            of the blood is now discharged into the cavity of the body, as it is
                            seen pursuing its course downwards in a wide-spreading stream on each
                            side, and beneath the dorsal vessel. As it descends, portions are again
                            absorbed by the valves of the large vessel, while at the same time
                            smaller vessels pass down each side of the body, and convey another
                            portion of blood to the lower extremity. These lesser vessels have
                            perceptible boundaries, and are certainly not portions of the great
                            abdominal cavity. They communicate at each junction of the segments of
                            the body with that cavity, as a part of the fluid they convey is
                            discharged at those points, to supply the place of what is absorbed by
                            the valves of the dorsal vessel, into the lower end of which they empty
                            their contents. In the caudal extremity the ascending and descending
                            vessels are seen, like vein and artery, to accompany each other, and at
                            the same moment that the fluid passes up the one with the usual
                            pulsatory motion, it descends the other. There is, however, no
                            perceptible pulsation of these minuter vessels themselves, and the
                            motion of their fluids therefore results from the action of the great
                            dorsal heart.</p>
                        <p>“Next to the larvae of the Ephemera marginata,” Mr Bowerbank observes,
                            “the larvae of Agrion afford the best view of the blood and its
                            circulation. In all the species of these larvae I have yet examined, I
                            have found it as nearly similar as possible in appearance to that which
                            we observe in the Ephemera, and in some instances it has afforded even
                            more satisfactory results. The head of this larva is much more
                            transparent than that of the larva of the Ephemera; we therefore have a
                            better view of the circulation of the blood in the head of this insect
                            than can possibly be obtained in the other. In this object the blood is
                            seen rushing like a beautiful intermittent fountain towards the mouth,
                            and dividing right and left into two jets, a portion of each of which
                            flows within a given boundary past the back of the eye, whilst the
                            remainder winds its way through other channels, deep in the side of the
                            head, and returns again into the body. The antennae of this insect also
                            afford another beautiful instance of the circulation being carried
                            forward within well-defined vessels. They are each composed of six
                            joints, up four of which the blood is seen to take its course; and
                            turning round the extremity of the fourth joint, it returns by a
                            distinct vessel into the head. In the leg, likewise, the circulating
                            fluid and its vessels are clearly and distinctly to be traced, even to
                            the very extremity of the tarsus, where, as in the antennae, the
                            particles of the blood are seen to descend on the one side of the leg,
                            and, turning the extreme point, to return up the contrary side to the
                            one by which they come down. I regret much that I have not yet had an
                            opportunity of examining the Ephemera in its perfect state; but in two
                            species of Culex, one of which was first observed and brought to me by
                            my friend Mr Tulley, I have seen the great dorsal vessel performing its
                            functions in a manner similar in every respect to its appearance in the
                            larvae of Ephemera, Agrion, &amp;c. &amp;c.; but, from the body of the
                            fly being more opaque than that of the larvae, and nearly covered with
                            its striated scales, neither the valves nor the particles of the blood
                            could be detected. On another occasion, after having carefully cleared
                            the wings of Phlogophora meticulosa of their coloured scales, both Mr
                            Samouelle and myself clearly saw a fluid pass down the side of one of
                            the principal ribs of the wing. We may therefore, I think, fairly
                            conclude, that the circulation is carried forward in the perfect insect
                            as well as in the larva, although, perhaps, not with so much vigour as
                            when young and growing.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        <p>The writer whose observations we have just quoted, inclines to the
                            opinion that a much greater portion of the circulation than we can
                            clearly define is carried on within special vessels, as the blood may be
                            frequently seen flowing in curved and other lines, as if confined within
                            very narrow limits. These streams, however, are generally so deeply
                            seated amidst the muscles and intestines as totally to prevent their
                            boundaries from being clearly seen. The blood itself is in fact a
                            perfectly colourless and transparent fluid, rendered visible only by its
                            containing a number of oat-shaped particles; and even the great dorsal

                            exhibits defined limits with certainty only when in motion. A singular
                            coincidence is observable between the flattened particles of the blood
                            of insects, and the circular double concave plates in that of man,
                            namely, that the former, in common with the latter, assume a globular
                            form immediately on coming into contact with water.<note anchored="true"

                        <p>The reader will be able to judge, from the preceding notices, of the
                            diversified opinions still entertained regarding the circulation of the
                            blood in insects. We shall conclude with a short account of Dr Carus’s
                            observations, which many consider as the first of a satisfactory and
                            conclusive nature on the subject. Mr Spence, the accomplished coadjutor
                            of Mr Kirby, having had the advantage, at a pretty recent period, of
                            witnessing some of the most striking facts on which the Dresden
                            physician rests his views, transmitted an account of them to an English
                            periodical. “The first insect,” he observes, “to which Dr Carus directed
                            my attention was the larva of <hi rend="italic">Ephemera</hi><hi
                            rend="italic">vulgata</hi> (or an allied species), in which, near to the
                            branchiae, and parallel with each side of the body, was very distinctly
                            visible a constant current, towards the tail, of oblong globules,
                            swimming in a transparent fluid, propelled with a regular pulsating
                            motion; and in cutting the body of the larva across, near the tail,
                            these globules were most plainly seen pushed out of the divided vessels
                            in a distinct mass, which increased at each pulsation. I cannot express
                            the pleasure which it gave me to see thus clearly this ocular
                            demonstration of one of the most important physiological discoveries of
                            modern times; and my gratification was heightened by the next object
                            which Dr Carus placed before his microscope, viz. a specimen of <hi
                            rend="italic">Semblis</hi><hi rend="italic">viridis,</hi> in which
                            precisely the same phenomena, but if possible more clearly, were seen in
                            the nervures of the wings, and in the antennae, in both which the
                            constant current of globules was most apparent; and in the former, the
                            sudden turning of these globules at the apex of the wing, out of the
                            exterior nervure, into a central one, with which it joins and forms an
                            acute angle, was equally curious and striking. On cutting off the end of
                            the antennae, precisely the same emission of globules (which soon assume
                            a greenish tint) took place as in the former case, forming a mass which
                            was increased with a sudden gush at each pulsation.”<note

                        <p>Insects are abundantly supplied with an adipose substance or fatty
                            matter, which may be mentioned in this place with the more propriety, as
                            many consider it a secretion from the dorsal vessel. It is spread over
                            the viscera and in the splanchnic cavities; and although its aspect
                            varies, it seems to consist essentially of membranous woofs, in some
                            cases divided in shreds, in others spread over the intestines and
                            against the sides of the abdomen, and containing pouches filled with a
                            homogeneous pulpy matter, sometimes in an oily condition, and offering
                            all the characters of grease. Much more of it is observable among larvae
                            than in perfect insects, and this observation leads us to a knowledge of
                            its use. It is particularly plentiful just before an insect is about to
                            undergo its metamorphosis; and as it almost entirely disappears on the
                            completion of those signal changes, we naturally conclude that it has
                            served in the production or development of the newly acquired organs.
                            This is rendered the more probable when we consider that, during the
                            intermediate or nympha state, the insect abstains from food, and is
                            therefore necessarily dependent on some internal reservoir. It is
                            analogous, in fact, to the store of fat which is known to pervade the
                            system of hybernating animals before they consign themselves to their
                            winter sleep.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the nutrition of insects, our opinions must be in a measure
                            regulated by the sentiments which we may adopt as to the functional uses
                            of the dorsal vessel. We need scarcely observe, that in all the higher
                            animals, and in most of the invertebrated tribes, nutrition is effected
                            through the medium of the blood, which, propelled by the heart,
                            circulates through, the entire system, and reaches every organ, after
                            having been submitted to the action of the air in lungs or gills. Cuvier
                            thinks it is carried on among insects by imbibition. The alimentary
                            canal elaborates a fluid which transudes through its coats, and flows
                            into the cavity of the body. There the various organs, such as the
                            muscles, the nerves, and many secreting vessels, absorb from that fluid
                            nutriment, whatever molecules are best adapted to their purposes. Those
                            who look upon the dorsal vessel as a true heart, which dispenses a
                            circulating fluid to the remotest ramifications of the wings and tarsi,
                            will place less confidence in this particular view. However, it is
                            certain that the secreting vessels are characterized by a structure
                            entirely appropriate to the functions which we have just assigned them,
                            their surface being obviously furnished with numerous pores or small
                            absorbent mouths.</p>

                        <p>The digestive system in insects naturally forms the next subject of
                            consideration. The earliest, most general, and perhaps the only
                            indispensable function of animal life, is that of nutrition. But its
                            materials are so different, and their modes of reception so various,
                            that the exercise of this function by no means necessitates the

                            rather complicated, and a great variety of parts are brought into
                            action. The more external portions, or those of the mouth, have been
                            already described. We shall therefore at present confine our
                            observations to the different portions of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >intestinal canal,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">biliary</hi> and <hi

                        <p>It is natural to suppose that, in a class so extensive and varied as that
                            with which we are now engaged, a corresponding diversity must exist in
                            the form, development, and number of the parts which constitute the
                            intestinal canal. It is always, however, so far tubular, and open at
                            either end; but in some it is straight and of the length of the body; in
                            others it is bent and longer than the body; while in many it is
                            tortuous, or twisted on itself in numerous convolutions, and
                            consequently of great extent. In general, its ength corresponds in a
                            certain measure with the nature <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746363"

                            vegetable matters having a longer, and such as feed on animal substances
                            a shorter canal. In some it is of equal diameter throughout; in others
                            the breadth of special portions varies; and there are many dilatations
                            and restrictions, known by various names. It even differs greatly in the
                            same species, according as the individual exists in the larva or imago
                            state.</p>
                        <p>The texture of the intestinal canal in insects is not the same in all
                            parts of its extent; but on a careful examination it is found to exhibit
                            throughout three tunics, more or less distinctly marked. Of these, the
                            first is external, with a membranous aspect; the second is of course
                            intermediate and muscular, with its fibres diversely directed; the third
                            is internal and mucous. In its more complicated state it exhibits the
                            following parts: 1s⅛ a <hi rend="italic">pharynx</hi><hi rend="italic"

                            intestines,</hi> which may be considered in subdivision as the small
                            intestines, the great intestine or caecum, and the rectum. The following
                            may be regarded as the usual process of transmission. The mouth, having
                            seized and chewed the food, transmits it to the pharynx, into which
                            salivary vessels sometimes open. It then passes into the oesophagus (of
                            which the muscular nature occasionally produces by its action a peculiar
                            impression), and is next transmitted to the crop, which converts it into
                            a homogeneous pulp. This is introduced into the gizzard, of which the
                            sides, being armed with teeth, complete its trituration. In the form of
                            a kind of paste it is now received by the chylific ventricle, where it
                            undergoes the action of the bile, is converted into chyle, and thus
                            supplies the nutritive fluid, which, passing through the coats of the
                            ventricle, spreads over the splanchnic cavity, and pervades the whole of
                            the organs. The residue is received by the small intestine, then by the
                            great intestine, in which it remains for some time, and finally by the
                            rectum.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">pharynx,</hi> which is sometimes rather difficult
                            to distinguish as a distinct feature, is placed at the bottom of the
                            mouth, and may be regarded as an anterior dilatation of the oesophagus.
                            Two pieces, very apparent in certain Hymenoptera, called the <hi
                            rend="italic">epipharynx</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                            >hypopharynx,</hi> seem to restrict and protect its entrance.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">oesophagus</hi> is a conduit varying in length,
                            which traverses the prothorax, and sometimes extends beyond it; but it
                            is occasionally so short as scarcely to pass beyond the region of the
                            head. Its structure is musculo-membranous, and it opens into the crop,
                            or, if that part is wanting, into the gizzard, or, if the latter is also
                            absent, into the chylific ventricle. It is around the origin of the
                            oesophagus that the nervous system, as formerly described, constitutes a
                            ring, by sending forth two branches which unite on the inferior face of
                            the body.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">crop,</hi> which is by some called the stomach, is
                            essentially nothing more than a dilatation of the oesophagus. It is
                            often difficult to detect, is sometimes entirely wanting, and may be
                            observed to vary greatly even in two individuals of the same species.
                            Exteriorly it does not differ much from the gizzard, but its interior
                            never presents those corneous pieces which in the latter serve the
                            purposes of trituration. Its position bears some analogy to that of the
                            crop of birds, from which circumstance it has probably derived its name.
                            Its texture is simply membranous, or slightly muscular when its
                            development is considerable, and in that case it is not rare to observe
                            certain folds or fleshy columns and deeper lines, which give it
                            something of a ribbed appearance. These folds, prolonged in the
                            interior, frequently constitute a kind of valve. It is in this crop that
                            bees contain their honey prior to their disgorging it, and it likewise
                            serves as the reservoir of that black and often fetid fluid which many
                            insects allow to flow from their mouths when they are seized. The form
                            of the crop differs in the various species; and even in individuals of
                            the same species, according to its state of repletion or vacuity, it
                            assumes an ovoid, rounded, or pear-shaped appearance. In some orders of
                            insects it is greatly developed, and very muscular; and in certain
                            cases, instead of lying in the same direction with the intestinal canal,
                            it forms with it an angle more or less acute, thus constituting a
                            lateral pouch varying in extent and form.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">gizzard</hi> follows the crop. Its existence is not
                            constant, and its essential character consists in its singular internal
                            structure, which is furnished with moveable portions of a horny texture,
                            provided with ridges or bristles pointed in all directions, in the form
                            of combs or brushes. The principal portions are more or less numerous,
                            and form by their union a kind of valvule at the orifice of the chylific
                            ventricle, into which they permit nothing to enter but what has been
                            previously reduced to a state of tenuity. This very singular triturating
                            machine, as we may call it, exists among both the herbivorous and
                            carnivorous kinds. It recalls to mind the aspect of the stomach among
                            the crustaceous tribes. Externally it greatly resembles the crop, and
                            indeed can scarcely be distinguished from it otherwise than by its
                            internal structure.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">chylific ventricle,</hi> which corresponds to the
                            part named <hi rend="italic">duodenum</hi> by Marcel de Serres, and <hi
                            rend="italic">stomach</hi> by Ramdhor, is a very constant organ among
                            insects, although its form and character are extremely various. It is
                            here that the pulpy food, mixed with specially elaborated fluids, is
                            converted into chyle. One of its most constant characters is the
                            insertion on a kind of circular pad more or less developed, of at least
                            one extremity of the biliary vessels. Its texture is soft and delicate,
                            and capable of varying its capacity by extension. Its form is generally
                            cylindrical, although it sometimes undergoes dilatations and
                            restrictions in its course. In some rare instances, detailed by Μ.
                            Dufour, it is bilobed or bifurcated at its commencement, the preceding
                            part of the alimentary canal being inserted in the angle of the
                            furcation. It presents several other occasional and very curious
                            characters, but it is in general straight, and but rarely exhibits a
                            limited number of convolutions. It is not garnished interiorly with
                            triturating organs, either muscular or corneous; but it is furnished
                            with a valvule at the point of union with the intestine. One of its most
                            curious characters consists in its being sometimes villous on the
                            surface, that is, covered by a quantity of little tubes, named <hi
                            rend="italic">villosities</hi> by Cuvier, and <hi rend="italic"
                            >papillae</hi> by Dufour. These are a species of tubes or purses,
                            somewhat resembling the fingers of a glove, and opening into the
                            ventricle. Their functional uses are differently construed by
                            physiologists. Cuvier inclines to think that they draw from the
                            abdominal cavity a gastric fluid, which they pour into the ventricle to
                            aid digestion. Marcel de Serres partakes of the same opinion, and
                            regards these papillae as the superior hepatic vessels. Dufour, however,
                            does not consider them as analogous to the biliary vessels, but as
                            culs-de-sac, which receive the alimentary fluid, and, after its
                            conversion into chyle, transmit it to the abdominal cavity. That able
                            anatomist has recognised in their interior a brownish matter, quite
                            analogous to what is contained in the ventricle itself. They do not
                            differ greatly as to form, but a great variation occurs in regard to
                            number and disposition. Sometimes they exist in great numbers throughout
                            the whole extent of the ventricle, sometimes they are fewer in number,
                            and confined to a limited portion. Insects belonging to the orthopterous
                            order have but few of these papillae, but they are greatly developed,
                            and inserted on the anterior part. In other instances the papillae are
                            entirely absent; and the ventricle is then smooth, or occasionally
                            exhibits depressed lines, which divide it transversely into so many
                            little bands. The presence of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746376"
                            xml:id="kp-eb0709-6376-0086"/> these papillae cannot be regarded as a
                            constant character in any group, for we find them absent or present in
                            different insects of the same family, without any known or assignable
                            cause. They occur indiscriminately among carnivorous and herbivorous
                            species; but it is among the coleopterous tribes that they show
                            themselves most frequently, and under the most characteristic forms.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">intestines</hi> constitute an extended portion of
                            the canal. They receive the alimentary matters after they have been
                            digested in the chylific ventricle, and extract by their action whatever
                            nutriment remains. Their absorbent powers, however, as alimentary
                            organs, are probably confined chiefly to their upper portion. They
                            consist of a <hi rend="italic">small intestine,</hi> a <hi rend="italic"
                            >great intestine,</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">rectum.</hi> The small
                            intestine of course proceeds from the ventricle, and is in general
                            narrow, with an equal diameter throughout, although it is sometimes
                            swollen or pursed in the course of its extent. It is of various length,
                            and makes numerous circumvolutions in the interior of the abdomen, after
                            which it borders with the great intestine. The latter, called also the
                            <hi rend="italic">caecum,</hi> consists of a swelling or enlargement,
                            usually ovoid and smooth, but not unfrequently also covered by plaits
                            and little muscular rib-like bands, more or less projecting. It is
                            dilatable, and in some cases is swollen beyond measure, especially among
                            certain aquatic tribes, such as the <hi rend="italic">Dytisci.</hi> In
                            these, as detected by the skilful eye of Μ. Dufour, the caecum is no
                            longer placed in the direction of the intestinal canal, but is thrown to
                            one side, and furnished with a vermicular appendix, spirally twisted. It
                            becomes inflated with air at the will of the insect, and thus seems to
                            act the part of a swimming bladder. Other modifications of this organ
                            have likewise been observed, into the detail of which we shall not here
                            enter. The rectum is a muscular tube, in general of no great extent.</p>
                        <p>We shall next devote a few lines to the <hi rend="italic">l&gt;iliary
                            vessels.</hi> That peculiar fluid called bile seems equally
                            indispensable to the digestion of insects as to that of the higher
                            animals, but the organ which secretes it is very different. In the
                            former class it has no longer the appearance of a gland, but consists of
                            more or less numerous vessels, of variable length, fixed for the most
                            part by a single extremity, but not unfrequently by both ends, to the
                            intestinal canal, and floating as it were in the abdominal cavity. These
                            vessels are often rolled on themselves, and interlaced by numerous
                            tracheae and slender nervous filaments. They are never wanting in
                            insects, and they exist equally in the larva state as in the perfect
                            condition. They are delicate tubes, composed of a thin and pellucid
                            membrane, on which certain transverse foldings produce a somewhat
                            varicoe appearance. They contain a liquid, sometimes limpid and
                            colourless, but usually varying from yellow to brown. It is bitter, and
                            exhibits all the characteristics of bile. The vessels themselves vary in
                            amount from two, four, six, to an almost countless number. Their mode of
                            insertion exhibits some remarkable variations, which however may be
                            reduced to two great divisions: 1<hi rend="italic">st,</hi> where the
                            insertion takes place upon the ventricle alone; 2<hi rend="italic"
                            >d</hi>, where it takes place upon the caecum likewise. The first of
                            these divisions offers two classes; sometimes the vessels are inserted
                            only by one extremity, while the other is free or floating; sometimes
                            they are fixed by both ends, and form so many arches. In the latter case
                            they are few in number, and each arch may be regarded either as a vessel
                            strongly curved towards the two points of insertion, or may be looked
                            upon as composed of two vessels exactly anastomosed at their
                            extrcmities. A coleopterous insect belonging to the genus <hi
                            rend="italic">ĴDoriacia,</hi> described by Μ. Dufour, was observed to
                            possess a ventricle provided at once with arched vessels and with such
                            as were free at their extremity. Such a combination connects, as it
                            were, the characters which principally distinguish the first great
                            division.. The second great division above alluded to never presents us
                            with any vessels that are free or unattached at one extremity. They form
                            a complete arch from the ventricle to the caecum, and scarcely present
                            any particular character, except that their number is always restricted.
                            The insertions on the ventricle are always more distinct than those on
                            the caecum; the latter being rarely isolated, but usually uniting into a
                            smaller number of common branches, and sometimes into one.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">salivary vessels</hi> consist of floating tubes,
                            which open about the pharynx, and furnish a liquid to assist in
                            deglutition. They are sometimes wanting or imperceptible, and are more
                            general, as well as more highly developed, among the suctorial than the
                            masticating tribes. The receptacles which supply the silk used by
                            spinning caterpillars, are by many regarded as analogous to salivary
                            glands, as are likewise the organs which furnish the venomous fluid in
                            the mouths of Scolopendrae.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    <p>THE METAMORPHOSES OF INSECTS.</p>
                    <p>As frequent reference is made, in the course of this treatise, to the
                        metamorphoses of insects, we shall here endeavour to explain in what these
                        essentially consist. “Were a naturalist,” observe Messrs Kirby and Spence,
                        “to announce to the world the discovery of an animal, which for the first
                        five years of its life existed in the form of a serpent; which then
                        penetrating into the earth, and weaving a shroud of pure silk of the finest
                        texture, contracted itself within this covering into a body without external
                        mouth or limbs, and resembling more than any thing else an Egyptian mummy;
                        and which, lastly, after remaining in this state without food and without
                        motion for three years longer, should at the end of that period burst its
                        silken casements, struggle through its earthy covering, and start into day a
                        winged bird,—what think you would be the sensation excited by this strange
                        piece of intelligence ?” Yet the difference which exists between the
                        sometimes repulsive aspect of a creeping caterpillar, and the consummate
                        beauty of the gorgeous butterfly to which it gives existence, is as
                        remarkable as any supposable change from one form of animal life to
                        another.</p>
                    <p>Although the ancients appear to have been aware that many insects, such as
                        butterflies, bees, and beetles, proceeded from eggs, and underwent those
                        changes which w¢ name metamorphosis; yet, very shortly before the time ol
                        Redi, Swammerdam, Malpighi, and Lecuwenhoeck, to whom we owe so much of our
                        present knowledge, Mouffet, who has been called the father of entomology,
                        mistook the aquatic larvae of Libellulae for creatures entirely distinct
                        from the perfect insects, and named them <hi rend="italic">Water Locusts
                        !</hi> The error was excusable, and has no doubt often been repeatec in
                        corresponding cases; for how many are ignorant, ever at the present day,
                        that the slender red-coloured wriggling worm, which is so often seen in
                        collections of rain water <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746389"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0709-6389-0087"/> is the larva state of a clear-winged and
                        elegantly formed fly, furnished with feathered antennae and long slender
                        limbs, the <hi rend="italic">Chironomus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >plumosus</hi><hi rend="italic">?</hi> How entirely dissimilar is the hairy
                        caterpillar, which we frequently observe crossing our foot-path in country
                        lanes, from the richly attired tiger-moth which it eventually becomes ? Many
                        examples of a similar nature will probably occur even to the least
                        instructed reader.</p>
                    <p>The word metamorphosis seems to have passed originally from a mythological
                        meaning to a term in natural science. We had deemed it an ancient phrase,
                        till we were informed by Mr Kirby that <hi rend="italic"
                        >μtτaμοξ&lt;ροω,</hi> and its derivative <hi rend="italic"
                        >μiτaμoξ&lt;ρω&lt;s</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">ς,</hi>
                        are not extant in any Greek writer before the date of the New Testament.
                        They are used to express any <hi rend="italic">external</hi> change of form
                        or colour, and metaphorically any <hi rend="italic">inward</hi> change and
                        progressive improvement of the mind. The word metamorphosis, as applied to
                        insects, is in fact synonymous with the more familiar term <hi rend="italic"
                        >transformation,</hi> although, speaking strictly in relation to physiology,
                        the changes indicated by these expressions should rather be regarded as a
                        series of developments.</p>
                    <p>All insects proceed from eggs either previously deposited by the female
                        parent, or, as in the case of the so-called viviporous (strictly
                        ovo-viviporous) kinds, hatched within the body of the mother. Their first
                        active condition is that of larva, which, according to the views of
                        Swammerdam, contains within itself the germ of the future perfect insect,
                        and those various envelopes, each of which, successively developed, becomes
                        external and apparent by the casting off of that by which it was
                        preceded.</p>
                    <p>Thus a caterpillar may be viewed, not as a simple, but a compound creature,
                        containing within it the germ of the future butterfly, inclosed in what will
                        become the case of the pupa, which is itself included in several more
                        envelopes or skins,* each of which becomes external in its turn. As the
                        larva (so called from the very circumstance of its containing the <hi
                        rend="italic">imago,</hi> or perfect insect, shut up as it were in a <hi
                        rend="italic">masK)</hi> increases in dimensions, the various parts expand,
                        and are thrown off, until at length the completed and more beautiful form is
                        displayed in all its lustre. Swammerdam, in fact, discovered, by careful
                        dissection, not only the skins of the larva and pupa incased within each
                        other, but within these again the very butterfly itself, with its organs all
                        complete, though nearly in a fluid state.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hill’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Siearn,tnerdarn,</hi> iì. 24.</p></note></p>
                    <p>Of the same fact, Mr Kirby states, any one may convince himself, without the
                        skill of the great Dutch observer, merely by plunging into vinegar or spirit
                        of wine a caterpillar about to assume the pupa state, and allowing it to
                        remain there for a few days till it gains consistency of parts; or by
                        boiling it for a few minutes in water. A very rough dissection will then
                        enable the student to detect the future butterfly,—the wings being rolled up
                        into a sort of cord, and lodged between the first and second segments, the
                        antennae and trunk coiled up in front of the head, and the legs, though very
                        dissimilar in form, actually sheathed in those of the caterpillar. Malpighi,
                        moreover, discovered the eggs of the future moth in the chrysalis of a
                        silkworm only a few days old ;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">De Bornbyex,</hi> 29.</p></note> and

                    <p>According, however, to the more recent doctrines promulgated by Dr Herold,
                        the successive skins of the caterpillar, the case of the pupa, and the
                        members of the perfect insect (except the sexual distinctions, which he
                        perceived even in the newly excluded larvae), do not preexist as germs, but
                        are formed successively from the <hi rend="italic">rete</hi><hi

                        through the pores of the intestinal canal into the general cavity of the
                        body, where being oxygenated by the air-vessels, it performs the nutritive
                        functions of blood.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                        to a <hi rend="italic">vis</hi><hi rend="italic">formatrix,</hi> a term of
                        most convenient application where the mysterious workings of nature are but
                        dimly seen or vaguely understood. But whatever may be the mode or principle
                        of development, we know that insects exist in the four following states,—the
                        <hi rend="italic">egg,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">larva,</hi> the <hi
                        rend="italic">pupa,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">imago</hi> or perfect
                        condition.</p>
                    <p>The first stage of <hi rend="italic">life,</hi> properly so called, is that
                        of larva, in which existence is usually more prolonged than in any other,
                        and in which the insect does nothing but eat voraciously, and increase
                        rapidly, with intervals of repose occasioned by repletion. In this state it
                        is entirely sterile. In the course, and towards the termination, of the
                        larva state, that peculiar internal secretion the caul, epiploon, or fatty
                        matter, formerly mentioned, is observed to increase, and the insect then
                        assumes the pupa state, which is usually one of inaction and apparent
                        torpidity. Ere long the skin of the pupa bursts asunder, or the wings and
                        members become sufficiently developed for active exercise, and the insect
                        assumes the perfect state, as exemplified in bees, beetles, and butterflies,
                        all of which proceed from a wormlike larva. In this condition they are
                        usually less voracious, their principal object and occupation being the
                        preservation or continuance of their kind.</p>
                    <p>All insects, however, do not pass through these transformations. Most of the
                        apterous kinds issue from the egg in a form very similar to that which they
                        maintain throughout their after lives; from which circumstance Linnaeus and
                        others have bestowed the name of <hi rend="italic">complete pupae</hi> on
                        their intermediate state, when such is recognisable. Even those that are
                        subjected to the signal changes above de-scrjbed, differ considerably in the
                        nature and degree of metamorphosis to which they are subjected. Many of the
                        winged kinds experience no other change than the accession of the organs of
                        flight. Their larvae resemble the perfect insect, with the exception of the

                        merely differ from the larvae by exhibiting the rudiments of those organs
                        the eventual development of which produces the completion of the perfect
                        insect. Such are the grasshopper and locust tribes, in which the pupae
                        continue to exercise their locomotive powers and ordinary vital functions.
                        Those insects which undergo a more entire metamorphosis are changed from
                        larvae into motionless and inert pupae, and this mode of transformation
                        presents different gradations. The pupae, or nymphs as they are often
                        called, of the Coleoptera and several other orders, exhibit their external
                        members in close approximation to the body, butjfree or uncovered by any
                        general envelope; we name them <hi rend="italic">incomplete.</hi> But among
                        the Lepidoptera, such as butterflies and moths, an elastic but firm and
                        sufficiently solid skin or integument is moulded over the entire body and
                        its various members, and only shows the form and outline of the latter
                        visibly impressed upon its surface. These were called <hi rend="italic"
                        >pupae obtectae</hi> by Linnaeus. Dipterous flies, again, are covered in the
                        pupa state by small simple cases, or egg-like shells, usually regarded as
                        the skin of the larva, through which the form and proportions of the parts
                        are in no way discernible. These were termed <hi rend="italic">pupae
                        coarctatae</hi> by the great Swedish naturalist.</p>
                    <p>When, however, we make use of the term <hi rend="italic">metamor<pb

                        meaning is apt to result from the application of the words complete,
                        semi-complete, and other adjective phrases,—for the less complete the pupa,
                        the more complete the metamorphosis. Some contusion, we think, has arisen
                        from this circumstance,—at least we have ourselves been occasionally puzzled
                        by the contrariety of opinion expressed upon the subject even by the “master
                        spirits” of entomology. Thus, Latreille observes, “Les Coléoptères subissent
                        one metamorphose complete,"<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        rend="italic">Horae Ent.</hi> p. 440. The confusion above referred to may
                        perhaps have arisen from certain adjective phrases having been at times
                        apphed indifferently, either to the state of pupa or the phenomena of
                        transformation, which in most cases causes a contradiction in terms. In
                        Orthoptera, of which the pupa is semi-complete, the metamorphosis may bear
                        the same designation; but in the other orders the double application of any
                        of the adjective terms leads to inaccurate ideas. Thus, in Coleoptera, the
                        pupoe are s <hi rend="italic">emi-complcte</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but
                        there is surely a total transformation, that is, a <hi rend="italic"
                        >complete</hi> metamorphosis, when we compare together the larva and the
                        perfect insect. So also in Lepidoptera, the pupa is obtected; in Diptera,
                        coarctate; and consequently the-metamorphosis must be <hi rend="italic"
                        >complete</hi> in both. Now Mr Kirby makes use of the phrase “metamorphosis
                        obtected” in regard to the former, and “metamorphosis coarctate” in relation
                        to the latter,—terms which we have been in the practice of applying to the
                        pupa state of these orders, but not to the general transformations. The same
                        admirable author, in defining apterous insects, states the metamorphosis to
                        he <hi rend="italic">complete.</hi> We would rather say that they undergo no
                        metamorphosis at all,—for which very reason, each particular state, or
                        rather period, of the insect, is itself complete from youth to age. The less
                        complete the pupa, the more complete the metamorphosis, and <hi

                    <p>However this may be, our entire range of natural knowledge presents us with
                        nothing comparable in singularity or beauty with the phenomena of
                        metamorphosis. No wonder that the mystical sages of Egypt, and the refined
                        philosophers of Greece, were so entranced or delighted with what they saw
                        and fancied, as to found upon these changes many of the fondest fables which
                        now pervade our classical literature. “Psyche,’ says Dr Nares, “means in
                        Greek the human soul; and it means also a butterfly, of which apparently
                        strange double sense the undoubted reason is, that a butterfly was a very
                        ancient symbol of the soul. From the prevalence of this symbol, and the
                        consequent coincidence of the names, it happened that the Greek sculptors
                        frequently represented Psyche as subject to Cupid in the shape of a
                        butterfly; and that even when she appears in their works under the human
                        form, we find her decorated with the light and filmy wings of that gay
                        insect.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                        upon the earth, sustained by the most ordinary kinds of food, which, when it
                        has existed a few weeks or months under this humble form, its appointed work
                        being finished, passes into an intermediate state of seeming death, when it
                        is wound up in a kind of shroud and incased in a coffin, and is most
                        commonly buried under the earth (though sometimes its sepulchre is in the
                        water, and at others in various substances in the air); and, after this
                        creature and others of its tribe have remained their destined time in this
                        deathlike state, to behold earth, air, and water, give up their several
                        prisoners; to survey them, when, called by the warmth of the solar beam,
                        they burst from their sepulchres, cast off their cerements, from this state
                        of torpid inactivity come forth as a bride out of her chamber,—to survey
                        them, I say, arrayed in their nuptial glory, prepared to enjoy a new and
                        more exalted condition of life, in which all their powers are developed, and
                        they are arrived at the perfection of their nature; when, no longer confined
                        to the earth, they can traverse the fields of air, their food is the nectar

                        interesting scene can help seeing in it a lively representation of man in
                        his threefold state of existence, and more especially of that happy day,
                        when, at the call of the great sun of righteousness, aD that are in their
                        graves shall come forth, the sea shall give up her dead, and death being
                        swallowed up of life, the nations of the blessed shall live and love to the
                        ages of eternity ?</p>
                    <p>“But although the analogy between the different states of insects and those
                        of the body of man is only general, yet it is much more complete with
                        respect to his soul. He first appears in this frail body—a child of earth, a
                        crawling worm, his soul being in a course of training and preparation for a
                        more perfect and glorious existence. When it has finished this course it
                        casts off this vile body, and goes into a hidden state of being in Hades,
                        where it rests from its works, and is prepared for its final consummation.
                        The time for this being arrived, it comes forth clothed with a glorious
                        body, not like its former though germinating from it, for though ‘ it was
                        sown an animal body, it shall be raised a spiritual body,’ endowed with
                        augmented powers, faculties, and privileges, commensurate to its new and
                        happy state. And here the parallel holds perfectly between the insect and
                        the man. The butterfly, the representative of the soul, is prepared in the

                        destroyed by the ichneumons and other enemies to which it is exposed,
                        symbolical of the vices that destroy the spiritual life of the soul, it will
                        come to its state of repose in the <hi rend="italic">pupa,</hi> which is its

                    <p>Swammerdam, to whom we owe the earliest philosophical examination of the
                        subject, divides the phenomena of metamorphosis into four classes. In the
                        first, in which the changes are the least varied or remarkable, he includes
                        apterous insects commonly so called, most of which we now name Myriapoda,
                        and the metamorphosis of which consists in gaining additional segments and
                        pairs of feet; also Arachnides and Crustacea, which are for the most part
                        characterized by simple renewals of their envelope. In the second class he
                        places such insects as are born with six feet, but have their wings
                        concealed or inclosed m a sheath during a rudimentary period, such as
                        Orthoptera, Hemiptera, and many Neuroptera. In the third class are included
                        those insects which exhibit three distinct conditions; they compose two
                        subdivisions. The first comprises those insects of which the second state,
                        called nymph or semi-nymph, exhibits either the appearance of feet and
                        wings, or the reality of these organs. They are not reduced to that state of
                        utter lethargy or apparent death which some present, and they include the
                        remainder of the Neuroptera, the Hymenoptera, and the Coleoptera. The other
                        subdivision contains the Lepidoptera, of which the larv¢e, commonly called
                        caterpillars, are subject to several preparatory changes of their coat, and
                        are finally converted into chrysalids, through the coriaceous skin of which
                        the interior parts are perceptible, but which externally exhibit neither
                        wings nor legs, nor any other members.</p>
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746415" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6415-0089"/>
                    <p>Finally, in the fourth class are included all those insects which on their
                        exclusion from the egg exist as vermiform apodal larvae, are provided at
                        most with six feet, and are converted into nymphs without a change of
                        envelope, so that their skin merely hardens over the intermediate stace of
                        the insect, which ere long issues winged. Such are the dipterous tribes.</p>
                    <p>These views and combinations have been somewhat modified in later years, by
                        Réaumur, Linnaeus, Fabricius, Huber, Dutrochet, Savigny, Marcel de Serres,
                        Latreille, and others who have devoted themselves to the investigation of
                        metamorphoses. Those phenomena have consequently been classed as incomplete
                        or partial by which the aspect of the insect is merely modified, and as
                        complete or total by which it is entirely changed. In all, the interior
                        changes may be said to command the exterior, that is, the latter are
                        consequent on the former. In numerous species, not less than three of the
                        principal organic systems, viz. the <hi rend="italic">nervous,</hi> the <hi
                        rend="italic">nutritive,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">respiratory,</hi>
                        undergo important modifications, and we may easily conceive how strongly the
                        instinctive habits of the individual must be thereby affected. The
                        alterations in the nervous system especially, are singular in their nature
                        and effects. The number of ganglia of the spinal cord is usually greater in
                        the larva than the perfect insect, although the great single ganglion of the
                        rhinoceros-beetle (<hi rend="italic">Oryctes ηαsicois),</hi> in its early
                        state, compared with the four ganglia of its subsequent condition, offers an
                        exception to the general rule. But in the larva of the stag-bcetlc <hi
                        rend="italic">(Lucanus cervus)</hi> we observe eight ganglia, besides a
                        recurrent nerve, while the perfect insect possesses only four; and among
                        caterpillars in general the same restriction takes place in the number of
                        their ganglionic knots as they attain the perfect state.</p>
                    <p>Among beings in which the parts representing the brain and other organs of
                        sensation of the higher tribes undergo so many variations even in the same
                        individual, we may well suppose that whatever ideas they are capable of
                        conceiving at one period of their existence, may differ essentially from
                        those with which they arc impressed at another. We shall not here involve
                        ourselves in the discussion of the difficult and dissimilar theories of
                        instinct, nor enter into any exposition of the mechanical, the intellectual,
                        or the supernatural character of that surprising manifestation, which,
                        uríder whatever aspect it may be viewed, whether as differing in kind or
                        only in degree from reason, cannot be otherwise regarded than as a most
                        beautiful illustration of divine benevolence. But we may ask, by what
                        peculiar memory or mode of recollection does the brilliant butterfly, which
                        seeks its sustenance in the nectarous juices of flowers, rifling their
                        sweets with its tubular <hi rend="italic">proboscis,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >—</hi> by what means does it remember that its progeny, while in the larva
                        state, must be sustained by a far different diet, and that they exercise
                        their <hi rend="italic">jaws</hi> on cabbage-lcaves, and other vegetation of
                        the coarser kind ř Μ. Virey, who denies all intellect to insects, and views
                        their various actions as resulting mechanically from the peculiar
                        disposition or character of their nervous system, has endeavoured to
                        illustrate the subject by the following parallel. He compares an insect to
                        one of those portable organs, of which the cylinder has different airs noted
                        on its surface, and which performs one or another tune in proportion as the
                        cylinder is made to recede or advance. So likewise the nervous system, or
                        series of ganglia along the double medullary cord, of the creatures now
                        under consideration, being differently constituted in the larva and the
                        perfect insect, ought to produce different actions in the two cases, though
                        respectively appropriate to the nature of each. Art in the one instance, and
                        nature in the other, has impressed certain dispositions, or notes of action,
                        fixed in a determinate series, equally in the musical organ, and the
                        ganglionic system of caterpillars. Hence the one gives utterance to a
                        certain air, while the other acts according to a certain sequence of
                        operations. Pull out a notch of the barrel organ, and you have another tune;
                        await the transformation of the caterpillar to a butterfly, and you have
                        (with a change in the <hi rend="italic">notching</hi> of its nervous system)
                        another series of instinctive operations. In both, the relations of cause
                        and effect are the same, and each is merely the mechanical playing of an
                        instrument !<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                        prove this position, as has been elsewhere remarked, Μ. Virey ought at least
                        to have shown, that whenever a change takes place in the instincts of
                        insects in their different states of larva and ima-ago, a corresponding
                        change also takes place in the structure of the nervous cord.<note

                        to Ent.</hi> iv. 27∙</p></note> But this is by no means the case. In three
                        entire orders, namely, Orthoptera, Hemiptera, and Neuroptera, the structure
                        of that cord remains unchanged, and yet we know that thousands of the
                        species which compose these orders acquire instinctive habits in their
                        perfect state, altogether dissimilar to those by which they w ere
                        characterized in their earlier condition. Even were it otherwise, our query
                        would still require to be answered, by what mechanical impulsion is the
                        completed butterfly, a gay and gorgeous honey-sucker, induced to play a tune
                        (we speak in harmony with Μ. Virey’s views) so completely in accordance, not
                        with its ow n refined tastes, but with the future welfare of the crawling
                        caterpillars of which it is the parent ? Why does it deposit its eggs, not
                        on the odorous blossoms and bright consummate flowers in which it takes so
                        much delight, and amid the varied petals of which it rejoices to expand to
                        the sunshine its own still more brilliant wings, but on the rank leaves of
                        the cabbage and cauliflower, or the dingy foliage of the nettle ? These
                        questions, and many others of a similar nature, are perhaps more easily
                        proponed than answered. When we consider, indeed, how frequently inaccurate
                        is our knowledge even of our own individual feelings, and how much more
                        incompetent we are to judge of what passes in the minds of others of our own
                        species, need we wonder that the sentient principles of the lower animals
                        should, in relation to human intelligence, be still shrouded in dim eclipse,
                        if not in total darkness.. It is far more probable, however, that the
                        alterations in the nervous cord have no necessary connection with the
                        changes of instinct, but are more closely concerned with those other not
                        less remarkable mutations in the organs of sense and motion, which occur
                        betw∙cen the larva and imago states of several orders. “In a common
                        caterpillar, the form of the body, the legs, the eyes, and other organs of
                        the senses, all strikingly differ from those of the imago; whereas, with the
                        exception of the acquisition of new wings, a perfect locust differs little
                        from its larva; so that we may reasonably expect a corresponding change,
                        such as we find it in the structure of the nervous cord of the lepidopterous
                        insect, not called for in that of the neuropterous (orthopterous ?) species,
                        in which accordingly it does not take place.”<note anchored="true"

                        In such as undergo an incomplete metamorphosis, the parts of the mouth, and
                        the form of the alimentary canal, experience no essential alteration; but
                        among those tribes in which the change of external aspect is complete in
                        each successive stage, these important <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746428"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0709-6428-0090"/>parts assume another character, and admirably
                        illustrate the multitude of means employed by nature to vary her innumerable
                        products, even although the general laws by which these are regulated, and
                        from which, under the great and never-slumbering eye of Omnipotence,
                        theymore immediately result, are themselves so few in number. The shorter
                        the alimentary canal becomes, the more carnivorous are the tendencies of the
                        individual. This finally exemplifies the great physiological truth
                        previously deduced from the difference between the structure of the
                        alimentary system in herbivorous and carnivorous animals of the higher
                        classes,—between the short canal of the bloodthirsty tiger, and the
                        lengthened convolutions of the gentler ruminating tribes. Here, however, the
                        disparity exists, not as among animals of entirely différent attributes, but
                        in the same individual at different periods of its existence. The young of
                        many aquatic beetles of the family of <hi rend="italic">Helophoridoe</hi>
                        are carnivorous in their larva state, and become herbivorous on assuming
                        their final transformation. A like singularity is manifested by many
                        dipterous flies, which, born and bred amid the putrid moisture of animal
                        remains, no sooner become winged insects, than they seek a purer diet in the
                        nectarous juices of fruits and flowers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Entomοlogia Edlncnsis,</hi> p.
                        207∙</p></note> Analogous changes take place even in those species which do
                        not entirely alter the nature of their diet. A voracious caterpillar, which,
                        by means of its robust maxillae, rapidly gnaws and consumes a quantity of
                        the most coriaceous leaves, to the amount sometimes of triple its own weight
                        in a single day, and presents the beau-ideal of an eating machine, has its
                        intestine greatly dilated, and pursed like a colon. The larvae both of wasps
                        and bees have a stomach so vast, that it occupies almost the entire of their
                        interior, although in the perfect state of each it becomes greatly
                        restricted. Thus in the bee that great laboratory consists of little more
                        than two unequal honey pouches; and among butterflies, of which the trunk or
                        sucker corresponds to the previous jaws, the stomach is much less than in
                        caterpillars. This, we may observe, reverses the rule which applies to the
                        great ruminating animals among the vertebrated tribes, where we find a
                        single stomach in the foetus state, and which in the adult is multiplied to
                        four. It is the opinion of some naturalists that larvae in general, having
                        larger intestines, tend more towards a herbivorous diet than perfect
                        insects, in which these organs are shorter, and which are consequently
                        supposed to assume a more carnivorous habit ;—“so rare, is it,” observes Μ.
                        Bory St Vincent, “to perceive the manners of living creatures not tending to
                        mutual destruction as their powers are developed.” An enlightened mind,
                        however, naturally delights in the perception and extrication of general
                        rules; and these, we fear, are not seldom fancied without being either
                        perceived or deduced. In opposition to the presumed law, we have already
                        mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Helophoridoe,</hi> which reverse the rule;
                        and to these we could add many more. The glowworm in its larva state is
                        greedy of animal jiiices, and feeds chiefly on minute testacea, while, in
                        its completed state, it is entirely herbivorous. A large aquatic beetle, the
                        <hi rend="italic">Hydrous</hi><hi rend="italic">piceus,</hi> is so ferocious
                        and blood-thirsty in the form of larva, as to bear in France the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">ver-assassin</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but in its after
                        condition, through the medium of metamorphosis, the intestine becomes
                        elongated, and the disposition of the insect is softened and subdued, so
                        that it then prefers a vegetable to an animal diet. In fact the great aim
                        and object of an insect in the perfect condition is rather the continuance
                        of its kind than the sustenance of itself; although, as the one process
                        cannot be well accom-plisħed without the other, it no doubt, even in its
                        most high and palmy state, casts, like its betters, an occasional eye on the
                        “flesh-pots of Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The changes in the <hi rend="italic">respiratory system</hi> of insects
                        produced by metamorphosis, are not less extraordinary than those to which we
                        have just alluded. But as we have already mentioned some of the more
                        remarkable of these in our observations on the <hi rend="italic">organs of
                        respiration,</hi> we shall not further dilate upon that portion of the
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>Metamorphosis in insects has been described as the maximum state of a general
                        law of nature, by which the whole organization of the animal being is
                        gradually developed and made fit for reproduction. Without the study of this
                        phenomenon, we cannot acquire a knowledge of the most important
                        circumstances in the lives of such animals as are guided entirely by
                        instinct; and just as an acquaintance with the whole life of an insect
                        necessarily induces a truer knowledge of its actual nature, than a mere
                        description of one of its forms,—so, in the same proportion, it has been
                        said, ought metamorphosis to outweigh every other principle of arrangement.
                        When we trace the natural history of a dragon-fly <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Libellula)</hi> from the time that the egg is first dropped into the bosom
                        of the uncertain waters, till, on some bright sunny morning in “the leafy
                        month of June,” the gauzy-winged insect in the perfect state is seen to rise
                        from its moist abode, and, hawking for flies, to hover like a bird of prey
                        along the placid shores of some familiar pool, we can scarcely conceive a
                        clear idea of the truth, except by supposing one animal to have been so
                        inclosed within another, that the imago is in a great measure distinct from
                        the repulsive larva, and is only opened to our view by its desiccation or
                        death. Hence, as Mr Macleay observes, a system unconnected with
                        metamorphosis may be regarded as taking no more notice of half the number of
                        true insects than if they did not exist, “It is the defect both of the
                        artificial system in Entomology, and of the sexual system in Botany, that
                        they become useless, except when the objects of the respective sciences are
                        before us in one particular state, which is often the most transitory of
                        their life. Unless this condition be fulfilled, such systems lose their sole
                        and peculiar merit of being dictionaries by which natural objects may be
                        named. There are thousands of organized beings, to the history and knowledge
                        of which the disciple of Linnaeus and Fabricius has no clue whatever,
                        although perhaps they are in that state of their existence which most
                        directly affects the interests of man. Plants not in flower, and insects not
                        in their declared state, constitute an ocean of difficulties, in which the
                        most skilled in the Linnaean nomenclature will founder, unless he have other
                        beacons than such momentary considerations as are afforded by the number of
                        stamina, or the form of the antennae.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    <p>We shall conclude our observations on the singular subject of metamorphosis,
                        by another quotation from the last-named author, which, with what has been
                        already stated, will, it is hoped, suffice to instruct the reader regarding
                        what we consider the most extraordinary phenomena observable within the
                        range of the animal kingdom. “It was perfectly in unison with the innate
                        propensity of the human mind towards the marvellous, that the change of a
                        caterpillar into a butterfly, when first noticed, should have been
                        considered by the ancients as a true transformation, irreconcilable with the
                        ordinary course of nature. Even on the mystery being in a great degree
                        cleared up by the discoveries of Libavius, Redi, Malpighi, and Swammerdam,.
                        the phenomenon continued to be termed metamorphosis; and perhaps it is even
                        still a little owing to such circumstances that a natural process, neglected
                        in other <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746441" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6441-0091"/>
                        branches of zoology, has always excited so much curiosity among
                        entomologists. Metamorphosis, however, has been taken of late in a very
                        general point of view, and rendered synonymous with that species of organic
                        decomposition which, by means of continual shedding of the external
                        envelopes, or even of the various integuments which may compose those
                        envelopes, occasions that extraordinary characteristic of a living body,
                        namely, that it never remains in a constant state, or identically the same,
                        but is continually assimilating new particles of matter, as it throws off
                        the old. And since no metamorphosis can take place except in consequence of
                        these integuments being shed, perhaps it may not be altogether improper to
                        survey the subject in this light. What I mean is, that we ought to regard
                        the metamorphosis or change of form which certain animals undergo at various
                        periods of their life, as an attendant upon, if not a variety of, the <hi
                        rend="italic">ecdysis,</hi> or moulting, to which all organized beings are
                        subject. There is, however, a great distinction to be made between the <hi
                        rend="italic">ecdysis</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Annulosa,</hi> for in the former we observe little more than
                        that the animal has quitted a sheath in which it was inclosed; whereas in
                        the latter the change is nothing else than if the skeleton were shed; for
                        this name is surely deserved by those hard and solid parts which in so many
                        cases afford support to the muscles. It is clear that such a process must
                        occasion a crisis in the life of an annulose animal, incomparably more
                        decisive in its effects than what can be produced among the <hi
                        rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> by merely being set free from an integument.
                        All the marvellous, however, of <hi rend="italic">ecdysis,</hi> was with the
                        earlier naturalists comprehended in the change of form; and consequently the
                        shedding of the envelope only excited attention where it regarded a few of
                        the <hi rend="italic">Annulosa.</hi> Hence it was a great discovery of
                        Linnaeus, that every annulose animal ought to be considered as subject to
                        metamorphosis. It may indeed have led to his more artificial notion of every
                        externally articulated being having a nympha state; but even this helped
                        Fabricius to give, although with a faulty nomenclature, a much more
                        convenient division of metamorphosis than he could otherwise have
                        devised.</p>
                    <p>“Ecdysis, by which term is signified generally every change in the identity
                        of the envelope of a living body, may either be complete or incomplete. If
                        it be incomplete, or, which is the same, if the integuments scale off piece
                        by piece, we have that mode of change which is peculiar to the most perfect
                        of the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> and to the least perfect of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Annulosa.</hi></p>
                    <p>“Complete ecdysis is the shedding of the whole external envelope at once, of
                        which we have examples among the vertebrated as well as annulose animals. It
                        is of three sorts; first, where the external envelope is shed without
                        producing any essential change of form, except in as much as may relate to
                        the increased size. In those larvae of insects which become inactive in
                        their pupa state, such a process may always be distinguished from the true
                        metamorphosis; but in apterous Hexapods having active nymphae, they are
                        necessarily confounded. It is also visible in reptiles and spiders, where
                        such appendages of the trunk as have been lost may be reproduced by
                        continued moulting. When the various envelopes are all cast as it were in
                        one mould, it is to be expected that the proper form of the animal should,
                        re-appear as these continue to be thrown off. The return therefore of a
                        spider or crab, after having lost a limb, to its original form, may be in
                        some measure understood as depending on the manner in which such animals
                        shed their envelope; but that the limbs thus shot forth should be furnished
                        with muscles and nerves, is, I conceive, what cannot be accounted for,
                        except by referring to that polype nature of the cellular substance, which
                        is perhaps, in the opinion of some persons, the foundation of all ecdysis.
                        If perfect hexapod insects cannot reproduce their members, this inability
                        may probably proceed from a cause which appears to have produced the same
                        effect among <hi rend="italic">Mammalia</hi> and birds, to wit, that these
                        animals in their perfect and final form are all subject, if to any, at least
                        to a very imperfect ecdysis.</p>
                    <p>“The second sort of complete ecdysis is that where the under envelope has
                        been cast in a somewhat different mould from the upper, so that in the
                        course of the moulting certain new parts become gradually developed without
                        the general form being in any material degree altered. This is observable in
                        every annulose class, as well as in Humboldt’s Axotl among the <hi
                        rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> and is the first species of change which
                        merits the name of metamorphosis. It includes the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Metamorphosis</hi><hi rend="italic">inchoata</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Metamorphosis</hi><hi rend="italic">dimidiata</hi> of Latreille, and is the
                        same with the <hi rend="italic">Metamorphose</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >partielle</hi> of Lamarck.</p>
                    <p>“The third sort of complete ecdysis is that wherein, by some two or three
                        moultings, generally the last which the animal has to undergo, the form is
                        entirely changed, as well as the number of appendages more or less
                        increased. This is clearly a true metamorphosis, and includes the other two
                        sorts of complete ecdysis; for we have here combined a total casting of the
                        integuments, a development of additional appendages, such as feet or wings,
                        and finally an entire change of form. Such a combination may be witnessed,
                        among the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> in frogs, and, among the <hi
                        rend="italic">Annulosa,</hi> in certain hexapod insects. Hence, in confining
                        ourselves to plain and open ecdysis, there will be no great error in stating
                        that the most imperfect takes place in the highest <hi rend="italic"
                        >Vertebrata</hi> and the lowest <hi rend="italic">Annulosa</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> while the most complete ecdysis is that which is seen
                        to prevail in the highest <hi rend="italic">Annulosa</hi> and some of the
                        lowest <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata.</hi></p>
                    <p>“In strict accuracy, however, it appears that we ought to acknowledge the
                        existence of complete ecdysis throughout the circle of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Vertebrata.</hi> Nay, some physiologists have attributed insect
                        metamorphosis itself to a shedding of an envelope analogous to that which
                        contains the foetus of the more perfect <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata.</hi>
                        As every embryo, whether animal or vegetable, is enclosed in a tunic more or
                        less solid, which is its chorion, so, proceeding with the analogy, they
                        conceive that there must be some condition for every animal, similar to the
                        state of the foetus of the more perfect animals when surrounded by the
                        amnios; and this state in batrachian reptiles and hexapod insects they hold
                        to be the larva. The only danger of this reasoning is, that while we find
                        the birth of an animal to be attended with complete ecdysis, we may be apt
                        to imagine that every complete ecdysis betokens a true birth. " It would,
                        however, be truly absurd to consider the casting of their shell by <hi
                        rend="italic">Crustacea,</hi> or the periodical moulting of the serpent, in
                        this light; yet no one can doubt the fact of both these being cases of
                        complete ecdysis, only differing from that of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Lepidoptera,</hi> because in the former animals the external envelope is
                        always of the same form as that of which it is to take the place. The truth
                        perhaps is, that we ought only to allow two states to every animal, a
                        perfect and an imperfect state. Then, by the reflection that no animal out
                        of the circle of <hi rend="italic">Aerita</hi> can ever arrive at its
                        perfect state except by means of metamorphosis, and that when perfect it can
                        never again be subject to this change of form, though it may still moult or
                        shed its external envelope, we may be able, if not to comprehend the cause,
                        at least to know the effect, of some of the most puzzling phenomena in
                        nature. The true criterion of animal as well as vegetable perfection is the
                        ability to continue the species; hence some of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Vertebrata,</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">Annulosa,</hi> gaining this
                        faculty before they have arrived at their proper type of form, metamorphosis
                        ceases, and they preserve the shape of larvae.</p>
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746454" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6454-0092"/>
                    <p>“But if a complete ecdysis may sometimes create a total change in the
                        external appearance of the animal, the fact, however astonishing, is nothing
                        in comparison of the internal metamorphosis which accompanies it, and of
                        which as yet no philosopher has been able to give any satisfactory
                        explanation. The generalization indeed by which we have reduced the moulting
                        of a bird’s feathers and the metamorphosis of a butterfly to one principle,
                        may appear to be strained beyond its proper limits; yet if we contemplate
                        the regular gradation from one to the other, how truly, for instance, the
                        inactive pupa of a beetle corresponds with the agile nympha of a <hi
                        rend="italic">Gryllus,</hi> how this ecdysis in an apterous <hi
                        rend="italic">Gryllus</hi> corresponds with the sloughing of a spider, and
                        this again with the annual renovation of the serpent, we must be sensible
                        that, however dissimilar the extremes may be, all these changes are
                        modifications of one principle. But what particularly deserves remark is,
                        that these extremes should often be visible in neighbouring groups; nay, in
                        the same order; that, in short, metamorphosis should differ so much in
                        degree even where the animals are near in affinity. An orthopterous insect
                        may preserve the same form and habits from the instant it quits the egg up
                        to the period of its death, the only qualities obtained by ecdysis being an
                        augmentation of size and an aptitude to continue the species. But if we turn
                        to the order of <hi rend="italic">Coleoptera,</hi> which is contiguous in
                        affinity, it is truly wonderful that, by metamorphosis, not only the form,
                        but the nervous and digestive systems, may be altered, and the organs
                        connected with these primary functions may all be of a construction
                        different from that which they originally possessed.”<note anchored="true"

                    <p>OF THE RELATIVE P0SITI0N OF THE CLASS OF INSECTS IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM.</p>
                    <p>A great diversity of opinion has existed from the earliest ages regarding the
                        natural affinities of the different kinds and classes of animated beings to
                        each other, and a consequent contrariety has prevailed in our systems of
                        classification, which are of course indications of the relation of groups,
                        unless where, for mere convenience, a professedly artificial basis or
                        arrangement, deduced from one or two obvious though unimportant characters,
                        may have been adopted. The majority of naturalists, both ancient and modern,
                        have proceeded upon the idea that all natural objects were <hi rend="italic"
                        >concatenated,</hi> or formed a continuous <hi rend="italic">chain</hi> or
                        linear series, and that whatever hiatus might seem to exist arose either
                        from some great convulsion which had swallowed or swept away the desired
                        links, or from these links bein&lt;&gt; still to be discovered in one or
                        other of those regions of the earth’s surface which still remain to be
                        explored. Hence the dictum of Linnaeus—natura saltus non facit, “When the

                        a regular approximation to each other in the works of God, and that they are
                        related to each other in a variety of ways both naturally and analogically;
                        but it need not be supposed that, in the magnificent plan of the creation,
                        there is no disparity in the relative position of the most nearly related
                        kinds, and no greater interval in one place than another. There is in truth
                        a great variation in the combinations of living beings, though no violent
                        break or sudden interval; in other words, “some continuous species or groups
                        have more characters in common than others.” But in considering the various
                        groups of living creatures, we must ever bear in mind our own ignorance of
                        their actual amount, and the thousands of unknown forms which in all the
                        pride of life may be daily unfolding their exquisite forms and gorgeous
                        colours amid those far deserts where man has never trod, and which for that
                        very reason he regards as <hi rend="italic">solitudes,</hi> though assuredly
                        teeming with all the inexplicable wonders of creation. Let not therefore a
                        <hi rend="italic">hiatus</hi> be confounded with a <hi rend="italic"
                        >saltus,</hi> the former being merely one of the many blanks in the
                        superficial map of knowledge drawn by man, the latter an absent link in that
                        resplendent chain, to us too often “dark with excessive light,” which in one
                        way or other connects together in divinest harmony the beautiful works of
                        the Creator. That the series of beings, however, was not only continuous,
                        but <hi rend="italic">undeviating,</hi> and ascended in a direct line from
                        the lowest to the highest, was maintained, among many others, by the
                        excellent and ingenious Bonnet, and has generally prevailed till very recent
                        times.</p>
                    <p>Now the principle which mainly characterizes the views so mildly advocated by
                        Mr Macleay, and entertained, we believe, about the same period, although
                        without communication, by Agardh, Fries, and other continental naturalists,
                        is this,—that although the natural arrangement of objects is indeed in a
                        continuous series, that series in its progression forms various
                        convolutions, each of which may be represented by a <hi rend="italic"
                        >circle</hi> or series returning into itself. He maintains that absolute
                        divisions do not exist in nature, and that a single plan pervades the
                        universe, a plan founded on the principle of series of affinities returning
                        into themselves, and forming circles; hence there is no such thing among
                        natural objects as a simple progression of species.<note anchored="true"

                        accustomed to consider the insect tribes as inferior in the great range of
                        organization to the molluscous animals which inhabit shells, there can be no
                        doubt that they are superior in many of their vital functions. Their powers
                        of locomotion, whether as winged, aquatic, or terrestrial creatures, are
                        finely developed, and their perceptive faculties are much more acute. The
                        symmetrical perfection of their forms, and the articulation of the limbs, in
                        the insect class, seem also in some measure to connect them with the
                        vertebrated tribes. Indeed, even of the latter, many seem far inferior to
                        insects, not only, as Mr Macleay has observed, in the possession of those
                        faculties by which we are accustomed to estimate the rank of the <hi

                        of their general structure. These and other considerations afford powerful
                        arguments in favour of the <hi rend="italic">circular</hi> system; for it
                        appears necessary, first, that certain affinities of the <hi rend="italic"

                        obvious in the <hi rend="italic">Cephalopoda</hi> or cuttle-fish, should not
                        be disturbed by any intervening division; and, secondly, that the annulose
                        animals themselves, such as insects, Crustacea, and Arachnides, should not
                        be far separated from <hi rend="italic">GastrobrancJrus</hi> and other
                        genera of cyclostomous fishes; above all, that they should not be made
                        subordinate in rank to such simply organized creatures as compose the
                        greatest part of the Mollusea. “Nov/ these conditions will all be fulfilled
                        if the chain of nature be viewed as returning into itself; whereas they will
                        be completely violated if we account it to be a regular line or ladder,

                        chiefly owing to the perfection of the circulating system in molluscous

                        of that organ than what is derived from the analogy which its position in
                        these Testacea is supposed to bear to that of the brain in the gasteropoda.
                        It is a strong fact, however, that so skilful an interpreter of nature as
                        Baron Cuvier should have been determined by that analogy, and should have
                        acceded to. the acephalous Mollusea the possession of a brain, and a general
                        construction, which, upon the whole, he regards as making a nearer approach
                        to that of the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> than is effected by any
                        annulose animal. Yet in spite of this it would be difficult to contend that

                        the works of the creation as referable to the human structure, as a standard
                        of perfection; for although the frame of man, when taken as a whole, ought
                        doubtless to be regarded with wonder and admiration as a most complicated
                        yet complete machine, there is at the same time as little doubt that we
                        scarcely possess a single sense or bodily power in which we are not excelled
                        by some irrational beings. Different animals have in fact been constructed
                        on different plans, and man may without impropriety be regarded as upon the
                        whole the most admirably constructed creature of all those which have been
                        organized upon the same general plan with himself, hut with the others he
                        cannot be compared.</p>
                    <p>In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Animal Kingdom</hi> of this work we have
                        already shown the importance of the nervous system in the formation of the
                        greater divisions of living creatures, and we there exhibited the relative
                        positions occupied by the different classes of animals in the works of the
                        most distinguished systematic writers. Lamarck divides the animal kingdom
                        into two great branches,—the one containing all those living beings of which
                        the skeleton is <hi rend="italic">internal,</hi> and constructed upon a bony
                        and articulated column, hence called <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">—</hi> the other consisting of those innumerous kinds of which
                        the skeleton is either wanting, or its supposed analogue is for the most
                        part <hi rend="italic">external,</hi> and includes the muscles; these are
                        the <hi rend="italic">ln-vertebrata.</hi> This grand distinction is strongly
                        marked throughout the great mass of each division, but it begins to
                        disappear wherever the provinces approach each other. Thus among the turtles
                        or chelonian reptiles, the vertebral column is converted to a row of square
                        osseous plates, which run along the back, and unite with eight pair of
                        expanded ribs, which are anchylosed together by real sutures, and combine to
                        form in fact the <hi rend="italic">external</hi> carapace or shell. In like
                        manner the vertebral column almost disappears among the cyclostomous fishes,
                        while, on the other hand, the Cephalopoda, or cuttle-fish, though belonging
                        to the invertebrate division, exhibit the commencement of an internal
                        skeleton. Μ. Virey, as we have shown in the article above referred to,
                        divided the animal kingdom into <hi rend="italic">three</hi> great branches,
                        according to the different character of their nervous system. Baron Cuvier,
                        proceeding upon the consideration of the same important basis, includes all
                        animals within <hi rend="italic">four</hi> primary divisions; while Mr
                        Macleay, according to his peculiar views, perceiving <hi rend="italic"
                        >five</hi> great sub-kingdoms in the magnificent <hi rend="italic"
                        >circle</hi> of living things, has assumed that number of divisions. We
                        shall here present a sketch of his system, so far as relates to the primary
                        forms, the majority of which agree with those of his predecessors, although
                        their relative position, and circular sequence, if we may so call it,
                        differ.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                        our occasional exposition of its peculiar and prevailing doctrines cannot
                        prove otheivise than interesting to the considerate reader.</p></note></p>
                    <p>1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>, There is a great tribe of beings which possess
                        one principal centre to their nervous system, the great trunk of which, with
                        the said centre, is contained in a bony articulated case, which forms the
                        axis of the whole body, and constitutes the vertebrae and skull of these
                        creatures, which are therefore named <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Vertebrata.</hi></p>
                    <p>2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi>, In another form of animals the skeleton is as it
                        were external, so as to envelope the whole body, and is divided by
                        transverse folds into a certain number of rings, to the internal surface of
                        which the muscles are always attached. Their nervous system consists of two
                        long strings of medullary matter, passing through the whole of the body, and
                        united to each other, at small distances, into several knots or ganglia.
                        These ganglia may be said to perform for the parts which surround them the
                        function of so many brains, and for a certain period are even sufficient for
                        nervous<pb break="no" facs="nls:193746480" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6480-0094"/>
                        sensibility after the animal has been cut in pieces. All the beings so
                        constructed are named <hi rend="smallcaps">Annulosa.</hi></p>
                    <p>3<hi rend="italic">rd</hi>, In a third prevailing form there is no
                        articulated skeleton either external or internal, the muscles being attached
                        solely to the skin, which is itself in general soft, though often protected
                        by a calcareous or stony crust, termed the shell. These animals, remarkable,
                        like plants, for the variety of modes in which the sexes are combined, have
                        their nervous system composed of several masses or ganglions united together
                        by nervous threads.. The constituents of this group are almost all aquatic,
                        and are named <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusea.</hi></p>
                    <p>4<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, A fourth form of animal life exhibits to our view
                        the organs of locomotion and sensation arranged in a circular disposition
                        round a centre, so as to give a sort of radiated aspect to the whole body.
                        They are composed of a more or less gelatinous substance, of which the
                        fibres are indistinct. The nervous system of these imperfect beings is but
                        little known. M. Tiedemann, in a work crowned by the French Institute <hi
                        rend="italic">(Mémoire sur</hi><hi rend="italic">l’</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Anatomie</hi><hi rend="italic">des</hi><hi rend="italic">Asteries),</hi>
                        conceives that the whitish threads which proceed in a radiant direction from
                        around the mouth, and which extend themselves through the entire length of
                        the arms of these animals, form a kind of nervous system, which, from the
                        pulpy nature of the medullary matter, seems to correspond with the
                        gelatinous composition of the animals themselves. They are all aquatic, and
                        are named <hi rend="smallcaps">Radiata.</hi></p>
                    <p>5<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, Thus far these groups agree in number and
                        constitution with the four primary divisions established by Baron
                        Cuvier,—the <hi rend="italic">Annulose</hi> division corresponding with the
                        <hi rend="italic">Animalia Articulata</hi> of the French naturalist, except
                        that it excludes the <hi rend="italic">Annelides,</hi> or red-blooded worms,
                        and includes certain radiated species (commonly so called), such as the
                        intestinal group denominated <hi rend="italic">Intestinaux Cavitaires</hi>
                        by the French, or <hi rend="italic">Entozoa Nematoidea</hi> of Rudolphi.
                        But, according to Mr Macleay’s views, there still remains a <hi
                        rend="italic">fifth</hi> form of animal life to be considered,—a group of
                        beings which cannot in the present state of knowledge be better described
                        than as masses of a transparent, homogeneous, mobile, and sensible pulp.
                        There may, however, be observed in this translucent mass innumerable minute
                        granulations, which may be regarded as the nervous molecules dispersed over,
                        or as it were confounded with, the substance of these animals, so as to
                        endow the whole with sensibility, or something which the author calls such,
                        probably for want of a better name. This final division is named <hi

                        positive in regard to plants. The simple texture of their cellular tissue is
                        common to them and to the <hi rend="italic">Algae.</hi> Their gemmiparous
                        generation is allied only to the very simplest mode of the reproductive
                        system among other animal tribes, but is by no means unfrequent among
                        plants. The method by which they are more or less sustained by the
                        absorption of their external pores, and the attractive influence exercised
                        on them by light, are likewise features only elsewhere to be observed among
                        the vegetable tribes. When a polype is cut in pieces, each of these
                        continues to live, and in time assumes the original form, so that every
                        point of such an animal body may be regarded as possessing an independent
                        life, like that of the lower plants. Lamarck accounts for this peculiarity
                        by regarding their alimentary canal as constituting a second absorbing
                        surface, in no way different from the absorbent external surface of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Agastria,</hi> or infusorial tribes, so that any portion
                        separated from their bodies may live for a time, like the Infusoria, until
                        they have obtained the second or internal absorbent surface.</p>
                    <p>“On considering,” says Mr Macleay, “the gelatinous composition of these
                        animals, the dispersion of the nervous molecules through their substance,
                        and the absolute certainty that they are devoid of every sense, except
                        perhaps those of taste and touch, we are led to connect them with the <hi
                        rend="italic">Mollusca,</hi> whose substance is always mucous, and often
                        even gelatinous,—whose nervous system, though collected into several <hi
                        rend="italic">ganglions,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">centres of
                        sensibility,</hi> has nevertheless these ganglions dispersed, with little if
                        any arrangement, throughout the whole mass of their body,— and whose senses,
                        so far at least as we are certain of their existence, seem to be confined to
                        those of taste and touch, with the exception of a few animals of the
                        division which possess the organs of sight, and still fewer which possess
                        those of hearing.</p>
                    <p>“ Nevertheless, on comparing the <hi rend="italic">Acrita</hi> with the <hi
                        rend="italic">Mollusea,</hi> we find that the organization of these last has
                        become much more complicated, and that a distinct system of circulation, and
                        peculiar organs for respiration, digestion, and secretion, are even visible
                        in these animals, which connect them in a remarkable manner with a still
                        more perfectly organized family—the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata.</hi></p>
                    <p>“These, however, by their red blood, their muscular heart, their jaws acting
                        vertically, their distinct organs for sight, hearing, smell, and taste,
                        their sexes constantly distinct, their vertebral column, and extreme
                        concentration of the nervous system, are sufficiently insulated from the <hi
                        rend="italic">Mollusea,</hi> as well as from all other material beings. The
                        group is therefore perfectly distinct and natural; yet if we attempt to
                        define it by any of the above-mentioned various properties, little
                        examination is requisite to convince us that the characteristic thus chosen
                        either disappears in the least perfect of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Vertebrata,</hi> or passes imperceptibly into the neighbouring groups.</p>
                    <p>“Thus in the fishes which compose the genera <hi rend="italic"

                        those parts which ought to have constituted their skeleton as vertebrated
                        animals become so soft and membranaceous that they may be considered as
                        having no bones. The organs of respiration and of manducation, the absolute
                        want of the sense of sight, the general habits and external form of these
                        singular fishes, all prove to us that they are connected with the <hi
                        rend="italic">Annelides,</hi> and that by them nature passes to the
                        structure of the <hi rend="italic">Annulosa.</hi> On the other hand, on
                        examining some of the <hi rend="italic">Ecliinoderma of</hi> Cuvier, such as
                        those composing the genus <hi rend="italic">Comatula,</hi> we may trace the
                        articulated texture of the <hi rend="italic">Annulosa</hi> into the division
                        of <hi rend="italic">Radiata,</hi> many of whose external forms are also
                        exactly imitated by the sessile <hi rend="italic">Cirrhipedes.</hi> Of the

                        >Acrita.</hi> So that the chain whose links we have endeavoured to unfold
                        returns into itself, and we find that all animals form a circle composed of
                        the following great divisions, viz.</p>

                    <p>“ This arrangement of animals is, it is true, quite distinct from that
                        generally adopted; but it will be seen that it is not only conformable to
                        nature, but that it removes many of the discrepancies which shock the
                        naturalist in the common systems. For instance, there is an acephalous
                        animal of the division <hi rend="italic">Mollusea</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >(Ascidia</hi><hi rend="italic">mammillaris,</hi> Linn.) which exists
                        without any visible organs of sense except that of taste, whose substance is
                        little better than a homogeneous gelatinous pulp, whose inert nature seems
                        to deprive it of any power like that of voluntary motion; a being which is
                        consequently reduced to fix itself to solid bodies, or to be the sport of
                        winds and waves, whose principal sign of life consists in the absorption and
                        spouting forth of water, and whose animal properties, in short, are all
                        comprised in its irritability, its circulation, and respiration. Yet because
                        these two last qualities appear in this animal, whose existence is little
                        better than vegetative, to bear some resemblance to the circulation and
                        respiration in some of the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> we find it
                        placed in the common systems before the bee, which astonishes us by its
                        industry and social qualities; before the ant, which excites our admiration
                        by its frugality and courage; and before the other numberless insects, which
                        by their manners and stratagems have often made the naturalist hesitate as
                        to the point where he would draw the line, and separate instinct from
                        reason.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    <p>Mr Kirby seems equally inclined to accord a step of precedence to the insect
                        and other annulose or articulated tribes over the Mollusea, or at least to
                        maintain that the latter should not be interposed between the former and the
                        vertebrated tribes. “If you inquire,” says he, “into the rank of each of
                        these sub-kingdoms, of course you will assign the principal station to the
                        <hi rend="italic">Vertebrates,</hi> which are the most perfectly organized,
                        to which man belongs, and over which he immediately presides. If we form the
                        scale according to the nervous system of each province, that in which the
                        organ of sensation and intellect is most concentrated will stand first; and
                        in proportion as this organ is multiplied and dispersed, will be the station
                        of the rest, which will place them in the order in which I have mentioned
                        them; and the <hi rend="italic">Annulosa,</hi> to which insects belong, will
                        precede the <hi rend="italic">Mollusea,</hi> which Cuvier and Lamarck had
                        placed before them on account of their system of circulation. But when we

                        unaccompanied by a more concentrated nervous system and more perfect
                        structure, cannot place an animal above those which in every other respect
                        so obviously excel them. With regard to <hi rend="italic">insects</hi>
                        particularly, we may further ask— who that considers how man employs his
                        powers and organs even in his most degraded state, or that contemplates the
                        wonderful works that he is enabled to accomplish when his faculties receive
                        their due cultivation and direction, can avoid regarding him as superior to
                        the rest of the animal creation ? And what unsophisticated mind, not
                        entangled in the trammels of system, when it surveys the industry, the
                        various proceedings, and almost miraculous works that have been laid before
                        you,—the waxen palaces of the bee,—the paper cottages of the wasp and
                        hornet, —the crowded metropolis of the white ants,—the arts, the
                        manufactures, and stratagems of other insects,—the associations and labours
                        for the common good of those that are gregarious ;—will not at once conclude
                        that they must be a superior race to the slug, the snail, and others, which
                        live only to eat and propagate their kind? Or who, that considers the
                        wonderful structure of the animals whose cause I advocate,—the analogy that
                        exists between their organs of manducation, of motion, and of sensation, and
                        between various other parts of it, with those of the higher animals,—the
                        acuteness of their senses, their wonderful strength of muscle, and powers of
                        locomotion,—but will think them superior to the headless and almost
                        inanimate oyster or muscle, or the conglomerate <hi rend="italic"
                        >Alcyonia,</hi> though they have a heart and circulation. Who, again, that
                        observes, that in proportion as pedate animals approach to the human type,
                        their motions are accomplished by fewer organs,—that man walks, <hi

                        perfect, and of a higher grade?”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    <p>Whoever regards the different classes of the animal kingdom with an observant
                        and discriminating eye, will not fail to perceive that the knowledge of any
                        organ in one particular division of nature is insufficient to enable us to
                        judge of its importance; for such are the changes in the organization of
                        animals, that a system of organs which performs the most important functions
                        in the first division, may either not exist in the next, or be found in a
                        secondary condition, and subordinate to some other system which has acquired
                        the preponderance. In truth, the anatomy of the higher classes having been
                        first profoundly, or at least laboriously studied, before the requisite
                        attention had been bestowed on the structure of Invertebrates, all those
                        organs and functional actions which were invariably more or less sustained
                        and apparent in these first divisions, have been regarded as fundamental,
                        and for this reason alone an equal importance in our systems of
                        classification has been attributed to them throughout the whole animal
                        kingdom. From this course of proceeding, as noticed by Μ. Straus,
                        approximations have resulted which break the natural relationship of many
                        divisions. For example, in the first great division of animals, respiration
                        and circulation being in fact two functions to which all the rest are more
                        or less subordinate, it has been imagined that we ought to regard them as
                        essential in the whole series of animals, and employ them as the sole basis
                        of classification. Among the Vertebrata these functions indeed afford the
                        firmest foundation for a natural distribution; but amongst other classes, on
                        the contrary, in which they are only secondary, their adoption has led to
                        the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746506" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6506-0096"/>
                        gravest errors and most palpable contradictions; for it not unfrequently
                        happens that one family of Invertebrata which respires by branchiae, cannot
                        be separated (keep· ing numerous natural affinities in view) from another
                        fa- ' mily in which the respiration is pulmonary or tracheal.<note

                        to combine vaiiety in the means with uniformity in the effect, we find that
                        among molluscous animals the circulation of the blood varies in its manner
                        <hi rend="italic">ad infinitum·,</hi> and has thus led to the most
                        artificial arrangements. Yet few animals in existence have the organs of
                        circulation more complicated than some of the Cephalopoda. Among the
                        annulose animals, also, in which the nature of the nervous system is so
                        uniformly accordant, circulation varies from an extremely perfect to an
                        evanescent state. A mode of nutrition and respiration takes place so
                        entirely different from that exhibited by the vertebrated and molluscous
                        tribes, that they never can be regarded as modifications of the same system.
                        As, then, the general plan of construction of these animals is so different,
                        Mr Macleay regards it as necessary to suppose that the new and dissimilar
                        system of respiration is that which more peculiarly characterizes the
                        annulose group, or, in the author’s words, “is that to which the structure
                        of the animals forming the group tends.” And what makes this supposition the
                        more probable is, that the Annelides, or red-blooded worms, which, of all
                        the articulated tribes, are placed by Cuvier the nearest to the vertebrated
                        classes, are nevertheless imperfectly organized, and of as dull perceptions
                        as any of the annulose division. This could hardly be the case were the
                        Annulosa to be considered with propriety as modifications of the vertebrated
                        structure, while, on the other hand, those annulose classes which respire by
                        tracheae, and coincide in nothing with a vertebrated animal, are,
                        nevertheless, the most active and industrious of their group, although their
                        activity and industry are of a nature entirely different from what is
                        observable among the vertebrated tribes. Now it is difficult, if not
                        impossible, to account for all this, unless we regard every vertebrated
                        creature to have been constructed by the great Creator with reference to one
                        type, and everyannulose with reference to another; and as the former is more
                        imperfect in proportion as it approaches the annulose structure, so the
                        latter also becomes more imperfect in proportion as it obtains a distinct
                        system of circulation and other characteristics of the vertebrated
                        tribes.</p>
                    <p>It thus follows that the animals which connect them ought to be extremely
                        imperfect in their organization; and this conclusion is well supported by
                        the sluggish Annelides, in which organs of sense are barely perceptible, and
                        organs of motion by no means so perfect as among the larvae of insects.<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"/> Μ. Straus also maintains
                        the opinion that it is the less perfect species of any one great group which
                        approach most closely to the group which precedes or follows them, and that
                        it hence results, that in any division, the species which offer the most
                        elevated organization may be more perfect than such as are placed at the
                        lower confines of a higher division. He admits that a more natural passage
                        exists from the Vertebrata to the Annu]osa, than from the former to the
                        Mollusea; but this connection he considers is by the lowest in the scale of
                        organization of each of these, groups. As soon as the Vertebrata reach the
                        most simple form compatible with their mode of organic life,the great Author
                        of nature commences from that point a new group, that named <hi
                        rend="italic">Annulos</hi><hi rend="italic
                        subscript"> α</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> by successively introducing a new
                        series of organs altogether different from those he has abandoned, and by
                        considerably modifying those he has retained. The genus <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ammo-caetes</hi> (and perhaps also that of <hi rend="italic">Myxine)</hi>
                        form this point among the Vertebrata, while <hi rend="italic">Gordius
                        wA</hi><hi rend="italic">Hirudo</hi> compose the corresponding link among
                        the annulose tribes. On either side these animals find their place at the
                        lowest point of the descending scale, formed by each of these two series;
                        and, compared with each other, the two genera of fishes just named, and the
                        abranchial <hi rend="italic">Annelides,</hi> present some remarkable
                        resemblances in the few organs which they possess.</p>
                    <p>The opinion that insects and other annulose animals are more nearly connected
                        with the Vertebrata than are the Mollusea, is regarded as true by Μ. Straus
                        Durckheim, both in regard to the modes of organization according to which
                        these three divisions are formed, and in relation to the degree in which
                        their faculties are developed. The Vertebrata, he observes, are
                        characterized by an articulated body, of which the two lateral,halves are
                        symmetrical, and are sustained by an internal skeleton, the central portion
                        of which is composed of a series of parts, to which the other osseous parts
                        are attached. In the Annulosa the symmetry of the two sides of the body is
                        still greater than in the Vertebrata; the body is likewise articulated, and
                        formed by a series of central parts, to which the others are attached,
                        although they have no internal skeleton. The nervous system in both consists
                        principally of a spinal marrow, from which arise most of the nerves of the
                        body; but there is this difference in the Vertebrata,—the spinal marrow is
                        dorsal, whereas it is ventral among the annulose tribes. The muscular system
                        is also as fully developed in the one as in the other, and offers nearly the
                        same distinct forms. The Mollusea, on the contrary, exhibit characters
                        totally at variance with those now mentioned; for, on the one hand, their
                        body no longer exhibits a perfect parity of parts, nor is it in any degree
                        articulated; on the other, the nervous system is not longitudinal, nor its
                        situation constant, while its mass is greatly decreased. The muscular system
                        is also in general much less perfect, and, considered in detail, the muscles
                        are less distinct, and only form, throughout the greater part of the body, a
                        mass of fibres so interlaced as to be incapable of separation, thus
                        conducting us to <hi rend="italic">Entozoa,</hi> of which the body is only a
                        continuous <hi rend="italic">parenchyma</hi> without distinct muscles.
                        According to the author last named, the character which eminently
                        distinguishes the Mollusea from the two other divisions is, that in these
                        the organs of <hi rend="italic">animal,</hi> in the Mollusea those of <hi
                        rend="italic">vegetable</hi> life, are the most predominant; from whence it
                        follows that the latter are totally devoid of industry, and of that higher
                        mode of perception approaching to <hi rend="italic">intelligence,</hi> which
                        insects possess in a degree surpassing all other invertebrated tribes.</p>
                    <p>Having entered into the preceding investigation with the view of illustrating
                        the true position of the annulose division in relation to the other
                        sub-kingdoms of animal life, we shall now, in more direct reference to the
                        proper subjects of our present dissertation, that is, the hexapod or
                        six-footed insects, exhibit, by means of the following diagram, the views
                        entertained by Mr Macleay regarding the natural affinities observable among
                        the annulose tribes themselves. The reader will perceive that the circles of

                    <p>CHAPTER VI.</p>
                    <p>THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF INSECTS.</p>
                    <p>This topic has indeed been much less attended to as a matter of philosophical
                        investigation than it deserves. When we take an extended view of the general
                        distribution of animals and plants, we find that they are usually disposed
                        over the earth’s surface in bands or parallel zones, corresponding in a
                        great measure with the peculiarities of temperature and climate which are
                        appropriate to the nature of each. When the temperature of a particular
                        latitude becomes colder, as on mountains or highly elevated plains,—or
                        warmer, as on plains by the sea shore, or in low lying sheltered valleys,—we
                        find, in the former case, that the species approximate in their nature and
                        characters to those of a more northern, in the latter to those of a more
                        southern parallel. Of course the zones of vegetable and of animal life do
                        not correspond at all strictly with the <hi rend="italic">latitudinal</hi>
                        lines of our geographical system. Humboldt has indeed shown, that within 15°
                        or 20° from the equator, the mean annual temperature is nearly the same in
                        all longitudes of equal elevation, or is at least but slightly varied by
                        local circumstances. In other words, the isothermal lines are more regularly
                        parallel with those of the equator. But in temperate and northern countries
                        the same uniformity of temperature in each portion of the same parallel is
                        not observable; all western coasts, and districts of continents and of
                        considerable islands, being of a higher temperature than those of the same
                        latitudes along the eastern shores. The mean temperature of the North Cape,
                        under the seventy-first degree of north latitude, does not exceed, indeed
                        corresponds with, that of Labrador, which is 14° further south; and that of
                        the west of Ireland, in the fifty-fourth degree, agrees with the forty-third
                        parallel in the United States.</p>
                    <p>In relation to zoological geography, 'indeed, there are several other minor
                        circumstances which tend to change or counterbalance the more usual results,
                        and consequently to derange such calculations as might very reasonably be
                        formed upon a knowledge of latitudinal and longitudinal position, and of the
                        height of a country above the level of the sea. The nature of the soil and
                        surface, the different degrees of dryness and humidity, and the consequent
                        character of the climate and vegetation, the comparative extent of land and
                        water, the extent and continuity of forests, marshes, and sandy deserts, the
                        direction of mountain ranges, and the form and position of lakes ;—these and
                        several other circumstances must be taken into consideration, and will be
                        found materially to affect the distribution of animal life over the surface
                        of the earth.</p>
                    <p>It does not appear that the climates of insects, or those peculiarities of
                        temperature and other physical attributes under which certain groups or
                        species appear to predominate, have been as yet studied in connection with
                        our imperfect knowledge of isothermal lines. Humboldt, indeed, has remarked,
                        that the geographical stations of the gnats and some other insects of South
                        America did not appear to depend solely on the <hi rend="italic">heat</hi>
                        of the climate, the excess of humidity, or the thickness of the forests, but
                        on local and unappreciable circumstances.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Personal
                        Narrative,</hi> vol. v. p. 88.</p></note> It is evident, however, that the
                        characteristic stations of insects are mainly dependent on the degree of
                        temperature, so influential on the development and distribution of all the
                        other varied forms of animal life. An increase of caloric seldom fails to
                        produce a corresponding increase and alteration in the number and character
                        of entomological forms; and when we travel from the hyperborean regions
                        towards the sunny south, we find that the tiny multitudes accumulate in all
                        the warmer portions of the temperate zone, till they swarm between the
                        tropics. Otho Fabricius resided six years in Greenland, and during that
                        period he collected only sixty-three species of the insect class, properly
                        so called. In the still higher latitude of Winter Harbour, where Sir Edward
                        Parry sojourned, only six species were collected from the beginning of
                        September till the August following. Mr Kirby has stated that in Greenland
                        every order of insect has its representatives, except Orthoptera and
                        Hemiptera; but in Melville Island, besides these deficiencies, neither
                        coleopterous nor neuropterous species exist, or at least were observable;
                        and even the mosquito, that shrill tyrant of the Lapland plains, appeared to
                        have ceased from troubling along those hyperborean shores. The most northern
                        locality of any insect yet ascertained is that of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Aphis borealis,</hi> taken in latitude 82° 26' 44", about one hundred miles
                        from the nearest known land.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>This species was found in the boat during the last day
                        of Sir E. Parry’s attempt to reach the north pole over the ice. There was no
                        vestige of vegetation around the adventurous party’; and we think it more
                        probable that the forlorn insect had been carried, <hi rend="italic"
                        >nolens</hi><hi rend="italic">volens,</hi> from a somewhat more southern
                        quarter.</p></note> It is probable, however, that the distribution of many
                        northern species is still unknown. It was formerly supposed that in Iceland
                        there were none, and that even in Norway there were very few, their absence
                        from those countries being attributed to excess of cold. This opinion,
                        however, was contradicted by Horrebow, so far as Iceland was concerned; and
                        Olafsen and Povalsen, during their sojourn there, collected 200 different
                        species in one small valley. It must indeed be borne in mind, that insects
                        can escape the extreme of cold, not only, as Mr Macleay observes, by passing
                        certain periods in the <hi rend="italic">pupa</hi> or torpid state, but also
                        by being while in that condition usually buried in the earth, where they are
                        greatly protected from the rigours of the winter season. “What they chiefly

                        principle. On the American continent the extremes of heat and cold in the
                        course of the year are, as is well known, incompaia-bly greater than in
                        places of the same latitude in Europe. We may therefore readily conceive how
                        particular families of insects will inhabit a wider range of latitude in the
                        former country than in the latter. W e see also how insects may swarm ijι

                        summer can boast of extraordinary rises in the thermometer; because the
                        energy of the vital principle in such animals is, within certain limits,
                        proportionate to the degree of warmth to which they may be subjected, and
                        escapes in a manner the severe action of cold.”<note anchored="true"

                        certainly at first seems an extraordinary circumstance in the geography of
                        insects; namely, that their tropical structure extends much farther north in
                        America than in Europe; that is, in a manner directly the reverse of that
                        which has been noted by botanists to occur in the vegetable kingdom. For
                        example, the <hi rend="italic">Chamcerops</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >humilis,</hi> a species of palm, occurs along the southern shore of France,
                        in latitude 44°; while on the eastern coasts of North America the hardiest
                        of the family, <hi rend="italic">C. palmetto,</hi> does not advance beyond
                        the 34°. But if we examine <hi rend="italic">Copris</hi><hi rend="italic"

                        shall find their difference of structure infinitely less than that which
                        would result from a comparison of the entomological productions of the
                        environs of Madrid with those of the banks of the Congo.<note

                    <p>A slight consideration of the subject suffices to show that certain
                        differences in the relative intensities of summer and of winter must
                        exercise a strongly modifying power on the influence, of mean annual
                        temperature, even in countries where that temperature is one and the same.
                        “Several fruits, as the olive and grape, as well as the different kinds of
                        corn and other annuals, depend more on the heat of summer than of the whole
                        year; while others, impatient of cold, and not requiring great heat, have
                        their range more influenced by the temperature of winter. Now, it is almost
                        an universal rule, that of two places whose mean temperature is the same,
                        that nearest the sea, and more particularly a western sea, has a temperate
                        summer and a milder winter. Hence the inland situation is better adapted to
                        the growth of corn and fruits, the maritime one to the preservation of
                        tender plants. In Europe, the northern boundary of the vine and olive rises
                        as we go eastward, though in so doing we encounter a lower mean annual
                        temperature. The <hi rend="italic">Arbutus Unedο, Sibthorpia Europ&lt;xa,

                        Whatever vegetation requires the absence of extreme cold rather than the
                        presence of extreme heat, will probably extend itself in a tropical form
                        more towards the poles on a dry continent than on a moist or marshy one.
                        Tropical plants, therefore, will thrive better in Thibet and other inland
                        parts of northern Asia, than they would do if transported to positions of
                        the same latitude in America; for in the latter country the extremes of heat
                        and cold are too distant from each other, f hus the vegetation of Canada
                        does not correspond either in its general character' or its amount of
                        species, with that of the corresponding latitudes of France.<note

                    <p>Mr Macleay admits, that although in his opinion the insect tribes suffer less
                        in cold climates than plants, for] the reasons which we have already stated,
                        it does not therefore follow that the prevalence of cold has no effect in
                        relation to the destruction, or rather we should say the prevention, of
                        insect life. In truth the diminution of the number of species becomes very
                        conspicuous as we advance towards the poles. But this the learned author of
                        the <hi rend="italic">Horae Entomologicae</hi> supposes to be owing rather
                        to the short continuance of the summer warmth than to the lowness of its
                        existing degree. In accordance with this view we certainly find that many
                        insects, such as gnats, mosquitoes, &amp;c. which pass their larva state in
                        water,—thus avoiding the external cold, and whose existence in the perfect
                        state being naturally ephemeral, must therefore suffer little from the
                        shortness of summer,—are nowhere more troublesome than among the moors and
                        marshes of the north. On the other hand, the number of <hi rend="italic"
                        >coleopterous</hi> species, which, being naturally longer lived, require a
                        greater continuance of warmth, is sensibly diminished amid those dreary
                        wastes.</p>
                    <p>It is natural to suppose that if certain plants are peculiar to certain
                        climates, so also insects, the greater proportion of which not only feed on
                        plants, but are each according to its kind almost restricted to particular
                        species, must in like manner be characteristic of special localities.
                        Whether this restriction in diet holds good in relation to the carnivorous
                        kinds, that is, whether one kind of carcass is not as good as another, is a
                        point which has not yet attracted the consideration of the naturalist. Such
                        as feed on living animals (the <hi rend="italic">thalcrophagous</hi>
                        Carnivora) are probably more restricted in their parasitical attachments.
                        But the coprophagous or dung beetles, and such as prey on dead animals (the
                        <hi rend="italic">saprophagous</hi> Carnivora), may be supposed to be less
                        regular in the limits of their localities, occurring wherever their
                        favourite food happens (not seldom accidentally) to have been deposited. In
                        such cases, of course, less advantage results to the entomologist from local
                        references, as the appearance of an insect in the place cited may have been
                        entirely accidental, and incapable of affording any great probability of its
                        recurrence; yet even the saprophagous beetles are no doubt regulated by
                        temperature and elevation, and it is likely that a dead body by the sea
                        shore will exhibit different species from a similar nidus exposed on a
                        mountain summit.</p>
                    <p>The geographical distribution of insects in general is, in truth, a subject
                        of too difficult and complex a nature to admit of being worthily treated
                        within our present limits. We shall, however, notice a few facts which,
                        though presented in a somewhat desultory manner, we trust will not be found
                        entirely devoid of interest.</p>
                    <p>We may observe, in the first place, that there are two aspects under which
                        the subject of zoological geography may be viewed. We may either proceed
                        upon the consideration of the divisions laid down by politicogeographical
                        writers,—divisions which are no doubt sufficiently arbitrary in relation to
                        the physical qualities of countries,—and describe or indicate the species
                        and genera which we have ascertained to characterize such divisions, —or we
                        may take into view the Systematic arrangements of naturalists, and by
                        tracing and pointing out the different localities of the various tribes,
                        genera, and species which we find there arranged, thus arrive by another
                        route at the conclusions sought for. We shall here, even <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193746545" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6545-0099"/> at the risk of appearing
                        immethodical, combine, in some measure, both these processes; and while we
                        indicate the varied localities of certain species, we shall also give an
                        occasional sketch of the equally varied entomological productions of
                        particular portions of the earth’s surface.</p>
                    <p>We formerly remarked that no coleopterous insect was noticed in Melville

                        however, an aquatic beetle well known throughout Great Britain, inhabits the

                        is not only spread over the south of Europe, and most of the countries

                        >Staphylinus,</hi> &amp;c.) have undoubtedly their metropolis or centre of
                        dominion in the temperate zone, and more especially within the British
                        islands; for while Dcjean, in the last edition of his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Catalogue</hi> (1833), gives only 789 species as his total amount both of
                        European and exotic kinds, Mr Stephens enumerates above 750 as indigenous to
                        Britain. This apparent excess may, however, partly arise from the great
                        attention which has been paid in this country to the collection of the
                        minuter sorts, which are frequently neglected in foreign lands for the sake
                        of the more showy and imposing species. The genus <hi rend="italic"

                        preceding observations: in a torpid state, or under the form of larvae, they
                        are capable of enduring the utmost rigour of a Swedish winter; but when
                        revived by the returning spring, the cool and variable summers of our
                        “sea-girt isle” would prove insuflicient for the full development of their

                        characteristic countries. The entomological characters of the southern
                        shores of Europe strongly exhibit their geographical approach to the African
                        continent. The <hi rend="italic">Ateuchus</hi><hi rend="italic">sacer</hi>
                        (the renowned species sculptured of old by the Egyptians on their sacred

                        have their centre of dominion in the burning deserts. Along the
                        Mediterranean shores the entomological traveller may study the habits of
                        many curious insects of the genera <hi rend="italic">Onitis, Cebrio,
                        Pirnelia, Brachycerus, Brentus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Scarites,</hi>
                        and may also enrich his collection by the capture of many beautiful
                        butterflies, and other lepidopterous insects, which are more truly
                        characteristic of Northern Africa. Spain especially exhibits many features
                        of African zoology. We shall not here talk of the cameleons, the scorpions,
                        and other species belonging to the separate classes of reptiles and
                        Arachnides; but the European entomologist will there discover for the first

                        are delighted with the hitherto unknown forms <hi rend="italic">of Anthia,

                        and moister shores of Europe.</p>
                    <p>But no sooner do we leave the Mediterranean coasts of Africa, and enter upon
                        the more weary and disastrous pilgrimage of the great deserts, the
                        apparently limitless expanse of which so soon greets the eye of the yet
                        undaunted traveller, than almost all vestiges of European life, whether
                        human or brute, disappear; and Nubia, Ethiopia, Senegal, and a great part of
                        Guinea, exhibit entomological forms, cognate in character when compared
                        among themselves, but separated in every sense of the words “<hi
                        rend="italic">longo intervallo'</hi> from those of Europe. As we proceed
                        farther southwards, where the chariot of the “Great Apollo” rolls on with a
                        still fiercer and more fiery lustre, and the beams of a vertical sun induce
                        even the tawny Moor and the woolly-headed negro to avoid his scorching and
                        sometimes fatal rays, we discover many extraordinary forms of insect life,
                        called into existence through the instrumentality of that bright effulgence
                        which the pale-faced European has so often sought to withstand in vain. From
                        the burning regions of Guinea, and the parched shores of the Congo, we
                        derive the finest of those magnificent coleopterous insects named
                        generically <hi rend="italic">Goliathus</hi> by Lamarck. The western and
                        equinoctial parts of Africa also yield us the species of <hi rend="italic"

                    <p>Both Madagascar and St Helena present a few insects which, to a certain
                        extent, demonstrate the African complexion of those islands; but the latter
                        especially is also allied, by its entomological features, to some of the
                        southwestern countries of Asia. According to Latreille, Africa furnishes no
                        species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Passalus,</hi> although it is
                        elsewhere widely distributed over America and the East Indies. The genera
                        <hi rend="italic">Graphypterus, Eurichora,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Pneu-mora,</hi> are probably peculiar to z∖frica. Among the hemipterous
                        insects of Africa may be mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Mantis</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">precaria,</hi> an object of superstitious veneration among the
                        Hottentots, who hold in the highest respect the person on whom the insect
                        happens to alight. Locusts are of common occurrence in many parts of Africa,
                        where, as “a great people and a strong,” they still produce their days of
                        “darkness and of gloominess,” their days “of clouds and of thick darkness,”
                        so magnificently described by the Prophet Joel. One of the most formidable
                        of the insect tribes of this continent is the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Termes</hi><hi rend="italic">bellicosus,</hi> or <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193746558" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6558-0100"/> white ant. It dwells in
                        congregated troops, consisting of labourers, soldiers, and sovereigns. The
                        habitations are of a conical form, built of mud and clay, from ten to twelve
                        feet high, and divided in the interior by thin partitions into a variety of
                        cells. Indeed, Jobson, in his <hi rend="italic">History of Guinea,</hi>
                        alleges that they are often twenty feet high; and he adds, that he
                        frequently found them extremely serviceable in screening himself and his
                        companions while engaged in the pursuit of antelopes and other game. The
                        queen-mother of this species becomes of so enormous a size in the pregnant
                        state, that her abdomen exceeds, by two thousand times, the bulk of the rest
                        of her body; and when the ova are fully formed, she obtrudes them at the
                        rate of sixty in a minute, or 72,000 in twenty-four hours. Madeira and the
                        Canary Islands are decidedly African in their productions,—the insects,
                        especially, exhibiting a strong relationship to those of Barbary and the
                        adjacent districts.</p>
                    <p>Latreille, while considering the geographical distribution of insects, has
                        well observed, that where the empire of Flora terminates, there the domain
                        of zoology likewise comes to an end. Animals which feed on vegetables cannot
                        support themselves in a region entirely sterile, and such as are carnivorous
                        are thus themselves indirectly deprived of sustenance in consequence of the
                        want of vegetation. Those countries of which the vegetable productions are
                        the most gorgeous and abundant, are likewise the most productive of insect
                        life. Both effects spring from a temperature high and continuously
                        sustained, from moderate moisture, and a varied soil. The more closely, on
                        the contrary, we approach the other extreme, where clouds and darkness
                        obscure the sky, and the ground is so often covered with a pure but
                        unproductive garment of snow, and the lifeless solitude of the mountain
                        valleys is defended by the icy battlements of the enduring glaciers,—the
                        more we shall perceive a diminution in the amount of organic, and more
                        especially of insect life. If, instead of travelling northwards to the polar
                        plains, we ascend some majestic mountain even of a tropical range, the same
                        phenomena are observable. Although its base should be laved by the
                        glittering waters of an equatorial sea, and its sloping sides should bear
                        the arborescent ferns and plumy palm trees of the warmest climes,—still,
                        should the mountain belong to the highest class, like those of Cayambé or
                        Chimborazo, long before the traveller has approached its barren summit, he
                        will perceive the most striking symptoms of that sterility which we are apt
                        to associate only with the polar regions. The “bright consummate flowers” of
                        the lower plains have disappeared,— the parrots in their gay attire no
                        longer adorn the stunted trees,—and the insect tribes, so fantastic in their
                        forms, and of such surpassing lustre, have gradually decreased in size and
                        number, and at last present, in common with the vegetable kingdom, an aspect
                        and character much more allied to those of northern climes. Finally, unless
                        it may be that some giant condor, or other bird of loftiest flight, is seen
                        floating in the thin air of those extremest heights, there is nothing to
                        remind the adventurous traveller that he is actually within the <hi
                        rend="italic">burning</hi> tropics; for all his perceptions and* sensations
                        might be identical were he suddenly transported to the summit of Mount

                    <p>An earthquake-rifted mountain of bright snow.</p>
                    <p>It is thus that, on the Central Alps of Europe, we meet with many species
                        characteristic of, though not peculiar to, the plains of northern countries.

                        snow-surrounded valleys of Switzerland. Many other butterflies which, in the
                        northern provinces of France, occur not far from warm and low-lying
                        sheltered stations, are found in the southern departments and in Italy on
                        alpine or sub-alpine situations. The same may be said of <hi rend="italic"

                        supposed to preclude any great disparity in the entomological productions of
                        its geographical divisions, there is an obvious difference between its
                        southern and northern quarters. The colder and more cloudy clime of Scotland
                        is poor in Lepidoptera of the finer kinds. Here no purple emperor, “proud of
                        cerulean dyes,” floats over the far-stretching branches of our oaks and

                        to observe the analogy which exists between the insects, more especially the
                        Coleoptera of Scotland and of Sweden. Several of the rarest, species lately
                        discovered in the northern quarters of the island, such as <hi rend="italic"

                        of the north-western division of the continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p>From these and similar observations, those who have viewed the science of
                        entomology with a philosophic eye have endeavoured, in common with
                        geographers, to divide the surface of the earth into different climatic
                        regions. But while the latter have assumed as a basis the progressive
                        differences in the longest continuance of the natural day, the former
                        proceed upon a knowledge of the mean temperature of countries. Fabricius, in
                        his <hi rend="italic">Philosophia</hi><hi rend="italic">Entomologica,</hi>
                        divides climate in general into eight subclimates, or restricted stations,
                        viz. the <hi rend="italic">Indian,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Southern,</hi>
                        the <hi rend="italic">Mediterranean,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"

                        >Western,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Alpine.</hi> But it is easy, as Μ.
                        Latreille has remarked, to perceive, by the enumeration of the particular
                        countries which are referred to each of these divisions, that the divisions
                        themselves arc by no means established on a fixed foundation; and that the
                        suppression of several would be necessary were the principle on which they
                        are established followed out with rigour. The subclimate which he names <hi
                        rend="italic">Mediterranean</hi> comprises the countries adjacent to the
                        Mediterranean Sea, with Media and Armenia. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Northern</hi> extends from Paris to Lapland. 1he <hi rend="italic"
                        >Eastern</hi> consists of the north of Asia, of Siberia, and of the cold or
                        mountainous portion of Syria. The <hi rend="italic">ĩĩ estern</hi> contains
                        Canada, the United States, Japan, and una. From these it will be seen that
                        this arrangement is in many respects extremely arbitrary; for several of the
                        above-named districts, although placed under separate climates, have a mean
                        temperature identically the same. Moreover, many countries in which the mean
                        temperature is the same, are characterized and distinguished <pb break="no"

                        the nature of their animal produc- tions.</p>
                    <p>Μ. Latreille has taken another view of this interesting subject, more in
                        conformity with the dictum of' Linnaeus, regarding the characters of genera,
                        the spirit of which may be also here applied. “Let the insects point out the
                        climate, and not the climate the insects.” He takes into consideration all
                        those genera which seem to be appropriated exclusively to certain
                        determinate spaces on the surface of our earth. It is true that the
                        groundwork of this method is much more restricted than that from which
                        Humboldt and other writers on botanical geography have deduced their
                        observations on the distribution of plants; for our knowledge of the precise
                        localities of foreign insects is by no means ample.<note anchored="true"

                        upbraids the majority of scientific travellers with their negligence in
                        these particulars; for it is not the locality alone, but the physical
                        character of the climate, the mineralogical qualities of the soil, the
                        vicinity of wood and water, and the height above the level of the sea, which
                        ought to be noted in connection with the occurrence of particular species.
                        We have already noticed the fondness of <hi rend="italic">Papilio</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi> and other insects for a calcareous soil. The
                        <hi rend="italic">Pimelia bicaudata,</hi> so common in the neighbourhood of

                        genus, this entomological relation no doubt results from the soil of these
                        countries being impregnated with saline particles, and abounding in plants

                        exhibit many analogies.</p>
                    <p>The following propositions result from Μ. Latreille’s researches in
                        Entomology.</p>
                    <p>l<hi rend="italic">st</hi>, The totality or a great proportion of the insects
                        which’ occur in countries of which the qualities of the soil and temperature
                        are analogous, are nevertheless of different species, if these countries,
                        though placed under the same parallel, are widely distant from each other.
                        All the insects brought from the most eastern parts of Asia, for example
                        China, are distinct from those of Europe and of Africa, whatever may be the
                        latitude, elevation, or mean temperature of these Asiatic countries.</p>
                    <p>2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, The generality of insects still differ
                        specifically in countries agreeing in the characters of their soil and
                        temperature, but separated, independently of mere latitudinal difference, by
                        great natural barriers, such as chains of lofty mountains, vast sandy
                        deserts, or the waters of an intervening ocean. Thus the species of New
                        Holland or of America are easily recognised among those of the various
                        countries of the ancient world; and even the insects of Grenada and Peru,
                        though at no great distance from those of Guiana, are in a great measure
                        different, owing no doubt to the interposition of the vast chain of the
                        Cordilleras. When we pass from Piedmont into France by the Col de Tende, we
                        perceive a marked difference of species, even in that short journey. These
                        rules, however, like most others, however general, are subject to several
                        individual exceptions. Several species of insect are distributed over such a
                        vast extent of territory as entitles them to be regarded as genuine
                        cosmopolites. Thus the painted lady-butterfly (<hi rend="italic"
                        >Vanessa</hi><hi rend="italic">Cardui)</hi> is found over great portions of
                        Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, and is as] familiarly known in the
                        central islands of the vast Pacific Ocean, as in the flower-gardens of
                        England.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                        have already mentioned the great extent of territory occupied by several
                        aquatic beetles; and these and other examples which might be adduced remind
                        us of M. Latreille’s next proposition.</p>
                    <p>3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, Many <hi rend="italic">genera</hi> of insects, and
                        particularly such as feed on vegetables, are spread over numerous points of
                        the principal divisions of our globe.</p>
                    <p>4<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, Other genera are exclusively proper to a certain
                        extent of country, whether of the ancient continents or the new. According
                        to Latreille, no species of the genera <hi rend="italic">Anthia,

                        family <hi rend="italic">Scarabeidae</hi> are likewise there unknown. But
                        the western world, on the other hand, produces several genera which we do
                        not meet with elsewhere,—such as <hi rend="italic">Agra,</hi><hi

                    <p>5<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, Many species in their natal countries effect
                        particular localities. Several alpine butterflies are never observed at any
                        considerable distance from the region of perpetual snow, while other species
                        prefer the warmer air of low-lying sheltered meads at no great height above
                        the level of the sea.</p>
                    <p>6<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, Both the ancient continent and the new may be
                        divided into zones, successively extending in the direction of the
                        meridians, and the breadth of which is measurable by a portion of a circle
                        parallel to the equator. The species proper to one of these zones disappear
                        gradually, and give place in the same manner to those of the zone following;
                        so that from space to space the dominating species, or even the totality,
                        have undergone a change.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        changes to that series of horizons which the traveller discovers in
                        proportion as he removes from his first point of departure.</p>
                    <p>Sweden presents us with many insects peculiar to that country, some of which
                        are confined to its more northern provinces, such as Lapland. But its
                        southern portions, •for example Scania, produce, though still in limited
                        numbers, many German insects. France, as far as the 45th or 44th degree,
                        supplies the entomologist with many of the species which occur in the
                        last-named countries; but the Rhine and its eastern mountains form a kind of
                        frontier line, which many others do not appear to pass. The first of the
                        species characteristic of the warmer regions of <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193746584" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6584-0102"/> Western Europe show
                        themselves towards the inferior course of the Seine, in pretty close
                        accordance with the point where the vine is vigorous in the open air,
                        independent of any succour derived from merely local circumstances. <hi

                        change,—which becomes still more obvious at Fontainebleau and the environs
                        of Orleans, where, in addition to the above-named species, we may perceive
                        <hi rend="italic">Phasma</hi><hi rend="italic">Possii, Mantis</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">pagana,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sphinx celerio-</hi> But
                        these are but the forerunners of such as are native to southern countries
                        properly so called. The culture of the olive, the spontaneous growth of the
                        Arbutus, the pomegranate, and of lavender, are botanical symptoms which
                        cherish in the mind of an instructed entomologist the hopes of a rich
                        increase. This change is very obvious in France, when, journeying from Paris
                        to Marseilles, we reach the territory of Montélimart. The eastern provinces
                        of Spain, those sunny regions where the orange and the palm-tree are
                        luxuriant without the aid of man, produce more abundantly the rarer southern
                        insects of France, intermingled with species hitherto unperceived in
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>Our knowledge of the insects of the south-east of Europe is by no means
                        ample. Latreille informs us that the <hi rend="italic">Papilio
                        Chrysippus</hi> of Linnaeus, common in Egypt and the East Indies, makes its
                        first appearance as a European species in the kingdom of Naples. The greater
                        proportion, however, of the Egyptian species are entirely unknown in Europe,
                        although they pertain, in numerous instances, to the same natural families
                        as our own. The southern parts of that land of pyramids produce many
                        magnificent species of <hi rend="italic">Copris,</hi> such as <hi
                        rend="italic">C. Midas,</hi><hi rend="italic">Bucephalus, Antenor,
                        Gigas,</hi> and other insects peculiar to warm countries, and seldom found
                        at any great distance from the equinoctial line of the old continent.</p>
                    <p>Similar successions of species take place from east to west, and
                        reciprocally. Most of the insects which ocçur in Normandy and Brittany
                        likewise inhabit the southern parts of England. The northerly departments of
                        France, situated on the banks of the Rhine, have in many respects a
                        community of species with the neighbouring provinces of Germany; while,
                        again, several species of the Levant, such as <hi rend="italic">Cantharis
                        orientalis,</hi><hi rend="italic">Mylabris crassiconis,</hi> a beautiful
                        variety of <hi rend="italic">Melolontha</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >occidentalis</hi> brought home by Olivier, and certain diurnal Lepidoptera,
                        appear to have journeyed far westward from their ancestral homes, and fixed
                        their abode in the Austrian territory. The collections formed by Olivier in
                        Asia Minor, Syria, and Persia, prove that the insects of those countries,
                        though nearly related to those of the south of Europe, are not specifically
                        the same; and a like judgment, with some exceptions, may be entertained of
                        the species of Southern Russia and the Crimea. The entomological productions
                        of the coast of Coromandel, of Bengal, of the south of China, and even of
                        Thibet, possess many characters in common; but they are entirely distinct
                        from those of Europe. In the regions just named we discover no species of
                        the genera <hi rend="italic">Graphipterus, Ahis,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Scaurus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Pimelia, Sepidium,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >Erodia,</hi> for of these nature appears to have granted the exclusive
                        possession to the south-western regions of the ancient continent, Although
                        Fabricius assigns the East Indies as the native country of certain species
                        of <hi rend="italic">Brachgeerus,</hi> Latreille has been unable to identify
                        any from such locality. The genus <hi rend="italic">Anthia</hi> is said to
                        occur in Bengal, but not farther eastward.</p>
                    <p>The great Asiatic division of our globe, when considered in its entomological
                        and other zoological relations., may indeed be partitioned into several
                        different departments.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                        severity of its winter season, possesses, even in its southern districts,
                        many attributes of the arctic regions; while its inland valleys, and the
                        upper basins of its numer. ous and far-flowing rivers, are enriched, during
                        a brilliant though short-lived summer, with many of the more gorgeous forms
                        of insect life. Another vast and imperfectly known region of Asia is bounded
                        to the north by Siberia, and to the south by those highly elevated
                        table-lands which terminate among the Himalaya Mountains. This division
                        still presents several features which prove its assimilation in some
                        respects to the characters which distinguish animal life in Europe; for
                        although it is undoubtedly characterized by numerous peculiar forms of
                        existence, yet many of its genera and species are either the genuine types
                        of groups which occur in countries with which we are familiar, or pertain to
                        groups which are themselves well exemplified by European insects. But we now
                        speak rather in relation to the higher animals than the insect tribes; for,
                        in truth, of the Entomology of Central Asia we have as yet a most inadequate
                        idea. Among the Himalaya Mountains, and other southern portions of this
                        division, we begin to discover many genera of birds which occur in the lower
                        lands of Hindustan and the peninsular projection of Malacca; and if the
                        entomological kingdom is at all regulated by corresponding rules, we may
                        infer that some of the southern insects also make their way up those
                        stupendous valleys. The same circumstance» indeed occurs, we mean the like
                        transition of species, in all the great geographical sections of the groups
                        of animal life. “Each extensive division is characterized by several
                        peculiar forms, and yet at the same time nourishes many species which are
                        common alike to it and to other regions; and it is only under some peculiar
                        circumstances of local situation, that either the zoological or botanical
                        products undergo a sudden change in character and condition. As the
                        adventurous and observant traveller advances on his journey, a few species
                        are continually perceived to decrease in number, and then to disappear,
                        while their places are supplied by others, which, at first but thinly
                        scattered, gradually acquire an accession of numbers, till they too have
                        reached their full amount or centre of dominion; but the change being only
                        partial from place to place, the difference is no more suddenly perceptible
                        than that in the horizon by which the traveller is surrounded, and a portion

                        sooner do we enter upon the zoology of India Proper, than the European forms
                        of animal life almost entirely disappear, and are succeeded by others of a
                        richer and more varied character of form and aspect, some of which, however,
                        extend to the parallel latitudes of the African continent. The Asiatic
                        Islands again present us with another picture, and this latter change may be
                        said to commence at the southern extremity of the Isthmus of Malacca. Java
                        and Sumatra, in Mr Swainson’s opinion, will probably be found to be the
                        metropolis or central region of this range, which still produces several of
                        the forms of Northern India; while in New Guinea and New Ireland, the
                        Asiatic forms properly so called begin to disappear, and are replaced by
                        many singular and interesting species, which exhibit the commencement of
                        what may be termed the Australian kingdom. <hi rend="italic">Papilio</hi><hi

                        to Africa. Nevertheless the species are distinct, and many of them present
                        no analogy whatever to those of the continent. The Isles of France and
                        Bourbon likewise manifest traces of the same family resemblance; but, on a
                        general view, they show a closer connection with the East Indian species.
                        Their ascertained number is, however, extremely limited.<note

                    <p>Although the Entomology of New Holland may be said, like that of all other
                        vast tracts of country, to exhibit a special type, it is yet composed, in
                        some of its principal portions, of species analogous to those of the
                        Moluccas and the south-east of India. This great fifth continent, as it has
                        been called, is, however, less rich in insects than many other foreign
                        countries, its soil being drier, and not so well wooded. The genus <hi
                        rend="italic">Mylabris,</hi> so abundant in the south of Europe, in Africa,
                        and Asia, does not appear to pass beyond Timor. In that respect, then, New
                        Holland agrees with America, as well as in the possession of <hi
                        rend="italic">Passalus,</hi> a genus of which the species have been more
                        particularly noted as inhabitants of the new world. Several generic groups
                        of the latter region present a closer resemblance to those of the east of
                        Asia, than to such as are characteristic of the ancient world. The insects
                        of New Zealand, of New Caledonia, and the circumjacent islcs, show an
                        obvious relation to those of New Holland; and the same may be said of such
                        as occur in the archipelagos of the Great Southern Ocean. These islands,
                        composed in great measure of aggregations of polypiferous rocks, form a
                        chain which unites them in a westerly direction to the preceding regions,
                        and from which many of their natural productions may have been received in
                        the long course of ages. This natural communication could not have taken
                        place with the new world, and thus many of these islands, although rather
                        American than otherwise, according to their geographical position, may be
                        regarded as Asiatic in regard to their animal and vegetable products.</p>
                    <p>The new world has also been observed to present progressive changes in the
                        succession of its species, in connection with every considerable difference
                        in the latitude and longitude. M. Bose collected in Carolina many species
                        which were unknown in Pennsylvania, and were still more foreign to New York;
                        and the researches of Abbot in illustration of the Lepidoptera of Georgia
                        demonstrate the existence in that province of certain species which have
                        their central station in the Antilles. The banks of the far-stretching
                        Missouri, about twenty degrees to the west of Philadelphia, produce many
                        peculiar species. The Entomology of the Antilles presents a strong contrast
                        to that of the United States. Trinidad, under the tenth degree of north
                        latitude, presents us with truly equatorial species, such as the splendid
                        butterflies called Teucer and Menelaus, which do not occur in St Domingo.
                        Brazil, so gorgeous in its insect tribes, possesses species in common with
                        Cayenne, but it also produces many others peculiar to itself. Latreille
                        differs from Mr Macleay in his opinion regarding the comparative extension,
                        in a northerly direction, of the southern species in the new and old world.
                        He states that the southern species of the western hemisphere do not attain
                        to so high a latitude as they do on the ancient continents. Here, he thinks,
                        they begin to appear between the forty-eighth and forty-ninth degrees of
                        north latitude; there, not until we gain the forty-third degree.<note

                        Germany, yet the summers are intensely hot; so that though tropical <hi

                        consideration certain peculiarities in the physical constitution of
                        America,—its well watered surface, its lofty mountains, its majestic
                        forests, and humid atmosphere,— we shall easily understand how many genera
                        of the ancient continent, dwelling by preference in dry, warm, and sandy
                        situations, for example <hi rend="italic">Anthia, Pimelia, Erodius,</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">Brachycerus,</hi> should not occur in the comparatively
                        rich, moist, and shaded soils of the new world. Thus also the carnivorous
                        Coleoptera in America are proportionally of smaller amount than in the old
                        continent, although no Quarter of the globe is more productive of large and
                        splendid species among the phytophagous or vegetable-eating tribes of
                        insects. However, the south of China and the Moluccas still maintain a
                        certain superiority in the production of such splendid examples of the
                        lepidopterous order as <hi rend="italic">Papilio Priamus</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Bombyx Atlas,</hi> of which the dimensions surpass those of
                        the American species. A fact noted by Latreille is worthy of remembrance,
                        viz. that Europe, Africa, and Western Asia, arc extremely unproductive of
                        the genus <hi rend="italic">Phasma,</hi> or the spectre insect, and that
                        such of the species as do occur are extremely small, while the Moluccas and
                        South America produce many of remarkable size. The atmospheric humidity of
                        the new world, its narrow and elongated form, the nature of its soil, and
                        the vast extent of ocean by which it is environed, arc sufficient reasons
                        for the disagreement observable between its productions and those of
                        corresponding latitudes in our own hemisphere. The new world, in fact, bears
                        in many respects the same relation to the old that Britain does to a great
                        portion of Europe.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    <p>We have already alluded to the classification of climste given by Fabricius,
                        and to certain circumstances which have been supposed to render the adoption
                        of that classification unadvisable. Latreille has viewed the same subject
                        under a better aspect. He considers the northern extremities of Greenland
                        and of Spitzbergen, under the eighty-first degree of northern latitude, as
                        the points where vegetation terminates. But to obviate all difficulty, and
                        with a view to establish a duodecimal division, which is not only convenient
                        in itself, but also in frequent accordance with the actual observation of
                        geographical groups, he raises this supposed limit of vegetation three
                        degrees higher, that is, to the eighty-fourth degree. If we then divide into
                        successive spaces of twelve degrees, a meridian commencing from the western
                        parts or Spitzbergen, or those nearest to Greenland, we shall have a suite
                        of latitudes corresponding successively to the limits of the countries
                        already alluded to in relation to their zoological productions. He continues
                        these sections duodecimally or by twelve degrees, beyond the equator, and
                        towards the antarctic pole, and stops about the sixtieth degree of southern
                        latitude, under the parallel of Sandwich Land, regarded in that direction as
                        the <hi rend="italic">ne</hi><hi rend="italic">plus ultra</hi> of
                        geographical discovery.</p>
                    <p>It appears that a difference in latitude of twelve degrees always produces a
                        very sensible change in the mass of insect species; and that if that space
                        is doubled, the alteration is almost total; as, for example, between the <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193746610" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6610-0104"/> north of
                        Sweden and the north of Spain. An analogous change takes place in relation
                        to the <hi rend="italic">longitude,</hi> but more slowly, and after a
                        traverse of a greater distance; since the mean temperature, but for causes
                        of a particular and local nature, is not widely different under the same
                        parallel. In proportion as we approach the pole, the extent occupied by
                        particular races embraces a greater number of geographical divisions.</p>
                    <p>The insects of America, even those of its northern provinces, at least as far
                        as Canada, may be said to differ specifically from those of Europe; but the
                        species of Greenland may rather be regarded as European. The last-named
                        country, so far as the entomological geography of the ancient continent is
                        concerned, is assumed by Latreille as the point of departure for his first
                        meridian. In any view it may be regarded as intermediate between the two
                        hemispheres. The Canaries, the Cape de Verd Islands, and Madeira, are
                        African, judging from their entomological productions. The meridian above
                        named will thus follow a middle line between these islands and the most
                        eastern cape of South America, that of St Roque, near Rio Grande, in Brazil.
                        It will pass by the western isles, or archipelago of the Azores, and by the
                        island of Ascension, and will abut to the westward of Sandwich Land. Its
                        longitude will be thirty-four degrees to the west of the meridian of Paris.
                        According to Latreille’s observations on the insects collected by Olivier in
                        Persia, their general relationship to those of the south of Europe and the
                        north of Africa, and the essential differences which they present when
                        compared with the entomological productions of the East Indies, it may be
                        inferred that the most signal changes in the species take place in a
                        southerly direction towards the frontier lines of Persia and Hindustan, and
                        in a northerly direction at a short distance from the eastern slopes of the
                        Uralian Mountains and Lake Aral, a little beyond the sixtieth meridian east
                        of Paris. We may fix this limit approximately at sixty-two degrees, somewhat
                        to the west of the Obi, and of Balk and Candahar, for the sake of affording
                        the means of continuing a duodecimal division; for if we add 62 to 34, the
                        difference between the first meridian and that of Paris, we have the number
                        96, a quantity susceptible of being divided, without fractions, into eight
                        parts, each equal to the thirtieth portion of the circle. We thus separate
                        the ancient continent into two great bands, of which one is western and the
                        other eastern; and if we assign to the latter the same extent in longitude
                        as the former, that is, ninety-six degrees, it will terminate 158 degrees of
                        eastern longitude from the meridian of Paris. Departing from Kamtchatka, it
                        will pass by the Carolinas, and from thence between New Holland and New
                        Zealand. If augmented by one fourth, or by twenty-four degrees, this eastern
                        band would be bounded by the 182d meridian east of Paris, and passing at a
                        short distance from East Cape, over Behring’s Straits, would stretch beyond
                        the Friendly Islands, and form, without any material error in relation to
                        our entomological views, a line of demarcation between Asia and America. The
                        remaining 144 degrees complete the equatorial circle, and compose the extent
                        in longitude of that great zone proper to the insects of America. It may
                        also be divided, and under the same denominations of eastern and western,
                        into two equal portions, each of seventy-two degrees. Thus the entire circle
                        of the equator may be regarded as divisible into four arcs, of which the
                        values are, 72, 72, 96, and 120, or in the proportion of six thirtieths,
                        eight thirtieths, and ten thirtieths. I he extent in longitude of the
                        ancient continent will comprise 216 degrees, and that of the new 144.</p>
                    <p>The lesser zones or climates are denominated <hi rend="italic">arctic</hi> or
                        <hi rend="italic">antarctic</hi> by Μ. Latreille, according to their
                        position on this or the other side of the equator. The climate included
                        between the 84th and 72d degrees of north latitude is named the <hi
                        rend="italic">polar</hi> climate. Then follow as far as the equator, and
                        always in divisions of twelve degrees, the following climates, viz. the <hi
                        rend="italic">sub-polar,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">superior,</hi> the <hi
                        rend="italic">intermediate, the super-tropical,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                        >tropical,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">equatorial;</hi> and as each
                        hemisphere is partitioned into two great divisions, the climates of each are
                        distinguished by the name of western and eastern. The antarctic climates
                        consist of only three in number, as we know little of what exists amid those
                        chilly regions beyond the 60th degree of south latitude, and thus in that
                        direction both the polar and sub-polar climates may be suppressed. We shall
                        illustrate these views by a few applications to the northern and western
                        kingdoms of Europe, the best known portions of the old world.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">polar</hi> climate presents us with the insects of the
                        greater part of Greenland, and with those of Iceland and of Spitzbergen. In
                        the <hi rend="italic">sub-polar</hi> climate we shall find those of Norway,
                        of the north of Sweden, and of Russia in Europe. These two of course contain
                        the insects of the coldest climates of the earth. We may regard as belonging
                        to the <hi rend="italic">superior</hi> climate the species of Great Britain,
                        of the south of Sweden, of the north of France as far as the inferior course
                        of the Loire, of Prussia, of Germany Proper, and of the south of Russia as
                        far as the Crimea exclusive. The <hi rend="italic">intermediate</hi>
                        climate, at equal distances from those of the equator and the pole, will
                        comprehend all the species of the south of Europe, and of a portion of the
                        west of Asia. Those of the north of Africa, and as far as the equator, may
                        be classed under the climates called <hi rend="italic">super-tropical,
                        tropical,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">equatorial.</hi> These western climates
                        may be divided into two equal parts, each consisting of forty-eight degrees,
                        by a meridian which, passing fourteen degrees to the east of Paris, in the
                        vicinity of Vienna, would leave to the east the most southern part of Italy,
                        Turkey in Europe, Egypt, &amp;c. Now it has been already remarked, that many
                        of the insects of the environs of Vienna are also known to occur in the
                        Levant, and that those of the kingdom of Naples, of Egypt, and of the
                        south-east of Europe, appear to differ in many respects from the southern
                        and western species of that division of the globe. We can here, then, effect
                        the formation of sub-climates. If we divide the eastern portion, of which
                        the extent in longitude is 120 degrees, into four equal sections of thirty
                        degrees, by meridians, we shall have sub-climates, of which the boundaries
                        seem very accordant with nature. Thus the first would comprehend Hindustan,
                        Thibet, Little Bucharia, &amp;c. while the second would detach almost all
                        the Philippine Islands, China Proper, and the regions of the north as far as
                        a short way beyond the river Lena. Corea, Japan, and the countries of the
                        Manchous and Tongouses, &amp;c. would form the third subdivision. The fourth
                        would present Kamtchatka, and the other countries which terminate the
                        north-east of~Asia. America may likewise be subdivided after a similar
                        manner.</p>
                    <p>It must, however, be borne in mind that nature, in her distribution of the
                        localities proper to the various races of animals, often swerves from her
                        more regular and accustomed courses, and that the <hi rend="italic">lines of
                        habitation</hi> form numerous curves and sinuosities, not unfrequently
                        crossed or interrupted by others of a somewhat different nature. We must,
                        therefore, in considering such views as the preceding, make abstraction of
                        particular modifications which alter or derange our theoretical views.
                        Latreille’s is but an unfinished sketch of a highly interesting geographical
                        map of Entomology, in which he has endeavoured, as well as he could, to mark
                        out various boundaries, and to divide them according to certain principles
                        in harmony with his <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746623"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0709-6623-0105"/> actual observations, so far as these have
                        been hitherto carried. The geographical distribution of living beings
                        presents a wide field for speculation, although the modes by which that
                        distribution has been effected will probably in many cases remain for ever
                        concealed from human knowledge. Their gradual extension by natural means,
                        from a single centre of creation, scarcely falls within the sphere of
                        credibility; and thus the creation of various groups of species over
                        different points of the earth’s surface, and in accordance with the climate
                        and physical character of different countries,—or the removal and
                        dispersion, by supernatural agency, of the greater proportion of existing
                        species from an original centre,—seem the two points, one or other of which
                        remains to be illustrated by whoever is curious in such bewildering
                        speculations. “A glance at the innumerable and far-spread legions which
                        compose the busy world of insect life renders the subject still more complex
                        and confounding. A discovery ship, under the guidance of brave men,
                        surmounts with difficulty the terrors of the ocean; and, after being months
                        on the trackless main, and some thousand miles from any of the great
                        continents of the earth, she arrives at last and accidentally at some
                        hitherto unknown island of small dimensions, a mere speck in the vast world
                        of waters by which it is surrounded. She probably finds the ‘ Lord of the
                        Creation’ there unknown; but though untrod by human footsteps, how busy is
                        that lonely spot with all the other forms of active life I Even man himself
                        is represented not unaptly by the sagacious and imitative monkeys, which
                        eagerly employ so many vain expedients to drive from their shores what they
                        no doubt regard as merely a stronger species of their race. ‘ Birds of
                        gayest plume’ stand fearlessly before the unsympathizing naturalist; and at
                        every step of the botanical collector the most gorgeous butterflies are
                        wafted from the blossoms of unknown flowers, and beautify the ‘ living air’
                        with their many splendid hues. Yet how frail are such gaudy wings, and how
                        vainly would they now serve as the means of transport from that solitary
                        spot, where all the present generations have had their birth ! In what
                        manner, then, did they become its denizens, or by what means were they
                        transported to a point almost imperceptible in comparison with the
                        immeasurable extent of the circumjacent ocean?”<note anchored="true"

                    <p>In the opinion of Humboldt, the causes of the distribution of species,
                        whether in the vegetable or in the animal kingdom, are among the number of
                        mysteries to which natural science cannot attain. This science, or at least
                        that branch of it which takes cognizance of zoological geography, is not
                        ocćupied in the investigation of the origin of beings, but of the laws in
                        accordance with which they are now distributed over the surface of the
                        earth. It enters into the examination of things as they are, the
                        co-existence of vegetable and animal forms in each latitude, at different
                        heights, and at different degrees of temperature; it studies the relations
                        under which particular organizations are more vigorously developed,
                        multiplied, or modified; but it approaches not problems the solution of
                        which is impossible, since they touch the origin or first existence of the
                        germs of life. “We may add,” says that enlightened naturalist, “that the
                        attempts which have been made to explain the distribution of various species
                        over the globe, by the sole influence of climate, date at a period when
                        physical geography was still in its infancy; when, recurring incessantly to
                        pretended contrasts between the two worlds, it was imagined that the whole
                        of Africa and of America resembled the deserts of Egypt and the marshes of
                        Cayenne. At present, when men judge of the state of things, not from one
                        type arbitrarily chosen, but from positive knowledge, it is ascertained that
                        the two continents, in their immense extent, contain countries that are
                        altogether analogous, and that there are regions of America as barren and
                        burning as the interior of Africa.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        organized bodies can no more be solved as a problem in physical science than
                        the mystery of their original creation; and that “the task of the
                        philosopher is fulfilled when he has indicated the laws in accordance with
                        which nature has distributed the forms of animal and vegetable life.”<note

                    <p>In regard to those exquisite tribes which form the more immediate subjects of
                        our present observations, it is known that the increasing intensity and
                        continuance of heat exert a powerful influence on the size, structure, and
                        external adornment of the species. The nearer, in general, that we advance
                        towards equinoctial countries, the more remarkable do we find these
                        creatures, for their largeness of dimension, their singularity of form, and
                        their depth as well as splendour of colour. An accurate knowledge of the
                        distribution of insects is of the highest interest to the geologist and
                        geographer as well as to the entomologist, and may be the means of
                        determining, in doubtful or disputed cases, the natural and what may be
                        called the original limits of countries; as, for example, in the case of
                        islands situated at nearly equal distances between two distant continents.
                        But we cannot here pursue the subject under a more extended form.<note

                    <p>Having thus cursorily considered the geographical dis tribution of insects,
                        we may now devote a brief space to their <hi rend="italic">local</hi>
                        distribution, or favourite haunts, according to their kind, in any given
                        district. The surface of a country, it has been observed, consists either of
                        mountains, hills, and valleys, or of plains. In either case it may be bare
                        and exposed, or diversified by forests, groves, or copses; and it may also
                        be dry and sandy, or rich and well watered by lakes and rivers. Such parts
                        as are uncovered are greatly varied by the hand both of art and nature, and
                        present heaths or grassy downs, marshes, meadows, or tillage land, each of
                        which is characterized by a difference of soil as well as of vegetable
                        surface. In each the careful entomologist will discover peculiar kinds of
                        insects. “As mountains and hills have usually their own Flora, the insects
                        appropriated to alpine plants can only be met with where their pabulum is
                        found. Here also those northern insects that are impatient of a warm climate
                        will take their station if they migrate to the southward. The predacious
                        beetles likewise sometimes frequent a mountainous district. <hi
                        rend="italic">Carabus</hi><hi rend="italic">glabratus</hi> was first taken
                        by Professor Hooker on Ingleborough; and probably, if the Welsh and Scotch
                        mountains were duly investigated by an entomologist, many novelties would
                        reward his toils. The valleys and plains, especially those of a sunny
                        exposition, abound in insects. When the heat of the atmosphere indisposes
                        you for motion, you will find it no unprofitable or unpleasant employment,
                        lying on the grass, to search for minute beetles, which you will there find
                        coursing about amongst the tufts and roots of the herbage. Thus you may
                        procure many of the <hi rend="italic">Pselaphidoe,</hi> which you would not
                        otherwise meet with. Even when the grass is grown up, insects are fond of
                        alighting upon <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746636"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0709-6636-0106"/> its spikes, and thence drop or run to the
                        ground. Should circumstances ever carry you abroad to the steppes or grassy
                        plains of Tartary, or to Hungary, you will find there two or three species
                        of the singular genus <hi rend="italic">Lethrus,</hi> which burrows in the
                        soil. Every hole is inhabited by a male and female ;—from it they issue to
                        attack the plants or vines; and having cut out the heart of a plant, go
                        backwards like a crab with the prize to their burrow. At the time of
                        pairing, sometimes violent battles, encouraged by the female, take place
                        between the male and a stranger of that sex desirous of admission, which
                        cease only with the death or flight of the stranger. The vicinity and
                        borders of <hi rend="italic">woods</hi> generally abound in insects of every
                        order, and, if you proceed as hereafter directed, will furnish you with
                        numerous prizes, especially of Lepidoptera. Here alone you can meet with the
                        purple emperor butterfly <hi rend="italic">(Apatura Iris)·,</hi> and if
                        properly equipped you may readily secure him.”<note anchored="true"

                        course occur in the water. During the evening twilight, however, they
                        frequently leave their moist abodes, and wing their way over the adjacent
                        country. When surprised, after their nocturnal adventures, by the rising
                        sun, they will plunge into whatever water is nearest at hand, and thus rain
                        barrels and washing tubs are sometimes not looked into in vain. Chance often
                        throws into the hands of an entomologist what he has long sedulously sought
                        for without success; and an open window and a lighted candle will sometimes
                        procure what a traverse through the forest, worthy of a North American
                        Indian, would not have obtained. By collecting aquatic plants, duckweed, and
                        “the green mantle of the stagnant pool,” and afterwards examining these
                        productions at leisure in a basin of water, many valuable insects of the
                        minuter kinds may be procured. Although the <hi rend="italic"

                        adverse to insect life. Brackish water, however, produces several peculiar
                        species, such as <hi rend="italic">Hy-droena marina,</hi> and the large-eyed
                        Cimicidae. According to Latreillc, the genus Pimelia occurs only in soils

                        <hi rend="italic">soils,</hi> such as are light, according to Mr Kirby, are
                        most prolific in insects. Warm sandy banks are frequented by <hi

                        rend="italic">sabulosum, Helops quis-quilius,</hi> &amp;c.; and chalk is
                        extremely attractive. The <hi rend="italic">Licini, Papilio Cleopatra,</hi>
                        several species of <hi rend="italic">Dasytes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Lamiae,</hi> seem to delight in the latter substance. Many others are found
                        in chalk-pits, which Mr Kirby does not think should be regarded actually as
                        chalk insects; but rather that they simply fall into the pits, and then
                        become more discernible in consequence of the stronger contrast of colour.
                        By watching in one of these pits during a warm day, vast numbers of insects
                        may be taken. Of all soils <hi rend="italic">clay</hi> offers the fewest
                        inducements to the entomologist.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    <p>Old trees, felled timber, and planks which have lain long upon the ground,
                        should be carefully examined by the collector, as on the under sides of the
                        latter, as well as beneath stones, many species seek repose and shelter.
                        Thorn and other fences, whether dead or living, are very productive; and
                        gates,posts, and wooden rails, ought in nowise to be neglected. Although the
                        <hi rend="italic">sea</hi> itself, according to the authority last quoted,
                        produces no true insects, yet many and varied tribes are known to haunt its
                        shores. On the sand hills of the Norfolk coast Mr Kirby found <hi
                        rend="italic">Aegialia</hi><hi rend="italic">globosa</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Cicindela hybrida.</hi><hi rend="italic">Rynchcemis</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">horridus</hi> likewise inhabits thistles growing near the sea.
                        Fuci and other marine rejectamenta, which border the margins of friths and
                        estuaries, produce peculiar species of <hi rend="italic">Cercyon,</hi> some
                        <hi rend="italic">Aphodii,</hi> and many <hi rend="italic"
                        >Staphylinidae.</hi> That singular insect <hi rend="italic">Oxytelus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">triconis</hi> has been captured in a situation like that now
                        indicated. The inundations of rivers in spring, summer, and autumn, sweep
                        innumerable insects from their hiding places; and when the waters begin to
                        subside, the examination of the floating grasses, broken twigs, and various
                        debris which line the indented shores, will afford an ample field for the
                        investigations of the entomologist. To him indeed the most barren scene,
                        whether of dreary moor or desolate mountain, can never be devoid of
                        interest,—for the more untrodden the path the stronger and more rational are
                        his hopes of becoming possessed of some of those treasures which are
                        everywhere scattered over the wilderness of nature,— hitherto unperceived
                        perhaps by human eye, but nevertheless performing an essential part in the
                        great and solemn mystery of creation.</p>
                    <p>The geological relations of insects do not appear to have attracted the
                        notice of naturalists,—we mean their more direct connection with rocks,
                        independent of that intermediate relationship which results from the
                        dependence of particular plants on certain soils, and the known alliance of
                        many tribes of insects with peculiar forms of vegetable life. Mr Wailes
                        always found the larvae of <hi rend="italic">Enicο-ceri</hi> on rough slimy
                        stones, and he found it as great a waste of time to look for them on a
                        smooth limestone, as to turn up a fragment of basaltic rock (whinstone) in
                        search of geodephagous insects. The repugnance of beetles to basalt he had
                        previously noticed. The subjacent rock of the wild district of Teesdale is
                        almost exclusively composed of the basalt of the great whin-sill, the
                        formation of which is regarded as a knotty point by geologists. Of course
                        the loose and superficial stones of the country are its fragments, and among
                        these scarcely a beetle is to be found, except a few which are superlatively
                        common elsewhere, though <hi rend="italic">inter</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >rariores</hi> in the district referred to. “So far,” says Mr Wailes, “as my
                        observations, whether confined to single stones, or extended over a whole
                        district, go, any place having limestone, particularly the magnesian, for
                        its subjacent stratum, will afford abundance of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Geodephaga,</hi> as well as most other Coleoptera, whilst they will be
                        found very thinly scattered over a basaltic region. It is strange to notice
                        the almost uniform absence of these insects on turning up a whin which has
                        accidentally found its way into a heap of other stones, though every one of
                        the latter may have one or more tenants under it. Must we-not look to the
                        comparative dryness of the limestone and humidity of the whin for an
                        explanation ? We can readily account for the great predominance of the land
                        <hi rend="italic">testacea</hi> on a limestone district; but lime does not
                        enter into the composition of beetles.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    <p>Insects may also be viewed in relation to their seasons of appearance, or the
                        most appropriate periods for the collection of the different kinds. Such as
                        gather honey and the pollen of plants are among the first to proclaim the
                        approach of spring; and their appearance maybe dated from the blossoming of
                        certain trees and flowers of common occurrence. Other plants, likewise
                        accompanied <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746649" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6649-0107"
                        /> by peculiar insects, blossom later; and thus we may trace a mutual
                        relationship between the two kingdoms throughout the sparkling spring, the
                        leafy summer, and the melancholy autumn,—till relentless winter sets his
                        seal upon insect life, and either renders it entirely torpid, or sheds
                        occasionally a feeble ray on some forlorn company of gnats, whose dances,
                        now no lcnger “choral,” exhibit but a sad representative of that more genial
                        season when the <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> ∙ living air” was filled with
                        their not unjoyful murmurs. With these and a few other exceptions, the
                        earliest insect season commences with the flowering of the sallow <hi
                        rend="italic">(Salix caprea</hi> of Linnaeus, <hi rend="italic">Saugh</hi>
                        of the Scottish schoolboy), which is accompanied by the golden flowers of
                        the crocus, and the beautiful green of the expanding gooseberries. “Then is
                        your time,” says Mr Kirby, “to collect many species of wild bees and <hi
                        rend="italic">Diptera,</hi> not afterwards to be met with; and various other
                        insects now begin to emerge from the pupa. Another and later season is
                        marked by the general blossoming of the buttercup <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Ranunculus bulbosus),</hi> accompanied by the marsh-marygold (<hi
                        rend="italic">Caltha palustris'),</hi> and ladies’ smock (<hi rend="italic"
                        >Cardamine</hi><hi rend="italic">pratensis),</hi> when you may hunt the
                        pastures, meadows, and marshes with success, and take some insects that do
                        not show themselves later. The coprophagous insects are now abundant.
                        Amongst others, <hi rend="italic">Aphodius testudina-rius,</hi> a perfectly
                        <hi rend="italic">vernal</hi> species, is now only to be taken, and usually
                        flying. A <hi rend="italic">third</hi> insect season indicated by Flora, and
                        a very prolific one, commences with the blossoming of the hawthorn, when you
                        must desert the meads for the inclosures. At this time all nature begins to
                        put on her gayest attire, and all her insect tribes are now on the alert,
                        and fill the air. They are almost universally attracted by the sweet and
                        lovely blossoms of the plant just named; so that, by examining them, you may
                        entrap some of every order, and many that during the year will appear no
                        more. Even many of the saprophagous insects will sip nectar from the
                        flowers. The umbelliferous plants proclaim the fourth season of insects,
                        particularly the wild carrot and parsnip. You will scarcely ever fail to
                        find, if the weather is genial, <hi rend="italic">hymenopterous</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">dipterous</hi> insects of various genera, especially such as
                        have a <hi rend="italic">short</hi> tongue, engaged in collecting the honey
                        from those plants. Here you may take some of the rarer <hi rend="italic"
                        >Chrysidoe, Crabronidae, Cereerides,</hi> &amp;c. and occasionally even <hi
                        rend="italic">Coleop-tera.</hi> The last insect season may be dated from the
                        general flowering of the thistle tribe. When these are in blossom is the
                        best time of all to collect the humble-bees <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Bombas'),</hi> the leaf-cutter bees <hi rend="italic">(Megachile),</hi>
                        and many other <hi rend="italic">Apiariae,</hi> Lat. which alone, by their
                        long tongues, can imbibe the honey and collect the pollen of these flowers.
                        The male humble-bees frequent them to the last, and often seem as if they
                        were intoxicated with their sweets.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            different orders has already been given in our introductory
                            observations,—see pages 59 and 60 of this volume. Our present order
                            corresponds to the <hi rend="smallcaps">Eleutherata</hi> of
                            Fabricius.</p></note></p>
                        <p>Coleopterous insects have usually four wings, the two superior of which,
                            called elytra, resemble horizontal, somewhat convex scales, which meet
                            in a straight line along their inner margins, where they form what is
                            called the dorsal suture. The inferior wings, which are the true organs
                            of flight, are membranaceous, transparent, transversely folded, and
                            covered and protected by the elytra or wing-cases. They are all
                            masticating insects, provided with mandibles and maxillae.</p>
                        <p>Of all the insect tribes these are the most numerous, the best known, and
                            the most generally interesting. Their singular and varied forms, their
                            brilliant colouring, the great size of many species, and that solid
                            consistence which renders their collection and preservation
                            comparatively easy, have long secured for them the devoted attention of
                            the entomologist. Some advantages also result to their study and
                            classification from the clearly defined and articulate forms of their
                            external organs. The name and principal characters of the order were
                            bestowed and defined by Aristotle, and have been adopted by almost all
                            succeeding writers on the subject. Other characters have no doubt been
                            added to his ancient definition of <hi rend="italic">wings in a
                            sheath,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> such as the transverse folding of
                            these organs, and the straightness of the suture by which the elytra are
                            united; and several exceptions to the supposed universal attributes of
                            the order have been discovered,— such as the female glow-worm, which has
                            neither wings nor sheaths, and the genus <hi rend="italic">Meloe,</hi>
                            and many <hi rend="italic">Carabi,</hi> which, though furnished with
                            sheaths or elytra, are entirely destitute of true or membranaceous
                            wings. So also, in the genera <hi rend="italic">Buprestis,</hi><hi
                            rend="italic">Molorchus,</hi> and others, we may discover exceptions to
                            the transverse folding of the last-named organs; and the exact fitting
                            or junction of the elytra, forming the dorsal suture, ceases to hold in
                            the genus <hi rend="italic">Meloe,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> so that
                            none of these characters can be regarded as universal; but as they are
                            very generally prevalent, and a few exceptions do not invalidate a rule,
                            it is advisable that they should be retained for the purposes of
                            definition.</p>
                        <p>Coleopterous insects, like others, are composed of three principal
                            portions, head, thorax, and abdomen. The <hi rend="italic">head</hi>
                            varies greatly both in size and form, according to the different tribes.
                            In the great section of the <hi rend="italic">Geodephaga,</hi> or
                            ground-beetles, it is usually of a somewhat triangular form; in many of
                            the short elytra’d tribes <hi rend="italic">(Brachelytra</hi> it is
                            orbicular; while among the weevils (<hi rend="italic"
                            >Curculionides)</hi> it is prolonged into a pointed rostrum or beak. The
                            hinder part is frequently contracted into a short neck, and is inserted
                            into a cavity of the thorax, in which it moves as in a socket. The head
                            bears two <hi rend="italic">antennoe,</hi> of which the form and
                            structure differ not only in the different genera, but even in the sexes
                            of the same species. They usually, however, consist of ten or eleven
                            distinct articulations, the latter number being the more frequent. They
                            are inserted in the front of the head, anterior to, and rather beneath,
                            the region of the. eyes. Their various forms, as characteristic of
                            particular groups, will be afterwards described. The <hi rend="italic"
                            >eyes</hi> of Coleoptera, in the perfect state, are two in number, and
                            composite. In certain Staphylinidae, two small yellowish points have
                            been observed, which some naturalists have regarded as analogous to the
                            simple or stemmatic eyes; but the sentiments of Latreille are adverse to
                            that opinion. The actual eyes are either entire, notched, or even
                            occasionally so completely intersected by a little corneous stalk, as to
                            exhibit (as in the genus <hi rend="italic">Gyrinus)</hi> the appearance
                            of a pair on either side. The <hi rend="italic">mouth</hi> consists of a
                            <hi rend="italic">labrum,</hi> two <hi rend="italic">mandibles,</hi> two
                            <hi rend="italic">maxillae,</hi> each furnished with one or two
                            articulated <hi rend="italic">palpi,</hi> and a <pb break="no"
                            facs="nls:193746662" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6662-0108"/><hi rend="italic"
                            >dabium</hi> composed of two parts, the <hi rend="italic">mentum</hi>
                            and <hi rend="italic">ligula,</hi> and accompanied by a pair of palpi.
                            The mandibles are usually of a corneous consistence, but they are
                            membranaceous and of small size, in such as take little apparent
                            nourishment, or feed on the juices of flowers, or on excrementitial or
                            putrescent animal fluids. The maxillae are of a softer texture than the
                            mandibles. When there are a pair of palpi on each maxilla, the exterior
                            ones never consist of more than four joints; those of the labium have
                            usually three articulations.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">thorax</hi> of the Coleoptera, like that of other
                            hexapod insects, is likewise divisible into three principal portions,
                            each of which is characterized by a particular degree of development.
                            The <hi rend="italic">mesothorax</hi> is very narrow, whilst the
                            corselet <hi rend="italic">or prothorax,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                            >metathorax,</hi> exhibit a considerable bulk. This is an important
                            feature in the structure of the skeleton or tegument of the coleopterous
                            order. The prothorax is always free in its movements, while the two
                            other portions are united together, and nearly immoveable. The component
                            parts or the mesothorax are in fact rudimentary, and those of the <hi
                            rend="italic">scutellum</hi> are soldered together. But the elements of
                            the latter portion, that is, the <hi rend="italic">praescutum,</hi> the
                            <hi rend="italic">scutum,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">scutellum,</hi>
                            commonly so called, and the <hi rend="italic">postscutellum,</hi> still
                            exist, and their joinings are quite perceptible in certain genera. The
                            prothorax supports only the first pair of legs, while the mesothorax
                            bears the second pair and the elytra. The second pair of wings and the
                            third pair of legs are attached to the metathorax.</p>
                        <p>The elytra and wings take their origin from the lateral and superior
                            margins of that portion of the body to which they are attached. The
                            elytra are usually of a very firm or almost crustaceous consistence,
                            opake, and without reticulations. The true wings are large, veined, and
                            concealed beneath the elytra. The latter always exist (with the
                            exception of the females of a few species), but many species are
                            apterous, so far as concerns the existence of the membranaceous wings.
                            In general the elytra equal the body in length, but they are sometimes,
                            as among the Staphylinidae, much shorter. They are usually free, and
                            extended during the act of flight; but among several carabideous insects
                            they seem united by the dorsal suture, and are consequently incapable of
                            extension. In these instances the true wings are wanting.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">abdomen</hi> of the Coleoptera is sessile, that is,
                            attached to the metathorax by its largest transverse diameter. Its
                            inferior or ventral part is less extended longitudinally than the
                            superior, and this restriction is chiefly owing to the development of
                            the sternum of the metathorax, which is prolonged backwards, and thus,
                            as it were, usurps the place of the abdomen. This may be very distinctly
                            observed in the genus <hi rend="italic">Copris,</hi> in which the
                            segments of the abdomen seem crowded together. In some species the first
                            segment appears divided into two parts by the sternum, which projects
                            along their line of union. Inferiorly, the abdomen is always of a firm
                            or horny consistence; but the upper part is generally soft, being
                            covered by the elytra and wings. When these are wanting or abbreviated,
                            the abdomen is equally hard above as below, as in the genus <hi
                            rend="italic">Meloe,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Staphylinidae,</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> r brachelytrous
                            tribes.</p>
                        <p>The legs vary in their structure and development. The anterior pair,
                            orthose of the prothorax, are frequently more strongly formed in the
                            male than in the female; and in the former sex the tarsi are often
                            broader than ip the latter. The legs are usually described as composed
                            of five pieces, the <hi rend="italic">haunch,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                            >trochanter,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">thigh,</hi> the ' <hi

                            Audouin has shown the existence of a sixth portion, moveable, constantly
                            concealed within the interior of the body, and serving to articulate the
                            haunch with the epimera. We have already mentioned it under the name of
                            <hi rend="italic">trochantin.</hi></p>

                            <hi rend="italic">masticating</hi> species, which are consequently
                            provided with instruments of a more or less resistant nature, adapted
                            for seizing, cutting, and triturating the food previous to its being
                            swallowed. For this purpose the mouth is furnished with a pair of
                            corneous mandibles, sometimes simply incisive, sometimes dentated or
                            toothed. Their motion is transverse and horizontal. There is also a pair
                            of maxillae, usually of a more membranaceous consistence than the
                            mandibles, an upper lip or labrum, an under lip or labium, and from four
                            to six palpi. The salivary glands, which in orthopterous and hemipterous
                            insects present all the characters common to such organs, are
                            rudimentary in size, and few in number, among the coleopterous tribes.
                            They contain a colourless saliva, and their existence hitherto has been
                            ascertained chiefly in genera of the families of <hi rend="italic"
                            >Melasoma, Taxicones, Stenelytra, Trache-lides, Ehincophora,</hi> and
                            <hi rend="italic">Aphidiphaga.</hi> The digestive tube possesses an
                            extent which varies singularly in relation to the habits of life of each
                            particular tribe. In a few it scarcely exceeds the length of the body;
                            while in others, and these are the greater number, it greatly surpasses
                            that extent. The oesophagus is generally short; the crop more or less
                            obvious; the gizzard is in some families garnished interiorly with
                            triturating pieces; the chylific ventricle is of variable size, and
                            either smooth or beset by papillae; the small intestine likewise varies
                            in length; the large intestine consists most frequently of a dilatable
                            caecum; the rectum is sometimes greatly elongated in the female sex.</p>
                        <p>The texture of the digestive tube is musculo-membranous, and is composed
                            of three tunics of varying thickness. The biliary or hepatic vessels are
                            always inserted at the posterior extremity of the chylific ventricle.
                            They are of great extent, extremely slender, singularly folded, and of a
                            cellular-membranous texture. Their number and the mode of their
                            connection vary in the different tribes and genera, but they are always
                            of an equal number, or in pairs. There are never less than a single
                            pair,.nor more than three. Sometimes their insertion is limited to the
                            chylific ventricle, in which case they are either free and floating by
                            one extremity, or they form an arch variously twisted, of which the two
                            extremities are implanted on the same circle. Sometimes the insertion is
                            double, and obtains at one end on the chylific ventricle, and at the
                            other on the caecum. The bile contained in these vessels varies from a
                            deep violet and brown colour, to yellow and white. It is sometimes even
                            diaphanous.</p>

                        <p>Besides the ordinary secreting organs, certain coleopterous species are
                            provided with a kind of excrementary secreting apparatus, which is
                            binary, and common to both sexes. Its function is the formation of an
                            acrid humour, liquid or gaseous, which the insect expels as a means of
                            defence when menaced or attacked.</p>
                        <p>The respiratory organs of the Coleoptera consist in stigmata placed along

                        <p>In addition to the usual differences, the sexes frequently present
                            external distinctive characters in the antennae and other parts. The
                            male is supposed to perish soon after the sexual union, and the female
                            does not long survive the deposition of her eggs. These eggs, which of
                            course vary in size, form, colour, and consistence, are deposited in
                            various localities, and among very different substances, in accordance
                            with the instincts and economy of the species, and the habits of the
                            larvae about to be produced. These larvae are also very dissimilar to
                            each other in this varied order; but they may be generally described as
                            soft bodied, with the exception of the head and the upper portion of the
                            three first segments of the body, which are of a firmer or more sealy
                            consistence. They are furnished with six feet; and the eyes, which in
                            the perfect state are composite, are in this early condition small
                            granuliform bodies, sometimes amounting to six on each side. The parts
                            of the mouth bear a relation, both to their immediate mode of lifi⅛ <hi
                            rend="subscript"> 9</hi> and their future development in the perfect
                            insect. The mandibles are very strong and corneous in such species as
                            feed on ligneous substances; they are coriaceous in such as feed on
                            leaves, and almost membranaceous in those which prefer carcasses, or
                            other matters in a state of putrescence. The antennae of these larvae
                            are usually very short, cylindrical or conical, and composed of a small
                            number of articulations.</p>
                        <p>Coleopterous insects enjoy a considerable length of life, at least in the
                            larva state. The period of endurance, however, of that early condition,
                            is extremely various in the different genera of this most numerous
                            order. Indeed, even among individuals of the same species, the
                            continuance of the different stages of growth varies in accordance with
                            the temperature of particular seasons, or the more or less abundant
                            supply of food. Many species pass the winter in a listless state,
                            abstaining almost entirely from eating, and consequently, even after the
                            lapse of several months, present scarcely any apparent increase of their
                            dimensions. No sooner, however, are they awakened from their temporary
                            trance by the enlivening beams of the returning sun, than they greedily
                            attack their favourite food, and their growth is almost instantaneous.
                            It has been remarked that the larvae which feed on leaves, such as those
                            of <hi rend="italic">Crioceris, Altica,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Chrysomela,</hi> remain but a brief period in the larva state; while
                            the subterranean and root-devouring species, on the contrary, not
                            unfrequently continue for two or three years in their dark abodes.
                            Attentive observation has also ascertained that those Coleoptera which
                            pass the winter in the egg state are the shortest lived in the form of
                            larvae ;—they are hatched, nourished, developed, reproduce, and perish,
                            all in the course of the summer first ensuing,—while such as pass the
                            winter in the larva state, or that of nymph, are the longest lived in
                            both of those conditions. It is chiefly in the form of larva that the
                            Coleoptera produce such injury to agriculture, and other branches of
                            rural industry. The ravages of species belonging to the genera <hi
                            rend="italic">Bruchus, Curculio,</hi><hi rend="italic">Calandra,
                            Melolontha, Crioceris, Altica, Anthrenus, Dermestes,</hi> and numerous
                            others, are unfortunately better known than any counteracting remedies
                            of easy application.</p>
                        <p>The larvae of the coleopterous tribes usually change their skins three
                            times, and many of those which live in the earth construct a kind of
                            cocoon, in which they undergo their transformations. These are of the
                            kind formerly mentioned under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                            >complete</hi> metamorphoses.</p>
                        <p>Linnaeus, Geoffroy, Fabricius, Olivier, Latreille, and others, have
                            established many divisions, more or less natural, in the coleopterous
                            order. The number of the articulations of the tarsi varies from three to
                            five, and their amount in each limb has been assumed as the basis of the
                            great sectional divisions of the coleopterous order, so generally
                            adopted by the continental naturalists. As these divisions pervade all
                            foreign works of importance on the Coleoptera, we shall here explain
                            their nature. Geoffroy having observed that all the species of a genus
                            or of a family were characterized by the same number of articulations of
                            the tarsi, and that the differences presented by these parts always bore
                            a relation to other differences in the general organization, he
                            conceived the idea of grounding his primary divisions on their
                            particular structure.</p>
                        <p>Many extensive families of coleopterous insects are distinguished by <hi
                            rend="italic">five</hi> articulations to the tarsi; that is, by five
                            joints on each foot. (See Plate CCXX. fig. 2 e.) All of these fall under
                            the first general section called <hi rend="italic">Pentamera,</hi> from
                            wnra, <hi rend="italic">five,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">μwος, part</hi>
                            or <hi rend="italic">article.</hi> Another extensive division is
                            characterized by <hi rend="italic">five</hi> articulations to the tarsi
                            of the two anterior pair of feet, while the posterior or third pair
                            possesses only <hi rend="italic">four</hi> articulations. All the
                            species so formed belong to the section <hi rend="italic"
                            >Heterornera,</hi> so called from <hi rend="italic">ιτsξος,
                            different,</hi> the tarsi being dissimilar to each other. Numerous
                            Coleoptera exhibit the tarsi composed throughout of four articulations.
                            These <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746688" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6688-0110"/>
                            are ranged under the general section <hi rend="italic">Tetramera,</hi>
                            from rcrgα, <hi rend="italic">four.</hi> Lastly, many species have no
                            more . than three, and some no more than two joints, to the tarsi, and
                            these belong respectively to the sections <hi rend="italic">Trimera</hi>
                            and <hi rend="italic">Dimera.</hi> It has even been supposed that an
                            insect exists, the tarsi of which are furnished with only a single
                            joint; and for its reception the section <hi rend="italic"
                            >iilonomera</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">μοvος, alone)</hi> has been
                            established. Later and more considerate observation, however, has led to
                            the belief that both of the last-named sections are resolvable among the
                            trimerous species, and that the supposed absence of the second and third
                            joints arises from their extreme minute-</p>
                        <p>θ“Nihil notatu dignius videtur,” observes Mr Fischer, “constanti tarsorum
                            insectorum imprimis coleopterorum formatione, quae, quidquid etiam
                            naturae scrutatores, quidam contra eam in medium protulerint, methodum

                            application, of the sectional rules deduced from the structure of the
                            tarsi, has probably induced the continental naturalists to adopt them
                            more readily than they would have done had they foreseen the occasional
                            contradictions to which they lead. The fact cannot be disguised that the
                            system is in many instances artificial,— for several insects differ in
                            the number of their tarsi, which are yet nearly allied by their general
                            structure and attributes,—while it would be easy to show that the mere
                            agreement in the number of those parts by no means carries along with it
                            a corresponding relationship in the form of the other more important

                            The truth is, that the articulations of the tarsi differ in some

                            consequence, as Mr Maclcay has pointed out, of forming the primary
                            divisions in accordance with their amount, has been, that many genera
                            are separated, and thrown to a great distance from the place which
                            nature has assigned them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        <p>We have already endeavoured, in the preceding introduction, to illustrate
                            the geographical distribution of insects in general. We shall here add a
                            few observations more especially applicable to the coleopterous
                            tribes.</p>
                        <p>The coleopterous insects of Europe in general, according to Μ. Latreille,
                            bear a strong affinity to those of Western Asia and Northern Africa.
                            These traits of resemblance become more obvious, when, the qualities of
                            the soil and the temperature being analogous, we approach towards the
                            northern tropic. It is under the forty-fourth degree of north latitude
                            that we begin to perceive certain species of carnivorous Coleoptera, of
                            the Lamellicornes, of the heteromerous section, and of the
                            Curculionides, characteristic of the warmer regions of the earth. There
                            also may be observed species of a larger size, and of an ιspect more
                            imposing, than characterize their congeners C of the north. The dominion
                            of the <hi rend="italic">Carabi,</hi> properly so ' called, so notable
                            over all the northern and temperate countries of Europe, and in the more
                            western regions of Asia, ceases towards the thirty-fifth degree of north
                            latitude. These predaceous insects are succeeded by the genera <hi
                            rend="italic">Anthia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Graphipterus.</hi>
                            Viewed in relation to entomological characters, Europe may be said to
                            extend further eastward than it does in accordance with our actual
                            political divisions, as the insects of the Levant, and even of Persia,
                            exhibit a very European aspect. Austria and Hungary, from their central
                            situation and other local circumstances, are numerically richer in
                            species than the western countries of Europe. These latter, however,
                            possess, in consequence probably of their littoral position, and the
                            influence of the oceanic waters, several peculiar species, which, though

                            lengthened line from north to south. However gorgeous may be the
                            productions of tropical regions, the European continent presents to the
                            entomologist a rich and varied assemblage both of carnivorous and
                            herbivorous Coleoptera. Many of these it possesses in common with other
                            countries, while of some it has to boast a more exclusive possession.

                            other quarter of the world. Latreille has observed that the herbivorous
                            Coleoptera seem to prevail in South America. Many species of the
                            northern countries of the new world greatly resemble those of the
                            northern and temperate parts of Europe, while others are identical. Of
                            these some may be regarded as naturally distributed alike over
                            Scandinavia, Greenland, the adjacent islands, and North America,—while
                            the greater proportion, which are xylophagous or timber-eating insects,
                            have very probably been transported by artificial means, that is, in
                            cargoes of wood, and in the timbers of our vessels. Notwithstanding many
                            examples which might be adduced to illustrate a certain agreement which
                            exists between the species of Europe and North America, the more general
                            as well as precise truth is, that the entomology of North America is
                            connected by a stronger affinity with that of the southern division of
                            the new world than with that of our own continent and islands. We
                            cannot, for instance, exhibit a single example of that division of <hi

                            conformity has indeed been observed, that North America and Europe both
                            possess many carnivorous Coleoptera entirely unknown in the equatorial
                            regions either of the old world or the new.<note anchored="true"

                            Insects.</hi></p>
                        <p>This is a very simple matter to those who are zealous in the cause. By
                            far the best method is for the collector to provide himself with a few
                            stout phials half filled with whisky, or any other ardent spirit which
                            he may happen to prefer. When the insects are caught, which they can
                            only be in any considerable number or variety by a sedulous search under
                            stones, and in the other localities afterwards indicated in our notices
                            of the different genera, they may be popped into the phial, where in
                            most instances they die almost instantaneously. This is not only the
                            most humane process, but it is also the best mode of preserving their
                            more delicate portions uninjured. It likewise puts an end to all
                            contention among themselves, which is by no means the effect of the
                            ordinary method of collecting in small boxes,—for in the latter case the
                            larger and more voracious invariably devour the smaller or least
                            assuming; and thus many captures, regarded with pleasure in the morning,
                            are found to have disappeared in the afternoon. If time and opportunity
                            are wanting for the immediate purpose of <hi rend="italic">setting</hi>
                            the specimens, that is, placing them in their most appropriate
                            positions, they may be allowed to remain in the phials for days or weeks
                            without being injured, although in that case greater care is afterwards
                            necessary, especially with the smaller specimens, in consequence of a
                            certain softness in the articulations, induced by maceration in the
                            spirits. When an entomologist (in search of Coleoptera) is employed in
                            what we may call the <hi rend="italic">home circuit,</hi> he requires
                            during his excursions nothing more than a couple of glass phials, as we
                            must suppose him possessed of all other appliances within his dwelling.
                            But during a more distant and prolonged journey, he must provide himself
                            with a few small boxes made either of wood or tin (the last is lighter
                            and thinner, and therefore more commodious), lined with cork at top and
                            bottom, and deep enough to contain an upper and an under range of pins.
                            In these the insects caught during the day may be transfixed in the
                            course of the evening, so that the phials may be left empty for the
                            captures of the ensuing morn. Notes ought to be taken of the places of
                            capture, and the insects should be so arranged in the boxes that, by
                            means of numerals or other marks, any individual may be afterwards
                            recognised in relation to its own particular locality.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">setting</hi> of an insect consists merely in
                            placing its limbs and antennae in a natural position, and fixing them in
                            the same for a time by means of pins, on a small board on which there is
                            a layer of cork. (See Plate CCXX. figs. 10 and 12.) They stiffen in a
                            few days, and may then be transferred to their proper places in the
                            cabinet. If not set when either moist or recent, they may be softened by
                            being placed for a night in any small vessel containing a layer of wet
                            sand, and covered with a damp cloth to prevent evaporation. The same
                            process, continued for a somewhat longer time, is equally efficient in
                            regard to foreign species. Each specimen, if not stuck, should, previous
                            to setting, be transfixed by passing a pin through the elytra and
                            abdomen, at right angles with the plane of its position,—enough of the
                            pin being made to project beyond the feet as will suffice to fix its
                            point firmly in the cork.</p>
                        <p>When mould appears upon coleopterous specimens, they ought to be exposed
                            for some hours at the distance of two or three feet from a brisk fire,
                            and then delicately brushed with a hair pencil. When mites or aćari make
                            their appearance among them, they ought either to be exposed for a few
                            minutes to a high temperature, which kills the living parasites without
                            injuring the dead insects, or each specimen ought to be carefully washed
                            by means of a hair pencil dipped in spirit of turpentine. A piece of
                            sponge constantly saturated with that fluid, or a supply of camphor,
                            should be kept in each drawer. With a view to maintain a collection in
                            good order, it is very advisable that all specimens obtained from
                            correspondents by purchase or exchange should, previous to their being
                            placed in the cabinet, be submitted to the ordeal of a bath either in
                            spirit of turpentine or camphorated spirit of wine. If mites or acari
                            are once introduced into a cabinet of considerable extent, their
                            eradication is extremely troublesome. As many collectors are careless of
                            their duplicate specimens, and as it is of course with these that they
                            supply their friends, much injury is frequently inflicted by the
                            introduction even of a single insect in bad condition into a cabinet
                            previously in a proper state.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                                    of these larvae, the head is weaker and more regular, and the
                                    eyes are of equal size. The shield is square, and does not
                                    project over the sides; the eighth segment wants the processes;
                                    but the terminal segment is furnished with two conical
                                    appendages, besides a membranous tube formed by the prolongation
                                    of the anal portion of the body. Ί hese appendages are toothed
                                    and horny in the larvae of <hi rend="italic">Calasoma</hi> and

                                <p>The adephagous Coleoptera have always a first stomach, which is
                                    short and fleshy,—a second, which is more elongated, and shaggy
                                    on the surface, by reason of the numerous small vessels with
                                    which it is furnished,—and a short and slender intestine. The
                                    hepatic vessels, four in number, are inserted near the pylorus.
                                    These insects may be regarded as terrestrial (<hi rend="italic"

                                    curved only at its extremity. The body is generally oblong,—the
                                    eyes projecting. The tracheae are tubular or elastic, and the
                                    intestine is terminated by an expanded cloaca, provided with two
                                    small sacs which produce an acrid humour.<note anchored="true"

                                <p>This tribe corresponds to the genus Cicindela of Linnaeus. Its
                                    genera are distinguished by a hook or nail, which is articulated
                                    by its base to the tip of the maxillae. All the species have a
                                    strong head, with large eyes, projecting toothed mandibles, and
                                    a short ligula concealed behind the mentum. The labial palpi are
                                    composed of four distinct articulations, and, in common with the
                                    maxillary palpi, are generally shaggy, or somewhat clothed. The
                                    precedence is usually assigned to these insects in our
                                    systematic arrangements, from motives probably similar to those
                                    which have induced ornithologists to place the accipitrine order
                                    at the head of the .class of birds. The greater proportion of

                                    within their tyrannous grasp. The bodies of these larvae are
                                    long, cylindrical, whitish, and furnished with six sealyfeet.

                                    brilliant metallic colours. The prevailing hues are different
                                    shades of golden green, spotted with white or pale yellow. They
                                    frequent dry and sandy soils, where they seem to enjoy the

                                    distributed over all the regions of the earth. Their organs of
                                    locomotion, and those more immediately subservient to the

                                    Coleoptera. They were named by Linnaeus the tigers of the insect
                                    tribes. “Though decorated with brilliant colours, they prey upon

                                    elevation of the head, which look like those of spiders; and,
                                    besides their threatening jaws, armed with a strong internal
                                    tooth, being furnished with a pair of spines resembling somewhat
                                    the sting of a scorpion, which stand erect upon the back of the
                                    abdomen, and give them a most ferocious aspect.”<note

                                <p>C. <hi rend="italic">campestris.</hi> Green, with five whitish
                                    spots on the margin of each elytron, and another in the centre.
                                    The spots on the elytra vary in shape and disposition, and some
                                    of them are occasionally obliterated. The female has two fuscous
                                    spots towards the base of the elytra, and is distinguished, in
                                    addition to the more slender tarsi, by having the abdomen
                                    divided into six segments; that of the opposite sex consisting
                                    of seven, with the penultimate one more or less emarginate. This
                                    sexual distinction, first observed by Gyllenhal, exists in most
                                    genera of the tribe.</p>
                                <p>This beautiful insect frequents dry sandy places exposed to the
                                    sun, most commonly in the neighbourhood of heaths, and is
                                    distributed more or less abundantly over all parts of Britain.
                                    We have traced it through most of thei Highlands of Scotland, as
                                    far as the south of Sutherland, and we doubt not that it extends
                                    to the most northern extremity of the island. It is an
                                    inhabitant of most European countries, ranging from the shores
                                    of the Mediterranean to Siberia. This is the most abundant of
                                    the British species, and the only one yet found in Scotland. The
                                    supposed species <hi rend="italic">C. Maroccana,</hi> Fab. which

                                <p>This important tribe corresponds to the old and unrestricted
                                    genus <hi rend="italic">Carabus</hi> of Linnaeus. The maxillae
                                    are terminated simply by a point or hook, which is not
                                    articulated, as in the preceding genera. The head does not
                                    exceed the breadth of the thorax, and is more frequently
                                    somewhat narrower. The mandibles, with few exceptions, are but
                                    sparingly toothed. The ligula is usually projecting, and the
                                    labial palpi exhibit only three free articulations.<note

                                    articulations; but among the Carabici it is adherent and forming
                                    only a support to the others, is not itself regarded as an
                                    articulation.</p></note> Many species are apterous, that is,
                                    have no membranous wings beneath the elytra. Their odour is
                                    often fetid, and their bodies exude an acrid fluid. The habits
                                    and economy both of the larvae and perfect insects are
                                    exceedingly various. Some conceal themselves under the earth,
                                    others beneath stones, or the bark of trees. They are active in
                                    their movements, and are very generally distributed, being,
                                    however, more characteristic of temperate than equatorial
                                    regions. M. Geoffroy bestowed the generic name of <hi
                                    rend="italic">Buprestis</hi> upon carabideous insects, on
                                    account of the injury which he supposed them capable of
                                    inflicting on cattle; and it is possible that the caustic ιumour
                                    with which many of them are imbued might be productive of bad
                                    effects in the event of their being swallowed along with better
                                    and more accustomed pasture. To whatever species this evil
                                    tendency was attributed, the ancients appear to have regarded
                                    its other characters with admiration, for the physicians of
                                    olden times held it as equal in virtue to Cantharides. Linnaeus,
                                    however, transferred the name of Buprestis to the genus <hi
                                    rend="italic">Cucujus</hi> of Geoffroy, although none of the
                                    latter genus in any way corresponded to the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Bovirgn&lt;trtς of</hi> the Greeks. The change proposed by the
                                    great reformer has been universally adopted, and the word
                                    Carabus is now most famihar to the ear of the entomologist.</p>
                                <p>As the larvae of the Carabici dwell in subterranean retreats, a
                                    knowledge of their habits and history is difficult to acquire.
                                    The body is of an elongated form; the legs are six in number,
                                    and of a sealytexture; and the maxillae are strong and
                                    pincer-like. With these they seize upon the larvae of other
                                    insects, which constitute their favourite food. They are
                                    extremely voracious.</p>
                                <p>In relation to the economical purposes of the human race, the
                                    tribes now under consideration are of no great utility. It is
                                    mentioned, however, by the younger Geoffroy, that while he was
                                    collecting insects on the coast of Senegal, a negro brought him
                                    a jar containing many thousand specimens of a small carabideous
                                    species, which had evidently been previously collected by
                                    design. On inquiry he found that they were used for making <hi
                                    rend="italic">soap,</hi> some of which, of a black colour, he
                                    afterwards examined, and found it to possess all the qualities
                                    of the European article. Olivier asks whether we could not
                                    extract from our indigenous speciesan alkaline matter
                                    subservient to the same ends?<note anchored="true"

                                    This is the prevailing character, although <hi rend="italic"

                                    colours are black spotted with white. They inhabit the African
                                    deserts, and are not altogether unknown in those parts of Asia
                                    which extend from the Red Sea to Bengal. According to
                                    Leschenhault de Latour, they emit a caustic fluid when handled.
                                    In the males of some species the thorax is dilated and bilobed
                                    posteriorly. Both sexes are destitute of wings. Dejean’s

                                    on each side of the anterior portion of the thorax. The elytra
                                    have each four deep grooves, with another in the centre common
                                    to both. These grooves are garnished with an ash-coloured or
                                    brownish down, which sometimes entirely disappears, and then
                                    each groove exhibits two rows of small excavated spots, with a
                                    longitudinal and slightly elevated line in the centre. Each

                                    the generality of these insects are so remarkably distinguished
                                    is, that the abdomen contains peculiar organs which secrete a
                                    caustic liquor of an extremely penetrating odour. When this is
                                    propelled by the insect on any threatened danger, it produces a
                                    detonating sound, and evaporates. M. Dumeril has remarked, that
                                    when this reservoir is opened by dissection, the liquid
                                    effervesces, and evaporates instantaneously. Paper imbued with a
                                    blue vegetable dye is changed by its action, first into a
                                    reddish hue, and then into yellow. When the vesicle which
                                    contains it is placed upon the tongue, and compressed, a
                                    peculiar and rather agreeable savour is felt in the mouth. A
                                    sharp pain, however, soon follows on the spot affected, where a
                                    yellow colour becomes perceptible, similar to that produced by a
                                    drop of nitric acid. Leon Dufour has made us acquainted with the
                                    apparatus employed in the production of this fluid.<note

                                    of Latreille, till their separation by Bonelli. They are almost
                                    all European, and are commonly found under stones, and beneath
                                    the bark of trees. Britain produces about twenty species.</p>

                                    has been divided by Bonelli into two. The type of the first

                                    terminated by a truncation, but are either entire or slightly
                                    sinuated. The abdomen is separated from the thorax by an obvious

                                    to be regarded as not carnivorous. But in opposition to this
                                    opinion, so contrary to analogy, we have the authority, as Mr
                                    Macleay has noted, of two accurate observers, MM. Olivier and
                                    Lefebre de Cerisy. The latter, who resides at Toulon, possesses
                                    peculiar facilities for acquiring a knowledge of their natural
                                    habits. He states them to be nocturnal insects of prey, which,
                                    during the day, lurk motionless in holes of the earth, and sally
                                    out at night to attack Melolonthidae and other insects.<note

                                <p>The insects included in this division are rather strongly
                                    distinguished from the conterminous groups. As they are destined

                                    structure is more peculiarly adapted than that of the other
                                    Coleoptera to a subterranean mode of life. The body is narrow,

                                    with strong spines, presenting a broad surface, well fitted to
                                    remove the soil ;— the head and thorax are strong, and the
                                    latter is attached to the abdomen by a short peduncle or
                                    footstalk. In the last-mentioned particular they differ from
                                    most other pentamerous beetles, which usually have the thorax
                                    closely applied to the abdomen, and the hinder angles
                                    rectangular or even salient, which necessarily prevents any
                                    considerable degree of lateral motion. But in insects which
                                    excavate holes scarcely exceeding their body in width, some
                                    provision is necessary to enable them to turn their anterior
                                    portion in different directions, otherwise their progress would
                                    be nearly in a straight line. This object, which is analogous to
                                    that which is provided for in moles and other burrowing
                                    quadrupeds, by the flexibility of the vertebral column, is
                                    attained by the interposition of a narrow cylindrical piece
                                    between the abdomen and thorax, on which the latter moves as on
                                    a pivot, its hinder angles being rounded off that its motions
                                    may be performed with greater facility. The form of the antennae
                                    is likewise in beautiful accordance with the habits of the
                                    insects. They arc composed of nearly globular articulations
                                    attached to each other by a slender filament, bearing some
                                    resemblance to a series of beads rather loosely strung. By a
                                    structure of this kind, they are rendered greatly more pliant
                                    and flexile than in the other Pentamera (the joints oř the

                                    the <hi rend="italic">Aphom)</hi> with two ranges of papillae or
                                    scales, with an intermediate linear space. The body is always
                                    winged, generally oval and arched, or convex above, with the
                                    thorax broader than long, or at most nearly isometrical, square,
                                    or trapezoidal. The head is never suddenly contracted
                                    posteriorly. The antennae are of equal thickness throughout, or
                                    are slightly and insensibly enlarged towards the extremity. The
                                    mandibles are never remarkably strong. The external palpi are
                                    terminated by an oval or fusiform joint of greater length than
                                    that which precedes it. The tooth of the notch or emargination
                                    of the mentum is always entire,—in some wanting.<note

                                    robust, the tibiae spiny, and the hooks of the tarsi simple. The
                                    intermediate tarsi, even in the females, are short, and, with
                                    the exception of the dilatation, are formed nearly like the
                                    anterior. The species prefer warm and sandy situations exposed
                                    to the sun.</p>

                                    genus to the insects which now constitute the tribe <hi
                                    rend="italic">Harpaliens</hi> of Dejean, itself consisting of
                                    twenty-eight genera. The <hi rend="italic">Harpalidae</hi> of
                                    the British writers include, besides our present genus, many
                                    genera of the sections afterwards mentioned under the names of
                                    <hi rend="italic">Simplicimani</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Pateilirnani.</hi></p>
                                <p>The genus Harpalus, even as now restricted and above defined, is
                                    very extensive, and probably contains nearly one half of the
                                    species of the section. The larva? of these insects, as far as
                                    we are acquainted with them, dwell beneath the ground. Their
                                    form is conicocylindrical; their head large, armed with strong
                                    mandibles, resembling those of the perfect insect; the posterior
                                    part of their body exhibits a membranous tube, terminated by a
                                    prolongation of the anal region, and two fleshy articulated
                                    appendages. Their metamorphoses are likewise subterranean. The
                                    Harpali are distributed over all the earth. They are, however,
                                    obviously more abundant in the temperate and even boreal regions
                                    of the northern hemisphere, than in equinoctial or southern
                                    countries. Comte Dejean’s collection contains 179 species, while
                                    Mr Stephens enumerates (including the doubtful kinds) 58 species
                                    as indigenous to Britain, besides 15 <hi rend="italic"

                                    antennae and legs rufous, the elytra pubescent striated, the
                                    interstices punctured. This insect is spread over all Europe. We
                                    took it at Cape Wrath. It occurs in Siberia. Μ. Gou-dot brought
                                    it from Northern Africa.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="italic">H. oeneus</hi> is distinguished by various
                                    shades of green above, with a brassy or coppery lustre; the
                                    under side black; external margin of the elytra punctulated, the
                                    antennae and legs rufous. This species is extremely variable. It
                                    is generally of a rich bronzed green; the males highly polished,
                                    the females more obscure, sometimes brownish black. Mr Kirby
                                    once took a specimen of this insect, which he immersed in hot
                                    water, and was surprised to observe what he at first supposed an
                                    intestine thrust itself forth; on a nearer inspection he found
                                    it was an intestinal worm, thicker than a horse-hair, and of a
                                    brown colour.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                                <p>A great variety of opinion is maintained by entomologists
                                    regarding the distribution of the component parts of this

                                    great collector, he observes as follows: “Ma collection depuis
                                    cette époque s’etant considérablement augmentée, je me suis
                                    trouvé souvent tres-embarassé pour placer dans ces différents
                                    genres les espèces qui je recevais, surtout les exotiques, et
                                    quelquefois plusieurs d’entre elles me paraissaient
                                    intermédiaires entre deux genres, et appartenir autant à l’un
                                    qu’à l’autre. Plus je recevais d’insectes, plus je me trouvais
                                    embarassé, et lorsque je voulus classer definitivement toutes
                                    mes espèces dans chaque genre, et établir les caractères de
                                    chacun de ces genres, après plusieurs essais infructueux, je
                                    finis par être convaincu que cela était réellement impossible.”
                                    Dejean then thought of following the example of Sturm, who
                                    reduces (in his <hi rend="italic">Deutschlands</hi><hi
                                    rend="italic">Fauna)</hi> all the genera above named to those of

                                    rend="italic">Platysma·,</hi> but after a deliberate
                                    re-examination, even these did not appear sufficiently marked;
                                    and he finally determined to combine them all in one under the
                                    name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Feronia,</hi> a term previously
                                    used in a comprehensive sense by Latreille in the first edition
                                    of the <hi rend="italic">Pegne Animal.</hi></p>
                                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Feronia,</hi> then, of Dejean is one
                                    of the most extensive in the coleopterous order, containing
                                    above 230 species. It is subdivided by the last-named author
                                    into ten sections, corresponding to the same number of genera as
                                    established by Bonelli, Megerle, Ziegler, and Sturm.</p>
                                <p>According to Latreille’s views, the genus is divisible into three
                                    groups as follows: Isí, The species, generally winged, of which
                                    the body, more or less oval, is a little convex or arcuated
                                    above, with the antennae more filiform, the head proportionally
                                    narrower, and the mandibles somewhat less projecting. In their
                                    habits these insects approach the genera <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Harpalus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Zabrus.</hi> Such are the
                                    <hi rend="italic">Amaxoe,</hi> of which the thorax is transverse
                                    (and which Dejean admits as a distinct genus); the <hi

                                    compressed and angular; and the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Argutores,</hi> which resemble the Paecili, but have
                                    proportionally shorter antennae, with the third joint not
                                    angular.</p>

                                    above, with the head nearly as wide as the body. Such is the
                                    genus <hi rend="italic">Platysma</hi> of Bonelli, to which
                                    Latreille unites <hi rend="italic">Ornaseus</hi> of Ziegler and

                                    applicable to the British species, and have even proposed
                                    several others of still more limited application. We regret that

                                    distinct. Both varieties are in this country among the most
                                    common of coleopterous insects, occurring beneath stones, at the
                                    roots of trees, &amp;c. both on low grounds and on mountains.
                                    They seem less common in Germany than in any other country in

                                    is also of frequent occurrence in all parts of Britain. It is of

                                <p>This genus was established by Bonelli on the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Carabus</hi><hi rend="italic">cephalotes</hi> of Fabricius, and
                                    was also distinguished about the same period by Panzer under the
                                    name of <hi rend="italic">Broscus.</hi> We adopt the latter term
                                    as more familiar to the English collectors. Of the five species
                                    with which we are acquainted, two belong to Europe, one to the
                                    north of Africa, one to Mount Sinai, and the fifth to Asia
                                    Minor. They are all of considerable size, and bear a resemblance
                                    to the genus <hi rend="italic">Stempus</hi> of Megerle.</p>
                                <p>The only British species is <hi rend="italic">B. cephalotes,</hi>
                                    which is of an elongated form, black, with the head thinly
                                    punctured, and the elytra very finely punctate-striate. It
                                    occurs in ţsandy places over many parts of Britain; and in the
                                    vicinity of Edinburgh is plentiful under stones, and marine
                                    rejectamenta, on the shore between Portobello and Musselburgh.
                                    We found it as far north as Keoldale, near Cape Wrath. The
                                    attitude this insect assumes when disturbed is rather peculiar.
                                    The two anterior pair of legs are brought close together, and
                                    extended straight outwards at right angles with the under
                                    surface of the body. The hind legs are bent upwards, and project
                                    in a similar way from the opposite surface. The antennae are
                                    drawn close to the sides of the thorax, and the mandibles
                                    extended to their utmost stretch, while a considerable degree of
                                    rigidity is imparted to the whole. It takes this posture most
                                    readily in cold weather; at other times, when more active, it
                                    prefers seeking safety by flight, or by burrowing in the
                                    sand.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                                <p>“The habit of these insects,” it is elsewhere observed, “is very
                                    curious. They are found only in the sand on the sea shore, and
                                    live in dens about three inches deep and half an inch wide,
                                    which are made in a diagonal position in the sand, where it is
                                    mixed with decomposed stalks of <hi rend="italic">Elymus</hi><hi
                                    rend="italic">arenarius.</hi> They appear to rove during the day
                                    occasionally; but upon any alarm they run swiftly to their dens,
                                    projecting from the mouths of which their heads may be seen

                                <p>This section is chiefly distinguished from the preceding by the

                                    the first joints (usually the first three, then the fourth, in
                                    others only the first two) sometimes square, sometimes partly of
                                    that form, and the others heart-shaped or reversed triangular,
                                    but always rounded at their extremity, and not terminated, as in

                                    usually furnished with brushes or close set papillae, without
                                    any intermediate (vacancy. The legs are generally long and
                                    slender. The thorax is frequently narrower throughout its whole
                                    extent than the abdomen. The species frequent, for the most

                                    with six large punctures. There is only one recorded instance of

                                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Anchomenus</hi> is nearly allied
                                    to the preceding, but the labrum is plane, the thorax more or
                                    less cordiform, with obvious posterior angles. The body is not
                                    so flat. We are acquainted with above forty kinds, of which not
                                    more than five inhabit Britain. We consider <hi rend="italic"

                                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Chlaenius</hi> of Bonelli, the

                                    form of a reversed and lengthened cone. There are 115 species of
                                    this extensive genus, of which about eight are as yet recognised
                                    as British. They are ornamental insects, being frequently
                                    adorned with green, and burnished with a metallic lustre. They
                                    are spread over almost all the earth,—Europe, Asia, Africa, and
                                    America. They seem, however, rare in the southern division of
                                    the new world, and, as far as we know, have not yet been found

                                    numerous with which the entomologist is concerned, and is
                                    rendered highly interesting from the size and beauty of many

                                    second by the form of the labrum and mentum,—and from the third

                                <p>The name of Carabus (Kαβα∕3oς), applied generically by Linnaeus
                                    to so vast a group, occurs in Aristotle’s history of animals,
                                    and denotes sometimes a winged coleopterous insect, at other
                                    times a species of crustaceous animal. Latreille supposes it to
                                    be a contracted form of <hi rend="italic">Scara~ ljoeus.</hi> In
                                    addition to the characters already given, we may mention that
                                    the species of the genus, as now restricted, are all of
                                    considerable dimensions. Their colours are usually black with a
                                    tinge of purple, or greenish with a golden hue. The form of the
                                    body is elongated; the head, always narrower than the thorax, is
                                    generally of greater extent forwards than transversely, and is
                                    borne almost in a horizontal position. The eyes are globular,
                                    and behind them the head assumes a narrow neck-like form. The
                                    mandibles, which are strong and pointed, are usually destitute
                                    of dentation, and may be observed to cross each other when the
                                    insect is in a state of repose. The thorax is narrower than the
                                    abdomen, is bordered with a slightly recurved margin, and is
                                    almost always emarginate in its basal line; its superior portion
                                    (strictly speaking the <hi rend="italic">prothorax)</hi> is more
                                    extended than the inferior parts, and covers posteriorly the
                                    scutellum of the mesothorax, which, naturally but slightly
                                    developed, presents to view its summit only. The elytra are also
                                    margined after the manner of the thorax, and their upper
                                    surface, rarely smooth, is variously characterized, according to
                                    the species, by striae, furrows, depressed points, or rows of
                                    bead-like elevations. The true or membranaceous wings are either
                                    wanting or exist in a very rudimentary condition. The species
                                    therefore are incapable of flight; but, to make amends for this
                                    deficiency, their legs are strong and lengthened, the trochanter
                                    is greatly developed, and the tarsi of the anterior pair (in the
                                    males) are dilated, with their first four articulations spongy

                                    only prey upon the soft bodied and defenceless caterpillars, and
                                    on all other insects weaker thah themselves, but they even seize
                                    upon and devour their own species. They usually avoid strong
                                    light, are partial to a certain degree of moisture, and conceal
                                    themselves during the heat of the day beneath stones, among
                                    mossy herbage, in garden rubbish, or under the stems or within
                                    the hollows of fallen trees. We have noted the usual habits of
                                    each of the species in the descriptions which follow; and, in
                                    regard to their general distribution, we may observe, that their
                                    principal seat appears to be the north temperate zone, that they
                                    are extremely rare in the warmer regions of the earth, and
                                    probably disappear altogether within the tropics. Their larvae
                                    and metamorphoses are but slightly known. Many of the perfect
                                    insects exhale a penetrating and fetid odour, and when touched
                                    exude a dark-coloured caustic humour.</p>
                                <p>Mr Stephens enumerates nineteen species of British Carabi. The
                                    claims, however, of three or four of these (such as <hi

                                    as truly indigenous, are extremely doubtful. The occurrence of
                                    an insect on our island shores is sometimes accidental, and
                                    results from the fortuitous impulsion of winds or waves. It is
                                    well that the visits of these erratic strangers should be
                                    recorded, as they afford an interesting illustration of the
                                    extreme extent in one direction of their geographical range; but
                                    they cannot on that account be considered as “children of the
                                    soil.” We shall here give a few brief notices of the Scottish
                                    species.</p>

                                    series of deep golden excavations. This is one of the largest
                                    and finest of the British Coleoptera. It has hitherto been
                                    regarded as a very rare insect, but a closer examination of the
                                    wilder districts will probably bring it into more frequent view.
                                    We were the first to take it in Scotland,— which we did many
                                    years ago, and in considerable numbers (nine or ten specimens in
                                    a few days), in the island of Colonsay, the hospitable

                                    captured several specimens in different parts of Sutherland
                                    (near Invershin, on the point of Tongue, and the vicinity of
                                    Laing), in the month of August 1833; and Mr George Little has
                                    collected it for some seasons at Ormsary, on the mainland of
                                    Argyllshire. On the continent this beautiful insect is found in
                                    Siberia, Sweden, Hungary, Italy, and the south of France,
                                    especially in the environs of Montpellier. It varies singularly
                                    in regard to the development of the true or membranaceous wings.
                                    Those which occur in the south of Europe are large, and
                                    furnished with wings; those of Sweden and Siberia are apterous,
                                    and of smaller size.</p>

                                    the antennae are long and slender. All the species belong to
                                    Europe, and the greater proportion are found to occur in
                                    Britain. <hi rend="smallcaps">Nebria,</hi> Lat. resembles <hi

                                    proportionally thicker, and composed of shorter articulations.

                                <p>In other genera the body is tolerably thick, and the eyes large
                                    and prominent; the antennae are slightly enlarged near the
                                    extremity, and composed of short joints, mostly in the form of a
                                    top or reversed cone; one of the two spines of the internal
                                    extremity of the two anterior tibiae is inserted higher than the
                                    other, with a notch between them. The four or first three joints
                                    of the anterior tarsi of the males are in general but slightly
                                    dilated. The palpi are more elongated. They occur chiefly by the
                                    sides of rivers in Europe and in Siberia. We may here place the

                                    of Comte Dejean. We come now to <hi rend="smallcaps">Tribe 3d,
                                    Hydrocantiiari,</hi> Lat.</p>
                                <p>This tribe is composed of the undivided genera <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Dytiscus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gyrinus</hi> of the old
                                    writers. Their feet are adapted for swimming; the last four
                                    being compressed, ciliated or laminiform, and the last two at a
                                    distance from each other. The mandibles are almost entirely
                                    covered. The body is always oval, the eyes but slightly
                                    prominent, and the thorax much wider than long. The terminal
                                    hook of the maxillae is curved from its base; those at the
                                    extremity of the tarsi are often unequal.</p>
                                <p>All these aquatic Coleoptera pass both their first and final
                                    stage of existence in the fresh and placid waters of lakes and
                                    marshes, or the undisturbed parts of tranquil rivers, and are
                                    distributed over all the countries of the earth, wherever such
                                    localities occur, from Greenland to Van Diemen’s Land.</p>
                                <p>The old genus <hi rend="italic">Dytiscus</hi> (Plate CCXXII. fig.
                                    3 and 4) embraced a vast assemblage of aquatic insects which the
                                    more minute observance of modern times has partitioned into many
                                    genera. They form a truly amphibious family: for although water
                                    is their favourite element, they siirvive for a long time on
                                    moist land, and most of them fly about in the evening and
                                    morning twilight, and even during the darkness of the dewy
                                    night, with great power and celerity. They vary considerably in
                                    size, according to the species, some being extremely small,
                                    while others measure between one and two inches in length. They
                                    are fierce and voracious in their habits, preying
                                    indiscriminately upon whatever smaller and softer tribes they
                                    are able to subdue. They are frequently observed resting on the
                                    surface of the water, with their legs expanded, their heads
                                    downwards, and the terminal segment of their bodies in contact
                                    with the air. It is thus that they carry on the process of
                                    breathing, for they cannot respire except by bringing a globule
                                    of atmospheric air in contact with the stigmata, which are
                                    placed on the sides of the abdomen, ∣ just beneath the outer
                                    margins of the elytra. Being specifically lighter than water,
                                    when they feel the necessity of respiration they have nothing to
                                    do but to allow themselves to float to the surface, where, by a
                                    peculiar action of the tips of the elytra and the terminal
                                    segment of the body, a portion of air is brought into contact
                                    with the stigmatic openings. The bodies of the larvae of these
                                    insects (Plate CCXXII. fig. 6) consist of eleven well-defined
                                    segments. The head is large, flattish, covered above by a scale
                                    or shield marked down the centre by a longitudinal furrow. On
                                    each side there are five or six black tubercles which are
                                    regarded as eyes, and anterior to the eyes are placed the
                                    antennae, consisting of three articulations. The mouth is armed
                                    with a pair of strong, horny, curved, sharp-pointed mandibles,
                                    which serve to seize and transfix the prey. According to
                                    Swammerdam and Degeer, these organs are pierced so as to act as
                                    suckers, by means of which the animal juices are absorbed. Near
                                    the extremity of the abdomen two delicate appendices may be
                                    perceived, pointing obliquely downwards. By means of these the
                                    larva appears to suspend itself occasionally from the. surface
                                    of the water when it wishes to respire. The principal stigmatic
                                    openings are at the end of the abdomen, and consist of two small
                                    cylindrical bodies, which, when the creature floats, come in
                                    contact with the air, and communicate with the tracheal vessels,
                                    which are seen to traverse beneath the skin on either side of
                                    the body. The movements of these insects in the larva state are
                                    effected in the water, partly by the legs and partly by an
                                    undulatory motion of the tail. They prey upon other larvae, such
                                    as those of dragon-flies, ephemerae, gnats, &amp;c. As an
                                    instance of their great voracity, it may be mentioned that we
                                    once observed one of the larger kinds transfix and suck out the
                                    juices of thirteen well-grown tadpoles in a single day. When the
                                    period of their transformation has arrived, they leave the water
                                    and bury themselves in the moist soft earth of a neighbouring
                                    bank. There they work for themselves an egg-shaped chamber, in
                                    which they assume the nympha state. (Plate CCXXII. fig. 9.) How
                                    long they remain in that condition is not very precisely known,
                                    from the difficulty of rearing them in confinement throughout
                                    their entire changes, but it is believed that the insect is not
                                    long of making its appearance in the perfect state. It may then
                                    be kept alive in a tumbler for several seasons, and the larger

                                <p>In this genus the body is oval and generally very glossy. The
                                    head is sunk in the thorax almost to the eyes, and hese are
                                    large, and divided by a horny process or border, in such a way
                                    that there seems to be two above and two below. Only seven
                                    joints of the terminal por∙∙ ion of the antennae are distinctly

                                    approximated the genus to the <hi rend="italic">Dytiscidae,</hi>
                                    thereby correcting the error he had previously committed of
                                    confounding, as Mr Maclcay observes, a relation of analogy with
                                    one of affinity. The Gyrinidae live in society, and several
                                    species are extremely common on our ponds, and ditches by the
                                    way side. They swim flat upon the surface, with their shining
                                    backs above water, chasing each other in circles, or darting
                                    about in more irregular gyrations. When hemmed into a corner of
                                    the pond, they make their escape by darting beneath the surface,
                                    carrying along with them a portion of air, which shines like
                                    quicksilver. Britain produces several species of this genus.
                                    They are known in England by the name of whirlgigs. These
                                    insects fly well, and transport themselves with ease and
                                    rapidity from place to place. The females deposit their eggs on
                                    the leaves of aquatic plants. The eggs are very small,
                                    lengthened in the form of little cylinders, and of a white
                                    colour tinged with yellow. According to the observations of
                                    Degeer, they produced minute six-footed larvae in the course of
                                    eight days, which swam in the water, or crept along the sides of
                                    the vessel in which they had been deposited. Neither he nor
                                    Roesel, however, could succeed in rearing them to a state of
                                    completion. These larvae (Plate CCXX1I. fig. 17) exhibit rather
                                    a singular aspect, and at first sight resemble small
                                    Scolopendrae. They arc of a dingy white or greyish colour, and
                                    their clear transparent skin permits the view of their internal
                                    structure. Their bodies are long, slender, cylindrical, and
                                    divided into thirteen rings, which are deeply incised. The head
                                    is oval, very much elongated, and flattened both above and
                                    below. It is armed in front with a pair of comparatively large
                                    curved jaws, tipped with brown, which, when closed, meet with
                                    their points in advance of the head, but are capable of wide
                                    extension. The structure of these parts demonstrates a
                                    carnivorous disposition. The antennae are very delicate, divided
                                    into four articulations, and equal the head in length. The first
                                    segment of the body is nearly twice as long as the others, and
                                    the three pairs of feet are attached to the first three
                                    segments. The eight following rings are garnished with very
                                    singular, long, slender, transparent filaments, which float in
                                    the water without being apparently under the guidance of the
                                    animal. From their resemblance to the gills of the Phryganeae
                                    and Ephemerae, it is probable that these are the respiratory
                                    organs. The twelfth or penultimate segment of the body is
                                    furnished with four of these filaments, of much greater length
                                    than the preceding, and covered with long hairs or secondary
                                    filaments. The last segment, which is much less than the others,
                                    is terminated by four long and remarkable hooks, placed parallel
                                    to each other, with their points bent beneath inwards. The whole
                                    body" seems filled with little globules of air, which are in
                                    frequent motion, sometimes towards the head and sometimes
                                    towards the other extremity. Modeer has described the
                                    transformations of these creatures in the Memoirs of the Royal
                                    Academy of Sweden. About the beginning of August, according to
                                    that author, the larvae leave the water, and, crawling up the
                                    stems of reeds or other aquatic plants, they are transformed
                                    into nymphs, beneath the envelope of a small cocoon, pointed at
                                    both ends, and formed of a substance resembling grey paper.

                                    the sheltered pool; and every schoolboy who has angled for
                                    minnows in the brook is well acquainted with the merry swimmer
                                    in his shining black jacket. Retiring in the autumn, and
                                    reposing all the winter in the mud at the bottom of the pond, it
                                    awakens in the spring, rises to the surface, and commences its
                                    sports. They associate in small parties of ten or a dozen near
                                    the bank, where some little projection forms a bay, or renders
                                    the water particularly tranquil; and here they will circle round
                                    each other, without contention, each in his sphere, and with no
                                    apparent object, from morning until night, with great
                                    sprightliness and animation; and so lightly do they move on the
                                    fluid, as to form only some faint and transient circles on its
                                    surface. Very fond of society, we seldom see them alone, or, if
                                    parted by accident, they soon rejoin their busy companions. One
                                    pool commonly affords space for the amusement of several
                                    parties, yet they do not unite or contend, but perform their
                                    cheerful circlings in separate family associations. If we
                                    interfere with their merriment they seem greatly alarmed,
                                    disperse or dive to the bottom, where their fears shortly
                                    subside, as we soon again see our little merry friends gamboling
                                    as before. This plain, tiny, gliding water-flea seems a very
                                    unlikely creature to arrest our young attention; but the boy
                                    with his angle has not often much to engage his notice; and the
                                    social active parties of this nimble swimmer, presenting
                                    themselves at these periods of vacancy, become insensibly
                                    familiar to his sight, and by many of us are not observed in
                                    after-life without recalling former hours—scenes of perhaps less
                                    anxious days; for trifles like these, by reason of some
                                    association, are often remembered when things of greater moment
                                    pass off and leave no trace upon the mind.”<note anchored="true"

                                    recent writers. Ancient authors appear to have bestowed the name
                                    of <hi rend="italic">Staphylinus</hi> on certain species, which,
                                    from the characters assigned them, and their reputed injurious
                                    effects on horses, we can scarcely refer to any of the modern
                                    genera of brachelytrous insects. Mouffet, however, having
                                    satisfied himself that some ancient passage did apply with
                                    sufficient correctness, made use of the term Staphylinus in
                                    relation to the present group; and whatever may have been its
                                    original application, its meaning is now no longer ambiguous in
                                    the modern systems. The genus, as constituted by Linnaeus, was
                                    first dismembered by Fabricius of two of its component groups,
                                    under the generic names of <hi rend="italic">Poederus</hi> and

                                    still more recent times numerous other subdivisions have taken

                                    >orthopterous</hi> order. In their habits they somewhat resemble
                                    the Silphae and Necrophori. They have usually a large, flattened
                                    head, strong mandibles, short antennae, and a thorax as wide as
                                    the abdomen, which is long, narrow, and generally depressed. The
                                    elytra are very short and truncated, although they still suffice
                                    to cover the long membranous wings, which, when not in use, are
                                    compactly folded. The upper portion of the segments of the
                                    abdomen, being exposed in consequence of the shortness of the
                                    elytra, is, contrary to the usual rule among the coleopterous
                                    tribes, of as firm a consistence as that beneath. From the
                                    terminal segment of the abdomen two vesicles are protruded or
                                    retracted at the pleasure of the animal, and from these, when
                                    irritated, a subtile vapour makes its escape with a strong odour
                                    of sulphuric ether, “Though most of the micropterous species,”

                                    insects of this family, when attacked or touched, elevate the
                                    extremity of their abdomen, bend it in various directions, and
                                    frequently protrude the vesicles above alluded to. They also use
                                    the point of the abdomen to close or unfold their wings. The
                                    tarsi of the two anterior legs are frequently broad and dilated,
                                    and their coxae, as well as those of the intermediate pair, are
                                    very large. The species usually occur in damp places, under
                                    stones, in earth, and excrementitious matters. Some live in
                                    mushrooms and fungi, or in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193747039"

                                    smaller species are found on flowers. They are all swift,
                                    active, and voracious.</p>
                                <p>The larvae bear a close resemblance to the perfect insect. In
                                    figure they more nearly resemble an elongated cone, the base of
                                    which is formed by the head; the terminal segment is prolonged
                                    into a tube, and is accompanied by two conical and hairy
                                    appendages. Their food and habits of life are very similar to
                                    those of the imago.</p>
                                <p>According to M. Dufour, the only essential difference between the
                                    alimentary canal of the brachelytrous tribes and that of the
                                    carnivorous Coleoptera consists in the absence of the crop. The
                                    first stomach is small and destitute of folds; the second is
                                    very long and pilose; the intestine is extremely short. The
                                    biliary vessels are inserted at the same lateral point as in the
                                    Carnivora, and present in some species, near the middle, a knot
                                    or vesicle, not observable in any other insects. Their sexual
                                    apparatus differs greatly from that of the carnivorous
                                    Coleoptera.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                                <p>Many of the species of this family are of minute dimensions, and
                                    a knowledge of their names and characters is of difficult
                                    attainment. Many more of the described species than have been
                                    hitherto collected no doubt exist in Britain, and many of the
                                    Scandinavian species will probably be discovered to inhabit
                                    Scotland. There is every reason, indeed, to believe that an
                                    assiduous entomologist would here reap a rich harvest among a
                                    tribe of insects which seem characteristic of, though by no
                                    means peculiar to, temperate or northern countries.
                                    Notwithstanding the obscurity in which many of our smaller
                                    species are still involved, Great Britain already possesses

                                    maxillary palpi, which are much shorter than the head, and
                                    always consist of four distinct articles; the anterior tibiae,
                                    at least, are dentated or spinous along their exterior side. The
                                    last joint of the tarsi, which in most are bent under the
                                    tibiae, is as long as all the preceding joints combined, or
                                    longer; and the first or first two are usually so small or so
                                    concealed that their total number does not seem to exceed two or
                                    three. In several males the forepart of the head, and even the
                                    thorax, is armed with horns. The antennae are inserted before

                                <p>All these insects walk very slowly, but fly exceedingly well in
                                    dry and sultry weather. When an attempt is made to seize them
                                    they drop upon the ground, with a view no doubt to conceal
                                    themselves in the subjacent herbage. The abdomen of the female
                                    is furnished at its extremity with a coriaceous or horny conical
                                    appendage, composed of three pieces (the terminal abdominal
                                    rings), and which may be regarded as a kind of ovipositor, by
                                    which she deposits her eggs in dry or decayed wood, in which the
                                    larvae dwell. Several of the minor species occur on leaves and
                                    flowers; but the greater proportion are found in forests or
                                    depots of timber. They sometimes appear suddenly in places where
                                    they were never seen before, having been involuntarily
                                    transported in foreign timber in the nymph or larva state.</p>
                                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Buprestides</hi> are very common in South

                                    climes, and altogether disappear in colder countries. Scarcely a

                                <p>This numerôus tribe corresponds to the undivided genus <hi
                                    rend="italic">Elater</hi> of Linnaeus, and differs from the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Buprestides</hi> chiefly in the posterior style of
                                    the praesternum, which is prolonged to a sharpish point or spine
                                    laterally compressed. On examining the living species, the use
                                    of the last-named organ becomes obvious. The legs are very
                                    short, and when the creature falls upon its back, which it
                                    frequently does while dropping from a plant to the ground, it
                                    can only assume its natural position by springing upwards, which
                                    it is enabled to do by bringing the projecting point into sudden
                                    contact with a groove situated in front of the mesosternum. The
                                    sides of the praesternum are also distinguished by a groove, in
                                    which the antennae, pectinated or bearded in several males, are
                                    partly lodged. The females have a species of elongated
                                    ovipositor, with two lateral pieces pointed at the end, between
                                    which is the true oviduct. The tarsi are entire.</p>
                                <p>The Elaterides occur in flowers, on various plants, and on the
                                    ground. We owe to Degeer the description of the larva of one
                                    species <hi rend="italic">(undulatus).</hi> It is long, nearly
                                    cylindrical, provided with small antennae, palpi, and six feet.
                                    Its body consisted of twelve sealysegments, of which the
                                    posterior was covered by a circular plate, furnished with two
                                    blunt points curving inwards; underneath was a large fleshy
                                    mammilla, which seemed to serve the office of a foot. The larvae
                                    of <hi rend="italic">Elater</hi><hi rend="italic">striatus</hi>
                                    are said to do much injury, by attacking the roots of wheat. The
                                    grub known in this country under the name of wire-worm is an
                                    Elater in the early state. It lives under ground for several
                                    years, feeding on the roots of grain and vegetables. It is
                                    partial to land newly broken up, and does great damage in
                                    gardens recently converted from pasture-land. In the year 1813,
                                    according to Mr Spence, this larva destroyed the greater
                                    proportion of the annuals sown in the botanic garden of Hull. In
                                    such cases Sir Joseph Banks recommended that slices of potatoes
                                    stuck upon skewers should be buried near the seeds, and examined
                                    and cleared of the wire-worms from time to time.</p>
                                <p>Μ. Leon Dufour has studied the anatomical structure of several
                                    species of this family. In the number, length, and mode of
                                    insertion of the hepatic conduits, they show a resemblance to
                                    the Carabidae. The digestive canal is seldom more than once and
                                    a half the length of the body. Immediately succeeding an
                                    oesophagus, so short as to be included within the region of the
                                    head, there is a small smooth conical crop, which appears to
                                    have escaped the observation of Ramdhor. The chylific ventricle
                                    is bilobed in certain species. This tribe is very extensive both
                                    in exotic and European species, and is much more prevalent in
                                    temperate and even northern countries than the preceding. The
                                    <hi rend="italic">Elaterides</hi> now consist of numerous
                                    genera. Some of the American species are remarkable for the fine
                                    phosphoric light which is observed to emanate from them during
                                    the evening twilight, and when the shades of night have fallen
                                    upon the forests. One of these had the fortune to be transported
                                    to Paris under the form of nymph or larva; and having made its
                                    escape into the streets after the assumption of the perfect
                                    state, it greatly astonished the inhabitants of the Faubourg St
                                    Antoine. Most of the genera are recognisable, in a general way,
                                    by their narrow, elongated, and somewhat flattish forms. We have

                                    measures when full grown about seven lines in length. The body
                                    is very narrow, of a yellow colour, hard, shining, and composed
                                    of twelve segments, on the last of which are two indented
                                    dark-coloured specks. The head is brown, the extremity of the
                                    jaws black. The anterior segments have six sealyfeet. It is said
                                    to remain five years in the larva state, from which it issues as

                                    owner calculated his loss at L.100. He one year sowed a field
                                    thrice with turnips, which were twice wholly, and the third time
                                    in great part, cut off by this destructive larva.<note

                                <p>This tribe is distinguished from the preceding by the enlarged
                                    termination of the palpi, at least of those of the maxillae; by
                                    their straight, depressed, but slightly convex body; and by the
                                    thorax, sometimes semicircular, sometimes nearly square or
                                    trapezoidal, projecting over and almost concealing the head. The
                                    mandibles are generally small, and terminate in a slender,
                                    arcuated, very acute point, generally entire. The penultimate
                                    joint of the tarsi is always bilobate, and the terminal hooks
                                    have neither dentations nor appendages. The females of some are
                                    apterous, or have but short elytra. When seized, most of these
                                    insects press their feet and antennae close to the body, and
                                    remain as motionless as if they were dead. Several curve the

                                    observance of common things, has not failed to immortalize the
                                    radiance of the “earth-born star.” “And if,” say Messrs Kirby
                                    and Spence, or one or other of these authors, while speaking of
                                    the British glow-worm, “living like me in a district where it is
                                    rarely met with, the first time you saw this insect chanced to
                                    be, as it was in my case, one of those delightful evenings which
                                    an English summer seldom yields, when not a breeze disturbs the
                                    balmy air, and hundreds of these radiant worms, studding their
                                    mossy couch with mild effulgence, were presented to your
                                    wondering eye in the course of a quarter of a mile,—you could
                                    not help associating with the name of glow-worm the most
                                    pleasing recollections. No wonder that an insect which chiefly
                                    exhibits itself on occasions so interesting, and whose economy
                                    is so remarkable, should have afforded exquisite images and
                                    illustrations to those poets who have cultivated natural

                                <p>The glow-worm is now a very rare insect in the neighbourhood of
                                    Edinburgh. Mr Neill informs us that it formerly occurred between
                                    the city and the village of Canonmills; but we have not heard of
                                    its having been found there or elsewhere around our immediate
                                    suburbs for many years. Dr David Ritchie has observed it
                                    occasionally near Pathhead, and Professor Wallace has met with
                                    it in Fife. Professor Wilson informs us that he once saw it on
                                    the Queensferry road, near Comely Bank. We have ourselves taken
                                    it by Loch Lomond side, and elsewhere in Scotland. It abounds in
                                    the north of England. We once received some living specimens
                                    early in July from Borthwick, about twelve miles from Edinburgh.
                                    They laid eggs a few days after their arrival, on the sides of a
                                    glass vessel. The parents soon after died, probably from being
                                    kept in too confined a space; but the young larvae were hatched
                                    in a few weeks, and by the end of September they measured about
                                    the third of an inch in length. These larvae bear a strong
                                    resemblance to the female perfect insect. The body is Composed
                                    of twelve segments, of which the central are the largest. The
                                    three first segments bear each a pair of feet, and the caudal
                                    segments are slightly retractile within each other; and when the
                                    insect walks, which it does very leisurely, it bends its tail
                                    beneath it in such a way as to assist or support it in its
                                    progress. The head is very small, and is also retractile, and is
                                    usually withdrawn whenever the insect is alarmed or disturbed.
                                    These little creatures throve well in captivity. They were kept
                                    on a piece of moist mossy turf, which was frequently renewed;
                                    but whether they sustained themselves on the dewy herbage, or by
                                    means of the minute animal substances which it contained, it was
                                    not for a time very easy to discover. The curved and extended
                                    form of the little jaws would in the first place induce one to
                                    suppose that they were carnivorous. Olivier, however, observes,
                                    in his description of the larva of the glow-worm, “elle vie
                                    cependant sur de la terre fraiche, avec de Therbe et des
                                    feuilles des différentes plantes; mais l’on a remarqué qu’elle
                                    devient foible et languissante, quand on la laisse manquer de
                                    terre humide. Elle est très-pacifique, et paroit
                                    craintive.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                                    certainly seems necessary to their welfare, for we noticed that,
                                    when their turf became dry, and a slice of fresh apple or potato
                                    was introduced, they immediately settled on it, and inserted
                                    their heads as if drinking. We, however, soon after detected one
                                    with its jaws fixed in the head of a minute snail, which it
                                    appeared to be devouring, its own head being inserted into the
                                    aperture of the shell.</p>
                                <p>This observation appeared the more interesting, in as far as it
                                    served to connect those insects, by means of their habits, with
                                    that singular species the <hi rend="italic">Drilus</hi><hi
                                    rend="italic">flavescens,</hi> which is known to feed
                                    voraciously on the <hi rend="italic">Helix</hi><hi rend="italic"
                                    >nemoralis,</hi> and the female of which was described by
                                    Mielzinski as the type of a distinct genus, under the name of
                                    <hi rend="italic">Cochleoctonus.</hi> This latter insect is
                                    parasitical on the body of the helix, in the shell of which it
                                    dwells and undergoes its metamorphoses.</p>
                                <p>While engaged in the observance of these glow-worms, we met with
                                    a notice, in the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi rend="italic"
                                    >des Sciences,</hi> by a French gentleman of Rouen, on the same
                                    subject. In it we have ample proof of the carnivorous
                                    propensities of the creatures in question. He placed a great
                                    number of the larvae in a vessel with fresh earth, and supplied
                                    them with various kinds of leaves. They soon however became
                                    extremely feeble, and remained so for several weeks, when he
                                    happened to put a dead slug in their jar, of which the young
                                    glow-worms were no sooner aware than they greedily seized upon
                                    it with their arched and sharp-pointed mandibles. On the ensuing
                                    day they were found to have eaten their way so far into the
                                    slug, that nothing but their tails was visible. They were
                                    perceived however occasionally to quit their prey and walk about
                                    upon the moist earth. The French naturalist was curious to
                                    observe how they would proceed with a living snail, and he
                                    therefore introduced one into his colony of insects. The animal
                                    soon began to crawl about its new domicile, but it no sooner
                                    came upon the path of a glow-worm than it was seized by the
                                    latter immediately beneath the mouth, and with such force and
                                    tenacity that it drew itself suddenly into its shell, and of
                                    course dragged its enemy along with it. The glow-worm however
                                    immediately disengaged its hold, and struggled back to the mouth
                                    of the shell, on the back of which it soon mounted, thus keeping
                                    the snail in a state of siege. Whenever it protruded even the
                                    point of its horns it was instantly seized, bitten, and obliged
                                    to withdraw within its fortress. The larva being soon joined by
                                    a companion, the two attacked the unfortunate snail, and <pb
                                    break="no" facs="nls:193747117" xml:id="kp-eb0709-7117-0143"/>
                                    after a continued combat of several hours, they put it to death,
                                    and by next morning it was not only slain, but eaten. These and
                                    similar experiments were made from the month of November to the
                                    month of June, after which the larvae were observed to undergo
                                    their transformations. They occupied about a week in assuming
                                    the state of nymph—they continued in that state eight days
                                    longer— and then appeared in the form of the perfect insect.
                                    When about to assume the nympha state, the skin of the upper and
                                    anterior portion of the body cracks and opens, or a lateral
                                    division takes place on either side, so as to separate the skin
                                    of the upper from that of the under portion. By alternate
                                    elongations and contractions they then work their way forwards,
                                    and contrive to effect their liberation in a few minutes from
                                    their old attire. The nymph is larger than the larva, though not
                                    quite so long. Its colour is at first pale yellow, with two
                                    reddish spots on the posterior and lateral portion of each
                                    segment of the abdomen, as well as on the posterior angles of
                                    the thorax. It wants the large acute mandibles of the larva; its
                                    antenna? are very obvious, and consist of eleven articulations.
                                    The tarsi are likewise distinctly composed each of five
                                    articulations. The last rings of the abdomen are very brilliant,
                                    especially when the insect is handled; and it was noted as
                                    remarkable that the whole body partook, though with less
                                    intensity, of that phosphoric splendour which in the perfect
                                    insect characterizes only the terminal segments of the abdomen.
                                    Before the termination of the eight days which are passed in the
                                    nympha state, all the more delicate colours had disappeared, and
                                    were finally converted into those duller hues which distinguish
                                    the insect in its matured condition. As soon as it has
                                    disengaged itself from the slough of the larva, it bends its
                                    body into an arch or semicircle, and is then a genuine nymph,
                                    although it still continues to move its head, and even its limbs
                                    and antennae. In this intermediate condition its general form
                                    has undergone no great change, but the head, feet, and antennae
                                    are considerably altered, and seem enlarged or swollen. At first
                                    the body manifests a slow and heavy movement, which ere long
                                    ceases, and the antennae and feet are then applied more closely
                                    to the sides of the body. The only signs of life now consist in
                                    a movement of the abdomen, which is bent into an arch, or
                                    occasionally moved from side to side. The body is shorter than
                                    that of the larva, the head is bent beneath the first segment or
                                    thorax, the antennae consist of numerous articulations, and the
                                    caudal segment of the body, instead of being terminated by a
                                    couple of points, is now surrounded by eight of those points, in
                                    the centre of which are two fleshy tubercles, placed in a slight
                                    depression. Olivier had previously informed us that the nymph,
                                    after quitting the skin of the larva, shone with a very lively
                                    and brilliant light of a beautiful green colour, which became
                                    more splendid for a time when the vessel which contained it was
                                    moved, and disappeared again, as if by some voluntary action of
                                    the animal, even in the nympha state, in which the vital and
                                    instinctive powers are usually almost m a state of suspension.
                                    According to Dcgeer, the larva is also luminous. We did not
                                    however observe any manifestation of that faculty in those in
                                    our keeping.</p>
                                <p>It has been a frequent subject of inquiry to ascertain the
                                    purposes which the light is intended to serve. In the perfect
                                    state the female continues wingless, while the male has become
                                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> swift-flying insect; and this has led
                                    to the supposition that the lambent flame, which is always most
                                    conspicuous in the female, is intended as a “nuptial lamp,” to
                                    guide the male to her society. In this case, however, we do not
                                    so clearly see the use of it in the larva and nympha states,
                                    unless, to be sure, as a preparatory process for the formation
                                    of the animal phosphorus. Although many insects discover each
                                    other merely by the sense of smell, the fact seems nearly
                                    certain that the male or winged glow-worm ascertains his mate by
                                    aid of her luminous property; for it is a well-known and
                                    successful entomological device to place a female in a
                                    conspicuous position, and watch by her side, with a view to
                                    entrap the rarer or less visible males, which ere long make
                                    their appearance. Olivier has frequently caught the males by
                                    holding a female on the palm of his hand,—which makes it the
                                    more singular that he did not perceive the two luminous points
                                    which the former bears on the last segment of the abdomen,—“Je
                                    n’ai pas encore m’assurer, il est vrai, si le mâle de notre
                                    espece commune a la propriété de luire.” We may add, that the
                                    eggs are also beautifully luminous for some time after they are
                                    laid.</p>
                                <p>Dufour has examined the anatomical structure of the female
                                    glow-worm. The alimentary canal measures about twice the length
                                    of the body. The oesophagus is so short as to be nearly
                                    imperceptible. It dilates immediately into a short crop. The
                                    chylific ventricle is separated from the crop by a valvular
                                    contraction. It is long, smooth, that is, unprovided with
                                    papillae, but pursed and cylindrical in its two anterior thirds,
                                    and intestiform in the remainder. The small intestine is very
                                    short.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                                <p>The matter from which the luminous property of the glow-worm
                                    results has been the subject of frequent experiment and
                                    observation. It is obviously under the control of the insect,
                                    which, when approached, may frequently be observed to diminish
                                    or put out its light.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                                <p>In the perfect female the luminous matter occupies chiefly the
                                    inferior part of the three last annuli of the abdomen. These
                                    differ from the rest in colour, and are usually of a yellow hue,
                                    especially on the under side. The light diffused is more or less
                                    intense, according to circumstances. The insect lives for a
                                    considerable time in a vacuum, and in various gases; but in
                                    nitrous acid, muriatic and sulphurous gases, it soon expires.
                                    When placed in hydrogen gas it has sometimes been observed to
                                    produce detonation. When the luminous portion of the body of a
                                    glow-worm is cut off, the insect continues to live, and the
                                    separated segments retain their phosphoric nature, and are
                                    luminous for some time, whether placed in vacuum, exposed to the
                                    air, or submitted to the action of different gases. By what
                                    means the living insect is able to shroud itself in darkness,
                                    and then suddenly to clothe itself an it were in a mantle of
                                    radiant light, is a subject beyond our power of investigation;
                                    but when dried the phosphorescence seems to depend on a certain
                                    degree of softness or humidity; for when apparently quite
                                    extinct, it may be reproduced by pressure, and the application
                                    of a little moisture. In the living state, however, although
                                    immersion in warm water produces a brilliant light, the
                                    application of cold water tends to its speedy extinction.</p>
                                <p>The next peculiarity in the history of the glow-worm consists in
                                    the change of its habits in regard to food, which takes place on
                                    its attaining maturity. From an insect of a predaceous nature,
                                    greedy of animal juices, it becomes entirely herbivorous, not
                                    much addicted indeed to food of any kind, but still confining
                                    itself, when it does indulge in eating, to the tender leaves of
                                    plants. It is <pb break="no" facs="nls:193747130"
                                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-7130-0144"/> this circumstance which has no
                                    doubt led to so much contrariety of opinion on the part of
                                    entomological writers regarding its natural disposition. Most
                                    observers having attended to it chiefly after it had undergone
                                    its transformations, they naturally, and so far correctly,
                                    concluded that it was a herbivorous insect. Had they watched its
                                    progress from the egg they would have come to another
                                    conclusion, at least in regard to its earlier condition. This
                                    alteration in the habits of these creatures is in fact by no
                                    means unexampled, either among other genera of the same class,
                                    or among the more distantly related ιep-tile tribes. The most
                                    familiar instance among the latter is the common frog, which in
                                    the early state of tadpole is herbivorous, while under the
                                    perfect form it preys on flics and other insects. In this case,
                                    to be sure, the order of change is inverted, the alteration
                                    being from a herbivorous to a carnivorous diet; while the
                                    contrary takes place in the glow-worm. But the analogy is more
                                    strictly maintained in the case of those aquatic beetles which
                                    form the family of <hi rend="italic">Helophoridae,</hi> which in
                                    the larva state are carnivorous, but become herbivorous after
                                    assuming their final transformation. The same, singularity is
                                    also illustrated by many dipterous flies, which, born and bred
                                    amid the putrid moisture of animal remains, no sooner become
                                    winged insects, than they seek a purer diet in the nectarous
                                    juices of fruits and flowers.</p>
                                <p>In relation to the glow-worm, the observation is of more
                                    practical interest, because the appearance of the insect among
                                    our lawns and shrubberies is so extremely ornamental during the
                                    summer nights, that many have tried to import it to districts
                                    where it does not naturally occur. They have failed, in
                                    consequence of endeavouring to rear the young on vegetable food.
                                    Moist herbage, or a supply of damp earth, seems almost
                                    indispensable; but, in addition to these, their box must contain
                                    some minute testacea, such as the young of the ordinary species
                                    of the genus Helix. Perhaps the best plan is to hatch the eggs,
                                    and then place the young at liberty under an old hedge as soon
                                    as they have begun to eat freely.</p>

                                <p>All the remaining genera of this second division of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Lampyrides</hi> are winged in both sexes, and the
                                    maxillary palpi are not much 1 ∙nger than the labial. They
                                    correspond to the family <hi rend="italic">Teleplioridae</hi> of
                                    English naturalists, and are composed chiefly of the species
                                    placed by Linnaeus under the genus <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Cantharis.</hi> Schoeffer and Degeer reserve that name to the
                                    species used in medicine, and apply the term Telephorus
                                    (probably from 0sλoς pogεω, <hi rend="italic">I carry

                                    are constituted by the genus Meloe, and the well-known

                                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Telepiīorus</hi> (Plate CCXXΠL
                                    fig. 11) the palpi are terminated by a securiform article, and
                                    the <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> thorax offers no lateral
                                    emarginations. Their bodies are long, narrow, depressed, and of
                                    a soft or somewhat flexible consistence. These insects abound in
                                    meadows during the summer season, on umbelliferous and other
                                    plants. The larvae are characterized by a flat sealyhead,
                                    furnished with two strong teeth, a pair of small antennae, and
                                    four palpi. Their bodies are flattish beneath, divided into
                                    twelve rings resembling those of caterpillars, and covered by a
                                    membranous skin, which is soft to the touch. The general colour
                                    of these larvae is a deep velvety black, except the front of the
                                    head, which is shining. The antennae, palpi, and feet are of a
                                    reddish or yellowish brown. They dwell in moist earth. Olivier
                                    was of opinion that they fed on roots, but the laborious and
                                    accurate Degeer asserts that they voraciously devour a great
                                    variety of insect prey. That of <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Telephorus</hi><hi rend="italic">fuscus</hi> was observed to
                                    change into the nympha state towards the end of May. It buried
                                    itself in the earth, but presented no appearance of cocoon. The
                                    nympha was about six lines in length, with the body somewhat
                                    arched, and of a pale-reddish white. The perfect insect was
                                    developed in the month of June. Even in the last-named state, in
                                    which so many species are chiefly occupied in the indulgence of
                                    other propensities, the Telephori, according to Degeer, continue
                                    their accustomed appetite. He has observed a female drag a male
                                    to the ground, turn him on his back, and suck out his entrails;
                                    so that, as among the spider tribes, considerable caution is
                                    necessary on the part of an inexperienced suitor while making
                                    his advances. Mr Curtis has frequently seen Telephori with other
                                    insects in their mouths. He once observed <hi rend="italic"
                                    >T.</hi><hi rend="italic">lividus</hi> eating an ichneumon, and
                                    he took another of the same species with an Empis in its mouth.
                                    <hi rend="italic">T.</hi><hi rend="italic">fuscus</hi> is known
                                    to prey upon its own species. There are above thirty different
                                    kinds of this genus in Britain. Dejean, under the Linnaean name
                                    of <hi rend="italic">Canthams,</hi> enumerates 132 species.
                                    Whatever we know of the anatomy of these creatures accords with
                                    their apparent dispositions. Dufour has ascertained that their
                                    digestive canal is absolutely straight. Their biliary vessels
                                    are four in number, in which character, as well as in that of
                                    their generative system, they present a resemblance to the genus
                                    Lycus.</p>
                                <p>One of the most remarkable incidents in the history of the
                                    Telephori is the frequency with which, in some continental
                                    countries, the species are carried into the air in great
                                    quantities by violent winds, and unexpectedly deposited in
                                    distant regions,—thus giving rise to what are called <hi
                                    rend="italic">insect showers.</hi> Sweden and Hungary have been
                                    most productive of such phenomena. One of the most ornamental of
                                    the British species, and the only one we shall here describe, is
                                    <hi rend="italic">T.</hi><hi rend="italic">cyaneus</hi> of
                                    Curtis. The head is black and shining, but rufous before the
                                    eyes; the thorax and abdomen are likewise rufous, the elytra are
                                    deep blue, the legs black. This insect is pretty widely, though
                                    sparingly, distributed over the southern and central counties of
                                    Scotland, and the north of England. We have specimens from the
                                    Edinburgh district, from Kinordy in Forfarshire, from Dollar in
                                    Clackmannanshire, and from Dumfries and Roxburgh shires.</p>
                                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Silis</hi> of Megerle differs from
                                    the preceding chiefly in having an emargination posteriorly on
                                    each side of the thorax. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Maltninus</hi>
                                    of Lat. (Plate CCXXI∏∙ fig· 14) the palpi are terminated by an
                                    ovoid joint; the head is narrow behind; and the elytra, in
                                    several species, are shorter than the abdomen.</p>

                                <p>Here we find the palpi generally short and filiform; the
                                    mandibles emarginated at the point; the body usually narrow and
                                    elongated; the head only covered at base by a flat or but
                                    slightly convex thorax, generally square, or elongated and
                                    quadrilateral; the joints of the tarsi entire, and the terminal
                                    hooks unidentated or bordered with a membrane. The antennae are
                                    usually serrated, and even pectinated, in the males of several
                                    species. Most of these insects are of active habits. They occur
                                    on the leaves and flowers of plants.</p>

                                    of Fab. (Plate CCXXIII. fig. 13), there is a retractile and
                                    dilatable vesicle under each anterior angle of the thorax, and
                                    on each side of the base of the abdomen. Most of the species are
                                    adorned by ornamental and contrasted colours. The habits of the
                                    larvae are but obscurely known. Olivier presumes that many of
                                    them live in wood, because he has frequently found the perfect
                                    insect in timber-yards, as if newly escaped from the nympha
                                    state. This is an extensive genus, and may be regarded as
                                    characteristic of temperate climes, although a few occur in
                                    Africa and the East Indies. Mr Stephens enumerates seventeen
                                    British species. Comte Dejean’s collection contains 104 in all.
                                    Among the Mclyrides with filiform antennae, but of which the
                                    thorax and abdomen are unfurnished with retractile vesicles,
                                    Latreille places the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"

                                    as long as the head and thorax; and the body is generally narrow
                                    and elongated, sometimes linear. We have figured the male of <hi

                                    thorax, insensibly enlarged, but without forming a club, as in
                                    <hi rend="italic">Lygia.</hi> Their joints are also less dilated
                                    laterally', and are almost isometrical. The thorax is less

                                    clavate. The mandibles are dentated. The penultimate joint of
                                    the tarsi is bilobate, the first very short or but slightly
                                    visible in several. The antennae vary, being in some nearly

                                    extremity. The body is usually cylindrical, the head and thorax
                                    narrower than the abdomen, and the eyes emarginate. Most of
                                    these insects occur on flowers, some of them on the trunks of
                                    trees or in dry timber. The larvae are regarded as

                                    joint in the form of a reversed triangle, the last of the labial
                                    palpi, which are larger than the others,· being securiform. The
                                    club of the antennae is hardly longer than wide, and is composed
                                    of crowded joints; the third is longer than the second. The
                                    maxillae terminate in a fringed and projecting lobe. The thorax
                                    is depressed anteriorly. The species, in the perfect state,
                                    occur on flowers. Their larvae feed on those of certain bees.
                                    Dufour has described their internal structure. The crop is so
                                    short as to be almost entirely contained within the head. In <hi

                                    Lat. (Plate CCXXII1. fig. 19), the four palpi are terminated by
                                    an elongated, compressed, triangular joint of the same size; the
                                    second and third joints of the antennae are almost equal, and
                                    the terminal club is elongated, and with looser articles. These
                                    insects occur chiefly in spring. They are said to live on
                                    carrion, and are richly adorned for such foul feeders. Deep blue
                                    is their prevailing colour. There are four species in Britain,
                                    of which we have as yet found only two in Scotland, viz. <hi

                                    If the geographical notices which we have collected of the
                                    former species be correct, its distribution must be very
                                    extensive. It seems to occur both in Africa and the East
                                    Indies,—a wide circuit for an insect which we have taken behind
                                    the glass-works at Leith. “Insectum mihi carissimum,” says

                                    possesses a body of a tolerably firm consistence, in some cases
                                    almost ovoid or oval, and at others nearly cylindrical, but
                                    generally short, and rounded at either end. The head is nearly
                                    globular or orbicular, and is received almost entirely into a
                                    strongly arched or rounded thorax, resembling a hood. The
                                    antennae of some are filiform, or diminished towards the
                                    termination, and are simple, flabelliform, pectinated, or
                                    serrated; of others they are terminated suddenly by three larger
                                    and longer joints. The mandibles are short, thick, and dentated
                                    beneath the point. The palpi are very short, and terminated by a
                                    larger article, almost ovoid, or like a reversed triangle. The
                                    tibiae are not dentated, and the spurs at the extremities are
                                    very small. These insects are all of small size, exhibit little
                                    variety in their colouring, which is usually dark or sombre, and
                                    when touched they counterfeit death. Their motions are slow, and
                                    such as are winged seldom take to flight. In the larva state
                                    they are extremely destructive in museums.</p>

                                    originally bestowed upon the insects of the last-named genus by
                                    Geoffroy, was transferred by Linnaeus to a very different group.
                                    His genus <hi rend="italic">Ptinus</hi> included both <hi

                                    Fabricius was the institutor of the genus Anobium, so called

                                    with most of their congeners, by their frequent simulation of
                                    death, and their re-assumption of activity as soon as the
                                    threatened danger is removed. In this instinctive mode of
                                    preservation Olivier accuses them of exhibiting an invincible
                                    obstinacy. “Ils se laissent entièrement bruler sans donner aucun
                                    signe de vie.” The larvae of these insects are extremely
                                    injurious to old furniture, in which they perforate numerous
                                    round holes. Hence the genus is named vrillette by the French,
                                    from <hi rend="italic">vrille,</hi> a gimlet. In the larva state
                                    they resemble small, white, soft worms, with six short minute
                                    feet. The head is scaly, and is terminated by two maxillae in
                                    the form of strong cutting pincers, with which they gnaw the
                                    wood into the finest sawdust. When about to change into the
                                    nympha state, they line the bottom of their little cells with a
                                    few silken threads. Other species feed on flour, bread,
                                    sealing-wafers, &amp;c. where they form grooves or galleries,
                                    according to the thickness of their working materials. The
                                    superstitious fancy of the <hi rend="italic">death-watch</hi>
                                    has arisen partly from an insect of this genus, the <hi

                                    share this mysterious calling with the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Termes</hi><hi rend="italic">pulsatorium of</hi> Linnaeus, and
                                    probably with several others. According to Dr Shaw, it is in the
                                    advanced state of spring that the former of these insects
                                    commences its mysterious pulsations, which, he asserts, is
                                    nothing more than the signal-call of the sexes. The number of
                                    distinct strokes is generally from seven to eleven, and these
                                    are occasioned merely by its beating with its head with
                                    considerable force and quickness against the plane of its
                                    position.'· Where the insects are numerous, as is not
                                    unfrequently the case in old bouses, these sounds may be beard
                                    during the whole day, especially in warm weather. The sound
                                    greatly resembles a moderate tapping on a table with the finger
                                    nail, and indeed by that simple process they may be induced to
                                    beat in reply wļjen not otherwise inclined so to do. “He that
                                    could eradicate this error,” says the quaint Sir Thomas Brown,
                                    in allusion to the death-tick, “from the minds of the people,
                                    would save from many a cold sweat the meticulous heads of nurses

                                    ones, are usually entire. In the larva state they feed on animal

                                    the thorax by an ovoid strangulation. The maxillary palpi
                                    project, and are long and inflated at the extremity. The abdomen
                                    is large, oval or ovoid, and laterally embraced by the elytra.
                                    The legs are elongated, the thighs clavate, the joints of the
                                    tarsi entire. These insects are found on the ground beneath

                                    >Hister</hi> of Linnaeus. The four posterior legs are more

                                    anterior pair. The legs are contractile, and the exterior tibiae
                                    dentated or spinous. The antennae arc always bent or <hi

                                    of a very solid consistence, and the elytra so hard that even
                                    the pin of the entomologist is with difficulty made to enter,
                                    and the praesternum is often dilated in front, and the elytra
                                    truncated. The mandibles are strong, and not unfrequently
                                    unequal as to size. The palpi are almost filiform, or slightly
                                    enlarged at their extremity, and terminated by an oval or ovoid

                                    with pointed and projecting papillae. The hepatic vessels have

                                    frequently with a tinge of bronze. Such of the larvae as are

                                    sealyand of a brown or reddish colour. These larvae have six
                                    short legs, and are terminated by a pair of articulated
                                    appendages, and an anal prolongation or tube. The sealyshield of

                                    the antennae, scarcely longer than the head, terminate abruptly
                                    in an almost globular club of four joints, the first of which is
                                    long, and the second much shorter than the third. The body forms
                                    nearly' a parallelopiped; the thorax is widest anteriorly; all
                                    the tibiae are strong, widened at the extremity, and terminated
                                    by strong spurs; the elytra are truncated at right angles. The
                                    maxillae are destitute of a corneous claw.</p>
                                <p>This important and well-marked genus was first defined by
                                    Fabricius. Linnaeus had placed the species of which it is
                                    composed with the Silphae, while Scopoli and Geoffroy combined
                                    them with the genus Dermestes. The most marked peculiarity in
                                    their manners consists in their habit of interring small
                                    animals, such as mice and moles, for the purpose of depositing
                                    their eggs in their decaying carcass. To effect this operation,
                                    they remove the earth from beneath the dead body, which sinks
                                    into the’hollow, and is afterwards covered with the looser soil
                                    of the excavation. Their sense'of smell, like that of many other
                                    insects, is extremely delicate, and no sooner has any of the
                                    smaller quadrupeds perished, than one or more of these
                                    grave-diggers make their appearance, and in a few hours the
                                    corpse is interred. The larvae are of a lengthened form, of a
                                    greyish-white colour, with a brown head. Their bodies are
                                    composed of twelve rings, furnished on their anterior and
                                    superior portion with a small sealyplate or shield, of a
                                    ferruginous brown colour; the shields of the last segments are
                                    provided with small elevated points. The head is hard, scaly,
                                    and furnished with strong cutting mandibles. The feet are six in
                                    number, very short, and attached to the first three segments of
                                    the body. When these larvae have attained to their final term of
                                    increase, they descend, it is said, fully a foot beneath the
                                    surface, and, forming an oval chamber, the walls of which are
                                    strengthened by a coating of a gluey liquid, they assume<pb

                                    genus in Britain. Dejean possesses twenty-five. They are all of
                                    considerable size, and are chiefly from Europe and North
                                    America. We have received a specimen from Persia.<note

                                    the second of which is larger than the third. Their body is
                                    oblong oval, the thorax almost orbicular, widest in the middle.
                                    The tibiae are narrow, elongated, slightly enlarged at the end,
                                    and terminated by two ordinary spurs. The elytra are obliquely
                                    truncated. We have probably not more than one species in
                                    Britain, <hi rend="italic">N. littoralis</hi> (the species

                                    depressed, or but slightly elevated. The thorax is semicircular,
                                    truncated, or very obtuse before; the exterior margin of the
                                    elytra strongly recurved and guttered; the palpi filiform, with
                                    the last article almost cylindrical, and in many terminated by a
                                    point. Most of these insects feed on carrion, and thus
                                    contribute to the more speedy disappearance of putrid effluvia.
                                    Some climb upon plants, particularly the stems of wheat and
                                    other grain, where they find small <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Helices,</hi> on which they prey. Others dwell on trees, and
                                    feed on caterpillars.</p>
                                <p>The genus was originally of great extent, but has been much
                                    modified and circumscribed by Fabricius, Dejean, Latreille,
                                    Leach, and others. The species which it now contains resemble
                                    their congeners in being of an essentially carnivorous
                                    nature—preferring animal substances in a state of putrescence to
                                    fresher food. They exhale a disagreeable odour, and, when
                                    seized, a thick and dark coloured liquid exudes from their
                                    bodies. The larvae resemble the perfect insects in their habits.
                                    They consist of twelve segments, of which the sides are
                                    terminated by sharp angles, the terminal segment being furnished
                                    with two conical appendages; the head is small, and bears a pair
                                    of tri-articulate filiform antennae, and two strong maxillae.
                                    Like the preceding genus, they undergo their metamorphoses under
                                    ground. The species are pretty extensively distributed over the
                                    earth, and are rather numerous. Dejean enumerates thirty-four
                                    species in his Catalogue, which, however, includes under the
                                    generic name of Silpha the genera <hi rend="italic"

                                    British species. Most of these are deep black or dark brown. One

                                    Greville. It is more frequent in England, where it frequents oak
                                    woods for the purpose of preying on lepidopterous larvae.</p>

                                    The tarsi are composed of five very distinct and entire joints.
                                    The body is oval, narrowed at either end, arcuated or convex
                                    above, and thick in the middle. The head is low, and received
                                    posteriorly into a trapezoidal thorax, slightly bordered,
                                    broadest behind. The antennae are generally as long at least as

                                    extremity; the tarsi seem to consist of only four joints, the
                                    first and last, in some, being only visible beneath, where they
                                    form but a slight projection,— in others the penultimate is
                                    extremely small, in the form of a knot, inclosed within the

                                    short or truncated. The legs are but slightly elongated, and
                                    their tibiae frequently widened at the end; the tarsi are
                                    furnished with hairs or pellets. These insects are of various
                                    habits, according to the species. They occur on flowers, in
                                    mushrooms, beneath the bark of trees, and even on putrid meat.

                                    by a kind of club, usually perfoliate, but composed at most of
                                    only nine articulations, and inserted beneath the advanced and
                                    lateral margins of the head, and scarcely longer than it and the
                                    maxillary palpi,—frequently even shorter than these last-named
                                    organs. The mentum is large and buckler-shaped. The body in this
                                    family is generally ovoid or hemispherical, and arched or
                                    convex. The feet in most of the genera are formed for swimming,
                                    and these present either four articulations to the tarsi, or
                                    five, of which the first is much shorter than the second: the

                                    (genus <hi rend="italic">Hydrophilus</hi> of Geoffroy) Linnaeus
                                    formed only a division of his genus Dytiscus. Their anatomical
                                    structure however differs in many important particulars from
                                    that of the true Dytisci. The digestive canal, which is four or
                                    five times as long as the body, presents a strong analogy, both
                                    in its length and texture, to that of the Lamellicornes, and
                                    differs from that of the Carnivora excepti as regards the
                                    biliary vessels. We perceive neither the swimming bladder nor
                                    the excrementitial apparatus, such as these exist among the
                                    Hydrocanthari. In the females only, the latter is replaced by
                                    secreting organs fitted for the formation of a cocoon to contain
                                    the eggs. The sexual organs of the male bear a great resemblance
                                    to those of the preceding family. These and other considerations
                                    have induced M. Latreille to place them here. The species are
                                    more convex in their general forms than the Dytiscidae, and
                                    their antennae are dissimilar; but in many of their instincts
                                    and habits of life, and in their general transformations, they
                                    bear a resemblance to that group. The largest water insect of

                                    small tooth at the inner angle. This fine insect flies well and
                                    swims swiftly, but is inefficient as a pedestrian. When held
                                    loosely in the hand it sometimes inflicts a wound with the point
                                    of the sternum. The female constructs an ovoid cocoon, arcuated,
                                    and of a brown colour. Its exterior tissue is composed of a
                                    gummy paste, at first somewhat fluid, which soon hardening,
                                    becomes impenetrable by water. The eggs which it envelopes arc

                                    whitish down. These cocoons float in the water.<note

                                    of being drawn backwards. This peculiar faculty gives it the

                                    Their tarsi consist of five distinct articulations, of which the
                                    first is at least as long as the following. The maxillary palpi

                                    inflated, and in the form of a reversed cone. The maxillary
                                    lobes are membranous. The body in this tribe is almost

                                    the most remarkable of the order,—whether we consider the great
                                    size of many species, the singularly varied forms of their head
                                    and thorax, or the richness of the metallic colouring with which
                                    the vegetable-eating kinds are frequently adorned.</p>
                                <p>The antennae, inserted in a deep groove beneath the lateral
                                    margin of the head, are always short, and composed generally of
                                    nine or ten articulations; they are always terminated in a club
                                    or mass, which usually consists of three joints, expanded in the
                                    form of thinnish plates or leaves, disposed in various
                                    ways,—like the spokes of a fan, the leaves of a book, the teeth
                                    of á comb, or a series of funnels placed above and within each
                                    other. The body is generally ovoid or oval, and thick. The
                                    exterior edge of the two anterior tibiae are toothed, and the
                                    articles of the tarsi, with the exception of certain males, are
                                    entire, and without brush or pellet beneath. The anterior
                                    extremity of the head is advanced and dilated in the form of a
                                    clypeus or epistoma. The mentum is usually large, covering the
                                    ligula, or incorporated with it, and bearing the palpi. The
                                    mandibles of many are membranous, a character scarcely if at all
                                    to be observed in any other Coleoptera. The males are frequently
                                    very different from the females, being distinguished by
                                    horn-like elevations on the head and thorax, and by the greater
                                    size of the mandibles. Linnaeus indeed founded the sections of
                                    bis great genus Scarabaeus in accordance with these peculiar
                                    projections, while Scopoli assumed the spines or teeth of the
                                    fore-legs as the distinguishing characteristic of his
                                    subdivisions. The latter author likewise proposed two other
                                    methods, one of which regards the number of articulations in the
                                    clava of the antennae, and the other takes into consideration
                                    the varying manners of the insects themselves. The former of
                                    these is extremely defective, the second is chiefly deserving of
                                    consideration as exhibiting the first attempt ever made towards
                                    a natural arrangement of these insects. They are divided into
                                    <hi rend="italic">An-thophylli, Phyllophagi,</hi> and <hi

                                <p>Degeer was the first to avail himself of the improvements
                                    indicated by Scopoli, while at the same time he avoided his
                                    principal imperfections. He arranged the Scarabaei into three
                                    families, as follows: lsí, <hi rend="italic">Scarabées de terre

                                    phyllophagous insects.</p>
                                <p>Geoffroy separated from Scarabaeus of Linnaeus the ex-scutellated
                                    species under the name of <hi rend="italic">Copris,</hi> and
                                    Scopoli’s genus Lucanus under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Platycerus.</hi> The institution of the genus Copris was
                                    certainly an improvement, although it was founded on such
                                    defective characters, that coprophagous nsects, such as the
                                    family Geo-trupini of Latreille, were included in the same genus
                                    with Cetoriia, from which they might have been perceived to be
                                    distinct so soon as the necessity was admitted of carrying the
                                    investigation among the <hi rend="italic">Lamellicornes</hi>
                                    somewhat beyond that first affinity—the form of the
                                    antennae.</p>
                                <p>At a still later period Fabricius further improved upon the
                                    heterogeneous composition of Geoffroy’s genus Scarabaeus, by
                                    taking from it the genera <hi rend="italic">Trox, AIelolontha,
                                    Ce-tonia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Trichius.</hi> But the
                                    re-union of Geoffroy’s genus Copris with Scarabaeus was a
                                    retrograde step which the entomologist of Keil afterwards
                                    corrected in a supplementary work. The connection, however,
                                    between the insects afterwards named <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Geotrupes</hi> by Latreille and the genus Copris of Geoffroy,
                                    was so far re-established by the formation of the Fabrician
                                    genus Scarabaeus.</p>

                                <p>This important family, in the system of Latreille, seems to
                                    include all those insects classed by Linnaeus in the old genera
                                    <hi rend="italic">Scaraboeus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Lucanus.</hi> The lamellicorn tribes, indeed, include a very
                                    numerous assemblage, many of which, especially such as feed on
                                    flowers and living vegetation (called <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Thalerophaga</hi> by Macleay), arc remarkable alike for beauty
                                    of form and splendour of colour. Most of those, however, which
                                    feed on decomposed vegetables, or excrementitious substances,
                                    are usually of a more uniform black or brownish hue. But even
                                    the coprophagous kinds sometimes surprise us by their beauty,
                                    and present a singular contrast when disentangled from their
                                    repulsive habitations. They are all winged insects, although for
                                    the most part rather dull and heavy in their movements.</p>
                                <p>The larvae are long, semi-cylindrical, soft, of a whitish colour,
                                    and divided into twelve rings or segments. The head, of a harder
                                    consistence, is armed with strong mandibles. The feet are six in
                                    number, and squamous or of a sealytexture. On each side of the
                                    body there are nine stiginatic openings. The posterior extremity
                                    is the most bulky; it is rounded and almost always curved
                                    inwards, in such a manner as to prevent the larva from extending
                                    itself in a straight line. Its motions are consequently slow and
                                    awkward, and when crawling on the surface it frequently rolls
                                    over or falls on one side. The nympha or intermediate state is
                                    in some instances not assumed till after the lapse of several
                                    years. Immediately preceding the assumption of that state the
                                    larva protects itself by means of a cocoon of an oval form,
                                    composed of earth and the gnawed fragments of other materials,
                                    agglutinated by a viscous secretion which exudes from its body.
                                    These larvae seek their food in the dung of cattle, in tan pits,
                                    in gardens where rich vegetable mould occurs, and among the
                                    roots of plants. In regard to their interior structure, it has
                                    been observed that the nervous system, when studied in the
                                    different stages of life, presents a considerable dissimilarity.
                                    The ganglions are less numerous, and approximate more to each
                                    other, when the insect has reached the term of its final
                                    transformation; and the two posterior ganglia throw out numerous
                                    filaments disposed in a somewhat radiated form. In the larva the
                                    trachea is elastic, but simply tubular in the perfect insect.
                                    The structure of the eye in most of the lamellicorn beetles
                                    exhibits characters analogous to those of the Tenebrionites, the
                                    Blattae, and other lucifugous or light-shunning species.</p>
                                <p>The alimentary canal is of great length, especially among the
                                    coprophagous kinds; and the chylific ventricle is beset with
                                    papillae, which, according to the investigations of Μ. Dufour,
                                    serve as the receptacles of the alimentary fluids. The biliary
                                    vessels resemble those of the carnivorous Coleoptera in number
                                    and position, but they difłer in being of greater length and
                                    much more slender. Latreille divides this important family into
                                    two tribes.</p>

                                    >Scaraboeus</hi> of Linn. Their antennae are terminated by a
                                    foliaceous club, generally capable of being alternately closed
                                    or expanded; or are composed of joints that fit into each other,
                                    either in the form of a reversed cone, or nearly globular. The
                                    mandibles are of identical form, or nearly so, in both sexes;
                                    but the head and thorax of the males frequently exhibit
                                    projections or peculiar forms. The antennae in the latter sex
                                    are frequently more fully developed than in the females. The
                                    alimentary tube in these insects is generally much longer than
                                    that of the following tribe, and the oesophagus is
                                    proportionally shorter. But it is chiefly by the genital system
                                    of the males that the Scarabacides are distinguished, not only
                                    from the tribe with which they are conjoined, but from all other
                                    pentamerous Coleoptera. The larvae have a cylindrical stomach
                                    surrounded by three ranges of small caeca, the small intestine
                                    very short, the colon extremely thick and turgid, and the rectum
                                    of moderate size. A prodigious accession of fine typical forms
                                    has been received of late years by this division of Entomology,

                                <p>In some of these the antennae are formed of nine, in others of
                                    only eight articulations; the three terminal ones forming the
                                    club. The labruin and mandibles are membranous and concealed.
                                    The terminal lobe of the maxillae is also of the same
                                    consistence, broad and arcuated al the upper margin, and curved
                                    inwards. The terminal-article of the maxillary palpi is always
                                    the largest of all, nearly oval or almost cylindrical; but that
                                    of the labial palpi is almost always more slender than the
                                    preceding, or very small. Behind each of these latter palpi is a
                                    membranous projection, in the form of a ligula. The mentum is
                                    emarginate. The sternum presents no particular projections, and
                                    the hooks of the tarsi are always simple. The anterior tarsi are
                                    frequently wanting incertain species, either naturally or
                                    because they are deciduous. The extent of the alimentary canal
                                    is always very great, occasionally (as in <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Copris</hi><hi rend="italic">lunaris)</hi> even ten or twelve
                                    times the length of the body. The chylific ventricle occupies
                                    the greater portion; it is beset with papillae, conoid or in the
                                    form of nails, folded on itself, and maintained in that state of
                                    agglomeration by numerous tracheal bridles. The intestine is
                                    filiform, but terminates in an enlargement. “Les testicules des

                                    a lengthened triangle; the intermediate pair terminate, like
                                    those of the preceding, in two strong spines; but the head or

                                    temperate zone; and Mr Macleay has made out the proportion of
                                    tropical species to be to those from countries beyond the
                                    tropics as one to eight. According to the same authority, none

                                    posterior extremity of the abdomen; but their other features are
                                    distinctive. The labrum is coriaceous, and generally projects
                                    beyond the epistoma. The mandibles are corneous, and usually
                                    curved and salient. The terminal lobe of the maxillae is
                                    straight, and not curved inwards. The third and last article of
                                    the labial palpi is always very distinct, and always at least as
                                    long as the preceding. With few exceptions, the antennae consist
                                    of from ten to eleven articulations. Like the preceding insects,
                                    however, these also live in dung, beneath which they dig holes
                                    in the earth. Their principal period of flight is during the

                                    occur on sandy soils, and are supposed by Latreille to feed on
                                    the roots of plants. We suspect that our knowledge is still
                                    extremely vague regarding their habits of life and modes of
                                    transformation. It is certain that they are attracted by dried
                                    bones and other cadaverous remains, but it is difficult to
                                    determine whether this is owing to the peculiar colour, or the
                                    nature of the animal substance. Pallas observes, “sub
                                    cadavcribus aestivo ardore exsiccatis cum Histeribus et
                                    Dermestibus hospitatur;” but it by no means follows from that
                                    peculiarity of position that the insect partakes of the carcass,
                                    any more than that numerous other species which seek the secure
                                    covering of a rock or mass of stone, are in the habit of
                                    devouring these inorganic matters. We may further remark that
                                    the Troges are the only petalocerous insects among which we find

                                    opposition, on the history of its congeners, and the value of
                                    the groups into which they have been divided. These in general
                                    are supposed to delight in cadaverous substances: all insects

                                    collected in masses, arc provided with wings, which convey them

                                    decaying objects which they instinctively desire; but the

                                    creates a feeling bordering upon awe, such as that which an

                                    a Scottish mountain. An eagle, from his size and strength, is
                                    called a “feathered king,” although his body is less than that
                                    of a pig a few months old. A mastiff or Newfoundland dog, being
                                    among the largest of the canine kind, is called “majestic,”
                                    although a sucking elephant might squeeze both of them to death
                                    by an accidental stumble,-—the said elephant being at the same
                                    time regarded as a “poor creature,” because it is not a full
                                    grown example of the “wisest of beasts.” An ancient walrus,
                                    floating among the hoary icebergs of the arctic seas, is looked
                                    upon as one of the most ponderous of created things; yet a
                                    Greenland seaman considers as insignificant, and will scarcely
                                    throw his harpoon into the sides of a young whale, which with
                                    one blow of its upraised tail could lash the ocean into foam,
                                    sink a “captain’s gig,” and send the walrus with a fractured
                                    skull to the bottom of the sea. The same principle is capable of
                                    illustration, by the practice of the more enthusiastic disciples
                                    of Isaac Walton. Even the most experienced of anglers gazes with
                                    delight, almost with wonder, at a river trout of three or four
                                    pounds weight. A grilse of the same dimensions, when made
                                    to·“spurn the indignant shore,” is viewed by the salmon fisher
                                    almost with a feeling of disappointment. We remember our friend

                                    angler was greatly astonished by a Loch Awe trout, which, though
                                    a giant of its kind, was, when brought to the balance, found

                                    sexes, and not characterized by peculiar projections. The
                                    anterior margin of the labrum is almost always exposed or
                                    apparent. The maxillae are entirely squamous, as if truncated at
                                    the termination, and furnished with five or six strong teeth on
                                    their inner edge. The mentum is proportionally shorter and
                                    broader than that of the Scarabaei, and less narrowed
                                    superiorly. The mesosternum is frequently prolonged to a horn or
                                    blunt point between or beyond the second pair of legs. The
                                    scutellum is usually large. The hooks of the tarsi are generally
                                    unequal. A small number excepted, these xylophilous Coleoptera
                                    are peculiar to the equatorial regions of the new world. They
                                    resemble in many respects our preceding subjects, and are at the
                                    same time nearly allied to the Melolonthae, and particularly the
                                    Cetoniae, of which they bear the external aspect, although their
                                    masticating organs differ. Fabricius and Olivier, in fact,
                                    arranged most of these insects with each other. The body of the
                                    kinds now under consideration is shorter, more rounded, and
                                    smoother than that of the preceding. They moreover differ in
                                    being frequently ornamented with brilliant colours.</p>

                                    moderate; and the sternal point is short,—not reaching to the
                                    origin of the two anterior feet. The body is ovoid or oval. <hi

                                    26), differs from the preceding in the proportions of the
                                    mentum, which is obviously longer than broad; in the short and
                                    rounded form of the body; in the length of the scutellum, which
                                    at least equals a third of that of the elytra; and in the length
                                    of the sternal point, the extremity of which attains to the
                                    origin of the two anterior legs, or extends beyond it. The
                                    mandibles are almost triangular, with the extremity pointed or
                                    emarginate. The maxillae are furnished with several teeth. One
                                    of the hooks of the tarsi, at least of the four anterior ones,
                                    is biful, the other entire. Here Latreille places also the genus

                                <p>This section, as well as the ensuing, is formed from the great
                                    genus <hi rend="italic">Melolontha</hi> of Fabricius, of which
                                    certain species are scattered also among the preceding groups.
                                    The Phyllophagi are nearly related to the concluding genera of
                                    the third section. Their mandibles, however, are covered above
                                    by the epistoma, and concealed beneath by the maxillae,—their
                                    exterior side being alone exposed, but without either protruding
                                    or presenting the sinuosities or dentations observed in the
                                    Rutelae and other analogous genera. The anterior edge of the
                                    labrum is exposed, and is sometimes of the form of a broad
                                    reversed triangle, sometimes (and more frequently) of a
                                    transverse lamina, emarginate in the centre. The number of the
                                    articulations of the antennae is by no means uniform, and varies
                                    from eight to ten. The same observation applies to those of the
                                    club, which in several differs even in the sexes of the same
                                    species. The ligula is entirely covered by the mentum, or
                                    incorporated with its anterior face, and the elytra meet
                                    completely along the whole of the dorsal suture,—characters
                                    which distinguish our present species from those of the fifth or
                                    ensuing section.</p>

                                <p>The family of <hi rend="smallcaps">Anaplognathides</hi> of Mr
                                    Macleay, and some other genera nearly allied to the preceding,
                                    form the first subdivision according to Μ. Latreille’s views.
                                    The epistoma is thickened anteriorly, and forms, either alone or
                                    with the labrum, a vertical facette in the form of a reversed
                                    triangle, the point of which rests on the mentum. This
                                    last-named portion is sometimes almost ovoid, densely pilose,
                                    with the extremity either rounded or truncated, and without
                                    emargination,—sometimes in the form of a transverse square, with
                                    the middle of the superior margin prolonged into a tooth, simple
                                    or emarginate. The maxillae of some terminate by a coriaceous or
                                    membranous lobc, very hairy, without teeth, or with a very small
                                    number, and situate near the middle of the internal border
                                    ;—those of the others are entirely corneous, resemble mandibles,
                                    and are either truncated or obtuse and entire at the end, or
                                    terminated by two or three teeth.</p>
                                <p>In the genera <hi rend="smallcaps">Paciiypus</hi> of Dejcan, and
                                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Amblyteres</hi> of Maelcay, the mentum is
                                    almost ovoid; and in the former the antennae of the males are
                                    composed of only eight joints, of which the last five form the
                                    club,—in the latter they consist of ten joints, of which the
                                    last three form the club.</p>
                                <p>In the other genera of this subdivision the mentum forms a
                                    transverse square, the centre of the superior margin projecting
                                    in the manner of a tooth, entire or emarginate. In the genus <hi

                                    tarsi are entire and unequal. The antennae are composed of ten
                                    joints, and the extremity of the maxillae is truncated, or
                                    obtuse and entire. These insects are <pb break="no"

                                    form of a transverse plate or leaflet, generally strongly
                                    emarginate beneath in its centre, so that when seen in front it
                                    exhibits the figure of a reversed or demi-truncated heart. The
                                    mentum is as long if not longer than broad, somewhat narrowed
                                    anterior to the summit, and either nearly square or
                                    heart-shaped; its superior margin is straight, or more or less
                                    emarginate or concave, in the middle, but without any tooth-like
                                    dilatation. The maxillae arc usually squamous, and armed with
                                    several (frequently five.or six) teeth, 1his subdivision is
                                    itself capable of a further partition into two groups, the first
                                    corresponding to the genus <hi rend="italic">Melolontha</hi> of
                                    Fabricius, as restricted by liliger and Latreille—the other to
                                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Hoplia</hi> of Illiger. The former
                                    continues to bear the name of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                    >Melolonthides.</hi></p>
                                <p>Distinguishable by the following general characteristics. The
                                    number of complete leaflets of the club exceeds three in several
                                    genera. The form of the body is usually thick and massive. The
                                    mandibles are strong, entirely or in greater part corneous, and
                                    exhibiting at most only a membranous and hirsute appendage,
                                    placed in the emargination of the inner side; the superior
                                    extremity is strongly truncated, with two or three teeth or
                                    angular projections. All the tarsi are terminated by two hooks;
                                    the first article of the two anterior being prolonged inferiorly
                                    into a hooked appendage. The labrum is usually apparent,—the
                                    maxillary teeth robust.</p>
                                <p>The insects of which this group is composed were included by
                                    Linnaeus, like all those with which we have been lately engaged,
                                    in his extensive genus <hi rend="italic">Scarabaeus,</hi> and
                                    they also continued to form a portion of that genus in the works
                                    of Geoffroy, Degeer, Schaeffer, and other entomologists prior to
                                    the time of Fabricius. The last-named author established the
                                    genus <hi rend="italic">Melolontha,</hi> which in its extended
                                    signification may be regarded as synonymous with the
                                    Melolonthides of Latreille. Were we to follow the prevailing and
                                    praiseworthy example of botanists, who bestow upon a <hi
                                    rend="italic">family</hi> the name of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >genus</hi> by which it is most strongly characterized, our
                                    present group ought to be denominated <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Sericides,</hi> in as far as the type is not formed by <hi
                                    rend="italic">Melolontha vulgaris,</hi> but rather by <hi
                                    rend="italic">Μ. brunnca</hi> of Fabricius, which now
                                    constitutes the genus <hi rend="italic">Serica</hi> of Macleay.
                                    But as it is at all times desirable that families should be
                                    named after well-known genera, the designation now adopted is
                                    preferable to that which might be derived from the less noted
                                    though more characteristic type. The Melolonthides are not often
                                    distinguished by brilliant or metallic colouring. Their elytra,
                                    of which« brown is a characteristic colour, are generally
                                    slightly sealy1 or hirsute. Throughout the entire period of
                                    their existence these insects live on vegetable substances, and
                                    their ravages are often extremely injurious. The larvae are very
                                    long lived, and sometimes pass three or four years in that
                                    destructive state. In cold and temperate climates they are very
                                    sluggish, if not torpid, during winter, and descend somewhat
                                    deeper into the earth to avoid the effects of frost. The perfect

                                    and other ancient authors, and was first applied by Fabri cius
                                    to the insects of the present genus. It is derived from the
                                    words mentioned above, because the insects it denoted either
                                    were supposed to be pioduced from the flowers of fruit-trees, or
                                    were accustomed to resort to them for food. This circumstance
                                    renders it probable that the of the ancients belonged to the
                                    family Cetoniides, as the true Melolonthides are hardly ever
                                    seen on flowers; and the description of Eustathius, who says
                                    that the animal resembled a wasp, led Air Macleay to conjecture
                                    that it might be the <hi rend="italic">Tiichìus</hi><hi

                                    mode of flight. Jylouiiets investigations led him to a very
                                    different conclusion—that the insect was of a metallic green,
                                    and referable to the <hi rend="italic">Bupres-tides.</hi> I he
                                    former opinion is greatly the more probable, and accords with

                                    particularly Hesychius and the scholiast on Aristophanes; but
                                    these notices are too imperfect to warrant the determinate
                                    application of a word obviously, used with considerable latitude
                                    of meaning, and intended in all probability to indicate a group
                                    or tribe of insects rather than any individual species. (See <hi

                                    marked by a range of triangular spots. The elytra are

                                    assume the nympha state in the course of the third autumn after

                                    larva than in any other state, great ravages are occasionally
                                    committed even by the perfect insect. It is in relation to the
                                    present species that Mouffet records the number of beetles which
                                    at Qne time fell into the Severn as being sufficient to stop the
                                    wheels of the water-mills. In the year 1688 they covered the
                                    hedges and trees in a district of the county of Galway, in such
                                    infinite numbers as to hang in clusters like bees when they
                                    swarm. When on the wing they almost darkened the light of day,
                                    and produced a peculiar sound by the rustling of their wings.
                                    When feeding, the noise of their jaws might have been mistaken
                                    for the sawing of timber; and in a very short time the foilage
                                    of the trees for miles around was so totally consumed, that at
                                    midsummer the country wore the aspect of the leafless

                                    the grub of the common cockchafer. This insect, which is found
                                    to remain in the larva state for four years, sometimes destroys
                                    whole acres of grass, as I can aver from my own observation. It
                                    undermines the richest meadows, and so loosens the turf that it
                                    will roll up as if cut with a turfing spade. These grubs did so

                                <p>M. Leon Dufour, as Latreille informs us, has remarked, that the

                                    than that of the Melolonthae, and rather approaches the same
                                    part in the genus Cetonia. The chylific ventricle is smooth and
                                    flexuous. The small intestine is shorter than in Melolontha, and
                                    often presents an ovoid inflation at its origin. The great
                                    intestine is elongated, and destitute of valvular
                                    anfractuosities, and the rectum is distinctly marked by an
                                    obvious collar. The generative system resembles that of the

                                    equal length. The body is generally furnished with minute
                                    scales. The epistoma is either almost square or nearly
                                    semicircular. The thighs of the two hind legs are moderately
                                    enlarged, and the tibiae are long, straight, and without a

                                    coriaceous and dentated along the inner edge. The labrum and

                                <p>In these the body is depressed, usually oval, brilliant,
                                    hornless, with the thorax trapeziform or almost orbicular. An
                                    axillary piece occupies, in the greater number, the space
                                    comprised between the posterior angles and the exterior of the
                                    base of the elytra. The anal termination is exposed. The sternum
                                    is frequently prolonged in the form of a point or advanced horn.
                                    The hooks of the tarsi are equal and simple. The antennae are
                                    10-articulate, with the last three joints forming the elub,
                                    which is always foliaceous. The labrum and mandibles are
                                    concealed, lamelliform, and nearly if not entirely membranous.
                                    The maxillae terminate in a silky lobe, in the form of a pencil,
                                    without corneous teeth. The mentum is usually ovoid, truncated
                                    superiorly, or almost square, with the middle of the superior
                                    edge more or less concave or emarginate. The ligula is not
                                    projecting.</p>
                                <p>The alimentary tube of these insects, according to Μ. Dufour, is
                                    shorter than in any of the scarabideous family. The chylific
                                    ventricle has usually its external tunic covered by very small
                                    superficial papillae, or projecting points. The enlargement
                                    which terminates the small intestine is not cavernous, as in the
                                    Melolonthae.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                                <p>This section, according to the views of M. Latreille, by which we
                                    have already been so long guided, is susceptible of division
                                    into three pincipal groups, corresponding to the genera <hi
                                    rend="italic">Trichius</hi> of Fabricius, <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Goliathus</hi> of Lamarck, and <hi rend="italic">Cetonia</hi>
                                    of Fabricius, but reduced and simplified by certain
                                    abstractions.</p>
                                <p>The Melitoph ili of the first two divisions have no
                                    strongly-marked sternal projection; the lateral portion of the
                                    mesosternum (or that named <hi rend="italic">epimera</hi> by M.
                                    Audouin) does not generally manifest itself upwardly. The thorax
                                    does not increase from before backwards as in Cetonia; nor is
                                    the exterior side of the elytra abruptly narrowed or uni-sinuate
                                    a little below the humeral angle, as in those insects. A more
                                    rigorous character consists in the labial palpi being inserted
                                    in lateral grooves of the anterior face of the mentum, so that
                                    they are entirely exposed, the sides of the mentum jutting
                                    beyond them at their origin, and protecting them behind. In the
                                    first two divisions these palpi are inserted beneath the lateral
                                    margin of the mentum, or in the margins themselves, in such
                                    manner <pb break="no" facs="nls:193747351"

                                <p>In these the mentum is either almost isometrical, or rather
                                    longer than broad, and leaves the maxillae exposed. They
                                    correspond, as we have said, to the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                    >Trichius</hi> of Fabricius (Plate CCXXV. figs. 8 and 9), of
                                    which we may mention as an example <hi rend="italic">T.</hi><hi
                                    rend="italic">fasciatus,</hi> probably the only British species.
                                    It is black, with scattered yellow hairs, the elytra yellowish,
                                    with three transverse black bands, interrupted at the suture. It
                                    is very rare in Scotland, but is, however, recorded by Mr Curtis
                                    as occurring “on the flowers of the thyme, near Loch Rannoch, in
                                    July.” It was also noticed some years ago by Dr Greville in Glen
                                    Tilt, and we saw it taken by Mr Giles Mun-by, on the southern
                                    border of Sutherland, early in the month of August 1833. The
                                    dimensions of the female considerably exceed those of the male.
                                    The genus, as now restricted, is not very extensive. Dejean
                                    enumerates twelve species, several of which are from North
                                    America.</p>

                                <p>May be distinguished from the preceding by the mentum, which is
                                    much longer and wider, and covers the maxillae. In some the
                                    mentum is concave in the centre. The anterior extremity of the
                                    epistoma is neither toothed nor horned. Such is the genus <hi
                                    rend="smallcaps">Cremastocheilus</hi> of Knock (Plate CCXXV.
                                    fig. 10), in which the thorax forms nearly a transverse square;
                                    the maxillae are terminated by a strong tooth, hooked or
                                    falciform, with setae or little spines in place of an inner
                                    lobe; the last article of the palpi is very long and
                                    cylindrical; the mentum in the form of a widened heart, or of a
                                    reversed triangle rounded at the upper angles, without sensible
                                    emargination. In others the mentum is in the form of a greatly
                                    widened heart, but without a discoidal cavity, its superior edge
                                    being emarginate or sinuous. The anterior extremity of the
                                    epistoma in the males is divided into two lobes, in the form of
                                    obtuse or truncated horns. The thorax is almost orbicular. Such
                                    is the extraordinary genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Goliathus</hi>
                                    of Lamarck <hi rend="italic">(Cetonia</hi> of Fab. and Olivier),

                                    and most striking of coleopterous insects. One of the species
                                    which we have represented appears to exhibit some variation in

                                    point, between the intermediate pair of legs; the axillary piece
                                    before mentioned is always visible above, and occupies the
                                    entire space which separates the posterior angles of the thorax
                                    from the base of the elytra; the thorax is usually enlarged
                                    posteriorly, and has the form of a triangle truncated anteriorly
                                    or at its point. The mentum is never transversal; its superior
                                    margin is more or less emarginate in the middle. The terminal
                                    lobe of the maxillae is silky or pencil-shaped. The body is
                                    almost ovoid, and depressed. The membranaceous texture of the

                                <p>Sufficient data have not yet been collected for the proper
                                    elucidation of their geographical distribution, but it appears
                                    that many more species exist within than without the tropics. In
                                    some the thorax is prolonged posteriorly in an angular form, so
                                    that the scutellum disappears. These form the genus <hi

                            <p>The first general division of the section may be made to contain the
                                first three families. The elytra are generally of a firm and hard
                                consistence, the hooks of the tarsi almost always simple, the head
                                ovoid or oval, susceptible of being sunk posteriorly in the thorax,
                                or sometimes narrowed behind, but not abruptly, and without any neck
                                at the base. Many of these insects are “darklings,” that is,
                                lucifugous or light-shunning.</p>

                            <p>This group consists of black or ash-coloured species, without mixture
                                or variety of colour, from which circumstance they derive their

                                The antennae are partly or entirely granose, almost of the same size

                                the projecting margin of the head, with the third articulation
                                generally elongated. The mandibles are biful or emarginate at the
                                extremity, and there is a corneous tooth or hook on the inner side
                                of the maxillae· All the articulations of the tarsi are entire, and
                                the eyes are oblong and but slightly elevated—a character which,
                                according to Μ. Marcel de Serres, indicates nocturnal habits. Almost
                                all these insects dwell upon the ground, either in sandy soils or

                                or projecting points, and terminates in a small collar, callous
                                within, which receives the first insertion of the biliary vessels.

                                cylindrical, or in the form of an elongated and reversed cone, the

                                turbinated, or hemispherical. The eyes are almost round or oval,
                                entire, or but slightly emarginate, and elevated. The last article
                                of the antennae is sensibly longer and thicker than the preceding.

                            <p>This tribe receives its name from the genus <hi rend="italic"
                                >Ωlaps</hi> of Fabricius. The maxillary palpi are terminated by an

                                anatomical observations made by Μ. Dufour in relation to these
                                insects, he states that they are provided with a double
                                excrementitial secreting apparatus, totally different in structure
                                from that of the pentamerous tribes. It consists of two tolerably
                                large oblong bladders, placed altogether beneath the viscera of
                                digestion and generation, closely approximated to each other, with
                                extremely thin parietes, and surrounded by vascular folds, adherent,
                                more or less pursed or turgid, and of which it is difficult to
                                ascertain the precise point of insertion, from the impossibilitv of
                                unrolling them. The same may be said of the canals destined to the
                                emission of the secreted fluids. They are concealed by a kind of
                                membranous diaphragm, which is applied, by means of a fleshy
                                pannicle, to the last ventrical segment. The fluid flows out
                                laterally, and not from the extremity of the terminal segment: it is
                                of a brownish colour, extremely acrid and irritating, of a peculiar
                                and penetrating odour, and is capable of being thrown to a distance

                                hooks; the anterior tibiae are often broad and triangular. Several
                                males have the head furnished with horns. The greater proportion of
                                these Heteromera occur on tree fungi, or beneath the bark; some live
                                on the ground under stones. M. Dufour has observed an excrementitial
                                secreting apparatus in several genera, and salivary vessels are

                                (Plate JCXXVI. fig. 1), the maxillary palpi terminate in an article
                                scarcely thicker than the preceding, and nearly cylindrical; the

                                upon the elytra. It is a well-known British species, not yet

                            <p>These are analogous in form to the genus <hi rend="italic"
                                >Peltis</hi> of Fab. and to several Nitidulae and Cassidae. They are
                                ovoid or sub-hemispherical, and overlapped in their contour by the
                                dilated sides’ of the thorax and elytra. The head is in some
                                entirely concealed beneath the thorax,—in others it is received or
                                incased in its anterior emargination. The last joint of the
                                maxillary palpi is larger than the preceding ones, and
                                hatchet-shaped. This tribe corresponds to the unrestricted genus <hi

                            <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Cossyphus</hi> properly so called
                                (Plate CCXXVI. fig. 3), the thorax is almost semicircular, exhibits
                                no anterior emargination, and entirely covers and conceals the head.
                                The antennae are short, terminate abruptly in an oval mass of four
                                articles, chiefly transversal: the second of the whole number and
                                the following ones are almost identical. These insects inhabit the
                                East Indies, the south of Europe, and the north of Africa. In <hi
                                rend="smallcaps">He-laeus</hi> of Lat. and Kirby, the head is
                                received into a deep emargination, or median aperture of the thorax,
                                and is exposed at least superiorly. The antennae terminate gradually
                                in a narrow elongated club. These insects are peculiar to New
                                Holland. Some other species, proper to South America, of which the
                                body is almost hemispherical, very convex, and of a soft or slightly
                                solid consistence, form the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Nilio</hi> of

                            <p>This family of heteromerous Coleoptera differs from the preceding one
                                chiefly in the antennae, which are neither granose nor perfoliated.
                                In the greater number the extremity is not thickened. The body is
                                generally oblong, arcuated above, and the legs elongated, as in many
                                other insects. The males, except in their antennae and genera]
                                dimensions, resemble the females. Our present species generally are
                                of much more active habits than those we have just left. Many
                                conceal themselves beneath the bark of trees, while most of the
                                others are met with on flowers and foliage. Linnaeus referred most
                                of them to his genus <hi rend="italic">Tenebrio,</hi> and
                                distributed the remainder among the incongruous groups of <hi

                                Latreille combined them, under a single genus, that of <hi

                                has since induced him to partition them into five tribes, referable
                                to a corresponding number of the older genera, viz. <hi

                                of Fab. and <hi rend="italic">Oedemera</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                                >Myeterus</hi> of Olivier. In <hi rend="italic">Oedemera</hi> the
                                head is more or less narrowed, and prolonged anteriorly in the form
                                of a muzzle, and the penultimate article of the tarsi is always
                                bilobed,-a character which seems to connect these insects with the
                                weevils,orrhyncophorous Coleoptera. In respect to the digestive
                                canal and some other considerations, <hi rend="italic">Helops</hi>
                                and <hi rend="italic">Cistela</hi> approach the Tenebriones; but in
                                Cistela the chylific ventricle is smooth, and the mandibles entire,
                                and the species affecl flowers and leaves, a habit by which they are
                                distinguished from Helops. Most of the Dirceae possess the faculty
                                of leaping, and the penultimate article of the tarsi, or at least of
                                some of them, is biful. Some live in mushrooms, others in old wood.

                                other with Oedemera, and still more with that sub-genus of the same
                                tribe named <hi rend="italic">Nothus</hi> by Ziegler. These are the
                                principles by which Latreille has been recently directed in his
                                arrangement of the present family.</p>
                            <p>A certain number (including the first four tribes) have the antennae
                                approximate to the eyes, and the head not prolonged into a trunk,
                                but terminated at most by a short muzzle.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tribe 1st, Helopii.</hi></p>
                            <p>Antennae covered at their insertion by the margins of the head,
                                almost filiform, or a little larger towards the extremity, generally
                                composed of nearly cylindrical articles attenuated towards the base,
                                and of which the penultimate are frequently a little shorter, in the
                                form of a reversed cone,—the terminal being for the most part nearly
                                ovoid, and the third always lengthened. The extremity of the
                                mandibles is biful; the last joint of the maxillary palpi is of
                                larger size, and hatchet-shaped, or in the form of a reversed
                                triangle. The eyes are oblong, reniform, or emarginate. None of the
                                legs are adapted for leaping; the penultimate joint of the tarsi, or
                                at least of the hindmost ones, is almost always entire, or not
                                deeply bilobed; the terminal hooks are simple, or without fissure or
                                dentation. The body is for the most part arcuated above, and always
                                of a firm and solid consistence. Such of the larvae as are known are
                                filiform, smooth, shining, with very short feet, like those of the
                                Tenebriones. They occur in old wood. It is also beneath the bark of
                                ancient trees that we find the perfect insects. The tribe
                                corresponds in great part to the genus <hi rend="italic">Helops</hi>
                                of Fabricius.</p>
                            <p>Some have the body almost elliptical, strongly arcuated above, or
                                very convex, with the antennae at the utmost as long as the thorax,
                                compressed and dilated towards their extremity, like the teeth of a
                                saw; the thorax transversal, plane above, either trapezoidal and
                                widening posteriorly, or almost square; the elytra frequently
                                terminated by a point or tooth. The posterior extremity of the
                                praesternum forms a little salient point, which is received by a
                                forked notch of the mesosternum. Here are placed the genera <hi

                            <p>In all the other Helopii, the mesosternum exhibits no marked
                                emargination, and the posterior extremity of the praesternum is not
                                prolonged to a point. Here are placed the genera <hi

                                >Helops</hi> properly so called. In the last named, most of the
                                joints of the antennae are nearly in the form of a reversed cone, or
                                cylindrical and attenuated at the base. The thorax is transverse, or
                                scarcely as long as broad, either square, or trapezoidal, or
                                heart-shaped, abruptly narrowed posteriorly, terminated by pointed
                                angles, and always applied exactly to the base or the elytra. Here

                            <p>This is very closely allied to the preceding, but the insertion of
                                the antennae is not covered. The mandibles terminate in an entire
                                point, or are unemarginate. The hooks of the tarsi are dentated
                                beneath like the teeth of a comb. Several of these insects live on
                                flowers. Their digestive canal is shorter than that of the Helopii,
                                and( the chylific ventricle exhibits no papillae. They correspond to
                                the genus <hi rend="italic">Cistela</hi> of Fabricius.</p>
                            <p>In some all the articles of the tarsi are entire. The last joint of
                                the maxillary palpi is simply a little larger, obconical or
                                triangular. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Lystronichus,</hi> Lat., the
                                thorax is thick, narrower than the abdomen, almost orbicular or
                                heart-shaped. The antennae are thickened towards the extremity. The
                                thighs are clubbed. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Cistela</hi> properly so
                                called, the thorax is depressed, trapezoidal, of the breadth of the
                                abdomen at its posterior margin, or scarcely narrower. The antennae
                                are filiform, or slightly enlarged at the extremity, and the head is
                                advanced in the manner of a muzzle. In others, such as the genus <hi
                                rend="italic">Allecula,</hi> Fab., the penultimate article of the
                                tarsi is bilobed, and the last joint of the maxillary palpi much
                                dilated, in the form of a hatchet. The body is generally more
                                oblong.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tribe 3d, Serropalpides.</hi></p>
                            <p>The most remarkable distinction of this tribe, and that from which it
                                derives its name, is the frequent serration of the maxillary palpi,
                                which are likewise large and inclined. The antennae are inserted in
                                an emargination of the eyes, exposed as in the preceding tribe, and
                                often short and filiform. The mandibles are emarginate or biful at
                                the extremity, and the hooks of the tarsi are simple. The body is
                                almost cylindrical in some, oval in others, with the head inclined
                                and the thorax trapezoidal. The anterior extremity of the head is
                                not advanced, and the posterior thighs are not inflated. The
                                penultimate article of the tarsi, or at least of the four anterior,
                                is frequently bilobed; and in those in which it is entire the
                                posterior legs at least are adapted for leaping; they are thin,
                                long, compressed, the tarsi small, almost setaceous, with the first
                                article elongated. The anterior are always short and dilated. The
                                genus <hi rend="italic">Dirccea</hi> of Fabricius forms the type of
                                the tribe. It contains the genera <hi rend="smallcaps"

                            <p>This tribe is allied to the preceding by several characters, such as
                                the exposed insertion of the antennae near the eyes, the biful
                                extremity of the mandibles, the bilobation of the penultimate
                                article of the tarsi, and the hatchet shape of the terminal joint of
                                the maxillary palpi; but they exhibit other characters, which
                                authorize their separation. The body is elongated, narrow, almost
                                linear, with the head and thorax scarcely so broad as the abdomen;
                                the antennae are longer than those parts, serrated in some (such as
                                <hi rend="italic">Calopus),</hi> filiform or setaceous, and composed
                                of long and nearly cylindrical articles, in others. The anterior
                                extremity of the head is more or less prolonged in the form of a
                                small muzzle, and rather restricted behind, with the eyes
                                proportionally more elevated than among the preceding tribes. The
                                thorax is at least as long as wide, and a little narrowed behind.
                                The elytra are linear, or narrowed posteriorly, and are frequently
                                flexible. Latreille regards the species as allied to <hi

                                Μ. Dufour has recognised in the Oedemerites the existence of
                                salivary vessels, of a simple nature, flexuous and floating, as well
                                as of a paunch formed by a lateral crop, furnished with a neck or
                                pedicle.</p>

                            <p>i They are the only Coleoptera in which that character has been
                                observed. These insects, of which the transformations are unknown,
                                are found on flowers and trees. They are all comprised in the old
                                genus <hi rend="italic">Oedemera of</hi> Olivier.</p>
                            <p>In some the antennae are always short, inserted in a notch of the
                                eyes, and simple; the posterior thighs are inflated, at least in one
                                of the sexes; the thorax as broad as the base of the abdomen; and
                                the hooks of the tarsi biful. Such is the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Nothus</hi> of Ziegler, in which the maxillary palpi are terminated
                                by a large elongated hatchet-shaped article. The posterior legs in
                                one of the sexes are very large, and furnished beneath with a strong
                                tooth and two little spurs, near the lower extremity of the tibiae.
                                The head is not prolonged anteriorly.</p>
                            <p>In others the antennae are always longer than the head and thorax,
                                the legs usually of nearly equal size, the thorax narrower than the
                                base of the abdomen, slightly narrowed posteriorly, and the hooks of
                                the tarsi entire. Such are <hi rend="smallcaps">Calopus,</hi> Fab.

                                grouped certain insects, some of which are evidently allied to the
                                preceding, while others in a natural system might be regarded as
                                belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Phynco-phorì.</hi> The head is
                                obviously prolonged anteriorly in the form of an elongated muzzle,
                                or of a flattened trunk, bearing the antennae at its base, and in
                                advance of the eyes, which are always entire or without
                                emargination.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes the antennae are filiform, and the muzzle not enlarged at
                                the base; the thorax is narrowed in front in form of a truncated
                                cone or of a trapezium; the ligula is emarginate, and the terminal
                                joint of the tarsi bilobed. These insects occur on flowers, a
                                habitat indicated by the silky prolongation of the terminal lobe of
                                the maxillae. Such are the genera <hi rend="smallcaps"

                            <p>Sometimes the antennae are terminated by an elongated mass, formed by
                                from three to five terminal joints; the muzzle is very flat, with a
                                projecting angle on each side, anterior to the extremity; the thorax
                                is in the form of a truncated heart, narrowed posteriorly; the
                                ligula and all the joints of the tarsi are entire. These insects
                                dwell beneath the bark of trees, and seem allied to the <hi
                                rend="italic">Anthribi</hi> of Fabricius. They form the genus <hi

                                the club of the antennae consists of only three articles, fall under

                            <p>This tribe is distinguished from the preceding by the hooks of the
                                tarsi, which are deeply divided, and appear as if double. The head
                                is generally large, broader, and rounded posteriorly. The thorax is
                                usually narrowed behind, and approaches the form of a truncated
                                heart; in some it is almost orbicular. The elytra are often somewhat
                                inclined laterally, or tectiform, and rounded. These insects
                                counterfeit death when seized, and several of them exude a yellow
                                caustic liquor, of a penetrating odour, from the joints of their
                                antennae; but no peculiar apparatus for the production of that
                                secretion has yet been ascertained. Many kinds are highly
                                serviceable in the formation of blistering applications. They were
                                all included originally in the old genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Meloe</hi> of Linnaeus, now greatly subdivided. The anatomical
                                observations of Μ. Dufour, and the extremely interesting researches
                                of Μ. Bretonneau of Tours, on the vesicatorial properties of this
                                tribe of insects, have enabled Latreille to arrange them in what he
                                regards as a natural order,—not greatly differing, however, from
                                that which he had previously adopted. Μ. Bretonneau has ascertained
                                that the genus <hi rend="italic">Sitaris</hi> is not
                                vesicatorial,—and Μ. Dufour has found that these same Heteroinera
                                possess only four biliary vessels instead of six, the amount by
                                which other insects of the tribe are characterized. That genus also

                            <p>In some the antennae, always regular and granose in both sexes,
                                sometimes appear to be composed of only from nine to ten joints, and
                                are not longer than half the body; they occasionally terminate in an
                                arcuated club, or are obviously enlarged at the extremity; while in
                                others they form from the second joint a short cylindrical or almost
                                fusiform stem. They constitute the genus <hi rend="italic"
                                >Mylabris</hi> of Fabricius. Such of them as have the two or three

                                forming an abrupt, thick, ovoid, or button-shaped club, the

                                the total joints are only from nine to ten, form the genus <hi

                                terminating by degrees in an elongated club, of which the terminal
                                joint, very distinguishable from the preceding, is large and ovoid,
                                belong to the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Mylabris</hi> properly so
                                called (Plate CCXXVI. fig. 11). The species we have here represented
                                is the J∕. <hi rend="italic">chicoii.</hi> It is more than half an
                                inch long, black, pilose, with an almost round yellowish spot on the
                                base of each elytron, and two transverse and indented bands of the
                                same colour, one near the centre, and the other nearer the
                                extremity. The antennae are black. This insect, unknown in Britain,
                                is occasionally found as far north as the vicinity of Paris, but it
                                is much more common in the south of France, and other meridional
                                parts of Europe. Its blistering qualities are quite as active and
                                efficient as those of the true <hi rend="italic">Cantharis</hi> or
                                Spanish fly; and in Italy it is employed for the same purposes,
                                mixed up with the latter, or even used alone. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">pustulatus</hi> is used by the
                                Chinese.</p>
                            <p>In the other Heteromera of this tribe the antennae, always composed
                                of eleven very distinct joints, are almost of equal thickness
                                throughout, or rather more slender towards the extremity, and
                                frequently much longer than the head and thorax. They are irregular
                                in several males. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Meloe</hi> properly so
                                called (Plate CCXXVI. fig. 12), the antennae are composed of short
                                and rounded joints, the intermediate of which are the largest, and
                                sometimes so disposed that these parts in the males exhibit an
                                emargination or crescent-like form. The wings are wanting, and the
                                elytra, oval or triangular, with a portion of the inner margins
                                crossing each other, only partially cover the abdomen, especially
                                that of the females, which, as often happens, is extremely
                                voluminous. According to Dufour, the crop of these insects may be
                                considered as a true gizzard, being furnished internally with
                                callous and anastomosing plicae, and separated from the stomach or
                                chylific ventricle by a valve formed of four principal pieces, each
                                of which results from two hollow cylinders placed back to back, and
                                tridentated posteriorly.</p>
                            <p>All the species of the genus Meloe are awkward and mis-shapen, and of
                                sluggish movements. They are found either crawling slowly and
                                heavily along the surface of the earth, or on plants of humble
                                growth. They feed on leaves, and when handled, an oily fluid of a
                                yellow or reddish colour flows from the joints of their legs.
                                Latreille suspects that these insects are the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Euprestides</hi> of the ancients, to which were attributed such
                                destructive effects on cattle, when inadvertently swallowed by the
                                latter. The genus seems characteristic of the European continent and
                                islands. Eight or nine species occur in Britain; and of the
                                twenty-one species enumerated by Dejean, the whole are European. Mr
                                Kirby however possesses a specimen taken in North America by
                                Professor Peck. They are all characterized by dark or sombre
                                colours. They are most frequent in spring and autumn, and occur in
                                fields and pathways, preferring, it is said, a sunny situation and a
                                sandy soil. In some districts of Spain they are employed along with
                                Cantharides, or in their room. They are also used by farriers.<note

                                these insects we may further observe, that Dr Leach was informed by
                                Mr Hunneman that the species called <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi
                                rend="italic">variegatus</hi> is highly prized in Germany as a
                                medicine, being considered as a specific in hydrophobia. For this
                                purpose it is taken by slipping a hair round its neck, and
                                suspending it till dry; the oily secretion first thrown out being
                                preserved, as in that the chief virtue is supposed to exist. Mr
                                Hunneman adds more particularly, that the late king of Prussia,
                                Frederick the Great, purchased the nostrum from the discoverer for a
                                valuable consideration, as a specific against the bite of a mad dog.
                                According to the recipe, twenty-five of these insects that have been
                                preserved in honey, are, with two drachms of powdered black ebony,
                                one drachm of Virginia snake-root, one ditto of lead filings, and
                                twenty grains of fungus sorbi, to be reduced to a very fine
                                substance; the whole, with two ounces of theriaca of Venice (and,
                                <hi rend="italic">if necessary,</hi> a little elder root), to be
                                formed into an electuary ! (See <hi rend="italic">Linn. Trans,</hi>
                                xi. p. 245.)</p></note> The females, when filled with eggs, become
                                greatly dilated, and in that condition much exceed the males in
                                size. An individual of the former sex observed by Goëdart, and fed
                                by him with the leaves of anemone and ranunculus, laid 2212 eggs
                                between the 12th of May and the 12th of June, besides about as many
                                more which were thrown aside uncounted. It effected this laying at
                                two separate periods, placing the extremity of its abdomen in a hole
                                which it had formed in the earth, and depositing the eggs in
                                packets. These are of a yellowish colour, and resemble grains of
                                sand pressed together. The larvae are long, cylindrical, garnished
                                with scattered hairs, composed of eleven nearly equal segments,
                                besides the head, which is oval, and provided with two eyes, and a
                                pair of longish antennae. They have six legs, of rather large size
                                compared with the length of the body, which is terminated by two
                                long bristle-like appendices. Their larvae are supposed by some
                                ingenious observers to be parasitical on the bodies of winged
                                insects. Degeer having remarked that a strong resemblance existed
                                between the larvae of Meloe, and a small insect which he found
                                adhering to <hi rend="italic">Eristalis intrica-rius,</hi> he placed
                                two domestic flies among the former, and found that they were
                                speedily adhered to by the larvae, which stuck to them
                                pertinaceously, and caused their death in two or three days. Bees
                                are also subject to their attacks; and MM. Lepelletier and Serville
                                are said to have recently confirmed the observations of Degeer, by
                                breeding these parasites from the eggs of Meloe. “On the other
                                hand,” says Mr Curtis, “Mr Kirby is disposed to think that his <hi

                                Geoff. (Plate CCXXV1. fig. 14), all the joints of the tarsi are
                                entire, the thorax almost ovoid, a little elongated, and restricted
                                anteriorly, truncated posteriorly. The second joint of the antennae
                                is much shorter than the following, and the last of the maxillary
                                palpi is sensibly larger than the preceding. The head is a little

                                extremely ancient, and has been received in a variety of
                                acceptations. Aristotle did not apply it to any particular insect,

                                >Cicindela,</hi> already otherwise employed, for that of Cantharis,
                                and placed in the latter the genuine Spanish fly. Fabricius placed
                                it in his genus <hi rend="italic">Lytta,</hi> which corresponds to
                                Cantharis of Geoffroy. The latter, however, amidst all these
                                revolutions of names, appears to have maintained its ground, and to
                                have been the most generally adopted.</p>
                            <p>The Cantharides properly so called have an elongated and almost
                                cylindrical form. The history of the most noted species, <hi
                                rend="italic">C. veswatoria,</hi> commonly called the Spanish fly
                                (fig. 14), is still somewhat doubtful, so far as concerns our
                                knowledge of its transformations. Neither De-gecr nor Geoffroy ever
                                saw the larva. Those who suppose themselves to have seen it say that
                                it feeds on various roots, and is metamorphosed in the earth,—an
                                observation which accords with the usually sudden appearance of the
                                perfect insect, the unexpected apparition of which has sometimes
                                given rise to the belief that they migrated from more southern
                                regions. It is described by Olivier as consisting, in its early
                                state, of thirteen segments, soft, of a yellowish-white, with six
                                short sealyfeet,—the head rounded andflattish, and furnished with
                                two short filiform antennae. The mouth consists of a pair of
                                tolerably solid maxillae and four palpi. The medicinal uses of this
                                now celebrated beetle are universally known, but its connection with
                                the sanitory art is not traceable to a remote antiquity; for the
                                Cantharis of the ancients was certainly not the same as the Spanish
                                fly, and is even supposed to have belonged to a different genus.
                                According to the testimony of Pliny and Dioscorides, who affirm that
                                the best Cantharides arc such as are marked with transverse yellow
                                bands, it becomes evident that their species was the <hi

                                antennae. 1he males are less than the females, and there exists in
                                general a great variety of size among different individuals. Diese

                                greater proportion employed in commerce come from the last-named
                                country, and hence their common name, lheir collection requires
                                precaution on the part of those who are employed in that office,
                                both with a view to guard against injurious accidents, and for the
                                proper preservation of the objects themselves. They are killed by
                                means of vapour of vinegar, and completely dried after they are
                                dead. The following is the plan of procedure . In the course of the
                                month of June the natives place extended cloths or sheets beneath
                                the trees on <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi>.which the Cantharides
                                occur, and make them tumble' down by beating all the branches. When
                                they have obtained a considerable quantity, they either put them
                                into a hair sieve, which they place over the vapour of vinegar, or
                                into a fine cloth, which they dip repeatedly in a vessel containing
                                diluted vinegar. They are then allowed to dry under the shade of
                                some loft or granary, being placed on hurdles covered with cloth or
                                paper, and stirred occasionally with a stick, or with the hand
                                protected by a stout glove. When thoroughly dry they are packed into
                                vessels of wood or glass, which are afterwards carefully and tightly
                                closed. These little processes being properly attended to, the
                                insects retain their blistering qualities for a length of time.</p>
                            <p>The chemical analysis of Cantharides has been made by numerous
                                experimentalists, who appear, however, to have confined their
                                researches rather too exclusively to the Spanish fly. Had they
                                studied with equal assiduity the genera <hi rend="italic">Meloe</hi>
                                and <hi rend="italic">Mylabris,</hi> and even <hi rend="italic"
                                >Cardbus, Coc-cinclla,</hi> and several <hi rend="italic"
                                >Tenebriones,</hi> they would have discovered in these also an
                                analogous or identical principle, less active perhaps in its nature,
                                but for that very reason susceptible of being employed with greater
                                advantage in special cases. Thouvenet, Fourcroy, Beaupoil, Orfila,
                                and especially Robiquet, have arrived at some remarkable results.
                                The latter has demonstrated the existence of a particular substance,
                                on which he has bestowed the name of <hi rend="italic"
                                >Cantharadine,</hi> and which may be characterized as white,
                                crystalline, insoluble in water, soluble in boiling alcohol, in
                                ether, and in oils. It is the seat of the vesicatorial or blistering
                                property, which does not therefore reside in the green oil, nor in
                                the black insoluble matter, nor in the yellow matter soluble in
                                alcohol and in water,—the other ingredients of which analysis has
                                demonstrated the presence. This discovery, though important in a
                                scientific point of view, has produced no alteration in the
                                practice, which proceeds effectually enough upon the old experience,
                                that when the substance of the insect is reduced to powder, mixed up
                                with some fatty matter, and applied to the surface of the body, it
                                immediately proceeds to action, and detaches the outer skin from the
                                dermis with great rapidity. It is also used for several other
                                purposes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"/>
                                Naturalists are acquainted with many other species of Cantharis
                                besides the Spanish fly. Of these we may mention <hi rend="italic"

                                <p>This numerous and widely extended family, so remarkable for the
                                    beauty of its South American species, is easily recognised by
                                    its more or less extended muzzle, terminated by a mouth, of
                                    which the parts, from their peculiar structure and position, are
                                    not easily determined without the aid of microscopical
                                    examination and dissection. The abdomen is generally of a bulky
                                    form, the antennae geniculate and clavate, and the penultimate
                                    joint of the tarsi almost always bilobate. In many tribes the
                                    posterior thighs are dentated. The body of the larvae is oblong,
                                    and resembles a small white worm, exceedingly soft. The head is
                                    squamous or scaly, and the feet are either wanting or
                                    mammillaeform. They live by gnawing the various parts of plants.
                                    Many dwell exclusively in the interior of fruits and seeds, and
                                    do great damage to the farmer, grain-dealer, and horticulturist.
                                    Some, such as the Brachyceri, are supposed to live beneath the
                                    ground, and to feed on roots.</p>
                                <p>The muzzle in this richly adorned family differs essentially from
                                    the <hi rend="italic">rostrum of</hi> the hemipterous species.
                                    It is in fact merely a prolongation of the head, and not
                                    composed of the parts of the mouth, as in the last-named order.
                                    This prolongation, however, exerts an influence over the
                                    alimentary tube, the oesophagus being thereby somewhat
                                    prolonged, and—as we find to be the case in the truly suctorial
                                    tribes—there is also a provision of salivary glands.</p>
                                <p>We have little detailed information regarding the internal
                                    structure of the Curculionidae. Two species <hi rend="italic"

                                    moderately long, the stomach partially shaggy, and the small
                                    intestine inversely claviform. In other respects, however, they
                                    differed materially. There was no crop or gizzard in the former,
                                    the stomach was fringed on each side, except at its upper
                                    extremity, with a series of small caeca or shags, and there were
                                    three pair of bile-vessels; in the latter the gullet was dilated
                                    into a crop, which included a gizzard of singular and exquisite
                                    construction; for, though so minute as scarcely to exceed a
                                    large pin’s head in size, it was found to be provided internally
                                    with more than four hundred pairs of teeth, moved by an
                                    infinitely greater number of muscles. A transverse section of
                                    this gizzard represented two concentric stars, with nine rays
                                    each, the object of this structure being the comminution of the
                                    timber which the insect has to perforate, and probably devour.
                                    The stomach was very slender, but dilated in the middle into a
                                    spherical vesicle; and only two pairs of bile vessels were
                                    observable.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                                <p>It may well be supposed, that in a family consisting of not much
                                    less than three thousand ascertained species, many diversities
                                    occur both in habit and external structure. The antennae are
                                    sometimes straight, but more frequently have an angular bend.
                                    They are inserted either towards the extremity of the muzzle
                                    when that organ is short, or nearer the centre, or even towards
                                    the base, in the long snouted species. The number of the
                                    articulations of the antennae varies in certain genera from six
                                    to ten; but eleven is the more usual number, or even twelve, if
                                    we count the false or terminal article. The body is generally
                                    narrowest in front, with a large abdomen covered by very hard
                                    elytra. The tarsi are very frequently garnished beneath with
                                    short hairs. None of the species are carnivorous in any degree;
                                    but even in the perfect state they are sometimes extremely
                                    noxious, when they happen, as they sometimes do, to occur in
                                    great abundance. They tap the buds and leaves of trees, and of
                                    several cultivated vegetables, and feed upon their juices.</p>

                                    occasion infinite damage. The perfect insect detaches a portion
                                    of the epidermis in the form of a cap, and, on issuing, produces

                                    females roll up these leaves into a tube or trumpet, in which
                                    they deposit their eggs,—thus forming a proper nidus for their

                                    means of a rotule. The muzzle is short, thick, enlarged at the
                                    end, a character common to the Attelabi properly so called; but
                                    in them, as well as in the other two genera, the head enters

                                    species of ant. They are numerous in South America, and occur
                                    there also beneath the bark of trees. The genus <hi

                                    only nine joints, the last of which forms the club. These
                                    insects are destitute of wings, and their body is very scabrous
                                    or uneven. They are characteristic of Southern Europe and of

                                    early in the spring. The women of Ethiopia use one species as a

                                    This splendid and extremely numerous genus, although greatly
                                    restricted by Fabricius, compared with its vast extent in the
                                    system of Linnaeus, has been still more circumscribed by authors
                                    of the present day. An enormous accession of species having been
                                    discovered and described, these have been arranged by Germar,
                                    Schoenherr, Megerle, Dejean, and others, into a corresponding
                                    variety of generic groups, partly for the sake of convenience,
                                    and partly (though not entirely) because the nature of the
                                    subjects required such systematic modifications. Latreille’s
                                    observations have led him to form these Curculiones into two
                                    principal divisions.</p>
                                <p>Isŕ, Those in which the mentum, more or less widened superiorly,
                                    and more or less orbicular, occupies the entire breadth of the
                                    cavity of the mouth, and wholly or nearly conceals the
                                    maxillae,—and in which the mandibles have no very sensible
                                    dentations, or merely exhibit a slight sinus underneath the
                                    point. The generic groups are as follows. In <hi
                                    rend="smallcaps">Cyclomus</hi> the tarsi (as in genus <hi
                                    rend="italic">Brachycerus)</hi> are unprovided with brushes, and
                                    the penultimate articulation is entire, or very slightly
                                    notched, without distinct lobes. In this genus Latreille would
                                    comprise those named <hi rend="italic">Crytops, Deracanthus,
                                    Amycterus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cyclomus</hi> of
                                    Schoenherr. The tarsi of all the others are furnished with
                                    brushes beneath, and the penultimate joint is deeply bilobate.
                                    Some are apterous. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Curculio</hi>
                                    properly so called (Plate CCXXVI. fig. 18), the lateral sulci of
                                    the proboscis are oblique and directed inferiorly. The anterior
                                    legs differ little in their proportions from the following ones.
                                    The genus, even thus restricted, comprises an immense number of
                                    groups, raised by Germar and Schoenherr to the rank of genera,
                                    “dont les caractères,” says Latreille, “sont peu importants et

                                    joint forming a greatly elongated and almost cylindrical club.
                                    The anterior legs are longer than the others, at least in the
                                    males. Of this genus we may mention as an example a well-known
                                    and singular-looking insect, found in Cayenne and Brazil, called
                                    <hi rend="italic">R. barbiros∙ tris,</hi> on account of a thick
                                    yellowish-brown beard which envelopes the proboscis of the male,
                                    and gives it somewhat the appearance of a bottle-brush. The
                                    female wants this kind of garniture on her snout, and she was
                                    consequently mistaken by Illiger for a separate species, and
                                    named <hi rend="italic">R. verrvrostris.</hi> In the genus <hi

                                    in Scotland, and probably in most other northern countries. But
                                    in France and other continental territories it is extremely
                                    injurious. This little creature measures about a couple of lines
                                    in length, and is generally of a pitchy red, smooth, the thorax
                                    deeply punctured. The elytra are rather narrower than the base
                                    of the thorax, and do not cover the extremity of the abdomen.
                                    They are marked with deep striae, punctured in the bottom. The
                                    legs are ferruginous. It is not in the perfect state that this
                                    destroyer commits its ravages. The season for the deposition of
                                    the eggs, and the periods of transformation, vary to a certain
                                    extent with the temperature of particular seasons; but generally
                                    in the south of France, as we are informed by M. Audouin, the
                                    female commences her maternal labours about the month of April,
                                    and continues them till the autumn. She first buries herself in
                                    a heap of grain, to the depth of some inches, and then commences
                                    to pierce their envelope, probably by means of a little dart
                                    concealed beneath the lower portion of the proboscis. The
                                    envelope is then raised, and a small hole bored, either in an
                                    oblique direction, or parallel with the surface of the grain. A
                                    single hole is made in each grain, and a single egg is laid in
                                    each hole, after which the opening is closed by a glutinous
                                    matter, so nearly resembling the colour of the grain, that it is
                                    extremely difficult to discover which is in a sound state, or
                                    which contains the germ of an insidious foe. The injured grains
                                    may, however, be detected by their floating when immersed in
                                    water, as well as by their feeling lighter when fingered by a
                                    practised hand. The egg thus laid is soon hatched, and gives
                                    birth to a very minute, white, soft, elongated worm, composed of
                                    nine segments, with a rounded corneous head, furnished with two

                                    for eight or ten days, and is transformed into a perfect insect,
                                    which, piercing the envelope of the grain, ere long produces in
                                    its turn a numerous progeny. The influence of temperature, so
                                    general on insect life, is effective on this noted <hi

                                    from forty to forty-five days may be stated as an average term
                                    between the union of the sexes and the reproduction of the
                                    perfect insect. When the old and unphilosophical belief
                                    prevailed of the spontaneous generation of the lower tribes of
                                    animal life, it was thought sufficient to say that these weevils
                                    were “engendered in the grain by humidity.” At an after period
                                    it was thought by some who called themselves “observers”—(men of
                                    the same class with those who settle all natural phenomena by a
                                    paragraph in a newspaper, which they sign “Scrutator ),—that the
                                    perfect insect laid her eggs in the green ear, from whence, when
                                    the fields were ripe for harvest, they were transported to the
                                    stores of the granary. The accurate and inimitable Lecuwenhoeck
                                    <hi rend="italic">{Continuatio Epistolarum,</hi> p. 56)
                                    dispelled these errors, and taught us the tiuth of nature, of
                                    which he was ever so great an interpreter. As each larva
                                    consumes only a single grain, we may form some idea of their
                                    power of increase, from the vast quantity sometimes destroyed.
                                    According to the calculation of Degeer, a single pair will
                                    produce (among themselves and their descendants), in the course
                                    of a season, <hi rend="italic">twenty three thousand six
                                    hundred</hi> individuals; so that, we may add, a few hundred
                                    weevils flying through the grating of a granary, and settling
                                    among its treasured heaps, might in the course of four or five
                                    months devour or destroy between <hi rend="italic">one and two
                                    hundred millions</hi> of grains. Various modes have been
                                    suggested by economists and men of science to stay the progress
                                    of these destroyers. We are not sure that any of them have been
                                    found Very efficacious. The most approved is the following: When
                                    the principal body of grain is suspected, let a small heap be
                                    placed apart in a corner, and the rest repeatedly stirred about
                                    and disturbed. The weevils, which love repose and a quiet life,
                                    will leave their usual domicils, and seek about for more
                                    peaceful dwellings. An instinct, which the foresight of man in
                                    this instance renders unavailing, induces them to settle on the
                                    smaller heap, and the shoveling of the main body being continued
                                    for some days, a vast number may be thus got quit of. Boiling
                                    water is then thrown upon the congregated insects, which have
                                    sought refuge in what they deemed a place of safety. As this
                                    process destroys only the perfect insects, and not the eggs or
                                    larva, neither of which care about being stirred up with any
                                    pole, however long, it must be employed during the earliest
                                    heats of spring, and before the laying of the eggs. It is said
                                    to succeed best when (whatever the principal store consists of)
                                    the decoy heap is formed of barley, which, it seems, is a
                                    favourite food of weevils. Reduction of temperature by
                                    ventilation has also been recommended, as tending to diminish
                                    their productive powers; and Μ. Clement thinks that dryness
                                    produced by lime may prove useful, by its tendency to destroy
                                    the eggs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                                    far as relates to the internal structure, the tarsi, and the
                                    habits; but the antennae are of equal thickness throughout, or
                                    more slender towards their termination. The mandibles are always
                                    projecting; the ligula is biful or emarginate; the palpi are
                                    short, and the body depressed and lengthened, with the thorax
                                    nearly square. These insects are found beneath the bark of

                                    with a little swelling or nodule resembling an articulation at

                                    ><p>Latreille remarks, that in regard to the above character,

                                    Longicones; and that hence, it we consider the little nodule as
                                    a genuine joint, both our present family and that which follows
                                    might be regarded as pertaining o ıe great pentamerous
                                    section.</p></note> The ligula, borne upon a short and
                                    transverse mentum, is generally membranous, heart-shaped,
                                    emarginate or biful,— in others corneous, and forming the
                                    segment of a very short and transverse circle. The antennae are
                                    filiform or setaceous, generally at least as long as the body,
                                    sometimes simple in both sexes, sometimes serrated, pectinated
                                    or flabelliform, in the males. The eyes of a great number are
                                    reniform, and surround the antennae at their base. The thorax is
                                    in the form of a trapezium, narrowed anteriorly in such as have
                                    the eyes rounded, entire, or slightly emarginate; in which case
                                    also the legs are long and slender, and the tarsi lengthened. M.
                                    Leon Dufour has remarked that the Longicones, in regard both to
                                    the alimentary tube and the disposition of the hepatic vessels,
                                    generally resemble the Melasoma, and, contrary to the opinion of
                                    M. Marcel de Serres, he denies the existence of a gizzard. The
                                    alimentary canal, usually beset with papillae, is preceded by a
                                    crop, which is smaller and less distinctly marked in Lamia and
                                    Leptura, the concluding genera.</p>
                                <p>1he larvae of almost all the Longicones live in the interior or
                                    beneath the bark of trees. They are either apodal, or provided
                                    with very inconspicuous legs. Their body is soft, whitish,
                                    largest anteriorly, with a squamous head, <hi rend="superscript"
                                    > 1</hi> furnished with strong mandibles, but without any other
                                    projecting parts. They are extremely destructive to the larger
                                    forest trees, piercing them to a considerable depth in all
                                    directions. A certain number gnaw the roots of plants, ſhe
                                    abdomen of the female, in the perfect state, is terminated by a
                                    tubular and corneous oviduct. Several species produce a sharpish
                                    sound by rubbing a portion of the thorax against the pedicle
                                    which attaches the base of the abdomen. Lister calls this sound
                                    <hi rend="italic">querulous,</hi> while Dumeril compares it to
                                    the braying of an ass. It is on account of this peculiarity that
                                    <hi rend="italic">Prionus</hi><hi rend="italic">coriarius</hi>
                                    is known in Germany by the name of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Fiddler. Of</hi> this numerous and graceful family some are
                                    nocturnal, and frequent old woods and the trunks of ancient
                                    trees; others occur on flowers and among flowering shrubs and
                                    hedges, and are richly gilded and adorned with various colours
                                    ;— while all are remarkable for their elongated bodies, their
                                    lengthened limbs, and their long and delicately formed antennae.
                                    Several of the species are among the very largest of the
                                    coleopterous tribes. The deficiency of wood in our northern
                                    quarter of the island is a circumstance unfavourable to the
                                    frequent occurrence among us of these lovers of “forest
                                    scenery.” Even of the English species commonly so called, a few
                                    of the finest are probably not original inhabitants of Britain,
                                    but have rather been accidentally imported in the larva state in
                                    foreign timber, and have afterwards, when excluded in the
                                    perfect form, contrived to wing their way, and colonize among
                                    our native woods. Their characteristic position is in countries
                                    adjoining the equator (especially in South America), and they
                                    seem to diminish both in size and number in proportion to their
                                    distance from the torrid zone. Britain in general, and more
                                    especially Scotland, are considerably to the north of the limit
                                    where these insects cease to be common; and in other respects
                                    our island presents few local peculiarities at all adapted to
                                    their increase. Yet the indefatigable Mr Stephens enumerates
                                    about one hundred indigenous species of Longicones, including,
                                    however, certain genera, such as <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Trogosita</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cucujus,</hi> which
                                    Latreille and others do not admit among the long-horned
                                    tribes.</p>
                                <p>According to the system by which we are at present guided, the
                                    Longicones are divisible in the first place into two
                                    sections.</p>

                                <p>In some the articulation of the palpi is in certain cases nearly
                                    in the form of a cone, or reversed triangle; in others nearly
                                    cylindrical, and truncated at the extremity. The terminal lobe
                                    of the maxillae is straight (not curved upon the inner one at
                                    its extremity); the head generally projected or simply inclined,
                                    and when, by a rare exception (as in <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Dorcacerus),</hi> its position is vertical, its breadth then
                                    nearly equals that of the body, and the antennae are distant at
                                    their base, and spiny. The thorax, often unequal or square, is
                                    rarely cylindrical. They are subdivisible into two lesser tribes
                                    as follows :</p>

                                    mandibles, or of the emargination of the eyes, but are not
                                    surrounded by them at their origin. The thorax is most
                                    frequently trapezoidal or square, and notched or dentated on the
                                    sides.</p>
                                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Pλrandra</hi> of Lat. the
                                    antennae are simple, almost granose, compressed, of the same
                                    size throughout, and at most as long as the thorax; and the
                                    ligula is corneous, in the form of a short segment of a circle,
                                    transverse, and without emargination. The body is depressed, and
                                    parallelepiped, with the thorax square, rounded at the posterior
                                    angles, and without any teeth or spines. These tribes are
                                    peculiar to America. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Spondylis,</hi>
                                    Fab. <hi rend="italic">(Attelabus,</hi> Linn.) the antennae and
                                    maxillary lobes resemble those of the preceding; but the ligula,
                                    as in all the ensuing Longicones, is membranous. The thorax is
                                    almost globular, without margins, and unarmed with teeth or
                                    spines. The species, which are few in number, inhabit Europe,
                                    and their larvae occur in trees of the pine tribe. In the genus

                                    thorax,—serrated or pectinated in some, —simple, attenuated
                                    towards the extremity, and with elongated articulations, in
                                    others. The terminal lobe of the maxillae is at least as long as
                                    the first two articulations of the palpi. The body is generally
                                    depressed, with the body square or trapezoidal, and either
                                    toothed or spiny, or presenting a lateral projecting angle.
                                    These insects are said to take wing only during the night or
                                    evening. When reposing they occur on trees. Some exotic species
                                    are remarkable for their great size, and their projecting
                                    mandibles. “C’est dans ce genre,” observes M∙ Guerin, “qui sont

                                    nearly equals half the length of the abdomen. The anterior legs
                                    at least are distant at their base. The scutellum is large in

                                    remains obscure. Latreille places in this niche of the
                                    entomological system various Callichromae (so called) of Dejean,
                                    with a smooth or but slightly unequal thorax. Most of them
                                    belong to South America. They are in general beautifully
                                    ornamented by the hand of nature, though their size is small.
                                    Some are singularly distinguished by one or more little globular
                                    tufts of hair upon the antennae, and even the hind legs of
                                    certain species are similarly adorned. The thighs of these
                                    insects (some of which were arranged by Fabricius and Olivier

                                    mass, supported upon a more lengthened pedicle. The antennae
                                    consist of long and slender articulations. In the genus <hi

                                <p>Latreille concludes our present tribe of insects with certain
                                    species, which, in regard to the palpi, the form of the head,
                                    thorax, and elytra, and their general proportions, offer some
                                    remarkable and anomalous characters. He commences with such as
                                    present a thorax analogous to that of the preceding, especially
                                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Certallum.</hi> It is as broad as
                                    the head, and as the base of the elytra, or scarcely narrower,
                                    and is either almost cylindrical, or rounded, or nearly
                                    orbicular; in both cases wider near the middle. The terminal
                                    articulation of the palpi is sometimes attenuated near the end,
                                    and terminated in a point, sometimes thicker and truncated, and
                                    obconical. All the thighs are clubbed, and supported by an

                                    not exhibit those peculiar forms; but in Necydalis, Linn, those

                                    contracted a little beyond their origin, then greatly narrowed,

                                <p>Certain insects, for the most part proper to the African islands,
                                    to New Holland, New Ireland, and New Zealand, present some
                                    ambiguous characters; and, according to Latreille, ought
                                    perhaps, in a natural order, to be placed between the Lamiariae
                                    and the Lepturetae. In the mean time, however, he concludes with
                                    them the tribe Cerambycini. The palpi are almost filiform, with
                                    the terminal articulation nearly cylindrical, slightly
                                    attenuated towards the base. The thorax is usually smooth, or
                                    but slightly uneven, without acute tubercles, is widened
                                    posteriorly, or presents the form of a trapezium or of a
                                    truncated cone. The abdomen is almost in the form of a reversed
                                    triangle in the greater number, and the elytra are truncated at
                                    the extremity. They form four genera, viz. <hi rend="smallcaps"

                                    ovoid, and tapering to a point. The exterior lobe of the
                                    maxillae is a little narrowed at the extremity, and curved upon
                                    the inner division. The antennae are most frequently setaceous
                                    and simple, and the thorax, exclusive of the lateral tubercles
                                    or spines, is nearly of an equal width throughout. Some species
                                    are apterous,—a character not exhibited by any other division of

                                    likewise took it in a forest of that northern county. Specimens
                                    from the neighbourhood of Kirkaldy are preserved in the
                                    collection of Sir Patrick Walker. The species is remarkable for

                                    to calcareous soils.</p>
                                <p>Other Lamiariae have the thorax cylindrical, and unfurnished with
                                    tubercles or spines. The body is always elongated,—in some
                                    almost linear. They compose the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                    >Saperda</hi> of Fab., which has been greatly subdivided. We
                                    have several British species, of which we shall here name only
                                    <hi rend="italic">S. carcharias,</hi> an insect about an inch in
                                    length, covered with a yellowish ashy down, spotted with black,
                                    and the antennae coloured alternately with black and grey. Its
                                    larva lives in the trunk of the poplar, and sometimes proves
                                    injurious to plantations of that tree.</p>

                                <p>The eyes are rounded, entire, or scarcely emarginate, and the
                                    antennae are then inserted forwards, or at most at the anterior
                                    extremity of that feeble emargination. The head is always
                                    inclined, prolonged posteriorly behind the eyes in several, or
                                    abruptly narrowed into a neck-like form at its junction with the
                                    thorax. This last part is conical or trapezoidal, and narrowed
                                    anteriorly. The elytra become gradually narrower from the base.
                                    This tribe corresponds to the genus <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Leptura</hi> of Linnaeus, with the exception of a few species
                                    which fall more naturally among the preceding tribes, and also
                                    of such as belong to the more modern genus <hi rend="italic"

                                    three indigenous species) (Plate CCXXVII. fig. 6), the antennae
                                    are simple, and at most not more than half the length of the
                                    body. The terminal articulation of the palpi forms a triangular
                                    club. The head is large, almost square, with the eyes entire.
                                    The sides of the thorax are furnished with a conical or spinous

                                    distant at their base. The two usual eminences from which they
                                    spring are almost confounded in one plane. The thorax is almost
                                    always smooth, or without lateral tubercles. The majority of the
                                    genus occur in Europe, and Britain produces about a score. Few
                                    of them have yet occurred in Scotland, probably owing to our
                                    comparative deficiency in wood. We have met with only one

                                <p>FAMILY V—EUPODΛ.</p>
                                <p>Some of the component parts of this family are nearl; allied to
                                    the Longicones or preceding tribes, while others so much
                                    resemble the Chrysomelae as to have been arranged with the
                                    latter by Linnaeus. The organs of manducation present the same
                                    range of affinities. Thus among the Donaciae, the ligula is
                                    membranous, biful 01 bilobed, as among the Longicones, and their
                                    maxillae an very analogous to those of the latter; while among
                                    the concluding Eupoda the ligula is almost square or rounded,
                                    and analogous to that of the ensuing family, callee <hi

                                    lobes are membranous, or but slightly coriaceous, whitish, or of
                                    a yellowish hue; the exterior expands towards the extremity and
                                    has not the figure of a palpus,—a feature which allies our
                                    present family rather to that which we have lei than to the one
                                    which follows. The body is more or less oblong, with the head
                                    and thorax narrower than the ab domen. The antennae are
                                    filiform, or gradually enlarg( towards the extremity, and are
                                    inserted before the eyes These are in some entire, round, and
                                    projecting, in other slightly emarginate. The head is received
                                    posteriorly by the thorax, which is cylindrical, or in the form
                                    of a trans verse square. The abdomen may be called large wher
                                    compared with the other parts, and forms a lengthene&lt; square,
                                    or elongated triangle. The articulations of th&lt; tarsi,
                                    excepting the terminal one, are furnished beneatl with little
                                    cushions, and the penultimate is biful or bilob cd. The
                                    posterior thighs are very large in many species <pb break="no"

                                    from that character that the family derives its name. They are
                                    all winged insects, and occur on the stems and leaves of various
                                    plants, especially, so far at least as many of the European
                                    species are concerned, on the liliaceous tribes. The larvae of
                                    the Donaciae feed on the internal portion of the roots of
                                    aquatic plants. Those of other genera live exposed, but, after
                                    the manner of the Cassidae, cover themselves with a case or
                                    scabbard formed of their own excrementitious matter. Latreille
                                    divides the family into two tribes.</p>

                                    closely to <hi rend="italic">Crioceris</hi> and <hi
                                    rend="italic">Galeruca.</hi> They are frequently bronzed or
                                    gilded in their aspect, and are covered in some cases by a fine
                                    silky down, which is supposed to prove useful to them when they
                                    fall into the water. Indeed, even in the perfect state, they are
                                    partly aquatic, and may be seen to seek repose and shelter on
                                    the under side of the leaf of a water lily, where they are
                                    necessarily submerged. According to Μ. A. Brongniart, the
                                    chrysalids are attached to their filaments by one edge only. M.
                                    Leon Dufour inclines to think, in consequence of anatomical
                                    investigation, that the Donaciae ought to be formed into a
                                    particular family. His observations, as we are informed by M.
                                    Latreille, demonstrate that their hepatic vessels, in number,
                                    form, structure, and arrangement, constitute a very remarkable
                                    exception to those of the Tetramera in general, and one which
                                    even appears peculiar to the genus. These vessels only open into
                                    the chylific ventricle, while in all the other Ťetramera which
                                    M. Dufour has dissected, they have two insertions, one of which
                                    is ventricular, and the other caecal. These biliary ducts, which
                                    are only four in number, are of two different kinds, —the first
                                    are capillary, and disposed in two strongly flexed curves, and
                                    are inserted by four distinct ends into a short obround vesicle
                                    placed at the inferior and somewhat lateral extremity of the
                                    chylific ventricle,—the others are much shorter, thicker, more
                                    dilatable, thin, and tapering at both ends, with one extremity
                                    free, and separately inserted by the other into the superior and
                                    dorsal region of the ventricle. They contain a whitish pulp,
                                    which is regarded as an alimentary substance. The oesophagus is
                                    capillary, and has no dilatation in the form of crop. The
                                    ċhylific ventricle is beset with projecting papillae.<note

                                    Donaciae—a great amount, when we consider that Dejean’s
                                    Catalogue contains only twenty-six in all. The genus may be
                                    regarded as characteristic of Europe, for scarcely any occur in
                                    other countries, although a few have been collected in
                                    America.</p>
                                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Crioceris</hi> properly so called,
                                    differs from the preceding in the posterior legs being scarcely,
                                    if at all, larger than the others. The antennae become somewhat
                                    enlarged towards the extremity, are almost granose, with their
                                    articulations not much longer than broad. The eyes are elevated
                                    and emarginate, and the posterior extremity of the head forms a
                                    kind of neck behind these latter organs. These insects are of
                                    small size, their bodies narrow and elongated, and frequently
                                    ornamented with lively colours. They live on the leaves of
                                    various plants,—Liliaceae, Asparagi, &amp;c. and occur in
                                    gardens and meadows. When seized they produce a sharpish sound,
                                    by rubbing the superior extremity of the abdomen against the
                                    inferior extremity of the elytra. The larvae feed on the same
                                    plants as those on which we usually find the perfect insects,
                                    and are somewhat adhesive or tenacious by means of their six
                                    sealyfeet. Their bodies are soft, short, and inflated; and they
                                    protect themselves in that early state from the action of the
                                    sun and the changes of the season, by covering their backs with
                                    their own ordure. They occupy a subterranean position in the
                                    nympha state. The species are extremely numerous as the genus
                                    was originally constituted, but it has been greatly restricted
                                    in recent times. Mr Stephens gives seven as the amount of
                                    British species. Of these not above three have yet been found in
                                    Scotland. <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                                    terminated by a strongly inflated joint, truncated, with a small
                                    angular prolongation, exhibiting the appearance of another
                                    joint. The antennae are slender, and composed, of very long and

                                <p>FAMILY VI—CYCLICA.</p>
                                <p>In this family the first three joints of the tarsi are still
                                    spongy, or furnished beneath with pellets, the penultimate joint
                                    divided into two lobes, and the antennae filiform, or a little
                                    larger towards the extremity; but the body is usually rounded,
                                    with the base of the thorax as broad as the elytra in such (and
                                    these are few in number) as are of an oblong form. The exterior
                                    division of the maxilhc, in its narrow and almost cylindrical
                                    form, and darker colour, presents the appearance of a palpus;
                                    the interior division is broader and destitute of a sealytooth.
                                    The bgula is almost square or oval, entire, or slightly
                                    emarginate. It appears from the anatomical researches of M. Leon
                                    Dufour, that the alimentary canal is at least thrice the length
                                    of the body in such of the genera as have been examined; that
                                    the oesophagus is usually inflated behind the crop; and that the
                                    chylific ventricle, or stomach, is generally smooth, at least
                                    throughout a great part of its length. The biliary apparatus
                                    resembles that of the Ccrambycidae and other Longicones, in the
                                    number and double insertion of the vessels of which it is
                                    composed ;—these amount to six, two of which (except in the
                                    genus Cassida) are for the most part shorter and more slender.
                                    The larvae have six feet; their bodies are soft, and frequently
                                    coloured. They feed, like the perfect insect, on the leaves of
                                    plants, to which they adhere by means of a viscid humour. Some
                                    enter the earth prior to their assumption of the nympha state,
                                    while others undergo that change attached to the plants on which
                                    they feed, and partly encompassed by the exuviae of the larva.
                                    The perfect insects are of small size, but they are frequently
                                    adorned by brilliant colours and metallic splendour. They are
                                    slow and timorous in their general movements, and when attempted
                                    to be seized, they closely fold their feet and antennae, and
                                    drop to the ground. Several species are good leapers, and the
                                    females are extremely prolific. Latreille divides this family
                                    into three tribes, according to the mode in which the antennae
                                    are inserted.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tribe 1st, Cassidariae.</hi></p>
                                <p>These have the antennae inserted on the superior part of the
                                    head, and approximate, straight, short, filiform, and almost
                                    cylindrical, or increasing gradually towards the extremity. The
                                    mouth, situate altogether underneath, and with very short almost
                                    filiform palpi, is sometimes arched (cintrée), sometimes
                                    partially received into the cavity of the praesternum. The eyes
                                    are ovoid or round; the legs contractile and short, with the
                                    tarsi flattened,— the lobes of the penultimate articulation
                                    entirely inclosing the terminal one. The body being flat
                                    beneath, these insects, by the disposition of their tarsi, are
                                    enabled to adhere closely to the surface of vegetation, and to
                                    remain there immoveable; in other respects the body is generally
                                    orbicular or oval, and is margined all round, or overlapped, by
                                    the thorax and elytra. The head is concealed beneath the thorax,
                                    or is received into its anterior emargination. The colours are
                                    extremely varied, and are distributed in the form of spots and
                                    radiated markings, in a manner delightful to look upon. The
                                    larvae present a less inviting aspect, and have the instinctive
                                    habit of covering themselves with their own excretions.</p>

                                    CCXXVII. fig. 12), is distinguished from the preceding by the
                                    orbicular or almost ovoid form of the body, which, however, in a
                                    small number is nearly square. The thorax, more or less
                                    semicircular, or in the form of the segment of a circle,
                                    entirely covers and conceals the head, or incloses it in its
                                    anterior emargination. The elytra, often elevated about the
                                    region of the scutellum, project over the body. The mandibles
                                    are furnished with not fewer than four teeth, and the external
                                    maxillary lobe is at least as long as the internal. The name by
                                    which the insects of this genus are distinguished was no doubt
                                    bestowed upon them on account of a strongly marked character in
                                    their structure. The edges of the thorax and elytra overlap and
                                    protect the limbs and abdomen on all sides, and the head is also
                                    nearly covered and concealed by the prothorax. Many of the
                                    species are highly ornamental, and present pleasing combinations
                                    of green and golden hues, which, however, soon disappear or
                                    diminish in intensity after the death of the insect, but may be
                                    temporarily restored by the use of hot water. These insects are
                                    herbivorous in their habits, and are fond of artichokes and
                                    thistles. The structure and habits of the larvae are rather
                                    singular, and have been studied and described by Goedart,
                                    Roesel, Réaumur, and Degeer. They are flattish, rather broad,
                                    and beset laterally by sixteen branched spines placed
                                    horizontally on each side of the posterior and superior portion
                                    of the body. At the base of these spines may be observed seven
                                    small cylindrical truncated tunnels, each placed on a distinct
                                    segment. These are probably the stigmatic openings. The head is
                                    small, of a corneous consistence, and presents four small
                                    tubercles on each side of its superior part, and only three on
                                    its inferior. These are regarded by Degeer as genuine eyes. Six
                                    sealyfeet terminated by a brown-coloured hook, sustain the body,
                                    which is terminated by a two-branched fork, curved over the
                                    back, and usually bearing a pile of excrementitious matter,
                                    under which the larva lies in part concealed. Il can elevate or
                                    depress this “stercorareous parasol” al pleasure, for the
                                    varying purposes of shade or shelter. The nymph is shorter than
                                    the larva, broad, flattened, ol an oval form, and surrounded by
                                    peculiar appendages. I∣ has an ample thorax, terminated by a
                                    circular arch, and furnished with similar points or appendages.
                                    The legs and the segments of the abdomen are perceptible. It was
                                    in the aspect of one of these nympħae that Goedart supposed he
                                    recognised a representation of the human figure surrounded by an
                                    imperial crown. The genus Cassida presents an immense amount of
                                    species. About twenty are indigenous to Britain, several more
                                    occur on the continent of Europe, and, including exotic species,

                                <p>In other groups, the antennae, perceptibly longer than the head
                                    and thorax, are simple and filiform, or enlarged towards the
                                    extremity, or even terminated by a club,—in which case they are
                                    generally toothed like a saw, but only from the seventh joint.

                                    produce an appearance of twelve joints. In the genus <hi
                                    rend="smallcaps">Cryptocephalus</hi> properly so called, the
                                    body is cylindrical, and the thorax as broad as the abdomen
                                    throughout its length. The antennae and palpi are of the same
                                    size throughout. We have above a score of species in Great
                                    Britain. In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Eumolpus</hi> of
                                    Kugelan the body is narrowed in front, and almost ovoid. The

                                    antennae is shorter than that which follows. Almost all of them
                                    are exotic, although a few are found in Europe, of which <hi

                                <p>We now approach the second great genus of the present tribe, that
                                    called <hi rend="italic">Chrysomela</hi> by Linnaeus. Of its
                                    modern reconstruction we shall likewise present the reader with
                                    a general sketch. The body of these insects is usually ovoid or
                                    nearly ovular, with the head salient, projecting or merely
                                    inclined. The antennae are simple, about half the length of the
                                    body, and most frequently granosc, and insensibly enlarged. When
                                    the great Swedish naturalist established his extensive genus
                                    Chrysomela, he included within its somewhat too ample boundaries
                                    numerous groups, which the more precise observation and richer
                                    materials of later entomologists have caused to be erected into
                                    separate genera. It is thus that we owe <hi rend="italic"

                                    the most beautiful and highly adorned of all the insect tribes.

                                    brilliant colouring.</p></note> These insects are of small or
                                    medium size. Few of them measure more than half an inch in
                                    length, and the greater number do not equal that dimension. They
                                    are strictly herbivorous, and sometimes commit considerable
                                    ravages on agricultural and garden produce. The larvae have in
                                    general six feet, an elongated body, beset with warts or
                                    tubercles, and terminated by a kind of nipple, which secretes a
                                    viscous fluid, used both in walking, and in order to fix the
                                    insect firmly before its conversion to the nympha state. Their
                                    transformations usually take place in the open air, in which
                                    case they are protected by the hardening of their natural
                                    envelope. Many of the species are gregarious, while others are
                                    solitary; and it is among the latter that such occur as undergo
                                    their metamorphoses under ground. We shall now enumerate the
                                    principal generic groups into which the old genus Chrysomela has
                                    been subdivided.</p>
                                <p>In some the body is always ovoid, or nearly oval, and furnished

                                    resemble the Eumolpi already mentioned, and differ from the
                                    ensuing Chrysomelinae in their filiform antennae, which are
                                    longer than half the length of the body, composed of elongated
                                    nearly cylindrical articles, of which the eleventh or terminal
                                    bears an appendage or false joint nearly half as long as the

                                    which it is equal, if not larger, in size,—its form being more
                                    or less semi-ovoid. Ihese insects are widely spread over most
                                    parts of the ancient continent, especially Europe. In the genus
                                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Timarcha</hi> of Megerle and Dejean (Plate
                                    CCXXVII. fig. 17), the species are few in number, and apterous.
                                    The elytra are joined together, the body gibbous, and the tarsi
                                    much dilated, especially in the males. They occur on the ground
                                    in woods, fields, and by the sides of highways. Their movements
                                    are slow and heavy, and a yellowish or reddish liquor frequently
                                    exudes from their articulations. Linnaeus classed a well-known
                                    species of this genus (7 <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>. <hi
                                    rend="italic">tenebricoa)</hi> as a tenebrio. It has been
                                    dissected by M. Leon Dufour, and exhibited an intestinal tube
                                    three times the length of the body. It presented no appearance
                                    of a crop; and the stomach, which was long and folded on itself,
                                    contained no sensible papillae: some small transverse muscular
                                    bands were just discernible. The stomach is followed by a
                                    filiform intestine, then by an oblong caecum, bordering on the
                                    rectum. As far as our own observation has extended, the species,
                                    with a few exceptions from the north of Africa, seem confined to
                                    Europe. In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Chrysomela</hi>
                                    properly so called (Plate CCXXVII. fig. 18), the species are all
                                    provided with wings, and the terminal article of the palpi is as
                                    large or larger than the preceding ones, and in the form of a
                                    truncated ovoid, or reversed cone. The species of this
                                    delightful genus are extremely numerous, even in its now
                                    restricted state. Comte Dejean was many years ago in possession
                                    of 120 species, and we know that his collection has recently
                                    been much augmented. Even in Britain we possess about thirty
                                    species, exclusive of fourteen kinds of <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Phcedon</hi> and six of <hi rend="italic">Melasoma,</hi> genera
                                    so nearly allied in structure and economy, that some authors do
                                    not yet distinguish them from the Chrysomelae strictly so
                                    called. We regret that within our present limits we cannot

                                    insupportable, being inexpressibly strong and penetrating. These

                                    a short distance from the mouth, and usually approximate at
                                    their base, and close upon a small longitudinal carina. The
                                    maxillary palpi, thickest towards the middle, are terminated by
                                    two joints of a conical form, but opposed or united by their

                                    last-named genus is the most frequent and best known in Britain.
                                    The species are of small dimensions, and occur in great numbers
                                    during the spring in humid places, and are extremely destructive
                                    both in the larva and perfect state to pot-herbs and other
                                    garden produce. The larvae resemble those of Chrysomela and
                                    Crioceris, and some of them are remarkable for discharging an
                                    odorous and acid fluid from certain small tubercles on their
                                    backs. The nymphae bear a likeness to those of Coccinella, and
                                    remain from fifteen to twenty days in that condition. The
                                    perfect insects are often highly adorned, and the species are
                                    extremely numerous. We shall mention merely <hi rend="italic">H.

                                <p>FAMILY VII.—CLAVIPALPI.</p>
                                <p>The insects of this family resemble the others of the same
                                    section in having the under part of the first three
                                    articulations of the tarsi furnished with brushes, and the
                                    penultimate biful,—but they are distinguished from them by their
                                    antennae, which are terminated by a distinct perfoliated club,
                                    and by their maxillae armed on the inner side with a claw or
                                    corneous tooth. A few have the articles of the tarsi entire, but
                                    they still differ from other Tetramera with analogous tarsi, in
                                    their globular or ball-like form. In this family the body is·
                                    usually rounded, frequently even very convex and hemispherical.
                                    The antennae are shorter than the body, the mandibles emarginatß
                                    or dentated at the extremity, and the palpi terminated by a
                                    large joint; the last joint of the maxillary palpi is very
                                    large, transverse, compressed, almost lunate. The form of the
                                    organs of manducation indicates that these insects are gnawers;
                                    and most of the European species occur on tree fungi, beneath
                                    bark, &amp;c.</p>
                                <p>Some have the penultimate joint of the tarsi bilobed, and are not
                                    contracted like a ball. Of these, a certain number have the last
                                    article of the maxillary palpi transverse, and almost lunate or
                                    securiform. Such are the following genera. <hi rend="smallcaps"

                                    shining hemispherical insects, frequently found on flowers. They
                                    pass the winter under moss or beneath the ark of trees, where
                                    they probably also undergo their metamorphosis. Their general
                                    colours are brown or black; <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> eir

                                    faculty possessed by the species of rolling themselves into a
                                    ball,—in which state they feign death in the most imperturbable
                                    manner. They occur in woods, beneath the bark of trees, and in
                                    mushrooms. We regard the genus, of which about a dozen species
                                    occur in Britain, as rather characteristic of the north of
                                    Europe. It was originally constituted by a dismemberment of
                                    Sphaeridium, from which, according to the sectional system of
                                    Latreille, it stands ata great distance, having, in common with

                                    distinct; the penultimate is usually bilobed; and the last,
                                    presenting a knot at its base, is terminated by a pair of hooks.
                                    The elytra are not truncated, and entirely cover the abdomen.

                                    large and securiform, and the penultimate article of the tarsi
                                    is deeply bilobed. In the remainder of the family the articles
                                    of the tarsi are simple, or at least the penultimate is very
                                    slightly biful, a character which, with certain others,
                                    distinguishes these insects from the Fungicoae.</p>
                                <p>In the extensive and beautiful genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                    >Coccinella,</hi> commonly called Lady-birds (Plate CCXXV1I.
                                    fig. 23), the antennae are distinctly composed of eleven
                                    articulations. The body is nearly hemispherical, the thorax very
                                    short, slightly if at all margined, and the penultimate joint of
                                    the tarsi is deeply bilobed. The head is not concealed. This
                                    genus was established by Frisch, and has been adopted by all
                                    succeeding entomologists. It serves, according to Mr Curtis, as
                                    a remarkable example of the value of structure in the
                                    combination of groups, and of the slight importance of the
                                    distribution of colour when employed to distinguish species. “As
                                    a genus, Coccinella is so natural that its appellation has never
                                    been disturbed; whereas the species composing it are so variable
                                    that many of them have been described under a great variety of
                                    names.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                                <p>These insects are distinguishable from the neighbouring genera of
                                    <hi rend="italic">Chrysomela</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Erotylus</hi> by the number of articulations of the tarsi,
                                    which never exceed three. In this character they so far coincide
                                    with <hi rend="italic">Eumorphus,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                                    rend="italic">—</hi> but from those genera they differ in the
                                    shortness of their antennae, the form of their bodies, and the
                                    development of the last articulation of the maxillary palpi. The
                                    general form of these beautiful, and for the most part
                                    familiarly-known insects, is hemispherical,—an aspect produced
                                    chiefly by the convex shape of the elytra. The under surface is
                                    extremely flat, and the legs are short, and, except when the
                                    insect is in motion, scarcely project beyond the lateral edges
                                    of the elytra. Leon Dufour has illustrated the anatomical
                                    structure of this genus with his accustomed accuracy. He dis-,
                                    covered in <hi rend="italic">C. septernpunctata</hi> a salivary
                                    apparatus composed of three pair of diaphanous vessels, of
                                    extreme tenuity, more or less twisted, and extending from the
                                    hinder part of the mouth into the abdomen, where the extremities
                                    appear to float. He was, however, unable to detect the
                                    appearance of any gland or other organ of an essentially
                                    secreting nature; but when submitted to a powerful microscope,
                                    these vessels exhibited a structure entirely analogous to that
                                    of the salivary conduits observable in the dipterous and
                                    hemipterous tribes. A linear and tubular axis was perceptible
                                    through their pellucid coats, resembling that of the
                                    excrementitial secretions of the Carabidae. The digestive canal
                                    is itself scarcely longer than the body of the insect, and is
                                    consequently nearly straight. The oesophagus seems inclosed in
                                    the head, in such a way that, to render it observable, the
                                    alimentary tube must be drawn backwards. The stomach is not
                                    preceded by any crop or gizzard. It is bilobed at its origin,
                                    where it approaches the head, and receives the oesophagus in the
                                    notch or slope produced by that bilobation. It is. longer than
                                    the rest of the tube,—is very smooth and dilatable,—and was
                                    found filled sometimes with a blackish, sometimes with a
                                    yellowish pulp. Near its termination were the biliary vessels,
                                    six in number. These vessels are somewhat large in proportion to
                                    the size of the insect, and each has a distinct and isolated
                                    insertion on' the stomach, like a caecum.. They have a very
                                    varicoe aspect, and always appear diaphanous. The insertion of
                                    these biliary vessels indicates the limits of the stomach, and
                                    we have then a very short intestine, followed by a slightly
                                    bulged caecum, and a rectum distinctly marked.</p>
                                <p>The larvae of the Coccinellae feed on Aphides, and are extremely
                                    useful in the destruction of those noxious insects which abound
                                    to the deterioration of so many valuable plants. In the perfect
                                    state many of the species pass the winter in the clefts of
                                    palings and the chinks of walls. Their eggs are usually laid in
                                    spring. These are of a yellow colour, with a disagreeable smell,
                                    and produce larvae of an aspect very different from that of the
                                    perfect insect. In that early condition the body is much broader
                                    than deep, and is pointed towards the extremity, which bears a
                                    fleshy projection, carried by the insect on the plane of its
                                    position, and serving as a kind of supernumerary foot. The body
                                    consists of twelve rings or segments, which in some cases are
                                    garnished with spines or tubercles, in others smooth. When the
                                    larvae have attained to their full size, they adhere by their
                                    hinder extremity to a leaf or a stone, and partly freeing
                                    themselves from a slough or skin, they assume the state of
                                    Chrysalis. In the course of a week or two, according to the
                                    species, the perfect insect makes its appearance. It is at first
                                    soft, flexible, and almost colourless, but a very short period
                                    suffices to adorn it with those gay and contrasted markings
                                    which render the Coccinellae or “Lady-birds” among the most
                                    admired of all the smaller tribes of coleopterous insects. Some
                                    contrariety of opinion appears to exist in regard to the food
                                    and habits of these insects in the perfect state. Perhaps their
                                    instincts may vary according to circumstances, or may present a
                                    disparity in the species. We have frequently observed them
                                    preying upon Aphides; and yet Bose, in describing the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Coccinella borealis</hi> of America, mentions its
                                    destructive attacks upon the leaves of the melon plantations;
                                    and other species are said to be injurious to the crops of
                                    lucerne and cinqfoils. Their numbers vary greatly in different
                                    years. In 1807, as Messrs Kirby and Spence inform us, the shore
                                    at Brighton, and all the watering-places on the south coast,
                                    were literally covered with them, to the great surprise and even
                                    alarm of the inhabitants, who were ignorant that their little
                                    visitors were merely emigrants from the neighbouring hopgrounds,
                                    where in their larva state they had slain their thousands and
                                    their tens of thousands of the Aphis, which, under the name of

                        <p>In this order the wings arc likewise four in number. The elytra or upper
                            pair are softer and more flexible than in the preceding order·; they are
                            semi-membranous, reticulated, and for the most part do not form by their
                            junction, when closed, a straight line along the dorsal suture. The true
                            wings are folded longitudinally, and usually after the manner of a fan,
                            and are divided by longitudinal membranous nervures. Maxillae terminated
                            by a corneous piece, toothed, and protected by the galea, a portion
                            which corresponds to the exterior division of the jaws of coleopterous
                            insects. In this order there is also a kind of tongue or epiglottis. The
                            metamorphosis is semi-complete.</p>
                        <p>Linnaeus arranged the first genus of our present order with his
                            Coleoptera, placing it, however, by itself at the termination of that
                            order ;—the remaining genera were grouped with his hemipterous tribes.
                            We owe their separation to Degeer, who formed the whole into an order,
                            under the name of <hi rend="italic">Dermaptera.</hi><note

                            tribes, along with which we have consequently ranked it in the present
                            treatise, in conformity with the views of Μ. Latreiìle, although we are
                            aware that most English entomologists, and many foreign ones, prefer
                            that it should be distinguished as above mentioned.</p></note> They
                            correspond to the <hi rend="italic">Ulonata</hi> of Fabricius. The title
                            which they now bear was imposed by Olivier.</p>
                        <p>The body of orthopterous insects is generally of an elongated form, and
                            of a somewhat soft and fleshy consistence. It is composed as usual of
                            head, thorax, and abdomen. We shall briefly describe the general
                            characters of these parts. The head varies considerably in size, form,
                            and position. It is usually large and vertical, and presents in the
                            greater number of species two or three stemmatic eyes. The front is
                            sometimes prolonged into a conical form, as in certain species of the
                            genera <hi rend="italic">Truxalis</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Mantis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> sometimes it bears a kind of fleshy
                            appendix resembling a veil, as in the <hi rend="italic">Gryllus</hi><hi
                            rend="italic">umhraculosus</hi> of Spain. The true eyes occupy the sides
                            of the head, and are generally very large, with a reticulated aspect.
                            The antennae do not vary so greatly in their structure as among the
                            Coleoptera, but they are usually composed of a greater number of
                            articulations. They are generally inserted in front of the eyes, but
                            sometimes beneath or between them. Their articulations are not very
                            distinct, and as to shape they are filiform, setaceous, massive,
                            perfoliated, and sometimes ensiform, or resembling the blade of a
                            sword.</p>
                        <p>The mouth consists of a labrum, two mandibles, a pair of maxillae, a
                            labium, and four palpi. The labrum is attached to the clypcus by a
                            distinct suture; it is moveable, always external, demi-coriaceous,
                            somewhat arched or vaulted, almost semicircular, rounded in front, and
                            advancing on the mandibles. The mandibles are scaly, or corneous and
                            strong, triangular, short, thick, with the exterior side arched, and the
                            interior armed with many unequal teeth or dentations. According to the
                            observations of Marcel de Serres, these dentations bear a close relation
                            to the mode of nourishment; and he distinguishes them, as we do the
                            dental system of the Mammalia, as <hi rend="italic">incisive,
                            canine,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">molar.</hi> These last arc the
                            largest, and there is never more than one in each mandible, placed
                            towards its base. The three sorts of teeth never exist simultaneously,
                            and it is by their presence or absence, and by the modifications of
                            their forms, that we may recognise the nature of the various substances
                            by which the different tribes of Orthoptera are nourished. In the genera
                            <hi rend="italic">Mantis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Empusa,</hi> for
                            example, which are purely carnivorous, we find only the canine teeth or
                            <hi rend="italic">laniares.</hi> Those species which have only incisive
                            and molar teeth are herbivorous, while such as are omnivorous possess
                            canine and molar teeth, but of smaller dimensions. The maxillae resemble
                            in a great measure those of the carnivorous Coleoptera. They are very
                            strong, corneous, at least on their superior portion, which forms a kind
                            of large conical tooth, provided with two or three dentations. They also
                            bear <pb break="no" facs="nls:193747702" xml:id="kp-eb0709-7702-0188"/>
                            two palpi, but that which is named the internal palpus among the
                            carnivorous Coleoptera is here transformed into a membranous
                            inarticulate piece, sometimes cylindrical, in other instances triangular
                            or dilated, but in all cases vaulted above, and covering the extremity
                            of the maxillae. It is to this particular portion, or internal maxillary
                            palpus, that Fabricius applied the name of <hi rend="italic">galea,</hi>
                            or helmet, a term not very accurately translated <hi rend="italic"
                            >galette</hi> by Olivier. The external maxillary palpi, which alone are
                            apparent, are composed of five articulations, of which the two first are
                            extremely short; and it is in these palpi that Olivier and Marcel de
                            Serres suppose themselves to have discovered the organ of the sense of
                            <hi rend="italic">smell.</hi> The latter author observed in their
                            interior a pair of nerves spreading themselves over the vesicular
                            membrane which terminates their last articulation. These he names the
                            olfactory nerves: one is furnished by the fifth pair, which springs from
                            the inferior face of the brain, and the other by the first pair, which
                            derives its origin from the lateral and superior face of the first
                            ganglion of the head. Between these two nerves there is a trachea,
                            which, before it reaches the vesicular membrane, commences to form a
                            pneumatic pouch. This pouch is more fully developed in the interior of
                            the palpus, and throws off numerous ramifications, which spread
                            themselves within the cavity of the organ. It was this peculiar
                            structure which induced Olivier and Marcel de Serres to regard these
                            palpi as the organs of the sense of smell. We may add, however, that
                            Latreille is by no means satisfied that they are so, and thinks that
                            additional observation is necessary to establish this alleged fact in
                            the physiology of insects. The labium, or ligula, of the Orthoptera, is
                            almost membranous, elongated, slightly enlarged towards its extremity,
                            and divided into two or four stripes or portions.</p>
                        <p>The interior of the mouth exhibits an additional piece, which some regard
                            as a tongue; it is fleshy, longitudinal, carinated above, broader at its
                            base, slightly restricted before its anterior extremity, rounded,
                            immoveable, and somewhat notched at its point. The mentum is coriaceous,
                            in form of a transverse square, rather narrow towards the summit. The
                            labial palpi are composed of only three articulations, as among the
                            coleopterous tribes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            and a metathorax. The first is generally the largest, and is the only
                            part exposed. It presents a great variety of forms, some of which are
                            sufficiently singular. The elytra, in the greater number, are
                            coriaceous, thin, flexible, semitransparent, and reticulated. They are
                            occasionally almost horizontal, with a straight dorsal suture, as among
                            the Coleoptera; but they are much more frequently more or less inclined,
                            with their inner edges crossing each other when closed over the back.
                            The true wings are broader than the elytra, membranous, full of
                            reticulations, and longitudinally folded after the fashion of a fan. To
                            this latter character, however, the somewhat anomalous genus <hi
                            rend="italic">Forficula</hi> (containing the earwigs) presents an
                            exception, as in it the wings are also transversely (as well as
                            longitudinally) folded, as among the Coleoptera. In some cases the
                            females, and in a few instances both sexes, among the Orthoptera, are
                            destitute of wings. In many species the elytra of the males are short or
                            rudimentary, and in that sex also a portion of the inner margin of these
                            parts frequently resembles talc or parchment, and exhibits large
                            irregular nervures. It is by the rapid friction of these upon each other
                            that the monotonous song, or <hi rend="italic">stridulation</hi> as it
                            is called, of many species is occasioned. In others, however, a shrill
                            monotonous cry is produced by rubbing the posterior limbs against the
                            edges of the elytra.</p>
                        <p>The legs of orthopterous insects are sometimes similar to each other. In
                            other cases the anterior pair are more extensile, and are armed with
                            spines, with which they transfix their prey,—or they are dilated,
                            compressed, strongly toothed externally, and adapted for burrowing in
                            the earth. The posterior legs, as among locusts and grasshoppers, are
                            frequently much larger than the others, and fitted for powerful leaping;
                            and both the middle and posterior pair are more widely apart from each
                            other at their origin than among the coleopterous species. The
                            arti-colations of the tarsi differ in the different tribes; but we
                            believe that no <hi rend="italic">heteromerous</hi> species have been
                            yet observed. These articulations are not unfrequently furnished beneath
                            with little membranous cushions, and the terminal articulation is always
                            provided with a pair of hooks or claws.</p>
                        <p>The form of the abdomen varies in this order. It is divided externally
                            into eight or nine rings, and is often terminated by projecting
                            appendages. Many of the females are furnished with an ovipositor,
                            composed of two portions closely applied, and frequently surrounded by a
                            common envelope.</p>
                        <p>In relation to the anatomy of the Orthoptera, we may state, that they are
                            all characterized by a first membranous stomach or crop, succeeded by a
                            muscular gizzard, armed interiorly with scales or corneous teeth,
                            according to the species. Around the pylorus, except in the <hi
                            rend="italic">Forji∙</hi><hi rend="italic">culee,</hi> are two or more
                            blind intestines, furnished at their base with many small biliary
                            vessels; and numerous other vessels of a similar nature are inserted
                            towards the middle of the intestine. The digestive system of the larvae
                            resembles that of the perfect insect.</p>
                        <p>M. Marcel de Serres has particularly devoted himself to the study of the
                            internal structure of these creatures. He informs us that the Orthoptera
                            with setaceous antennae, such as the genera <hi rend="italic">Elatta,
                            Mantis, Gryllο-ialp∏,</hi><hi rend="italic">Gryllus,</hi> and <hi
                            rend="italic">Locusta,</hi> have only elastic or tubular tracheae, and
                            these of two kinds,—the one arterial, the other pulmonary. The latter
                            alone distribute the air to all parts of the body <hi rend="superscript"
                            > 7</hi>, after having received it from the former. In the genera
                            characterized by cylindrical or prismatic antennae, such as <hi
                            rend="italic">Acrydiurn</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Trιιxalis,</hi> the
                            pulmonary tracheae are replaced by vesicular ones. They are covered by
                            cartilaginous hoops or moveable ribs, and receive air by means of
                            tubular or elastic tracheae, which proceed from the arterial kind.
                            According to the same authority, the nutritive system is more or less
                            developed, and exhibits four principal modifications. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Gryllus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gryllo-talpa</hi> in that respect
                            excel the others. In them the crop is shaped like a bagpipe, and placed
                            on one side, while in the rest it is on a line with the gizzard. In the
                            latter also the hepatic vessels are inserted insulately, but in the
                            former by means of a common deferent canal. The genera <hi rend="italic"
                            >Truxalis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Acrydiurn</hi> (criquets), although
                            resembling <hi rend="italic">Locusta</hi><hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi
                            rend="italic">Sauterelles')</hi> in their digestive system, differ in
                            respect to the superior hepatic vessels, which are not furnished at
                            their extremity with secreting vessels, and no longer form enlarged
                            pouches, but cylindrical and elongated canals. The intestines of <hi
                            rend="italic">Elatta</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mantis</hi> present only
                            two divisions; their nutritive system is in other respects the same. The

                            Orthoptera in wanting the superior hepatic vessels.</p>
                        <p>The metamorphoses of the Orthoptera are called semicoplete, and consist
                            chiefly in the development and increase of the elytra and wings. Both
                            the larvae and nymphae feed and move about like the perfect insects, and
                            differ chiefly by the entire want of wings in the first state, and their
                            rudimentary condition in the second. These insects lay an immense number
                            of eggs, of an elongated form and considerable size. They are sometimes
                            deposited in a mass, and inclosed together within a capsule. Both young
                            and old are extremely voracious, and frequently produce the most
                            frightful consequences by their-devastations. On the other hand, we are
                            not aware of any recompensing advantages derivable to the human race
                            from any species of orthopterous insects. Several eastern tribes no
                            doubt use them as food, and seem to have done so in remote times, as
                            indicated by the ancient name of <hi rend="italic">Acridophagi</hi><hi
                            rend="italic">;</hi> and the sacred writings have recorded that the food
                            of John the Baptist in the wilderness was “locusts and wild honey.” We
                            believe that no aquatic species is contained in this order.</p>
                        <p>Mr Macleay has observed, that although there may be reason for hesitation
                            with respect to the types of the Neuroptera, there is none in relation
                            to the principal forms of the orthopterous order. These forms seem to
                            have been perceived by all entomologists, and their dissimilarity has
                            led to tribes being regarded in the light of orders. “Indeed no forms
                            that are within the limits of an order can be more distinct from each
                            other than those of a <hi rend="italic">Phasma,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                            >Forficula;</hi> and we accordingly find that they have been considered
                            as the types of so many groups by Linnaeus. The affinity of <hi
                            rend="italic">Flatta</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Mantis</hi> is
                            acknowledged in the <hi rend="italic">Fegne Animal.</hi> The genus <hi

                            Berlin, one of the first entomologists of the present day, proves the
                            proximity of <hi rend="italic">Phasma</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                            >Truxalis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and no entomologist is ignorant
                            that the chain of connection from <hi rend="italic">Actidium</hi> to <hi

                            established. Hence some notion may be obtained of the contents of the
                            orthopterous circle, if we reckon the above-mentioned five genera as the
                            types of the following tribes :</p>

                        <p>But as this series returns into itself, and the genus <hi rend="italic"
                            >Forficula</hi> cannot be inserted therein without disturbing its
                            regularity, we must agree with Degeer and Mr Kirby, that it belongs to a
                            distinct order. That this order can only be esteemed osculant between

                            <p>The insects of this genus, known under the familiar name of <hi
                                rend="italic">earwigs,</hi> are frequent in moist places, beneath
                                stones, under the loose bark of old trees, or in decayed timber.
                                They are injurious in gardens, where they attack various kinds of
                                fruit. They also pierce the petals of flowers, and do not refuse
                                animal food. Our entomological cabinet, when left open for a summer
                                night, has sometimes suffered from their depredations. They may
                                therefore be regarded as omnivorous. Their alleged inclination to

                                must be familiar to the reader; but we shall devote a few lines to
                                the manners of the common earwig, <hi rend="italic">F.</hi><hi
                                rend="italic">auricularia.</hi> The female is known to watch over
                                her eggs wit*h great care,—an uncommon tendency among insects.
                                Degeer placed an earwig, with her eggs, in a box with fresh earth,
                                early in the month of April. They had been scattered by accident
                                about the box; but she soon collected them together, and placed
                                herself above them, as if she were hatching. Towards the middle of
                                May the young made their appearance. They seemed large in proportion
                                to the eggs, and appeared as if swollen. The movement of the dorsal
                                vessel was very perceptible through the skin. These larvae have
                                neither wings nor elytra. They are composed of thirteen segments, of
                                which the first three bear the legs, and the last exhibits the germ
                                of the pincers, which are conical and slightly divergent. The
                                antennae are composed of eight articulations. Degeer endeavoured to
                                bring up the young along with their mother, and fed them with slices
                                of apple. They were observed to cast their skins several times, and
                                after each of these changes the antennae gained an additional
                                articulation. The pincers also became longer, and their points
                                approached each other, as in the adult insect. These larvae,
                                however, all perished by degrees but one; and the mother also
                                perished, and was found half devoured by her offspring, an
                                ungrateful return for such tender solicitude. This unnatural
                                voracity, however, probably arose from a deficiency of other food,
                                as they are never observed to attack each other in a state of
                                freedom. The remaining larva increased in size, and assumed the
                                nympha state towards the end of July. The cases of the elytra and
                                wings are flat, and closely pressed upon the back, and the pincers
                                have assumed their usual aspect. It therefore does not greatly
                                differ from the perfect insect.</p>

                                run with great rapidity. Some inhabit woods or the crevices of old
                                walls, while others frequent store-rooms and dwelling-houses, where
                                their voracious propensities produce great damage to all kinds of
                                provisions. , They likewise destroy silk and woollen stuffs, and
                                even leather. But their ravages are chiefly confined to warm
                                countries. The species are numerous. Olivier<note anchored="true"

                                >Blatta orientalis</hi> of Linn, is about an inch long, of a reddish
                                chesnut-brown. The wings, which are shorter than the abdomen in the
                                male, are merely rudimentary in the female, and are wanting in the
                                larvae of both sexes. The eggs, to the number of sixteen, are
                                inclosed symmetrically in an oval compressed shell, which is at
                                first white and afterwards brown. It is tolerably solid, and is
                                toothed along its edges like a saw. The female carries it about with
                                her for some time, and afterwards attaches it to a favourable
                                position, by means of a gummy exudation. This species, originally
                                imported from eastern countries, is now widely spread over Europe,
                                and occurs as far north as Finland.</p>

                            <p>We may observe, that the genus <hi rend="italic">Mantis,</hi> as
                                originally constituted by Linnaeus, contained a great variety of
                                very singular and somewhat incongruous forms. It has since been
                                greatly restricted, and more precisely defined, by Illiger,
                                Latreille, Lichtenstein, and other modern writers. Thus it is
                                distinguishable from <hi rend="italic">Empusa</hi> of Illiger, by
                                the antennae, which in the latter genus are pectinated in the male
                                sex, and by the want of the frontal prolongation of the head. From
                                the spectre insects <hi rend="italic">(Spectrum)</hi> with which
                                they were likewise combined by Linnaeus, the true species of Mantis
                                may be easily discriminated by the form and relative length of the
                                legs, which in the spectres are of uniform size. The head in Mantis
                                is triangular, vertical, with large eyes, and three small distinct
                                stemmata. The antennae are simple, setaceous, inserted between the
                                eyes, and composed of numerous articulations. The labrum is entire;
                                the mandibles cutting or incisive; the palpi filiform, pointed, not
                                compressed; and the ligula is composed of four parts or divisions of
                                nearly equal length. The thorax is long, and composed almost
                                entirely of the first segment, of which the anterior extremity is
                                frequently dilated, and the sides rounded. The first pair of legs
                                are held in advance and raised, the haunch being very large, and the
                                thigh toothed and compressed; the tibia is also toothed, and
                                terminated by a strong hook or crotchet. The other legs are slender,
                                simple, and unarmed with teeth or spines. The elytra are horizontal,
                                narrow, lengthened, rather thin, semitransparent, and overlap each
                                other on their inner edges. The under or true wings are folded
                                lengthways like a fan. The abdomen is oblong, and is terminated by
                                two conical articulated appendages, and a compressed sealyplate,
                                arched on the back, and composed of several short pieces received
                                into a pair of anal valves.</p>
                            <p>Such, we conceive, are the characters of the genus <hi
                                rend="smallcaps">Mantis</hi> properly so called. It contains a
                                considerable number of species, all characterized by singular and
                                eccentric forms. We do not know by what means it has happened that
                                an insect of this genus has become, in various parts of the world,
                                if not an object of religious worship, at least a subject of
                                superstitious wonder and credulity. From time immemorial the Mantis,
                                in Turkey, has been regarded as a sacred insect; and even among the
                                apathetic Hottentots, so sparingly endowed with any thing allied to
                                the nobler faculties, it is said to be held in still higher
                                estimation. The <hi rend="italic">Mantis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                                >religiosa</hi> of Europe, called <hi rend="italic">Prega-Diou</hi>
                                (Prie-Dieu) in the southern provinces of France, is well known as
                                living habitually under the safe-guard of a religious veneration on
                                the part of the peasantry, who deem it a faithful guide and guardian
                                of children who have lost their way. It has obtained the name of <hi
                                rend="italic">religiosa,</hi> from the incessant movements of its
                                fore legs, which it is continually raising into the air, and as it
                                were clasping together. This action, however, is the result of its
                                peculiar instinct and mode of life; for the insect, in common with
                                the rest of the genus, is a fierce, cruel, gormandising creature,
                                and so far from indulging, as is fondly supposed, in a state of
                                religious abstraction, is continually seeking for what it may
                                devour. It preys upon all the weaker insects, which it either
                                crushes to death, or relentlessly impales alive upon the sharp
                                spines of its own shanks. To effect this, it is perpetually moving
                                its arms or fore-legs in the air, and closing one armed joint upon
                                another, so that whatever insect prey approaches within its reach is
                                immediately transfixed and devoured. In some of the French provinces
                                it is called the <hi rend="italic">sorcerer.</hi> Four or five
                                different species are found in Europe, and many more occur in the

                                frequently cover the abdomen in such a manner as to make it appear

                                a great number of nearly cylindrical articulations,—while those of

                                composed of not more than nine articulations. It appears that this
                                great disparity between the sexes led Latreille into an error when
                                he formed a distinct species of <hi rend="italic">Ph.

                                colour. The thorax is short and dentated on the sides, and the
                                foliations of the thighs are likewise dentated. In the female the
                                antennae are very short, the elytra as long as the abdomen, and the
                                true wings wanting. The form of the male is narrower and more
                                lengthened, and the antennae long and setaceous; the elytra are
                                short and the wings long. This species, Latreille informs us, is

                                inhabit both fields and dwelling-houses. The common species (ćr. <hi

                                a pale yellowish or clay colour, mingled with brown. The female
                                bears a long ovipositor, and the male is characterized by his
                                perpetual cry of <hi rend="italic">cree cree,</hi> uttered most
                                continuously during warm weather, or in the vicinity of ovens or
                                large kitchen fires. These insects remain in their retreats during
                                the day, and come forth in the night season to seek their prey. They
                                feed on bread, flour, and other articles of domestic economy.
                                Latreille says they also devour insects. The common cricket is
                                widely distributed over Europe. In Spain it is kept by the peasantry
                                in little cages hung by the fireside, for the sake of its song.</p>
                            <p>The field cricket (G. <hi rend="italic">campestris)</hi> is larger
                                than the preceding. It is of a blackish hue, with the base of the
                                elytra yellowish. The head is large. The posterior thighs are red
                                beneath. The female, during the month of July, lays about three
                                hundred eggs, from which the young are excluded in fifteen days.
                                They feed on herbs and roots, and moult or change their skins before

                                cutting asunder the roots of plants, during the progress of their
                                subterranean excavations. Their natural prey, however, consists of
                                insects and worms. The female of the best known species (ćr. <hi
                                rend="italic">vulgaris,</hi> Lat.) lays from two hundred to four
                                hundred eggs in a commodious dwelling under ground, resembling a
                                bottle with a curved neck. The young dwell together for some time in
                                society. The song of the male is sweet and agreeable.<note

                            <p>1hese insects are herbivorous. They occur in grassy meadows, and on
                                shrubs and trees. In flying they spring into the air, and then
                                extend their capacious wings, but their flight is neither rapid nor
                                long sustained. The cry of the male is sharp and continuous, and is
                                produced by the friction of the elytra. The genus is extensive, and
                                occurs in many countries. They are usually of a brilliant green. One
                                of the best known in Europe (it is also an English species) is the
                                Z. <hi rend="italic">viridissima,</hi> Lat. (Plate CCXXVIII. fig.
                                12). It is about two inches in length, of a fine green colour,
                                without spots. The ovipositor is straight, and of the length of the
                                body. Another species <hi rend="italic">(L. verrucivora,</hi> Fab.)
                                is likewise green, but the elytra are spotted with brown and black.
                                The ovipositor exceeds the length of the abdomen, and is slightly
                                arched. This latter bites pretty severely, and derives its specific
                                name from a practice said to be followed by the Swedes, who allow it
                                to gnaw their warts, which are alleged speedily to disappear, from
                                the action of a black and bilious liquid which escapes from the
                                mouth of the insect during mastication.</p>

                            <p>All the preceding genera of the leaping or saltatorial Orthoptera
                                have this character in common, that the males effect their peculiar
                                cry chiefly by a portion of the elytra, which is discoloured,
                                transparent, and somewhat resembles a mirror or small tambourine.
                                But in the following genera, the stridulation of the male is
                                effected by the friction of the spiny legs against the sides and
                                edges of the elytra and wings. The antennae are sometimes filiform
                                and cylindrical, sometimes sword-shaped, or terminated by a mass,
                                always at least as long as the head and thorax. The ligula in the
                                greater number has only two divisions. There are three simple eyes,
                                the labium is notched, the mandibles much toothed, the abdomen
                                conical and laterally compressed. The tarsi are composed of three
                                articulations, and the female is not furnished with a prolonged
                                ovipositor.. They all leap better than the preceding genera, and
                                have a higher and more sustained flight. They feed on vegetables,
                                and are extremely voracious. They compose the old genus <hi

                                shall briefly detail. The head is largely developed, and supports
                                two rather short antennae, composed of twenty articulations. The
                                true eyes are oval, projecting, and situated on the sides of the
                                head, while the stemmatic cyes, three in number, form a triangle on
                                its summit. The mouth is composed of a large and broad upper lip,
                                slightly notched on its anterior margin; of strong cutting
                                mandibles, irregularly toothed; of maxillae terminated by three
                                teeth, and supporting at the same time the galeae by which they are
                                covered, and a pair of filiform palpi, consisting of five
                                articulations; of an inferior lip, broad, advanced, biful at the
                                extremity, and giving insertion to a pair of filiform palpi of four
                                articulations. The prothorax, of the same breadth as the body,
                                sometimes exhibits superiorly small <hi rend="italic">heels,</hi>
                                which are prolonged transversely on the sides in slight impressions,
                                appearing to indicate the natural divisions of that portion of the
                                thorax. The chest of the mesothorax and metathorax, or rather the
                                sternum, is broad, flattened, and very dissimilar to that of <hi
                                rend="italic">Locusta</hi> (Sauterelles), in which it has the
                                appearance of two triangular foliaceous plates. The elytra are
                                coriaceous, narrow, and as long as the wings, which are large,
                                reticulated, folded like a fan, and frequently ornamented by
                                brilliant shades of red or blue. The legs are of unequal length,—the
                                two anterior pair being of ordinary proportions, while the hindmost
                                are large, and formed for leaping. Many species exhibit on each
                                side, and near the origin of the abdomen, a large cavity, closed
                                interiorly by a thin membranous diaphragm, of a pearly white colour.
                                Latreille regards it as a pneumatic pouch, forming an acoustic
                                instrument. It may no doubt be influential in regulating the sounds
                                uttered by these insects, which, however, are certainly produced in
                                the first place by the alternate friction of the inner face of the
                                hind legs against the surface of the elytra.</p>
                            <p>The females, which are not provided with an exserted ovipositor, lay
                                their eggs in some instances in the ground, in others on the stalks
                                of plants, to which they adhere naturally by a gummy secretion, and
                                are, moreover, enveloped and protected by a frothy matter, which
                                hardens over them, ſhe larvae, the nymphae, and the perfect insects,
                                arc all voracious, and feed on plants. The ravages of locusts are so
                                well known to all readers of foreign travels, and accounts of their
                                desolating inroads have been so frequently extracted, and published
                                in numerous popular works, that a few slight notices of the subject
                                will here suffice.</p>
                            <p>Locusts are of very common occurrence in many parts Qt Africa. Mr
                                Barrow records, that in the southern districts which he visited, the
                                surface of an area of nearly 2000 square miles might literally be
                                said to be covered by them. 1he water of a wide river was scarcely
                                visible, m consequence of the innumerable dead locusts which
                                i°atedonits surface, apparently drowned in their attempts to reach
                                the reeds which grew along its shores. Except these much wished-for
                                reeds, they had devoured every other green thing. Their destruction
                                on a former occasion was sudden and singular. All the full-grown
                                insects were driven into the sea by a tempestuous wind, and were
                                afterwards cast upon the beach, where they formed a bank three or
                                four feet high, and extending <hi rend="italic">nearly fifty English
                                miles.</hi> The smell, as may be easily supposed, was most
                                abominable, and was sensibly felt at the distance of 150 miles. In
                                regard to the lndian locusts, a correspondent of Messrs Kirby and
                                Spence informed these authors, that he was an eye-witness to an
                                immense army of locusts which ravaged the Mahratta country, and was
                                supposed to come all the way from Arabia. This column extended <hi
                                rend="italic">five hundred miles,</hi> and was so compact when its
                                members were upon the wing, as to darken the sun like an eclipse, so
                                that no shadow was cast upon the ground, and some lofty tombs,
                                distant not more than two hundred yards from the observer, were
                                rendered invisible. These were not the <hi rend="italic"

                                rend="italic">(A. migratoriurn,</hi> Plate CCXXVIII. fig. 13), but a
                                red species, the peculiar colour of which is said to have added
                                additional horror to the scene ;—for after having stript the trees
                                of their foliage, they congregated around the bare and desolate
                                branches, producing a hue like blood. When they moved again, “the
                                sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots, and of many
                                horses running to battle.”</p>
                            <p>The migratory flight of these insects, their desolating effects upon
                                vegetation, and consequent injury both to man and beast, have
                                afforded a frequent subject of exercise to the pen of the poet; but
                                by none has their injurious inroads been so magnificently portrayed
                                as by the prophet Joel, “A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day
                                of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the
                                mountains; a great people and a strong: there hath not been ever the
                                like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many
                                generations. A fire devourcth before them, and behind them a flame
                                burncth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind
                                them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them. The
                                appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen
                                so shall they run. Like the noise of chariots on the tops of
                                mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that
                                devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.” “The
                                earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun
                                and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their
                                shining.” “How do the beasts groan ! the herds of cattle are
                                perplexed because they have no pasture; yea, the flock’s of sheep
                                are made desolate.”</p>

                                his friend and fellow poet S. T. Coleridge, has also, in his “wild

                                destroyers.</p>

                                very formidable, and of different kinds. Forskal thinks that the
                                species which chiefly infests that tented region, and which he names
                                <hi rend="italic">Gryllus gregarius,</hi> is distinct from the <hi

                                Arabs to believe that they are produced by the waters of the Persian
                                Gulf. Nejed is particularly exposed to their ravages; and no sooner

                                penetrate by thousands into the dwelling-houses, devouring whatever
                                they can find, even to the leather of the water vessels. They appear
                                in the air at a distance like clouds of smoke; and their near
                                approach, accompanied as by a sound of falling water, stuns the
                                inhabitants with astonishment and dread. They alight upon a field,
                                and its verdure disappears,—the lofty palms are stript or their long
                                shadow-casting leaves,—and pulse and all other succulent crops are
                                voraciously devoured. Grain, however, if ripe, usually escapes, in
                                consequence of its hardness and aridity. The Bedouins of Sinai are
                                frequently driven to despair by the multitudes of these flying
                                vermin, which remain for a period of a month or six weeks before
                                they finally disappear. The time of their arrival is towards the end
                                of the month of May, when the Pleiades are setting,—a coincidence
                                which leads the natives to imagine that locusts entertain a dread of
                                that beautiful constellation. Although a few are visible every year,
                                the great flights are inflicted only every fourth or fifth season.
                                Most of the Arabs, except those of Sinai, are in the habit of eating
                                these insects. “In almost every town there are shops where they are
                                sold by measure. In preparing them, the cook throws them alive into
                                boiling water with which a good deal of salt has been mixed. After a
                                few minutes they are taken out and dried in the sun; the head, feet,
                                and wings are then torn off; the bodies are cleansed from the salt,
                                and perfectly dried, after which they are put up into sacks or bags.
                                Sometimes they are broiled in butter, and spread on the unleavened
                                bread used at breakfast. The Jewish Arabs believe that the food of
                                which the Israelites ate so abundantly in the desert was showers of
                                locusts.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                                several African countries, and are even exported as articles of
                                commerce. The elytra and wings are first cut off, and then the
                                bodies are preserved in brine. M. Miot, in his translation of
                                Herodotus, has observed that the numerous carcasses of <hi

                                above two inches and a half in length. Its usual colour is green,
                                obscurely spotted, the elytra pale brown, marked with black. The
                                mandibles are likewise black, and the thorax is marked by a slightly
                                elevated crest. This species is common in Poland, but occasionally
                                extends its ravages into other European countries. It was very
                                destructive in Provence sb lately as the year 1819. It is well known
                                in the Levant, in Barbary, and Egypt. These countries produce
                                another species, likewise found in the south of France, the <hi

                                The crest of the thorax is intersected by three impressed transverse
                                lines; there is a conical pectoral point between the anterior legs,
                                almost as long as the haunches; and the posterior legs are furnished
                                with reddish spines, black at their extremity. This species is eaten
                                in Barbary. Another kind, native to Senegal and other parts of
                                Africa, of a yellow colour, spotted with black (it is figured by

                                elevated, much compressed, and forming a sharp: crest, rounded and

                        <p>The insects of this order have neither mandibles nor maxillae properly so
                            called. Their mouth is fitted for suction, and is composed of a tubular
                            articulated rostrum, cylindrical or conical, curved inferiorly, or
                            directing itself along the breast, and, when extended, presenting the
                            appearance along its upper surface of an elongated groove or canal, in
                            which are lodged three delicate pointed bristles, covered at their base
                            by a ligula. These bristles form by their union a needle-like sucker, of
                            which the tubular piece just mentioned forms the sheath, in which they
                            are retained by means of the ligula or triangular basal portion. The
                            inferior bristle is in fact composed of two, which unite together not
                            far from their origin, so that the sucker itself consists of four
                            pieces. Savigny is of opinion that the two superior bristles are
                            analogous to the mandibles, and that the inferior represent the
                            maxillae<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                            representing the labrum, and the articulated sheath the labium, of the

                        <p>The elytra of a great portion of the hemipterous order are of a
                            coriaceous texture throughout their principal extent, with their
                            terminations membranous. They thus partake of the nature of both elytra
                            and wings, and the order, as formerly mentioned, derives its name from
                            that peculiarity. Among the Cicadae and the Aphides, however, all the
                            four wings are membranous, and frequently quite clear and transparent.
                            In <hi rend="italic">Tettigonia, Membracis, platlα,</hi> &amp;c. they
                            are of a denser consistence; while in <hi rend="italic">Aleyrodxs</hi>
                            they are farinaceous, and of a milky translucence. Certain kinds are
                            apterous, as the bed-bug, some species of <hi rend="italic"

                            hemipterous order, to which the structure of the mouth shows them to
                            belong.</p>
                        <p>The composition of the thorax in these insects begins to experience some
                            modifications, which exhibit their relation to the ensuing orders. The
                            first segment, or prothorax, in certain cases resembles in extent that
                            of the Coleoptera; but in others it is much more minute, and becomes
                            incorporated with the second segment, which is then manifest or exposed.
                            The scutellum is sometimes extremely small, or altogether imperceptible;
                            while in certain genera, such as <hi rend="italic">Scutellera</hi> and
                            <hi rend="italic">Membracis,</hi> it is greatly dilated, and covers the
                            entire upper surface of the body, concealing the elytra and wings.</p>
                        <p>The sucker, regarded as a sting, and so named by the ancient naturalists,
                            is adapted only for the extraction of animal or vegetable matter in a
                            fluid state. The delicate parts of which it is composed penetrate
                            various organic substances, the nutritive juices of which are forced to
                            flow into the interior canal by successive compressions, till they reach
                            the oesophagus.</p>
                        <p>The antennae of the hemipterous tribes are frequently very small, and of
                            difficult detection. In <hi rend="italic">Psylla,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                            >Cimex,</hi><hi rend="italic">Τhrips,</hi> and others, they are very
                            obvious; in <hi rend="italic">Cicada</hi> they are short, simple,
                            setaceous threads; in <hi rend="italic">Fulgora</hi> they are still
                            shorter and subulated; while in <hi rend="italic">Nepa, Ranatra,</hi>
                            &amp;c. they are placed beneath the eyes, and so abbreviated as to be
                            rendered visible only by reversing the insect.</p>
                        <p>The eyes are rather large, and between them, on the upper part of the
                            head, in many species, there are two or three of the stemmatic kind, or
                            ocelli, called <hi rend="italic">yeux</hi><hi rend="italic"

                        <p>The nature and amount of the tarsal articulations differ according to the
                            genera or tribes; but the greater number of hemipterous insects are
                            characterized by three divisions of the tarsi. In some the anterior
                            tarsi are composed of only a single piece, which is bent upon the leg in
                            the form of a pincer; while in the aquatic genera, such as <hi
                            rend="italic">Naucoris</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Notonecta,</hi> the
                            posterior legs are oar-shaped, with the tarsi composed of two
                            articulations.</p>
                        <p>All hemipterous insects pass as usual through three stages of mutation.
                            But their metamorphosis is not in any case complete, and their changes
                            consist rather in the development of the organs of flight, and the
                            increased bulk of the body, than in any very decided or obvious
                            transformation. Their anatomical structure exhibits a stomach with a
                            rather solid and muscular coat, a small intestine of medium length,
                            succeeded by a large intestine, divided into various swellings, and of a
                            small number of biliary vessels, inserted at some distance from the

                                    size, and are adorned by brilliant colours. The larvae of these
                                    insects do not greatly differ from the perfect state, except in
                                    having neither wings nor elytra. The nymphae possess these
                                    organs in a rudimentary state, inclosed in sheaths. Their
                                    changes of condition are accompanied by a general casting of the
                                    skin. In their various states they exist on vegetable juices,
                                    which they seem as it were to pump up by means of their suckers.
                                    Some species, however, have been seen to attack insects, even
                                    those of their own kind, and suck their softer parts. Almost all
                                    of them exhale a disagreeable and penetrating odour, <pb

                                    are deposited on the stalks of plants, regularly disposed, and
                                    made to adhere by means of a remarkably tenacious liquid. They
                                    are not unfrequently adorned by extremely agreeable colours.</p>
                                <p>A pleasant and curious narrative is given by Degeer, relating to
                                    the female of a species of this genus, the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Cimex griseus</hi> of Linn. He found on a birch tree several of
                                    these females, each followed by a little troop of thirty or
                                    forty young ones, which accompanied their mother as chickens do
                                    a hen. The parents seemed to watch over them with the greatest
                                    solicitude. This is a singular fact in the history of insects,
                                    which for the most part are not personally regardful of the
                                    welfare of their offspring, although they seldom fail
                                    instinctively to deposit their eggs in situations the best
                                    adapted for the sustenance and preservation of the future

                                    many quarters to require particular description. It deposits its
                                    eggs in the month of May. The larvae differ from the perfect
                                    insects in wanting the elytra. This species, though mentioned by
                                    Dioscorides, is said to be not an original inhabitant of Europe.
                                    It is also believed to have been unknown in London prior to the
                                    great fire in 1666, after which calamity it was transported
                                    thither in timber from America. It is said sometimes to acquire
                                    wings, and infest young pigeons, swallows, and other birds.
                                    Latreille however is of opinion that the kind attached to the

                                    covers’itself with ordure, or the sweepings of apartments, and,

                                    linear. Their eyes are large and globular, and are placed
                                    towards the centre of the lateral parts of the muzzle, or rather
                                    muzzle-shaped head. The best known species is <hi rend="italic"
                                    >H.</hi><hi rend="italic">stagnorum,</hi> which measures about
                                    five lines in length. It is of a black or blackish-brown colour,
                                    with the feet of a redder hue. The elytra are very short, with
                                    two nervures on each. This species is common throughout Europe.
                                    The <hi rend="italic">H. fossarum</hi> of Fab. is a native of
                                    the East Indies. We are inclined to regard it as belonging to
                                    the next genus.</p>

                                    Rostrum with three articulations. Anterior feet serving the
                                    office of pincers. Second pair distant from the anterior, and as
                                    long again as the body. (Plate CCXXIX. fig. 9.)</p>
                                <p>These insects have elongated bodies, are usually of a blackish
                                    colour, and are met with on the surface of still waters, on
                                    which they advance as it were by starts. Their under surface
                                    seems covered by a peculiar coating, of a black or silvery hue,
                                    according to the position in which the insect is held, and which
                                    probably protects it from the influence of the subjacent liquid.
                                    They appear rather to row than to walk upon the surface. The
                                    species are insectivorous, and prey upon such of their own class
                                    as they can master, and especially upon any land species that
                                    have fallen accidentally into the water, and are naturally
                                    inactive in that element. These they immediately seize upon with
                                    their anterior feet. The <hi rend="italic">G. lacustris,</hi>
                                    Lat. <hi rend="italic">(Hydrometra lacustris,</hi> Fab.),
                                    figured on the plate above referred to, is of a blackish-brown
                                    colour, greenish above. The feet are brown. The body is
                                    terminated by a projection. This species presents some
                                    peculiarities worthy of notice. There are two varieties of it,
                                    one of which is winged, the other apterous. The former of these

                                    all apterous, but resemble perfect insects in every other part
                                    of their structure. Sexual intercourse takes place among them.
                                    It was this latter circumstance which induced Geoffroy to
                                    believe that they offered a remarkable exception to a general
                                    rule, and that fecundation took place in the state of nymph or
                                    larva. Degeer, in combating this opinion, maintained that these
                                    apterous insects were of a distinct kind, and perfect in their
                                    way. Μ. Audouin, on the other hand, is or opinion that they may
                                    be regarded as individuals of the ordinary kind, proceeding from
                                    larvae of the preceding year, of which the development has been
                                    checked by the rigours of the winter season, and the consequent
                                    condition of torpidity. He conceives that the wings are not, in
                                    these aquatic insects, organs of the first importance, and that
                                    the influence of surrounding causes is on that account the more
                                    likely to prove effectual, and that thus they remain
                                    rudimentary, when the other parts of the body, and the
                                    generative system in particular, have at-1 tained the maximum of
                                    their development. He illustrates this point by reference to the
                                    genera <hi rend="italic">Lampyris</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                                <p>The body in this genus is almost elliptical, and narrower and
                                    more elongated than in the preceding genera. The head is small,
                                    and partly lodged in a notch of the thorax. The setae, which
                                    terminate the abdomen, serve, according to some authors, for the
                                    purposes of respiration m the moist and muddy places in which
                                    they dwell. The Nepae, i∏ their various states, inhabit the
                                    quiet waters of ponds, lakes, and marshes. They swim more
                                    leisurely than many of their congeners, and often proceed along
                                    the surface of the mud below, in search of the minute insects of
                                    which they make their prey, and which they seize with their
                                    anterior feet. Their eggs are of an oval form, and, when
                                    examined with a microscope, are seen to be crowned by an
                                    aigrette of seven small threads. Swammerdam anatomized these
                                    insects, and has given us some curious details regarding the
                                    arrangement of the eggs in the ovaries. 1hey are so disposed
                                    that the crown-like threads of the one which is next the orifice
                                    embraces the one which follows, and so on consecutively. The
                                    generative system of the male is singular, and very complicated.
                                    The larvae leave the eggs in midsummer. They differ from the
                                    perfect insects chiefly in wanting the wings and setae. The
                                    nymphs acquire, as usual, rudimentary wings inclosed in sheaths,
                                    and placed on each side of the body. The perfect insect
                                    frequently quits its subaqueous abode during the dewy night, and
                                    flies about with great agility. The genus is by no means
                                    numerous in species, although these seem pretty extensively
                                    distributed over the waters of the earth.</p>

                                    to offer the vestiges of a pulmonary organ. They consist of two
                                    oblong bodies, placed immediately below the region of the
                                    scutellum, clothed by a fine membrane, smooth, and white as
                                    satin. They are almost as long as the chest, free except at
                                    their extremities, and are filled with a substance like tow,
                                    which, when examined under the microscope, presents a
                                    homogeneous tissue, formed by vascular arbusculae. The nervous
                                    system appears to consist of two large ganglions, the one placed
                                    beneath the oesophagus, the other in the chest betwixt the first
                                    and second pair of feet, and throwing out two remarkable cords,
                                    divided into two or three threads at their extremities. Only two

                                <p>The Notonectae properly so called are characterized by the

                                    bodies somewhat inclined, their heads being elevated during
                                    their upward progress, and the contrary while they either rest
                                    suspended at the surface or descend towards the bottom of the
                                    pool. When these insects are in the act of swimming, they make
                                    use only of the middle and posterior pairs of legs, the anterior
                                    being applied closely to the chest; but when they walk at the
                                    bottom, or over the herbage of aquatic plants, in search of
                                    insect prey, they then bring the latter into active service, and
                                    merely trail the former after them, or alongside. The females
                                    deposit their eggs, which are long and white, on the stalks and
                                    foliage of water-plants. The young are produced in spring, and
                                    resemble the perfect insects, except in the want of wings. The
                                    nymphae are equally active, and exhibit these organs in a
                                    rudimentary state. They are all, of whatever sex, age, or
                                    condition, predaceous in their disposition, and, in the absence
                                    of more ordinary food, will seize upon and cruelly devour their
                                    own species. We are acquainted with about a dozen of the genus,
                                    of which about a third inhabit Europe. The others occur in Asia,
                                    Africa, and America. The most familiarly known in this country

                                <p>The genera composing this family present three articulations in
                                    the tarsi,—the antennae are usually very small, conical or
                                    awl-shaped, and consist of from three to six portions, including
                                    the attenuated seta by which they are terminated. We owe to MM.
                                    Ramdhor, Marcel de Serres, Leon Dufour, and Straus, many
                                    excellent observations on the internal structure of these
                                    insects. According to Dufour, the stomach, or chylific
                                    ventricle, is of remarkable length. It commences by an oblong
                                    dilatation, either curved or straight, and decreases into’ an
                                    intestini-form canal, which returns upon itself, and opens near
                                    the origin of the ventricle, alongside the insertion of the
                                    hepatic vessels, and not far from the origin of the intestine.
                                    They are all provided with four biliary vessels. In the Cicadae
                                    the ventricle has what Dufour calls “la forme d’une anse,” the
                                    right portion being dilated into a large lateral, and frequently
                                    plaited pouch. Its superior extremity is united to the
                                    oesophagus by an upper ligament, and the other leads to the
                                    narrow, tubular, very long, reflexed prolongation, with the form
                                    of an intestine, which, after its circumvolutions, re-ascends to
                                    unite with the pouch near the insertion of the hepatic vessels.
                                    This truly singular disposition of the chylific ventricle,
                                    which, after several convolutions, finally disgorges into
                                    itself, by the completion of a circle traversed throughout by
                                    the alimentary fluid, is doubtless a circumstance not easily
                                    explained in a physiological point of view. It is, however, <pb

                                <p>These insects differ from those that follow, not only in the
                                    structure of the antennae and the amount of the simple
                                    orstemmatic eyes, but also in their being all destitute of the
                                    faculty of leaping. The males are musical, that is, during the
                                    heat of summer, they produce, by a peculiar structure, a loud
                                    and continuous cry or stridulation, called by courtesy a song.
                                    When we examine the lateral base of the abdomen of a male
                                    Cicada, we perceive two large sealyplates of a rounded figure,
                                    approaching that of a demi-oval cut through its smaller axis; so
                                    that each plate presents a side which is rectilinear, while the
                                    remaining portion exhibits a rounded outline. It is by the
                                    straight side that each plate is fixed without articulation, on
                                    the metathorax, of which it forms a portion. When we lift up
                                    these plates we discover a cavity on each side of the abdomen,
                                    divided into two principal chambers by a horny triangular
                                    septum. When viewed from the side of the abdomen, each cell
                                    presents anteriorly a white and plaited membrane; and lower down
                                    there is another membrane, thin, light, and transparent as
                                    glass, called Ze <hi rend="italic">miroir</hi> by Réaumur. Some
                                    authors have regarded this as a kind of drum or tambour, and the
                                    seat of sound; but that organ has yet to be described. If we
                                    open the mirror from above, we perceive on each side of it
                                    another plaited membrane, moved by a very powerful muscle,
                                    composed of a great number of straight parallel fibres, and
                                    arising from the horny septum. This latter membrane is the
                                    tymbal or drum, on which the muscles act by contraction and
                                    relaxation, alternately tightening and restoring it to its
                                    original state. This is the true origin of the sound, which in
                                    fact may be produced even after the death of the insect, by
                                    jerking the muscle.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                                    M. Chabrier has perceived a stigmatic opening, not noticed by
                                    Réaumur, at the inferior junction of the mesothorax and
                                    metathorax; while Latreille has discovered on the posterior part
                                    of each tymbal a distinct hdle, which, he thinks, serves for the
                                    egress of the air. Chabrier, however, is of opinion that the air
                                    makes its escape through the two stigmata placed at the base of
                                    the opercula before mentioned.<note anchored="true"

                                    already recognised, though much more feebly developed, not only
                                    in the female Cicadae, but also in certain species of the

                                <p>The Cicadae dwell on shrubs and trees, of which they suck the
                                    juices. 1he females, which are provided with ovipositors, lay
                                    their eggs in holes, which they form in the small branches or
                                    twigs of trees. The parts thus attacked are easily recognised by
                                    little irregularities, formed by a portion of the wood which has
                                    been raised. These elevations are placed in a row, one after the
                                    other, upon the same side of the branch. The different holes
                                    have a diameter nearly equal. Their depth is from three to four
                                    lines. They commence in an oblique direction; but as soon as
                                    they reach the pith, they become nearly parallel with the twig
                                    itself. The ovipositor does not pierce be- , yond the pith; and
                                    the number of eggs placed in each liole varies from four to ten.
                                    They are white, oblong, and pointed at both ends. The larvae are
                                    white, and furnished with six feet. They soon quit their sylvan
                                    nurseries, and make their way under ground, where they gnaw the
                                    roots of plants. Their anterior legs are short, with strong
                                    dentated thighs, and are well adapted for digging. They increase
                                    rapidly in size, and are ere long transformed into nymphs. These
                                    are of a dingy-white colour, and are chiefly remarkable for
                                    their very short and inflated fore legs, which are dentated, and
                                    serve them to penetrate the earth. After living for about a year
                                    in this state, they leave the groupd during the prevalence of
                                    warm weather, and, climbing up the stems of trees, their skin
                                    first hardens, and then bursts all along the centre of the
                                    dorsal line. The perfect insect then escapes from its exuviae.
                                    It is at first very soft, and of a greenish colour; but it soon
                                    attains a firmer consistence, and various external markings make
                                    their appearance, according to the characteristic aspect of the
                                    different kinds.</p>
                                <p>These insects were well known to ancient writers, and their
                                    so-called song has been celebrated by poets from the highest
                                    antiquity. To ourselves it appeared monotonous and fatiguing,
                                    although heard not seldom among the leafy groves which shadow
                                    the fair white walls of the “Etrurian Athens.” The Cicada is the
                                    insect so frequently and fondly commemorated by the Greek poets
                                    under the name of r⅛mξ,—which our translators have generally
                                    though erroneously construed <hi rend="italic">grasshopper.</hi>
                                    Linnaeus, with his accustomed propriety, applied the term <hi
                                    rend="italic">Gryllus</hi> to the locust and grasshopper tribes,
                                    and that of Cicada to the “beloved of the Athenians.” The name
                                    of tree grasshopper, however, which is sometimes used, applies
                                    with sufficient accuracy to the latter, and indicates one of its
                                    characteristic habits, that of usually perching upon trees. The
                                    true grasshoppers are ground insects. The Cicadae are scarcely
                                    known in Britain, although the species attached to ash-trees
                                    (ċľ. <hi rend="italic">orni)</hi> is recorded as an English
                                    insect, in common with <hi rend="italic">C. hoematodes.</hi>
                                    They abound in Italy and other southern parts of Europe. The
                                    Italians call them <hi rend="italic">Cicale</hi> and the French
                                    <hi rend="italic">Cigales,</hi> both words being no doubt
                                    derived from the Latin. They are frequently mentioned by the
                                    modern Italian poets; and Lord Byron somewhere alludes to the
                                    “shrill Cigala, people of the pines,” thus recognising their <hi
                                    rend="italic">arboreous</hi> disposition. Although held in the
                                    highest estimation as <hi rend="italic">children of the
                                    soil</hi> by the Athenians, who used to wear golden images of
                                    them in their hair, there is no doubt that they were also
                                    regarded by the Greek nations under a less intellectual aspect.
                                    Aristotle mentions that they were used as food, and that they
                                    were particularly esteemed just before <pb break="no"

                                    under the name of <hi rend="italic">Tettigometra,</hi> or mother
                                    of the Cicadae, is in fact merely that intermediate condition of
                                    nymph, prior to the development of the organs of flight. In that
                                    state, as well as when under the form of larva, it lives upon
                                    the ground, or even beneath it, feeding on herbage and the roots
                                    of plants;.but when about to undergo its final metamorphosis, it
                                    climbs a tree, its outer garment bursts asunder and is thrown
                                    off as exuviae, the wings expand their folds “voluminous and
                                    vast,” and we have then the perfect insect or tree grasshopper,
                                    the Cicada of the Latins, and Tettix of the Greeks, so
                                    beautifully addressed by Anacreon :— . ,</p>

                                    Fleshless, bloodless, passionless, thou almost art a god.</p>
                                <p>A great variety of opinion seems to prevail regarding the musical
                                    accomplishments of these celebrated insects. Virgil accused the
                                    Italian Cicadae of bursting the very shrubs with their noise—“Et
                                    cantu querulae rumpent arbusta Cicadae;” and Dr Shaw in his
                                    Travels calls it, alluding to its shrilly cry, “the most
                                    troublesome and impertinent of insects.” Kirby and Spence tell
                                    us that in some countries it is execrated for its deafening din.
                                    Yet some one who desired to compliment Plato, asserted that his
                                    voice was as sweet as a grasshopper’s; and we may all remember
                                    the story of the rival musicians (Eunomus and Ariston), one of
                                    whom gained the victory in consequence of a Cicada settling on
                                    his harp, and supplying the place of a broken string. Even at
                                    this day the song of the <hi rend="italic">Tettigonia</hi><hi
                                    rend="italic">Tibicen</hi> of Surinam is supposed so greatly to
                                    resemble the sound of a musical instrument, that the insect
                                    itself is called the <hi rend="italic">Harper.</hi> The
                                    following is Mr Elton’s translation of Meleager’s
                                    invocation.</p>
                                <p>0 shrill-voiced insect ! that with dew drops sweet, Inebriate,
                                    dost in desert woodlands sing ;</p>
                                <p>Perched in the spray-top with indented feet, Thy dusky body’s
                                    echoings harp-like ring: Come, dear Cicada ! chirp to all the
                                    grove, The Nymphs and Pan, a new responsive strain; That I, in
                                    noonday sleep, may steal from love, Reclined beneath the dark

                                <p>We shall here conclude our general sketch of these insects by
                                    observing that the substance used in medicine, and known by the
                                    name of <hi rend="italic">manna,</hi> is an exudation from
                                    certain species of ash <hi rend="italic">(^Fraxinus</hi><hi

                                    rend="italic">ornus^</hi> which flourish in the south of Europe.
                                    It has been observed to be frequently produced by the puncturing
                                    of the Cicadae, which feed on the juices of those saccharine
                                    trees. The largest insect of the genus in Europe is <hi
                                    rend="italic">C. plebeia</hi> of Linn. Its cry is very strong
                                    and shrill; and as it is well known in Italy, there can be no
                                    doubt of its being the species mentioned by Virgil. If identical
                                    with the Athenian Cicada, its voice does certainly by no means
                                    correspond in musical intonation to what might be inferred from
                                    its recoided character as a lyrist among the ancient Greeks. The
                                    pleasure produced may however depend upon association; for, as
                                    Cowper says/</p>
                                <p>Sounds inharmonious in themselves, and harsh, <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Yet heard in scenes where peace for ever reigns, And only
                                    there,</hi> please highly for their sake.</p>
                                <p>It is said that the males alone are musical, which may perhaps be
                                    one reason for their continued cheerfulness; for, as the Rhodian
                                    Xenarchus has it,</p>
                                <p>Happy the Cicadas’ lives,</p>
                                <p>Since they all have voiceless wives.</p>
                                <p>The amount of species in the genus Cicada is considerable. They
                                    are spread over almost all the regions of the earth, especially
                                    in the warmer latitudes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                                    France and Italy. It is about an inch long, yellowish, paler
                                    beneath, but mixed with black on the upper portions. The margins
                                    of the abdominal segments are reddish. There are two rows of

                                    far as that of several other species. This is the kind which, by

                                    species of wild ash), causes a peculiar and honey-like fluid to
                                    flow from it. It afterwards dries and hardens, and in that state
                                    is used medicinally under the name of manna. The C. <hi

                                    France. It is black, with some spots on the first segment of the

                                <p><hi rend="italic">F. laternaria,</hi> Linn, is a large and
                                    remarkable insect from South America, drawn and described in
                                    most illustrated works on entomology. Its muzzle is nearly
                                    straight as to its direction from the head, but it is vesicular
                                    and inflated, or swollen out and rounded, at the sides and
                                    extremity. The ends of the under wings are pleasantly varied
                                    with black and yellow, in the form of an expanded spot,
                                    resembling the eye of a peacock’s feather. Madame Merian informs
                                    us, that from the head or front of this species a light is seen
                                    to shine during the darker hours, so clear and brilliant that it
                                    is easy to read by its rays. She adds, that during the day it is
                                    transparent as a bladder, and radiated with red and green. The
                                    indefatigable and accurate Réaumur, desirous to ascertain by
                                    anatomical investigation the proximate cause of this curious
                                    phenomenon, opened one of these vesicular expansions, buthe
                                    found it empty, except of air, and containing no organic
                                    structure. We must bear in mind, however, that the individual
                                    examined was in a state of desiccation. The species is common at
                                    Guadaloupe and Cayenne, where it is known by the name of
                                    fire-fly. It flies well, and hovers habitually about the summits
                                    of the tallest trees. Its luminous faculty has been sometimes
                                    called in question, especially by M. Richard, who captured many
                                    at Cayenne, but never saw them shine. Yet the testimony of
                                    Madame Merian, and the general application to the species of the

                                    however, that the phosphoric emanation from this and other
                                    species is only perceptible at certain seasons of the year, and
                                    this consideration may explain the discrepancy arising from M.

                                <p>FAMILY II.—APHIDII.</p>
                                <p>These singular insects are distinguished from those of the
                                    preceding family by the tarsi, which have only two
                                    articulations, and by the antennae, filiform or setaceous,
                                    longer than the head, and composed of from six to eleven
                                    articulations. Such as possess organs of flight have always two
                                    elytra and a pair of wings. The species are usually very
                                    small,—their bodies generally of a soft consistence, the elytra
                                    and wings nearly alike, or differing merely in size and
                                    thickness. They lay a prodigious number of eggs, and their mode
                                    of production is in other respects very remarkable.</p>
                                <p>In some the antennae consist of from ten to eleven articulations,
                                    of which the last is terminated by a couple of setae. These are
                                    leaping insects, and compose the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                    >Psylla</hi> of Geoffroy <hi rend="italic">ÇChermes,</hi>

                                    from the true Aphides after mentioned. They live on trees and
                                    various plants, by the juices of which they are nourished. Both
                                    sexes are winged. The body of the larvae is usually very flat,
                                    the head large, the abdomen rounded posteriorly. Their feet are
                                    terminated by a small membranous vesicle, furnished beneath with
                                    a couple of hooks. The nymphs are distinguishable by four broad
                                    flat dorsal portions, which constitute the sheaths of the
                                    incipient wings and elytra. Several species are covered during
                                    both of those immature conditions <pb break="no"

                                    species, by the wounds which they occasion to plants while
                                    sucking their juices, occasion the growth of peculiar
                                    excrescences on the buds and leaves, resembling gallnuts. Of

                                    dwells among rushes (Plate CCXXIX. fig. 17). The antennae are
                                    much thicker near the base than towards the extremity.</p>
                                <p>In other Aphidii the antennae have only from six to eight
                                    articulations, of which the last is not terminated by a couple
                                    of setae. .</p>
                                <p>Some have the elytra and wings linear, fringed with hairs, and
                                    placed horizontally upon the body, which is of an almost
                                    cylindrical form. The rostrum is very small or indistinct. The
                                    tarsi are terminated by a vesicular article, unfurnished with
                                    hooks. The antennae consist of eight granular articulations.
                                    Such are the species which form the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                    >Thrips</hi> of Linn. (Plate CCXXIX. fig. 18). These insects are
                                    very small, extremely active, and seem to leap rather than fly.
                                    When teazed, they raise and recurve the extremity of the
                                    abdomen, after the manner of the Staphylinidae. They live among
                                    flowers and other parts of plants, and beneath the bark of
                                    trees. We may add, that although Latreille did not perceive in
                                    the organization of the mouth of these insects any characters
                                    essentially different from such as distinguish that organ among
                                    the other component parts of the homopterous Hemiptera,-yet M.
                                    Straus, who has studied the subject very laboriously, and with
                                    his wonted intelligence, is of opinion that the genus Thrips
                                    belongs in fact to the orthopterous order.</p>
                                <p>Others have the elytra and wings oval or triangular, without
                                    fringe, and inclined or tectiform. The rostrum is distinct. The
                                    tarsi are terminated by two hooks. The antennae consist of from
                                    six to seven articulations. Such are the species which compose
                                    the great genus <hi rend="italic">Aphis of</hi> Linn, which is
                                    now divisible as follows.</p>
                                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Aphis</hi> properly so called,
                                    the antennae are longer than the thorax, of seven articulations,
                                    of which the third is elongated. The eyes are entire, and the
                                    abdomen is furnished with two horn-like projections at its
                                    posterior extremity. The species dwell together in society on
                                    various trees and plants, of which they suck the juices. They
                                    walk very leisurely, and cannot leap. The two horn-like
                                    processes just mentioned are hollow tubes, from which a drop of
                                    transparent liquid frequently exudes. It partakes of the
                                    property of sugar, and is much sought after by ants, who suck it
                                    with avidity from the living Aphides. This curious fact was
                                    first noticed by M. Boissier de Sauvages, and has since been
                                    amply confirmed by Μ. P. Huber. The desired liquor seems to be
                                    given out voluntarily by the aphis, when solicited so to do by a
                                    gentle tap from the ant’s antennae. A single aphis may be

                                    and the obstruction of the natural pores, is consequently great.
                                    Réaumur calculates, that in the course of five generations, a

                                    multitudes of small oval or rounded bodies resembling scales,
                                    adhering closely to the wood, and presenting no indications of
                                    any external organs. These aiae insects of the genus Coccus, the
                                    <hi rend="italic">progallinsectes</hi> of Réaumur. Their history
                                    was for a long period extremely obscure, and the species
                                    employed in commerce was even at one time regarded as a kind of
                                    grain. It was only towards the termination of the seventeenth
                                    century that Μ. Plumier clearly established their insect origin.
                                    We are indebted to Réaumur for a complete history of the life
                                    and transformations of the European kinds. The larvae of both
                                    males and females, on first quitting the egg, are tolerably
                                    active, and run about among the leaves and branches. They are,
                                    however, so extremely small at that period, as not to be
                                    distinctly discernible without the aid of a microscope. They are
                                    flat, ovular, apterous, with short and indistinctly articulated
                                    antennae. The males have no apparent organs of manducation,
                                    although the females are furnished with a small, extremely
                                    short, almost conical beak, inserted between the first and
                                    second pair of feet, nearly perpendicular in its direction, and
                                    composed of a four-jointed sheath containing a sucker of three
                                    pieces. It is with this instrument that they pump the juices of
                                    the leaves and tender stems. They also fix themselves from time
                                    to time for the purpose of changing their skin, and after
                                    arriving at a certain size, they become definitely fixed in some
                                    chosen spot, usually at the bifurcation of a branch, where they
                                    form a little nest, protected by a tapestry of cotton. They then
                                    attain the perfect state, and are apterous (we speak of the
                                    females) even in that otherwise complete condition. Their head
                                    is semicircular, their mouth is still formed of the beak which
                                    existed in the larva state, and the eyes are small. The thorax
                                    is not easily distinguished from the abdomen, the segments of
                                    which are distinct. When the insect has attained its full
                                    growth, its abdomen is found filled with a multitude of minute
                                    eggs. The larvae of the males, though by no means rare, are much
                                    less numerous than those of the other sex. Their mode of
                                    sustenance, owing to the want of the sucker, is not distinctly
                                    known; but they increase in size, and after a time their skin
                                    hardens, and serves as a cocoon, in which they undergo their
                                    transformation to the nympha state. In the latter condition they
                                    are remarkable for the anterior pair of legs being directed
                                    forwards. Towards the beginning of spring these eocoons open at
                                    their posterior portion, and the perfect male insect comes forth
                                    stern foremost. It is of a more elongated form, with a round
                                    head furnished with two small eyes and a pair of rather long
                                    antennae. The thorax is rounded, and has attached to it a pair
                                    of long wings, folded horizontally one over the other, and very
                                    delicately veined. (For a male Coccus see Plate CCXXIX. fig. 16;
                                    the fe male is shown by figures 21 and 22). The male is less
                                    thank the female, and more active, although it uses its wings
                                    very ! sparingly. As soon as it attains the perfect state, it
                                    sets off in search of the other sex, which still remains fixed
                                    in <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> the nest, as formerly
                                    mentioned. The oviposition of the female is another remarkable
                                    peculiarity in the history of these insects. Though excluded
                                    from the body, the eggs do not appear externally, but are made
                                    to pass beneath the abdomen, and between it and the cotton
                                    tapestry above alluded to. In proportion as the insect becomes
                                    empty, the lower surface of the abdomen approaches the upper
                                    one, so as to leave beneath the body a kind of arch or cavity
                                    for the reception of the eggs. The perfect female never stirs a
                                    step in the course of her life, but having laid her eggs she
                                    dies, and her body shŗivels up and hardens, and thus forms a
                                    cocoon or covering for the incipient young. These, as soon as
                                    hatched, work their way from beneath the dead body of their
                                    parent, making their escape by its posterior extremity.</p>
                                <p>These curious insects are certainly hurtful to vegetation, by
                                    causing a too abundant transudation of their juices; and they
                                    consequently excite the jealousy of those who cultivate the
                                    finer trees, such as the peach, the orange, the olive, and the
                                    fig. Certain species attack also the roots of plants. But, upon
                                    the whole, the advantages which we derive from this genus of
                                    insect amply counterbalance whatever injuries it may
                                    occasionally inflict upon us. The species are very numerous. We
                                    shall here notice only a few of the more remarkable.</p>
                                <p>Of the kind called Kermes, is that known to naturalists by the
                                    name of <hi rend="italic">Coccus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                                    >Ilicis,</hi> of which the female attains to the size and form
                                    of a pea. It is of a violet-black colour, covered by a whitish
                                    powder. This species is common over the south of Europe on the
                                    evergreen oak, and appears to be widely distributed over many of
                                    the southeastern countries of the ancient world. It occurs
                                    abundantly in Spain, where it attaches itself chiefly to the
                                    twigs and leaves of a small species of spiny-leaved oak,
                                    frequent in the southern parts of that romantic kingdom,
                                    especially on the slopes of the Sierra Morena. Many of the
                                    inhabitants of Murcia have no other means of subsistence than
                                    those procured by collecting the Kermes. Women are usually so
                                    employed, and they scrape the adhesive insects from the trees by
                                    means of their nails. Though supplanted over the greater portion
                                    of Europe by the introduction of the more famous cochineal (Cbcm

                                    According to Beckman, the epithet <hi rend="italic"
                                    >vermiculatum</hi> was applied to it during the middle ages,
                                    when its insect origin came to be generally understood, and
                                    hence is derived our English word vermilion. The French term <hi
                                    rend="italic">cramoisi</hi> is evidently from the Arabic. It is
                                    supposed to have been by means of this substance that the

                                    regarded by Dr Bancroft as identical with that of cochineal, but
                                    combined with some astringent matter derived from the tree on
                                    which it feeds. _</p>
                                <p>The substance called <hi rend="italic">lac</hi> is also the
                                    produce of an insect of the Coccus kind. It is collected from
                                    various trees in India, where it is used in the fabrication of
                                    beads, rings, and other ornaments of female attire. When mixed
                                    with sand it forms grindstones; and, added to ivory black, and
                                    previously dissolved in water with a little borax, it composes
                                    an ink which, when dry, is said to be capable of resisting a
                                    considerable degree of damp or moisture. In this country,
                                    according to the different states in which it is imported, it is
                                    called stick-lac, seed-lac, lump-lac, or shell-lac. It is
                                    chiefly used in the making of varnishes, japanned ware, and
                                    sealing-wax, although during late years it has been applied to a
                                    still more important purpose, as originally suggested by Dr
                                    Roxburgh, that of a substitute for cochineal in dyeing scarlet.
                                    The first preparations from it with this view were made in
                                    consequence of a hint from Dr Bancroft; and large quantities of
                                    a substance termed <hi rend="italic">lαe-lαhe,</hi> consisting
                                    of the colouring matter of stick-lac, precipitated from an
                                    alkaline lixivium by alum, were manufactured at Calcutta, and
                                    sent to this country, where at first the consumption was so
                                    considerable, that in the three years previous to 1810 the sales
                                    at the India house equalled in point of colouring matter half a
                                    million of pounds weight of cochineal.<note anchored="true"

                                    was alum, and the colour communicated was blood-red; but Dr
                                    Bancroft ascertained, that with the solution of tin used with
                                    cochineal it was capable of imparting as brilliant a scarlet as
                                    that dye, and one perhaps more permanent. It must be borne in
                                    mind, however, that as ten or twelve pounds of kermes contain no
                                    more colouring matter than a single pound of cochineal, the
                                    latter at its ordinary price is, after all, the cheapest.</p>
                                <p>Several other curious and valuable products arc obtained from
                                    insects belonging to the genus Coccus, or to one nearly allied
                                    in its natural character and attributes. The <hi rend="italic"
                                    >pe-la,</hi> for example,, or white wax of the Chinese, is
                                    derived from an insect, apparently a Coccus, described by the
                                    AbbéGrozier; and a non-descript Indian species produces a wax
                                    analogous to pe la, first noticed by Dr Anderson under, the name
                                    of white lac. It is obtained in great quantities in the vicinity
                                    of Madras; but Dr Pearson’s experiments do not countenance the
                                    idea, at one time rather sanguinely entertained, that it might
                                    be advantageously used for making candles.<note anchored="true"

                                    figs. 16, 21, 22). This species, so important in a commercial
                                    point of view, and in relation to our arts and manufactures, is
                                    a native of Mexico where it was assiduously cultivated at a
                                    period long anterior to the European conquest of that country.
                                    We shall not describe its appearance, as that will be better
                                    understood by an inspection of the figures just referred to.
                                    There are several varieties, named in general from the provinces
                                    where they are bred; and of these, that called Mastique or
                                    Mêsteque is regarded as the best. It is cultivated on a tree
                                    called Nopal by the Indians <hi rend="italic">(Cactus
                                    cochenilifer,</hi> Linn.) and its colour is by some attributed
                                    to the juices of that plant. It is the female insect that is so
                                    highly valued for the incomparable beauty of its colour. It is
                                    imported to Europe in the form of a little grain, convex on one
                                    side, concave on the other, and exhibiting traces of the
                                    abdominal segments. In the year 1736 there was sent to Europe
                                    about 700,000 pounds weight of this minute creature, a quantity
                                    worth L.700,000 sterling. Humboldt states the quantity imported
                                    about the period of his inquiries to have been 32,000 arrobas,

                                    consumption of cochineal in Great Britain at about 750 bags, or
                                    150,000 pounds weight,—worth L.375,000 sterling at recent
                                    prices. The natives of those districts in which the cochineal is
                                    reared form plantations of the nopal tree near their
                                    dwellinghouses. It grows freely from cuttings, and the latter
                                    are fit for the reception of the insect in eighteen months.
                                    Eight orten females are put into a small nest formed of tufts of
                                    a thread-like substance collected from a species of palm, <pb

                                    spines of the nopal, upon the side facing the rising sun, and
                                    the insects are placed in them about the middle of October, a
                                    period at which good weather usually commences in Mexicoafter
                                    the rains. The eggs are soon laid and hatched, and the progeny
                                    spread in vast numbers over the plant, each female producing
                                    upwards of a thousand young. According to Μ. Thierry de

                                    destruction produced among them by the periodical rains. The
                                    first collection takes place about the middle of December, and
                                    the last in the month of May. They are detached by means of a
                                    knife with the edge blunted, to prevent injury to the nopal
                                    tree. When the first gathering is made, the nests are taken
                                    away, and the dead females (those placed on the nopal in
                                    October) are likewise picked off. These are lighter and less
                                    valuable than such as are taken off alive and full of young; the
                                    former losing three fourths, the latter two thirds, during the

                                    put them in a basket, which they dip in boiling water, and
                                    afterwards dry them by exposure to the sun; others place them in
                                    an oven, or on plates of heated iron. The various external
                                    colours of the insect, as we afterwards see it in Europe, depend
                                    upon the mode of putting it to death. Those which have been
                                    killed by being dipt in hot water (the method regarded as the
                                    best), lose a portion of the white powder with which they were
                                    previously invested, and acquire a brownish-red colour. When so
                                    treated, they pass under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                                    >renagrida.</hi> When killed in an oven they retain the white
                                    powder, remain externally of a grey colour, and are <hi
                                    rend="italic">caWĉAjarpeada.</hi> Such as are placed on plates
                                    of heated iron become of a blackish hue, and are then named <hi
                                    rend="italic">negra.</hi> When cochineal insects are forced from
                                    the tree, they speedily die, even if no further violence is
                                    offered them; because their sucker, being fixed in the wood, is
                                    unavoidably dislocated and broken off by the act of removal. It
                                    is necessary, however, to put them to death, because they might
                                    otherwise live for a short time, and meanwhile produce their
                                    young, the loss of which would diminish the quantity of
                                    colouring matter.</p>
                                <p>The other most frequent variety of cochineal is called <hi
                                    rend="italic">sylvester</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi>
                                    on account of its being commonly collected from a species of
                                    cattus which grows wild, or without culture. It is of smaller
                                    size, and much less valuable in relation both to the amount and
                                    quality of the colour which it yields. We have not yet
                                    ascertained to our own satisfaction whether it is a mere variety
                                    or a distinct species. Although it occurs naturally upon a wild
                                    spiny cactus, it is also cultivated upon the nopal or garden
                                    species, for the sake of the greater facility of collection. So
                                    great indeed is the difference in this point, that in one day a
                                    single labourer will gather from the latter a quantity which,
                                    when dry, will amount to the weight of three pounds,—whereas
                                    from the former the most persevering hand will not obtain in
                                    that time much more than a couple of ounces. Moreover, when
                                    cultivated on the garden nopal, the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >sylvester</hi> cochineal attains to as large a size as the <hi

                                <p>Various attempts have been made to introduce the culture of the
                                    cochineal into our eastern possessions, although these, so far
                                    as we are informed, have not yet been attended with any marked
                                    success. The old Spanish government manifested great jealousy on
                                    the subject; and we are not aware that the true kind has been
                                    yet imported, although the court of directors at one period
                                    offered a reward of L.6000 to whoever should effect its
                                    introduction to India. Colonel Bory St Vincent informs us that
                                    attempts have recently been made, and with a fair prospect of
                                    success, to effect its cultivation near Malaga, in Spain.<note

                                    sketch by observing that considerable care is requisite to
                                    preserve these insects from the attacks of their natural
                                    enemies, of which one of the chief is the larva of a species of
                                    Coccinella, which sucks them to death, and leaves nothing but
                                    the skin. A very destructive foe is also described as being a
                                    caterpillar, of an inch in length, and the thickness of a
                                    crow-quill, which, it is said, would soon destroy the race if
                                    allowed to continue its attacks without any interference on the
                                    part of the higher powers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                                    species of <hi rend="italic">Ptinus</hi> also feeds upon them
                                    freely. Besides these direct enemies, there is another insect,
                                    with the exact nature of which we are not acquainted, which
                                    lives in common with the cochineal upon the juices of the nopal,
                                    and by so doing greatly interferes with the health and progress
                                    of the more valuable species. Among its larger, if not more
                                    formidable enemies, we may mention a mouse, which is said always
                                    to prefer the mastique or finer cochineal to the Sylvester or
                                    wild species, because the cottony matter with which the latter
                                    is invested produces discomfort by entangling in its teeth. Both
                                    kinds are moreover subjected to the attacks of numerous
                                    birds.</p>

                        <p>Distinguished by four naked or transparent wings, reticulated or
                            interlaced by a delicate network, and usually of the same size as well
                            as texture. The mouth is adapted for mastication, that is, furnished
                            with mandibles and true maxillae, and never assumes the tubular form.
                            The abdomen does not possess a sting, and is rarely provided with an
                            ovipositor. The antennae are usually setaceous, and composed of numerous
                            articulations. The head is furnished with two or three simple eyes. The
                            thorax is formed of three segments, intimately united to each other,
                            though perceptibly distinct from the abdomen; the first of these
                            segments is usually very short, and in the form of a collar. The number
                            of joints of the tarsi varies. The form of the body is for the most part
                            elongated, and its texture rather soft and delicate. The abdomen is
                            always sessile. Many of the species are carnivorous, both in the larva
                            and perfect state.</p>
                        <p>This beautiful and very varied order has been divided into two by Mr
                            Kirby, by the separation of the genus <hi rend="italic">Piiryganea</hi>
                            of Linn., which the English naturalist raises to the rank of an order
                            under the name <hi rend="smallcaps">Trichoptera.</hi> It might also have
                            simplified the characters of the order if we had left in it only those
                            which possess reticulated wings; but as some of the latter exhibit a
                            difference in the texture of the organs of flight, it is difficult to
                            assign rigorous characters to the neuropterous tribes, if we attach a
                            high importance to the wings. “Of all the Linnaean orders,” says Mr
                            Kirby, “this appears to consist of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193747975"
                            xml:id="kp-eb0709-7975-0209"/> the most discordant tribes; so that it
                            seems next to impossible to construct a definition that will include
                            them all unless indeed we admit M. Latreille’s idea, adopted by Mr
                            Macleay, that a varied metamorphosis is its essential character; or, to
                            speak more largely, variety itself seems the characteristic of the
                            insects composing it in every state, and there is scarcely a common
                            distinctive character in their perfect state, upon detecting which in
                            any individual, you may exclaim—this is a neuropterous insect.”<note

                            >Introduc. tο Ent.</hi> vol. iv. p. 371.</p></note> Theneuropterous
                            species, however, may be readily distinguished from the orthopterous and
                            hemipterous kinds by the greater difference of consistence in the two
                            latter between the upper and under wings. The Hymenoptera, again, have
                            generally much longer maxillae—serving rather to suck the juices than to
                            bruise .the more solid portions of the substances on which they feed.
                            The scale-covered wings of the lepidopterous order prevent their being
                            confounded with our present subjects; while the Diptera are easily
                            distinguished by the absence of the lower wings, and the different
                            structure of the organs of manducation.</p>
                        <p>The mouth in the neuropterous order is generally composed of a labrum and
                            a labium, of two mandibles, and a pair of maxillae. The latter organs
                            are very sharp and strong among the <hi rend="italic">Lihellulce,</hi>
                            which prey on other insects, but extremely small or almost imperceptible
                            in the <hi rend="italic">Ephemeral,</hi> which, as their name implies,
                            are very short-lived, and take no nourishment in the perfect state. The
                            palpi are very short in the former tribes, but exceedingly long among
                            the <hi rend="italic">Aiyrmeleones.</hi> Although the antennae, in the
                            majority, are filiform or setaceous, they are terminated by an elongated
                            club in those last named; while in the genus <hi rend="italic"
                            >Ascalaphus</hi> they are very long and slender, and terminate in a
                            little button, resembling those of many Lepidoptera. The wings are
                            sometimes tectiform or incumbent, sometimes stretched out horizontally.
                            Though frequently alike in size, they occasionally differ from each
                            other. Thus in the genus <hi rend="italic">Eemoptera</hi> the under pair
                            are very long and narrow, while in some Ephemerae they are almost
                            obliterated.</p>
                        <p>In the larva and nympha states these insects are either terrestrial or
                            aquatic, according to their kinds. In the former case some dwell beneath
                            the bark of trees, others move about on twigs and branches, making an
                            unresisting prey of Aphides; while a certain number inhabit sandy soils,
                            where they excavate insidious pit-falls, and seize upon whatever insects
                            venture within the circle of their treacherous toils. The aquatic
                            species dwell in their earlier states in ponds and marshes, and in the
                            shallower and more sheltered parts of lakes and rivers. They then
                            respire by means of organs which exhibit a strong analogy to the gills
                            of fishes, but which Latreille recognises only as exterior tracheal
                            appendages, named false branchia. Many construct very ingenious cases of
                            small stones, shells, and twigs of water-plants, in which they move
                            about m their watery element.</p>
                        <p>Ihe Neuroptera are, in general, insects ofan extremely elegant
                            deportment. They fly with great facility, and are not unfrequently
                            adorned by agreeable and varied colours. Though almost all carnivorous
                            as larvae, their habits differ greatly in the perfect state. Some
                            undergo a semi-metamorphosis,—others are completely changed, —-but all
                            the larvae are provided with six-hooked feet, which they usually employ
                            in their search for food. La-tieille divides the order into three
                            families, which present the following succession of natural affinities,
                            <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">st,</hi> Carnivorous insects,

                            <p>FAMILY I.—SUBULICOHNES, <hi rend="smallcaps">Lat.</hi></p>
                            <p>These consist of the <hi rend="italic">Odonata</hi> of Fabricius, and
                                the genus <hi rend="italic">Ephemera.</hi> The antennae are subulate
                                or awl-shaped, scarcely longer than the head, and consist at most of
                                seven articulations, of which the last is setiform. The mandibles
                                and maxillae are entirely covered by the labrum and labium, or by
                                the anterior or prolonged portion of the head. The wings are always
                                much reticulated, separate, sometimes horizontal, sometimes raised
                                perpendicularly. The inferior pair, though often as large as the
                                superior, are in some instances much less, or even entirely wanting.
                                The real eyes are large and projecting, and have from two to three
                                stemmatic eyes placed between them. They feed on living prey, and
                                pass their earlier states beneath the waters. The larvae and nymphs
                                exhibit a form somewhat similar to that of the perfect insects, and
                                respire by particular organs placed along the sides or at least the
                                extremity of the abdomen. They creep up the stalks of plants, or
                                otherwise leave their moist abodes, before undergoing their final
                                transformation.</p>
                            <p>In the great genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Libellula</hi> of Linn.
                                (Plate CCXXX. figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6), the mandibles and maxillae are
                                corneous and very strong, and are covered by the labrum above and by
                                the labium below. The tarsi have three articulations. The wings are
                                nearly of equal size, and the posterior extremity of the body is
                                terminated simply by hooks or by foliaceous appendages.</p>
                            <p>The light and graceful form of these insects, their beautiful and
                                varied colours, their large and lustrous wings, and the hawk-like
                                velocity with which they pursue their flying prey, render them
                                objects of our frequent attention, and easy to be recognised. Our
                                present observations apply to all the component parts of the great
                                and unrestricted genus just named. We shall afterwards give the
                                specialities of the minor groups. The eyes of the Libellulae, or
                                dragon-flies in general, are large and lateral; the stemmata are
                                placed upon the vertex. The antennae are inserted on the front,
                                behind a vesicular elevation, and are composed in the greater number
                                of from five to six articulations, or at least of three, of which
                                the last is composite, and attenuated in the form of a style. The
                                labrum is arched and semicircular; the mandibles are of a sealy
                                texture, very strong and toothed; the maxillae are terminated by a
                                piece of the same consistence, dentated, spinous, and ciliated on
                                the inner side, with a palpus of one articulation on its back,
                                representing what is called the <hi rend="italic">galea</hi> in the
                                orthopterous tribes. The labium is large, arched, and trifoliate,
                                the two lateral foliae being in fact palpi. There exists a kind of
                                epiglottis, or vesicular and longitudinal tongue, in the interior of
                                the mouth. The abdomen, always considerably elongated, varies in its
                                contour, being in some cylindrical, in others compressed, and
                                occasionally flattened. It is terminated in the males by two
                                lamellar appendages, which likewise vary in fortn according to the
                                species. The legs are short, and directed forwards. “Le dessous du

                                dont le corps est alors courbé en forme de boucle. La copulation a
                                souvent lieu dans les airs, et quelquefois encore sur les corps où
                                ces insectes sont posés.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            <p>The larvae and nymphs are aquatic. The former have no wings, the

                                3). The head in these early stages is remarkable for the singular
                                piece which corresponds to the labium. It assumes the form of a
                                mask, and covers the mandibles, the maxillae, and almost all the
                                under parts of the head. It is composed of, 1s(, a principal
                                triangular piece, sometimes arched, sometimes flat, named <hi
                                rend="italic">mentonnière</hi> (or chin-cloth) by Réaumur, which
                                articulates by means of a hinge with a pedicle or kind of handle
                                attached to the head; 2d, of two other pieces inserted at the
                                lateral and inferior angles of the preceding, moveable at their
                                base, transverse, and either in the form of wide and dentated
                                plates, resembling shutters in their nature, and the mode in which
                                they close the mouth, or analogous to little hooks or claws. To that
                                portion of the mask where the <hi rend="italic">mentonnière</hi> is
                                articulated with its pedicle, or the knee, and which appears to
                                terminate it inferiorly when the mask is bent or folded upon itself,
                                Réaumur applied the term <hi rend="italic">mentum.</hi> The insect
                                unfolds and extends this peculiar apparatus with great promptitude,
                                and seizes its prey with the pincers of the superior portion. These
                                creatures live fór ten or eleven months in the water, during which
                                period they several times cast their skin. When the nymphs are ready
                                to assume their final change, the form and position of the
                                wing-cases undergo an alteration. They then leave the water, become
                                dry and crisp, the skin of the thorax bursts asunder, and the winged
                                insect issues forth under a different and much more ornamental
                                aspect. The name of <hi rend="italic">Demoiselles,</hi> by which
                                many of them are known to our continental neighbours, attests the
                                impression produced by their graceful forms or elegant movements.
                                These Demoiselles always come out of the water head foremost; but no
                                sooner have they burst their casements than they turn themselves
                                round, and hang for a time with their head downward, being prevented
                                from falling by the hinder segments of the abdomen being still
                                entangled in and adhering to the skin of the nymph. After a time the
                                young aspirant again turns round, and seizing, the anterior portion
                                of the cloven skin with its claws, it finally succeeds in dragging
                                itself forth from its former dwelling. The wings, however, are as
                                yet narrow, thick, and closely folded, just like a leaf during the
                                bursting spring. After another hour or two they become firm,
                                consistent, and extended both in length and breadth, and the gay and
                                gorgeous creature, launching buoyantly into the air, becomes the
                                tyrant of the insect world.</p>

                                vertex; the other stemmatic eye is larger, and placed anteriorly.
                                The central division of the labium is much smaller than the lateral
                                ones, which unite above by a longitudinal suture, and exactly close

                                elongated. The form of the larvae and nymphs is also more lengthened
                                than that of the same states in Libellulae. The mask is flat, and
                                the two pincers are narrow, with a moveable nail at the end. The

                                but the middle lobe is divided into two as far as its base. The

                                ligula. The antennae seem to be composed of only four joints. The
                                front presents no vesicle, and the stemmatic eyes are of nearly
                                equal size, and disposed triangularly on the vertex. The abdomen is

                                laminae at its posterior extremity. The form of the body in the
                                larva and nympha states of this genus is likewise long and slender,
                                and the abdomen is terminated by three fin-like plates (ibid. fig.
                                3). The mask is flat, the upper extremity of the <hi rend="italic"

                                sloped in others; the pincers are narrow, but terminate in several
                                dentations resembling hands. The species are very numerous. <hi

                                genus also belong the small pale-coloured kinds, annulate d with

                                individuals of the same species, besides the more fixed distinctions
                                of a sexual character.</p>

                            <p>In these frail and fleeting insects the body is very soft, long, and
                                tapering, and terminates as above mentioned. Their antennae are very
                                small, and composed of three articulations, of which the last is
                                very long, and in the form of a conical thread. The anterior portion
                                of their head projects in the manner of a clypeus, is frequently
                                carinated and emarginate, and covers the mouth,-of which it is
                                difficult to distinguish the structure, on account of the slight
                                development of its parts, and the softness of their texture. The
                                Ephemerae in repose carry their wings almost always in a
                                perpendicular position, or a little inclined backwards. The legs are
                                slender, with very short tibiae, frequently confounded with the
                                tarsi, which often exhibit only four joints, owing to the
                                evanescence of the first; the two hooks of the last are much
                                compressed into the form of a little pallet. The two anterior legs
                                are much longer than the others, inserted almost beneath the head,
                                and extended forwards. These insects usually make their appearance
                                in the winged state towards the evening in fine summer weather, and
                                sometimes in such abundance, that in certain districts of France
                                cart-loads of them have been gathered from the ground, and employed
                                as manure. <hi rend="italic">E. albipennis,</hi> in particular, a
                                species, as its name implies, remarkable for the whiteness of its

                                rivers, as to thicken the air and whiten the surface of the
                                ground,—reminding one, even in the verdurous and leafy summer,

                            <p>The males are distinguished from the females by a pair of articulated
                                hooks, and their fore legs and caudal appendages are likewise
                                longer. Although strictly ephemeral in their final state, they have
                                rather a more extended term of life than usual in their subaqueous
                                abodes, where they are said to live and prosper for two or three
                                years. In the larva state the antennae are longer than afterwards;
                                the stemmatic eyes are wanting; the mouth presents two horn-like
                                projections, which are regarded as mandibles; the abdomen is
                                furnished on each side with a range of laminae or leaflets, usually
                                united at the base in pairs. These last-named parts are a kind of
                                false branchia, on which the tracheal ramifications are extended,
                                and which serve not only for the purposes of respiration, but also
                                for those of locomotion. The tarsi have only a single hook at their
                                extremity. The abdomen is terminated by setae, of the same amount as
                                in the perfect insect. The nymphs differ from the larvae chiefly in
                                being possessed of little sheaths or wing-cases (Plate CCXXX. fig.
                                10). When <hi rend="italic">ripe,</hi> they leave the waters, and
                                undergo their final transformation, pretty much after the manner of
                                the Libellulae already described, although more rapidly. One
                                singular characteristic, however, attends their winged condition,
                                from which the other tribes are free; they cast off a complete
                                envelope or skin, including that even of the limbs, setae, and
                                antennae, almost immediately after they have attained the perfect
                                state, or at least what Mr Curtis has well named the <hi

                                pursuit of angling, both along our own unrivalled streams, and by
                                the banks of foreign waters, we have frequently had our fishing
                                panier and the rims of our hat covered by a pearly layer of these
                                ghost-like exuviae, and it proved extremely interesting to witness
                                what we had often previously perused in the accurate pages of
                                Réaumur. Swammerdam, who had long ago observed and described this
                                singular moulting, seems to think that the male sex is alone
                                subjected to it. The manners and metamorphosis of these insects have
                                been minutely detailed by the laborious author just named, in his
                                <hi rend="italic">Biblia</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturoe,</hi> as well
                                as by Réaumur and Degeer, in their respective <hi rend="italic"
                                >Mémoires</hi> on the natural history of insects. The angler
                                recognises them under the name of May-flies,—an imitation of which,
                                during the early part of the trouting season, is deemed a lure not
                                to be resisted by the finny race. We cannot here describe the
                                species in detail. We have figured several different kinds on Plate
                                CCXXX. Some have four wings, figs. 5 and 9; others have only two,
                                fig. 7. Of the latter the eyes are sometimes very singularly
                                constructed, being double, or two on each side, one above the other,
                                as shown by fig. 8 of the same plate.</p>

                                antennae, always composed of a great number of articulations, are
                                considerably longer than the head, without being styliform or
                                awl-shaped. The mandibles are very distinct, and the under wings,
                                almost equal to the superior ones, are extended, or simply folded
                                beneath at their inner margin. The wings are very generally much
                                reticulated and naked, with the maxillary palpi for the most part
                                filiform, or a little larger at the extremity, shorter than the

                                figs. 13 and 20). The antennae are setaceous and inserted between
                                the eyes. The clypeus is prolonged into a corneous lamina, arched
                                beneath for the reception of the mouth. The mandibles, maxillae, and
                                labium, are almost linear (Plate CCXXX. fig. 16). The palpi, varying
                                in number from four to six, are filiform; those of the maxillae do
                                not distinctly present more than four joints. The body is elongated,
                                the head vertical, the first segment of the thorax usually very
                                small, and in the form of a collar. The abdomen is conical or almost
                                cylindrical. In several species the sexes are very dissimilar.

                                but they differ from the preceding in not having the head prolonged
                                in the form of a beak or proboscis. The antennae are gradually
                                enlarged, or have a globular or button-like termination. The head is
                                transverse, vertical, and exhibits no stemmatic eyes. The ordinary
                                organs of vision are round and projecting. The mouth is furnished
                                with six palpi, of which the labial are usually longer than the
                                others, and somewhat inflated at the extremity. The palate of the
                                mouth is raised in the toim of an epiglottis. The first segment of
                                the thorax is small. The wings are equal, elongated, tectiform, or
                                incumbent. The abdomen is generally long and cylindrical, with two
                                projecting appendages at the extremity in the male sex. The legs are
                                short.</p>

                                the north. They rest on plants, and generally remain quiescent
                                during the day. The nymphs are inactive; but the generality of the
                                perfect insects are well endowed with the power of flight. They form

                                half an inch in length, of an oval depressed form and greyish
                                colour. It feeds chiefly on Solomon’s emblem of industry, and has
                                hence received the name of <hi rend="italic">Formica-Leo</hi> or
                                lion-ant. Its head is very small, but armed with two strong and
                                lengthened mandibles, serrated on the inner side, and pointed at the
                                end. These parts look rather like a pair of horns than organs of
                                manducation; but it is with them that the larva seizes upon its
                                prey; and as they are pierced at the extremity, they no doubt also
                                act as suckers. As its form does not admit of active locomotion,
                                nature has made amends by endowing this insect with admirable
                                instinctive skill and cunning. It constructs, in a dry or sandy
                                soil, a funnel-shaped excavation, the sides and edges of which are
                                loose and crumbling, and at the bottom of which, with body closely
                                covered, but with ever-ready jaws projecting upwards, the insidious
                                larva lies concealed. No sooner does an industrious ant, laden
                                perhaps with its republican provision, approach the edge of the
                                unsuspected slope, to it as dangerous as a volcanic crater or
                                avalanche of snow, than the finely poised sand immediately gives
                                way, and the persevering citizen, rolling to the bottom, is
                                instantly seized and sucked to a shadow by the lurking tyrant. The
                                dead body is ere long tossed by a jerk of the head beyond the
                                immediate boundaries of the dwelling, probably because it is by this
                                time useless, or, as some French naturalist has expressed it, “pour
                                que son cadavre n’épouvante pas les autres fourmis qu’il attend.”
                                There are tartars, however, among Myrmeleons as well as men; and it
                                sometimes happens that a large and vigorous winged insect, such as a
                                wasp, bee, or beetle, tumbles head foremost into the pit. “When
                                Greek meets Greek, then comes the tug of war;” and when a lion-ant
                                has the tail of a wasp in his mouth, there is no sayino∙ exactly how
                                the combat may end. The one is furnished with jaws tenacious as well
                                as strong,—but he bears no “charmed life ;” while the other is armed
                                with a weapon which the dews of heaven cannot rust, and compared
                                with the keenness of which the brightest sword in Damascus is as a
                                broken foil. In these doubtful, though, to one or other of the
                                parties, eventually disastrous circumstances, the result at last is,
                                that either the lion-ant is dragged out of his den and stung to
                                death, or dropped upon the ground and left a prey to birds, or that
                                the winged insect is maimed, disabled, drawn into the sand, and
                                slain. If an insect incapable of flight, or from its situation
                                unable to use its wings, but of larger size than the Myrmeleon deems
                                it prudent at once to seize upon, chances to fall into the snare, it
                                is overwhelmed in its attempts to re-ascend, by repeated showers of
                                sand, which its enemy directs upon it with unerring aim. No sooner,
                                however, is the strength of the toiling and exasperated Sisyphus at
                                least in part exhausted, than he too is seized upon, and sucked to
                                death. The lion-ant makes use of its head as a catapult or
                                instrument of war, with which to shower the sand upon its astonished
                                prey. This singular larva is capable of enduring a very
                                long-continued fast. When it has attained to the natural term of its
                                increase, which requires the lapse, it is said, of nearly a couple
                                of years, it weaves a white cocoon, by means of two spinners placed
                                at the posterior extremity of the body, of a rounded form and satin
                                lustre, but covered with grains of sand. In this it undergoes its
                                transformation to the nympha state (Plate CCXXX. fig. 15). The
                                perfect insect bursts from its silken tomb in the course of from
                                fifteen to twenty days. We are acquainted with many species of the
                                genus. Besides the one of which we have just now sketched the
                                history, and which is the <hi rend="italic">Myrìneleon

                                France. It is a very large insect, measuring from four to five
                                inches between the tips of the extended wings, and was described as
                                <hi rend="italic">a Hemerobius</hi> by Linnaeus. It is the <hi
                                rend="italic">Libella</hi><hi rend="italic">turcica</hi> of old
                                Petiver, and the <hi rend="italic">Musea rarissima</hi> of Ray. We

                                muddy stream. The flight of both of these insects, and of all
                                belonging to the genus, is slow and heavy. They seldom fly far, and
                                seem to end their lives near the places where they had their birth,—
                                even to the last “loving the spots which once they gloried in.” They

                                proportionably broader than those of Myrmeleon. The flight of these

                                from place to place, committing great havoc among Aphides, their
                                favourite food,—for which reason they are named <hi rend="italic"

                                to death. Some of the perfect insects are exceedingly beautiful,

                                brilliant golden eyes. Its flight is feeble. The females lay their
                                eggs on leaves, to the number of twelve or sixteen in a group. They
                                are whitish and oval, and are supported and secured by a long
                                hair-like stalk or pedicle, which some botanists, less versed in
                                edible fungi than Dr Greville, have mistaken for a species of <hi

                                the wings usually placed upon the body in a horizontal position. The

                                females, are short, and formed like a chaplet. The mouth resembles
                                that of the orthopterous order, and the labium is quadriful. There
                                are three ocelli, one of which, placed upon the front, is
                                indistinct, and the other two are placed laterally, near the
                                internal margin of the ordinary eyes. The wings are usually rather
                                transparent, colourless, with fine and closeset nervures, but not
                                very distinctly reticulated. There are two small conical
                                biarticulated points at the extremity of the abdomen. The legs are
                                short. A good monograph of this singular and destructive genus is
                                still a desideratum in Entomology. Several species, inhabiting
                                widely distant countries, have been described under the general name
                                of <hi rend="italic">Termes</hi><hi rend="italic">fatale,</hi> but
                                we have still an insufficient knowledge of their actual and
                                distinguishing characteristics. So confused was the acquaintance of
                                our immediate predecessors with these insects, that the larvae of
                                <hi rend="italic">T. flavwolle,</hi> Fab. were placed by Linnaeus
                                among his <hi rend="italic">Aptera,</hi> while the perfect insects
                                formed a part of his genus <hi rend="italic">Hemerobius.</hi> These
                                Termites are for the most part peculiar to countries placed between
                                or near the tropics. The individuals named neuters or labourers
                                among the white ants (commonly so called) are the wingless larvae
                                (fig. 17), and in that state their powers of destruction are quite
                                appalling. They live together in assemblages so vast as almost to
                                defy calculation, and excavate galleries under ground, in trees,
                                tables and all kinds of furniture, as well as in the timber of
                                dwelling-houses. Dr M‘Mur-trie saw a beautiful edifice in the Isle
                                of France that had been abandoned within a few months after its
                                completion, on account of the attacks of these destructive
                                creatures. The whole building was a mere shell.<note anchored="true"

                                ligneous bodies are mined by them, retaining little but a
                                superficial bark, soon crumble into dust; and where the roof of a
                                house, or heavy lintel stone, depends on such support, the
                                insecurity may be as easily imagined as described. They sometimes
                                construct external tunnels or covered ways, which conceal them from
                                view while passing to and from their subterranean dwellings.
                                Sometimes their habitations are raised pyramidally above the
                                surface, in other instances they resemble turrets, with an eave like
                                expansion on the top. Some are broader and extremely solid; and when
                                constructed, as they often are, in groups, they exhibit the
                                appearance of a little village. They are so strongly built, that
                                when raised to only half their height, they are capable of
                                supporting such wild bulls as mount upon them to act as sentinels
                                while the rest of the flock is feeding. λVhen at their full height
                                of ten or twelve feet, they are used by men as stations from which
                                to look across the country, the grass itself being in those regions
                                of equal height. Sineathman, to whom we owe a curious and
                                often-quoted narrative of their history, has frequently stood with
                                four companions on the top of one of their buildings, employing it
                                as a watch-tower by the shore, from which to obtain sight of
                                whatever vessels might heave in sight. Besides the larvae or
                                workers, we find another set of inhabitants, of which the nature is
                                not yet clearly known, although their functions are obvious. They
                                are known by the name of soldiers or neuters, and were erroneously
                                regarded by Fabricius as the nymphs. They defend the habitation.
                                When a breach is effected with a pick-axe, they make their
                                appearance, and snap about in all directions with their
                                mandibles,—apparently in a state of considerable indignation. λVhen
                                the attack has ceased, the soldiers retire, and are succeeded by the
                                labourers, who speedily repair the breach. They are still attended,
                                however, by a few soldiers, who seem to act as superintendents of
                                the work. The nymphs bear the rudiments<pb break="no"
                                facs="nls:193748040" xml:id="kp-eb0709-8040-0214"/> of wings; in
                                other respects they resemble the larvae. No sooner do they become
                                perfect, by acquiring the organs of flight, than they wing their way
                                from their original dwellings, during the evening, or the stillness
                                or night, and in incalculable numbers. At sunrise, however, by a
                                singular law of nature, they lose their wings, which dry up, become
                                shrivelled, and fall to the ground. In this defenceless state they
                                become the prey of many reptiles, and of insect-eating birds. Indeed
                                they seem not to be despised in that respect even by man himself;
                                for not only are they greedily devoured by Hottentots and negroes,
                                but have been often eaten by Europeans with delight. Mr Smeathman
                                found them “delicate, nourishing, and wholesome, without sauce or
                                other help from cookery, than merely roasting them in the manner of
                                coffee.” He indeed discoursed with various friends on the taste of
                                white ants, and on comparing notes, they agreed that these insects
                                were “delicious and delicate eating.’ One gentleman compared them to
                                sugared marrow, while another thought they tasted like “sugared
                                cream and a paste of sweet almonds.”<note anchored="true"

                                of fecundity, that old colonies are soon replenished, or new ones
                                formed. According to Smeathman, the provident larvae seize upon all
                                the winged couples they can find, and shut them up in a roomy cell
                                or nuptial chamber, where they supply them with abundant food; “mais
                                j’ai lieu de présumer,” says LatreiHe, “que l’accouplement a lieu,
                                comme celui des fourmis, dans l’air ou hors de Thabitation, et que

                                (Plate CCXXX. fig. 23) becomes so greatly dilated as to exceed the
                                rest of her body by 1500 or 2000 times, and she is then about a
                                thousand times heavier than her husband. Indeed well she may, if, as
                                is reported, she is endowed with the power of laying <hi

                                >arborum)</hi> live on trees, where they build nests as large as
                                sugar casks, and from seventy to eighty feet above the ground. These
                                are formed of particles of gnawed wood cemented by a gluten either
                                secreted by themselves, as silk is by caterpillars, or gathered from
                                gummiferous trees. They are so strongly attached to their supporting
                                branches as to resist the violence even of those tornadoes which so
                                often in tropical countries level alike the palaces of kings, and
                                “huts where poor men lie.” Indeed they cannot be detached except by
                                being hewn in pieces. The genus Termes is not unknown in Europe. <hi

                                of France, where it dwells in the interior of various trees. It has

                                navy-yard of Rochefort that it cannot be extirpated, and is the

                            <p>The remaining Termitinae are characterized by their biarticulate
                                tarsi, and their short and indistinct labial palpi. The antennae
                                consist of about ten joints; the anterior seg- ' ment of the thorax
                                is very small; and the inferior wings are less than the superior.
                                They form the genus Psocus of Latreille, which consists of very
                                small species with short soft bodies, often hunched or inflated,
                                with a large head, setaceous antennae, projecting maxillary palpi,
                                and incumbent wings, slightly reticulated or but simply veined.
                                These are active insects, living beneath the bark of trees, in wood,
                                straw, &amp;c. Some occur among books and in collections of plants

                                though each has its peculiar integument, so that the animal can use
                                them when the time comes for it to emerge from the water, and
                                commence a denizen of the air. The imago exhibits few or none of the

                                The wings are veined in a peculiar manner, without reticulations, in
                                some degree like those of <hi rend="italic">Lepidoptera.</hi> The
                                antennae resemble much those of the Tinea tribe, and the tibiae of

                                many of the moths; but they have no spiral tongue, the wings, though
                                hairy, have no scales, the under wings are folded longitudinally,
                                and the head, besides the usual compound eyes, has three stemmata.

                        <p>This order, of more direct utility to man than many others, in as far as
                            it contains the species which yield us wax and honey, is characterized,
                            like the preceding one, by the possession of four membranous and naked
                            wings. The mouth consists of mandibles, maxillae, and an under and an
                            upper lip. The organs of flight, however, differ from those of the
                            Neuroptera, in being simply veined rather than reticulated; and the
                            upper wings are always somewhat larger than the under pair. The abdomen
                            of the female is terminated either by an ovipositor or sting. Besides
                            the ordinary visual organs, these insects are all provided with three
                            small stemmatic eyes. The antennae are variable, not only in different
                            genera, but in different sexes of the same species. In the majority,
                            however, they are filiform or setaceous. The maxillae and the labium are
                            generally long and narrow, fixed in a deep cavity of the head by
                            lengthened muscles, semi-tubular it their lower portion, often folded at
                            their extremity, and serving rather for the transmission of nutritive
                            juices than for mastication properly so called. Indeed in several these
                            parts unite to form a kind of trunk or sucker. The ligula is membranous,
                            whether widened at the extremity, or long and filiform, with the pharynx
                            at its anterior base, and frequently covered by a kind of sub-labrum or
                            epipharynx. The palpi are four in number, two labial and two maxillary.
                            The thorax as usual consists of three segments, of which the foremost is
                            very short, and the two remainder are intimately united. The wings cross
                            each other horizontally over the body, and the upper pair have a little
                            rounded convex knob at their base. The abdomen is composed of from five
                            to nine segments, the number being frequently six in the females and
                            seven in the males. It is usually suspended, as it were, to the thorax
                            by a small and slender pedicle; in which case its second articulation
                            seems to be the first, the latter being in fact confounded with the
                            metathorax. The ovipositor and the sting (both being constructed on the
                            same modeD are composed, in the generality, of three long and slender
                            pieces, two of which serve as a sheath for the third, which is itself,
                            when under the form of ä sting, composed of a pair of pieces joined in
                            one The tarsi are composed of five articulations, none of which is
                            divided.</p>

                            (and we are still far from our conclusion), will not, however, admit of

                            two strong approximate parallel nervures, deriving their origin from the
                            thorax, and united by means of a strong expansion of the membrane of the

                            these principal branches give rise to. shorter intersecting nervures,
                            the interlacement of which partitions the wing as it were into
                            membranaceous departments, designated by the name of cells. Several of
                            these, by reason of their constancy of disposition in each genus of
                            hymenopterous insects, have been used with advantage by Jurine for the
                            purposes of classification. A nervure, called the <hi rend="italic"
                            >radial</hi> (fig. 3, <hi rend="italic">a),</hi> usually springs from
                            the middle of the stigma, and attaining the tip or anterior angle of the
                            wing, leaves between itself and the anterior margin a membranous space,
                            known as the <hi rend="italic">radial cell</hi> (fig. <hi rend="italic"
                            >4, a).</hi> If there should, moreover, spring from the stigma a lesser
                            nervure, dividing the cell into two parts, we recognise a pair of ιadial
                            ce s. to this case, however, the larger nervure does not derive its
                            origin from the central line of the stigma, but farther back, or from
                            its ⅛asal portion (fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">d).</hi> It sometimes also
                            happens that the radial nervure, proceeding from the stigma, encounters,
                            before it gains the margin of the wing, a small intersecting nervure,
                            itself proceeding from that margin. The radial cell is then said to be

                            two, three, or four lesser cells, by means of intersecting nervures
                            (fig. 4, e, and fig. 1, e). If two of these cells are much developed,
                            and the second one, on the contrary, is so circumscribed that it cannot
                            reach the margin of the radial nervure, we have then a peculiar
                            character. The two developed cells, instead of being separated from each
                            other by the entire interval of the second cell, are kept apart, for a
                            space, only by a simple nervure, the length of which is proportional to
                            the curtailment of the second cell; and in this way the latter has no
                            other connection with the radial cell above it, than that it adheres to,
                            or depends from it, as it were, by a kind of pedicle or stalk,—for which
                            reason it is then named <hi rend="italic">ρ&lt;Aiolated</hi> by Jurine
                            (fig. 2, δ). If it happens that the cubital nervure does not attain to
                            the extreme margin of the wing, the spaces which it partly forms are
                            regarded as <hi rend="italic">incomplete.</hi></p><p>It has been already
                            stated that, besides the large nervures named cubitus and radius, Jurine
                            has distinguished others, which also spring from the base of the wing,
                            as at fig. <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">,g.</hi> These
                            produce others of a secondary kind, which mount towards the cubital
                            cells, sometimes attaining to the first and second, sometimes to the
                            second and third, and sometimes only to a single cell. These have
                            received the name of recurrent nervures (fig. 1,∕). By anastomosing
                            among themselves, and with the cubitus, the brachial nervures and their
                            branches form several cells, which Jurine has named the <hi

                            lepidopterous insects, the cell situated in the centre of the wing is
                            prolonged uninterruptedly as far as the base.</p><p>Since we have
                            entered into these details, we may here also mention briefly a few
                            additional particulars, relating chiefly to the nomenclature of the
                            outline of the wings. The <hi rend="italic">base</hi> is that part which
                            articulates with the thorax (fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">a, b, g).</hi>

                            posterior and inner margins (fig. 1, ž). The posterior margin commences
                            at the anterior angle or summit, and ends at the posterior or inner

                        <p>The digestive systetn of Hyn ’ ιenoptera consists in general of two
                            stomachs, of which the second is elongated; of a short intestine,
                            terminated by a widened cloaca; and of numerous biliary vessels,
                            inserted near the pylorus. In regard to their tracheal apparatus, M.
                            Leon Dufour has remarked, that all the Hymenoptera which he has examined
                            exhibit a greater degree of perfection in that part of their structure
                            than any other order of insects. Instead of being composed of
                            cylindrical and elastic vessels, of which the diameter decreases by
                            successive divarications, they present constant dilatations, or
                            determinate vesicles, favourable to the greater or less continuance of
                            air, and capable of being distended or otherwise, according<pb

                            the quantity of their contents. On each side of the base of the abdomen
                            there is a large oval vesicle of the kind alluded to, of a dull milky
                            white, giving rise here and there to radiating bundles of vascular
                            tracheae, which distribute themselves to the neighbouring organs. On
                            entering the thorax it becomes restricted, is again dilated, and ends
                            insensibly in a tube, of which the subdivisions are lost in the head.
                            Behind these two abdominal vesicles the respiratory organ is prolonged
                            in the shape of two filiform tubes, which give off an infinity of little
                            air-bearing branches, and become confluent towards the anal

                        <p>Hymenopterous insects undergo a complete metamorphosis. Most of the
                            larvae resemble little worms, unprovided with feet. At least those of
                            the second and following families answer that description. Those of the
                            first family, however, have six feet, furnished with hooks; and besides
                            these they frequently possess from twelve to sixteen others of a simply
                            membranous texture. These latter larvae are named by the French <hi
                            rend="italic">fausses</hi><hi rend="italic">chenilles.</hi> Both kinds
                            are provided with a sealyhead, with mandibles, maxillae, and a labium,
                            at the extremity of which is a <hi rend="italic">spinner</hi> for the
                            passage of that silky substance which is ere long employed in the
                            construction of the nymph’s cocoon. Some live on vegetable substances;
                            others, and these are the footless or apodal kinds, feed on insects,
                            with which they are supplied by the provident attention of their
                            mothers, which either carry food to their admirably constructed
                            dwellings, or, as among the Ichneumonides, deposit their eggs at once on
                            living larvae, of which the excluded young soon become the tenacious and
                            destructive parasites. Among bees a vast number of individuals of
                            ambiguous or undeveloped sex are charged, among other arduous labours,
                            with the sustenance of the helpless young, a task performed with a
                            propriety and precision which, with their many additional attributes of
                            instinctive skill, render their proceedings worthy to be classed, if not
                            as standing miracles of nature, at least as deserving the careful
                            contemplation of the wisest minds.</p>

                        <p>In the winged or perfect state, hymenopterous insects generally occur on
                            flowers, and they may be regarded as more abundant in southern than in
                            northern regions. We shall not here dilate upon the generalities of the
                            order, as it is our intention to notice all the more remarkable
                            historical facts, in our sketch of the principal tribes and genera. We
                            shall merely remark, that notwithstanding the numerous and always
                            delightful observations of Réaumur, Degeer, Huber, Latreille, Walkenaer,
                            and others, the hymenopterous order still presents a vast and fruitful
                            field of discovery to the zealous cultivator of entomological science.

                                    or separate power of movement. The females have an ovipositor
                                    <hi rend="italic">(tariere),</hi> generally in the form of a
                                    saw, and which serves not merely for the deposition of the eggs,
                                    but also for the construction of a proper place for their
                                    reception. The larvae have always six sealyfeet, and frequently
                                    several others which are membranous. This family forms two
                                    tribes.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tribe 1st, Tenthredinetae, or
                                    Saw-flies.</hi></p>
                                <p>Of these the mandibles are lengthened and compressed. The ligula
                                    is divided into three, as if digitated. The ovipositor is
                                    composed of two plates, toothed like a saw, pointed, united, and
                                    lodged in a groove of the posterior extremity. The maxillary
                                    palpi are always composed of six articulations, and the labial
                                    of four. The latter are always the shorter. Both pairs of wings
                                    are divided into numerous cells. This tribe corresponds to the
                                    great genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Tenthredo</hi> of Linnaeus.</p>
                                <p>The abdomen of these insects is cylindrical, rounded posteriorly,
                                    composed of nine segments, and so united to the thorax as to
                                    appear almost like a uniform continuation of that part. The
                                    wings appear as if rumpled, and there are two little grain-like
                                    coloured bodies behind the scutellum. The form and composition
                                    of the antennae vary. The mandibles are strong and toothed. The
                                    extremity of the maxillae is almost membranous, or at least of a
                                    less coriaceous consistence than the base. The palpi are
                                    filiform, or nearly setaceous, and composed of six
                                    articulations. The ligula is straight, rounded, divided into
                                    three parts, of which the central is the narrowest; its sheath
                                    is usually short. The abdomen of the female is provided at its
                                    lower extremity with a double moveable ovipositor, scaly,
                                    serrated, pointed, and enclosed within two other concave plates,
                                    which serve it as a sheath. It is by the action of the teeth of
                                    this instrument that the insect perforates the stalks and other
                                    parts of plants, in which she lays her <hi rend="superscript">
                                    e</hi> Sa <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> ∙ These she afterwards
                                    imbues with a peculiar frothy liquor, which seems to prevent the
                                    parts of the plant from reuniting, and even causes the formation
                                    of a concave chamber, or of ligneous parts resembling galls, in
                                    which the excluded larvae dwell, either in a state of solitude,
                                    or m company, according to their kind. After undergoing its
                                    final metamorphosis, the perfect insect makes its escape by
                                    gnawing a circular overture. The larvae of many species,
                                    however, live exposed upon the foliage of trees and plants. They
                                    bear a great resemblance to caterpillars in their general form
                                    and colouring, but they present either from eighteen to
                                    twenty-two feet, or only six; whereas in caterpillars properly
                                    so called, these parts range merely from ten to sixteen. They
                                    frequently continue in the larva state for several months, or
                                    throughout the winter, and remain but a short time in the nympha
                                    state, previous to the assumption of which they spin a cocoon.
                                    We shall briefly notice the principal genera into which these
                                    insects are now divided.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Cimbex</hi> of Olivier and Fab. (Plate
                                    CCXXXI. fig. 1) the antennae are alike in both sexes, and
                                    terminate in a button-like expansion. The larvae have
                                    twenty-four feet, and some of them when tormented will spout out
                                    a greenish liquid to the distance of a foot. In <hi
                                    rend="smallcaps">Hylotoma,</hi> Lat. (ibid, fig. 2), the
                                    antennae exhibit only three distinct articulations, of which the
                                    last is in the form of an elongated prismatic or cylindrical
                                    club, more slender, ciliated, and sometimes forked in the males.
                                    A well-known species (figured as above), the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Temthredo rosaecA</hi> Linn, belongs to this genus. In the
                                    genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Tentiiredo</hi> properly so called
                                    (ibid. fig. 3), the antennae are composed of nine articulations,
                                    which are simple in both sexes. The larvae have from eighteen to
                                    twenty-two feet. In the perfect insects the number of teeth of
                                    the mandibles varies from two to four. The amount of radial and
                                    cubital cells of the wings also varies in different species.
                                    Hence the formation of the genera <hi rend="italic">Allantus,
                                    Dolerus, Nematus,</hi> &amp;c. by Jurine, Leach, and other
                                    naturalists. The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Cladi-</hi> us of
                                    Klug has also nine joints in the antennae, but those parts are
                                    pectinated on one side in the males. In <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                    >Athalia</hi> of Leach the body is short and thick, as in
                                    Hylotoma, but the antennae, simple in both sexes, have from ten
                                    to fourteen articulations. The genus <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Pterygophorus</hi> of Klug are remarkable for their antennae,
                                    composed at least of sixteen articulations, being pectinated or
                                    fanshaped in the males, and serrated in the females. In LoPHYRUS
                                    of Lat. (Plate CCXXXI. fig. 4) the antennae are doubly
                                    pectinated in the males, and resemble a triangular plume (fig.
                                    5); they are shortly serrated in the females (fig. 6).<note

                                    their liguìa, which is entire, and by the ovipositor of the
                                    female, which is sometimes projecting and composed of three
                                    thread-like parts, sometimes spirally rolled within the abdomen,
                                    and of a capillary form. They compose the old genus <hi
                                    rend="smallcaps">Sirex</hi> of Linn.</p>
                                <p>The antennae of these insects are filiform or setaceous,
                                    vibratory, and composed of from ten to twenty-five
                                    articulations. The head is rounded and nearly globular, the
                                    labrum very small, the maxillary palpi filiform, consisting of
                                    from three to five articulations, and the labial of three, of
                                    which the last is largest. The body is almost cylindrical. The
                                    anterior or posterior tarsi, and in several species the colour
                                    of the abdomen, differ according to the sexes. The females
                                    deposit their eggs in ancient trees, generally in those of the
                                    pine tribe. The ovipositor is lodged at the base of the abdomen,
                                    between two valves, which form a protecting groove.</p>

                                    only two species found in Europe, both of which are exceedingly
                                    active, and occur on trees in spring. We have figured <hi

                                    fig. 8, the antennae, inserted near the front, consist of from
                                    thirteen to twenty-five articulations, the mandibles are toothed
                                    on their inner side, the maxillary palpi are very small, almost
                                    conical, of two articulations, and the extremity of the last
                                    segment of the abdomen is prolonged in the form of a tail. The
                                    ovipositor consists of three threads. These insects are of
                                    rather large size. They inhabit more particularly forests of
                                    pine and fir, in cold and mountainous countries, and during
                                    flight produce a buzzing noise, like that of an humble-bee. The
                                    larvae have six feet, with the posterior extremity of the body
                                    terminating in a point. It lives in the interior of wood, where
                                    it spins a cocoon, and undergoes its metamorphosis. Our most
                                    noted species is the <hi rend="italic">S. gigas</hi> of Linn.
                                    The male has a yellow abdomen, with a black extremity; the
                                    female is black, with a yellow spot behind each eye, and the
                                    second and three terminal rings of the abdomen also of the
                                    latter colour. Owing to the disparity of aspect of the sexes,
                                    they have been not unfrequently described by naturalists as
                                    distinct species.</p>

                                    slender thread or pedicle, so that its mode of insertion is
                                    distinct and obvious, and admits of a separate movement. The
                                    larvae are apodal, and for the most part parasitical and
                                    carnivorous. Latreille divides them into six tribes, as

                                    areolated. The antennae are filiform or setaceous, and composed
                                    of from thirteen to fourteen articulations. The mandibles are
                                    dentated on the inner side. The maxillary palpi consist of six,
                                    and the labial of four articulations. The abdomen is implanted
                                    on the thorax,—i∏ some, just beneath the scutellum. The
                                    ovipositor is usually projecting, and composed of three

                                    exhibit on their disc closed or completed cells. The abdomen
                                    takes its rise between the two posterior legs. The antennae are
                                    generally filiform or setaceous (very rarely clubbed), and
                                    composed of a great number of articulations. In the majority the
                                    mandibles have no tooth on the inner side, and terminate in a
                                    biful point. The maxillary palpi, always apparent or projecting,
                                    have usually not more than five articulations. The ovipositor
                                    consists of three threads or setae.</p>

                                <p>The general term Icħneumonides comprehends an extensive series of
                                    insects, important on account of the purposes to which they are
                                    subservient in the economy of nature, and deriving considerable
                                    interest from the peculiar manner in which these purposes are
                                    effected. They differ from most of the other members of the
                                    class to which they belong, in their mode of providing for their
                                    young,— presenting this peculiarity, that they deposittheireggs
                                    in the living bodies of other insects. In a tribe of such
                                    extent, considerable variety of external appearance necessarily
                                    prevails; but a genuine Ichneumon may in general be known by its
                                    elongated form, attenuated, and in most cases petio-lated
                                    abdomen, terminated frequently in a long fissile seta; and by
                                    its filiform, porrected, often recurved and annulated antennae,
                                    to which a constant vibratory motion is imparted. The European
                                    species vary in size from a fraction of a line to fifteen lines;
                                    those of tropical countries, however, greatly exceed these
                                    dimensions, a few of them ranking even among the largest
                                    insects. Upwards of 1300 species have been described as natives
                                    of Europe, of which number a great many hundreds exist in

                                    this tribe, even from the earliest periods. The word Ichneumon
                                    occurs in the natural history of Aristotle, by whom it is
                                    applied to a species of Spbex. Ray appears to be the first who
                                    used it to designate the tribe of insects to which it has ever
                                    since been restricted. Little, however, was known regarding the
                                    structure or habits of these creatures till the time of Frisch,
                                    who subjected them to an anatomical examination, and described
                                    the parts of the mouth, and formation of the wings, with great
                                    accuracy and minuteness. He was the first who employed the form
                                    and relative position of the cells of the latter to assist in
                                    distinguishing genera. Much valuable information resulted from
                                    the observations and experiments of Réaumur, whose work may be
                                    referred to for many interesting details regarding the manners

                                <p>In the numerous works on Entomology which appeared during the
                                    latter half of the eighteenth century, our knowledge of these
                                    insects kept pace with the increased zeal manifested towards the
                                    study of natural history during that important period. Linnaeus,
                                    Scopoli, Fabricius, Schrank, Panzer, and others of inferior
                                    name, applied themselves successfully to investigate their
                                    history—reducing the information derived from their predecessors
                                    to a more systematic form, and greatly increasing the amount of
                                    known species. In 1807 Jurine published his new method for the
                                    classification of Hymenoptera, already mentioned. The
                                    application of his principles to the Ichneumonides afforded less
                                    satisfactory results than in most of the other tribes. Like all
                                    systems founded on a partial view of organic structure, it led,
                                    in many instances, to the violation of natural order, by
                                    separating cognate species, and associating others having no
                                    positive affinity. But though Jurine failed to establish an
                                    efficient mode of arrangement, he rendered important service to
                                    subsequent inquirers, by describing minutely, and furnishing
                                    with a suitable terminology, the variously modified forms of the
                                    organs of flight, which are found to afford characters of
                                    considerable value for the discrimination of genera. Latreille
                                    at different times published arrangements of this tribe, and by
                                    the number of his sectional divisions, generally founded on
                                    obvious characters, greatly facilitated the identifying of
                                    species.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                                    approximate so closely to each other in external characters,
                                    that a comprehensive division, and a more detailed description
                                    of specific difference, became indispensable. This desideratum
                                    has recently been supplied by the publication of an extensive
                                    and elaborate work on the Ichneumonides by Professor
                                    Gravenhorst; an individual eminently qualified to unravel the
                                    complexities of this difficult tribe. An extensive intercourse
                                    with men of science enabled him to amass a large collection of
                                    these insects from all parts of &lt; Europe; while habits of

                                    research, combined with just views of systematic arrangement,
                                    and an accurate perception of the affinities of corn secutive
                                    groups, qualified him to employ to the best advantage the ample
                                    materials thus obtained. The result or his labours appeared in
                                    1829, as specified in a note on &lt; our preceding page. The
                                    arrangement adopted is funda- 1 mentally the same as that

                                <p>The body of the Ichneumons is more or less elongated, and in most
                                    instances naked and shining, seldom rough or impressed with
                                    punctures. It is occasionally covered, particularly on the head
                                    and thorax, with a pubescence composed of slender erect hairs,
                                    or it is somewhat sericeous and opaque, with a soft decumbent
                                    pubescence. The prevailing colours are rufous, black, and
                                    yellow, variously intermingled with lines and patches of white.
                                    In the great majority of species, there are one or two spots of
                                    the latter colour on the thorax, at the insertion of the wings.
                                    The scutellum is most frequently white. The feet are very often
                                    of a reddish colour, at times red and black; but they are never
                                    entirely black, the anterior femora being always, pale on the
                                    under side. The head is prominent, generally orbiculate or
                                    subovate anteriorly, in many instances a little narrowed towards
                                    the neck, and nearly of the same breadth as the thorax. The
                                    forehead is sometimes armed with one or two short erect horns,
                                    placed between the antennae and stemmata. The latter are three
                                    in number, and disposed in a triangular form. The antennae in
                                    the greater number of species are shorter than the body; in a
                                    few they are of the same length, very rarely longer, porrected,
                                    generally curved or involuted after death, especially in the
                                    females, filiform or setaceous, sometimes slightly compressed at
                                    the middle, as in some species of <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Phygadeuon,</hi> distinctly compressed in the <hi rend="italic"

                                    sixty articulations, of which the first or radicle is small,
                                    globose, and sunk in the head; the second or scape
                                    sub-cylindrical or sub-clavate, rarely ovate, very rarely
                                    sub-globose, always thicker than the rest (except in the
                                    antennae of the <hi rend="italic">Barycerotes</hi> and the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Eucerotes'),</hi> and longer than the two
                                    following; the third and fourth very short, rather stout, and
                                    often so closely united that they may be regarded as one joint;
                                    the fourth always shorter than the third, which is at times very
                                    inconspicuous; the fifth long, cylindrical; the remainder
                                    gradually decreasing in length, so that the apical joints often
                                    appear transverse. Such is the general appearance of the
                                    antennae; but they are liable to numerous modifications. The
                                    mandibles are corneous, more or less arcuate, generally broadest
                                    at the base, and narrowed towards the apex; in a few instances
                                    they are straight, and in others linear, or even dilated at the
                                    extremity, where they are furnished with two teeth, except in a
                                    very few species, which have the apex entire or tridentate. The
                                    maxillae consist of two parts, of which the basal portion, or
                                    stipes as it has been called, is usually of a corneous
                                    consistence and somewhat lanceolate form; the other portion
                                    (mala) is of a membranaceous substance, and biful or bipartite.
                                    The palpi are four in number, elongate, filiform, and unequal;
                                    the maxillary are rather long, and consist of five joints, very
                                    rarely of four. They have been described by Fabricius and Panzer
                                    as having six joints. The third joint is generally the longest;
                                    the first, second, and fourth, very short; sometimes, however,
                                    one or other of these, or the fifth, is longest, and in a very
                                    few cases the third is shortest; in some species all the
                                    articulations are of equal length. The labial palpi are rather
                                    short, and consist of five joints, very rarely of three.</p>
                                <p>The Ichneumonides, like the rest of the Hymenoptera, are provided
                                    with four wings, composed of thin membrane, and of corneous
                                    ribs. These ribs are generally denominated nerves or nervures;
                                    and the various spaces into which the wing is divided by their
                                    intersection are called <pb break="no" facs="nls:193748118"
                                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-8118-0220"/> cells or areolets. The base of
                                    the wing <hi rend="italic">(radix),</hi> or that portion of it
                                    which is inserted into the thorax, is of a substance
                                    intermediate between corneousand membranaceous, and is always
                                    more or less coloured. It is partially covered with a hard
                                    convex scale <hi rend="italic">(squamula),</hi> which, however,
                                    may more properly be regarded as an appendage of the thorax. The
                                    anterior wings (fig. A) are longer than the posterior, narrow
                                    throughout a considerable portion of their length, and gradually
                                    dilated towards the extremity. The <hi rend="italic">stigma</hi>
                                    (a) is distinctly marked, and varies much in size. The thick rib
                                    of the anterior margin, extending between the stigma and the
                                    dorsal angle of the wing, is called the <hi rend="italic">radius
                                    (b).</hi> By the anastomosing of the nerves, ten or eleven cells
                                    are formed, of which the three at the base of the wing are named
                                    humeral <hi rend="italic">(humerales),</hi> 1, 2, 3; one radial
                                    <hi rend="italic">(radialis),</hi> 4; two or three cubital <hi
                                    rend="italic">(cubitales),</hi> 5, 6, 7; two lying under these
                                    discoidal <hi rend="italic">(discoidales),</hi> 8, 9; and two
                                    towards the margin posterior <hi rend="italic">(posticae),</hi>
                                    10, 11. When the cells are viewed in relation to the breadth of
                                    the wing, the three situate at the apex or posterior margin are
                                    said to be external (5, 8, 10); those next the humeral cells
                                    internal (7, 11); and those between the external and internal
                                    cells intermediate (6, 9). Of the humeral cells, that which lies
                                    next the radius is named the external (1), that next the margin
                                    the internal (3), and that which lies between these two the
                                    intermediate (2). The intermediate cubital cell (6) is generally
                                    denominated the areolet, and is important on account of the
                                    distinctive characters it affords. The interior cubital cell (7)
                                    is very large, in consequence of the nerve which ought to divide
                                    it into two parts, at least which does so in the other
                                    Hymenoptera, having become obsolete. In many species, however, a
                                    portion of this nerve is visible <hi rend="italic">(z)</hi>; and
                                    in some instances it extends nearly to the centre of the cell;
                                    but it is usually very short, or a projecting angle alone
                                    indicates the point whence it ought to issue; and in the less
                                    typical species all traces of it are obliterated. The areolet
                                    likewise is occasionally awanting; different individuals of the
                                    same species have it or have it not; and examples occur in which
                                    it is distinctly formed in one wing and awanting in the other.
                                    In general, however, it is present, and may readily be
                                    distinguished from the other cells by its inferior size and
                                    angular form. It is either five-angled or quadrangular,
                                    triangular or orbiculate. But all these forms are liable to
                                    numerous modifications, and one passes into another. The
                                    posterior wings (B) are shorter and narrower than the anterior,
                                    and nearly of equal breadth throughout. By the anastomosing of
                                    the nerves, seven cells are formed, of which the three at the
                                    base of the wing are named inter-ĭ nal (1, 2, 3), and four at
                                    the posterior margin external <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> (4,
                                    5, 6, 7). In the sub-genus <hi rend="italic">Pezomachus</hi> the
                                    wings are generally absent, and when present are extremely
                                    imperfect, and usually unfit for the purposes of flight,
                                    although their structure, as far as it can be traced, exactly
                                    corresponds to that of the more perfect species. The abdomen,
                                    which is very variable in form, is composed of seven or eight
                                    segments, the eighth being more or less concealed, and often
                                    entirely obsolete. This imperfect development of some of the
                                    segments has led authors to give various accounts of their
                                    number. In addition to the seven usually enumerated, Audouin is
                                    of opinion that there is another of very small size, which
                                    unites the abdomen to the thorax. According to Blainville, there
                                    are never fewer than ten segments, of which the two at the apex
                                    are always concealed. The first or basal segment bears on each
                                    side of it a small tubercle, more or less distinct, which forms
                                    the outlet to a spiracle. When the tubercles are placed very
                                    near the base, and the anterior part of the basal segment is not
                                    much narrower than the following segments, and these nearly
                                    correspond to the breadth of the thorax, the abdomen is said to
                                    be sessile; the posterior part of the first segment being so

                                    anterior part consequently appearing to adhere immediately to
                                    the thorax. If this segment, or the posterior part of it, be
                                    gradually contracted towards the base, the abdomen is said to be
                                    sub-sessile or sub-petiolate. When the posterior part is narrow
                                    and elongated, linear or filiform, that part is called the
                                    petiole or footstalk, and the abdomen is said to be
                                    petiolate.</p>
                                <p>The sexes of these insects can with difficulty be
                                    distinguished,·—few species affording any permanent external
                                    marks of sexual difference. The males in some instances differ
                                    from the females in having a more slender abdomen, in others the
                                    antennae are thicker, and in some species they are more slender
                                    than in the females. Many of the latter are distinguished by
                                    having a white ring round the antennae,<note anchored="true"
                                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In regard, however, to this
                                    distinctive character between the sexes, Gravenhorst observes in
                                    his preface (page 10)- "nonnullarum mares quoque hoc ornamento
                                    gaudent."</p></note> which after death become curved or spirally
                                    convoluted. The males may frequently be known by having the
                                    colours with which they are adorned clearer and more distinctly
                                    defined than in the opposite sex. But the most certain, and
                                    often the most obvious mark of sexual distinction, is the
                                    ovipositor with which the females are provided. This remarkable
                                    appendage varies in its form, in fine accordance with the varied
                                    economy of different species. Some Ichneumons deposit their eggs
                                    on the bodies of caterpillars; an operation which they
                                    accomplish by merely piercing the skin. Others, in order to
                                    lodge their eggs in a proper receptacle, are obliged to
                                    perforate the nests of insects, and to penetrate to the bottom
                                    of crevices too narrow to admit of the whole body. The former
                                    are furnished with a short, retractile ovipositor, seldom
                                    exserted, and lodged in a groove on the under side of the
                                    abdomen. But the ovipositor of the latter is often of
                                    considerable length, exceeding in some instances that of the
                                    whole body. It is composed of three parts; that in the centre is
                                    a slender flexile seta, of a corncoui substance, very smooth and
                                    shining, generally straight and rounded, rarely arcuate and
                                    compressed, and most commonly of a rufous or castaneous colour.
                                    It is provided with a longitudinal central canal, through which
                                    the eggs are propelled. The apex is often compressed and
                                    dilated, and impressed with transverse inequalities; it is
                                    frequently compressed throughout its whole length, and
                                    occasionally <pb break="no" facs="nls:193748131"

                                    each side of this central seta is placed another, adapted, by
                                    the concavity of the inner surface, to enclose it as in a
                                    sheath. These lateral appendages are generally punctate and
                                    pubescent externally, and somewhat incrassate towards the apex.
                                    They issue from the terminal segment of the abdomen; but the
                                    central tube or oviduct originates in the interior, and must
                                    necessarily be connected with the viscera, to whose contents it
                                    forms the outlet.</p>
                                <p>When a female Ichneumon, furnished with an apparatus of the kind
                                    just described, has discovered the retreat of a larva or pupa,
                                    in which she wishes to deposit her eggs, she stations herself
                                    immediately over the spot, and raising her abdomen to a vertical
                                    position, bends the ovipositor under her belly, and thrusts it
                                    into the aperture. This operation is much facilitated by the
                                    great flexibility of the instrument, and the ease with which it
                                    can be accommodated to any circumstances in which it requires to
                                    be employed. It penetrates to a considerable depth into the body
                                    of the larva, lest the eggs, by being placed near the surface,
                                    should be thrown off when the skin is changed. Upon their
                                    exclusion from the egg, the parasitical young make their way
                                    still farther into the interior of the larva, consuming the fat
                                    that surrounds the muscles and viscera, but carefully abstaining
                                    from doing injury to the vital organs. In this state they are
                                    gregarious, and were found by Réaumur (who has given a figure of
                                    a caterpillar so infested) to be arranged in regular rows in the
                                    interior of the caterpillar. When they have arrived at maturity,
                                    they undergo their destined change either in the body of the
                                    larva which served them as a matrix, or, gnawing a passage
                                    through its skin, they construct externally their silk cocoons,
                                    and are then converted into pupae, from which, after a longer or
                                    shorter period, they emerge in their declared or perfect
                                    form.</p>
                                <p>A still more remarkable method of rearing its offspring is
                                    adopted by the <hi rend="italic">Ophian luteus</hi><hi

                                    elongated pedicle or foot-stalk. When the larvae are evolved,
                                    they do not enter the body of the caterpillar, but remain
                                    attached to the columnar appendage, through which they extract,
                                    by suction, the juices necessary for their sustenance. The
                                    caterpillar dies before it assumes the pupa state, but this
                                    event in no case proves fatal to the larvae, as it either does
                                    not occur till they require no further nourishment, or they
                                    avail themselves of that principle of accommodation to existing
                                    circumstances, which insects possess in such a remarkable
                                    degree, and undergo their destined changes as soon as their

                                    are so entirely engrossed, that regard for their own safety
                                    appears to abandon them. They occur in flowers, on the trunks of
                                    trees, and on ants, also on walls and in houses; but their
                                    favourite P aces of resort are the flowers of umbelliferous
                                    plants. The species furnished with a long ovipositor usually
                                    frequent walls and the trunks of trees, for it is in these
                                    situations that they find the larvae on which a singular
                                    instinct leads them to deposit their eggs.</p>
                                <p>Our knowledge is obscure regarding the food of these insects in
                                    the perfect state; but it appears to be derived from the
                                    vegetable rather than the animal kingdom. We kept one alive,
                                    however, during the greater part of a winter on calf-foot jelly.
                                    They have often been observed to examine carefully with their
                                    mouths the pollen of plants; and it is probable that the pollen,
                                    or rather the honey, of flowers, affords them nourishment.
                                    Indeed it is expressly affirmed by Fabricius, that it is this
                                    material which forms their food. They do not seem to attack or
                                    devour other insects, or larvae, or spiders, but associate with
                                    them without offering the least annoyance. It is likely,
                                    therefore, that those authors who assert that they are of
                                    predatory habits, mistook for Ichneumons certain species of an
                                    allied group (<hi rend="italic">Spheges</hi><hi rend="italic"
                                    >∖</hi> to which they bear resemblance. WTienever they attack a
                                    larvae, it is not for the purpose of employing it as food, but
                                    to convert it into a matrix for the reception of their young.
                                    But, though they do not devour spiders, as has been asserted,
                                    that insidious tribe of creatures is by no means exempted from
                                    their destructive visits,—for they oviposit either on the
                                    spiders’ eggs, or on the dense silky web in which these are
                                    frequently enveloped; and the larvae when excluded consume the
                                    substance of the eggs, and are then changed into nymphs and
                                    perfect insects within that silken chamber, so carefully
                                    constructed for a far different purpose.</p>
                                <p>The larvae of the Ichneumonides are without feet. The tissue of
                                    their cocoons is of fine silk, usually of a beautiful yellow, or
                                    pure white, according to the species. Some, however, are banded
                                    with brown and yellow. We have already stated that their
                                    positions are various. A remarkable instance is occasionally met
                                    with of a <hi rend="italic">suspended</hi> cocoon. It hangs to
                                    the leaves or twigs of the oak-tree, fastened at one extremity
                                    by a silken cord. This cocoon is farther remarkable for the
                                    manner in which it executes little springs, several inches in
                                    height. These are no doubt occasioned by the enclosed larva,
                                    which probably has space enough within to admit of its body
                                    being bent and retorted, after the fashion of the little worms
                                    which we sometimes see vaulting within the hollow walls of an
                                    old cheese.</p>
                                <p>Several Ichneumons are apterous. These Linnaeus placed with the
                                    Mutillae. Degeer describes one which proceeded from a ligneous
                                    gall which he found upon the stalk of a species of Potentiíla.
                                    It first attracted his notice by two inflated conical pieces,
                                    pointed at the end, attached to the upper and posterior portion
                                    of the thorax, and directed backwards. They were moveable at the
                                    base, and the insect worked them about in all directions while
                                    itself in motion. It was extremely small, and leapt with great
                                    activity. As its hinder thighs were not enlarged, Degeer
                                    inferred that its springs were produced by curving its abdomen,
                                    and then pressing that part forcibly against the plane of its
                                    position.</p>
                                <p>In regard to the situations most favourable for collecting
                                    Ichneumonides, we may observe, that wherever other insects,
                                    especially in the larva state, abound, there also we may expect
                                    to find multitudes of these parasitical depredators. Having so
                                    greatly extended our general observations on this interesting

                                    as an anomalous fact in the history of Ichneumons, is more
                                    apparent than real, and arises, in some instances, from the
                                    distinctive marks of sex being so slight as to elude
                                    observation, while in others the sexes are so dissimilar that
                                    each of them is received as a different species. The
                                    détermination of the sexes is impeded by the difficulty of
                                    observing their intercourse. “Nunquam mihi successit,” says
                                    Gravenhorst, “par copula junctum aut copulam parans invenire,

                                <p>This insect, which is the largest of the European Ichneumonides,
                                    occurs not unfrequently in many parts of Europe. It is found in
                                    England; and in Scotland it has been observed in Roxburghshire,
                                    and near Edinburgh. “On the first of October,” says Gravenhorst,
                                    “I observed many females of this species on the decaying trunk
                                    of a willow, about to deposit their eggs. They traversed with
                                    much assiduity the barkless trunk, which was perforated with
                                    numerous holes, inhabited no doubt by the larvae of other
                                    insects; and so free were they from apprehension, that when I
                                    touched them with my finger they did not fly off, but only
                                    slightly averted their bodies. They searched out and examined
                                    the holes by means of their antennae, which were vibrating
                                    incessantly, and exploring on all sides. When they had selected
                                    a hole, they: stationed themselves with the four anterior legs
                                    over it, and raising the body as high as possible, and the
                                    abdomen perpendicularly, bent the ovipositor downward in such a
                                    .manner that it passed under the belly and thorax, and entered
                                    the hole over which they stood. It not unfre∙ quently happened,
                                    when the hole was sufficiently large, that the whole abdomen was
                                    inserted, and the head, feet, and thorax were the only parts of
                                    the insects which remained free. Frequently also a contest took
                                    place between two females for the possession of a hole; but they
                                    did not employ their mandibles on these occasions, their
                                    fighting consisting entirely of violent concussions of their
                                    bodies, and strokes of the feet, till the weaker party
                                    retreated. When a female had obtained full possession of a hole,
                                    no attack could displace her; but she retained her seat even
                                    though assailed by a more powerful antagonist.”</p>

                                <p>These have only a single nervure on the lower wings; the upper
                                    pair offer a few areolets or cells, viz. two at the base—the
                                    brachial, of which the internal is usually incomplete or
                                    slightly marked,—one radial and triangular,— and two or three
                                    cubital,—of which the second, in such as have three, is always

                                    the posterior margin of the wing. The antennae are either of
                                    equal thickness, or increase towards the termination, but not
                                    elub-shaped, and are composed of from thirteen to fifteen
                                    articulations, the number when different in the sexes being
                                    generally greater in the males. These insects form the old genus

                                    attached near the origin of the abdomen. It is minutely

                                    groove. The palpi are extremely short. The radial cell is
                                    usually wanting, and there is never more than a single cubital
                                    cell, which is not closed. The antennae have not more than
                                    twelve articulations. The modern genera are very numerous,
                                    though all related to the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                    >Chalcis</hi> of Fab. The species are extremely small,
                                    brilliantly ornamented with metallic colours. Many of them are
                                    leapers. The ovipositor is generally composed of three threads,
                                    like that of the Ichneumons, and is salient. The larvae likewise
                                    resemble those of that tribe in being parasitical, and some of
                                    them are so minute as to be able to dwell at large in the
                                    interior of insect eggs, themselves scarcely visible to the

                                    terminated by a tubular and conical ovipositor, sometimes
                                    internal and exsertile, proceeding like a sting from the anal
                                    extremity, sometimes permanently external, and forming a kind of
                                    tail. The antennae are composed of from ten to fifteen
                                    articulations, and are in some cases filiform or slightly
                                    enlarged towards the extremity, in others clubbed in the

                                    resemble in their construction the tubes of a telescope, and are

                                    moving about in a state of great vivacity, almost of agitation,

                                    Their antennae are filiform, geniculate, vibra-ile, and composed
                                    of thirteen articulations in both sexes. The mandibles are
                                    arched, narrow, and pointed. The maxillary palpi are usually
                                    longer than the labial, filiform, and composed of five unequal
                                    articulations ;—the labial consist of three. The ligula is for
                                    the most part emargi-ιιate. The thorax is semicylindrical, and
                                    exhibits several impressed and transverse lines. The abdomen in
                                    the greater number is semi-oval, truncated at the base, and
                                    appears at first sight as if attached to the thorax by its
                                    entire breadth. The terminal segment is frequently marked by
                                    large punctures, and terminates in dentations.</p>

                                distinguished from the preceding by the want of an ovipositor. That
                                organ is represented by a sting composed of three parts, concealed
                                and retractile. It is characteristic of the females, and likewise
                                exists in those individuals (imperfect in a sexual point of view)
                                commonly called neuters, which constitute so important a feature in

                                ejecting an acid liquid, elaborated and contained in special

                                antennae, composed of a constant number of articulations, that is,
                                thirteen in the males and twelve in the females. The palpi are
                                usually filiform; those of the maxillae, which are frequently the
                                longer, have six articulations,—the labial only four. The mandibles
                                of the males are smaller, and generally less toothed, than in the
                                others·. All the wings are veined. The abdomen, united to the thorax
                                by a thread or pedicle, is composed of seven segments in the males,
                                and of six in the females.</p>

                                according to the different kinds. Latreille divides the section into

                                    presence or absence of the wings, and in other particulars. In
                                    all, the antennae are geniculate, and the ligula small, rounded
                                    and hollowed, or spoon-shaped.</p>
                                <p>Some live in society, and consist of three kinds of individuals,
                                    of which two, that is, the males and females, are winged, and
                                    the third or neuters are apterous, <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi>
                                    In the two latter kinds the antennae gradually increase in

                                    least the third part of their total extent; the second is almost
                                    as long as the third, and has the form of a reversed cone. The
                                    labrum of the neuters is large and corneous, and falls
                                    perpendicularly beneath the mandibles. These Hymenoptera

                                    of the Mutillae seem little known. We are not ourselves
                                    acquainted with the nature of their metamorphosis. They love
                                    warm sunny places, and sandy soils. The females being apterous,
                                    are always found pon the ground, concealed under stones, or
                                    lurking in little holes. The males are seen on flowers, or by

                                    females. The genus is extensive, Olivier and Klug having

                                    winged in both sexes, and of solitary habits. The legs of
                                    several are adapted for digging. The ligula is always more or
                                    less widened at the extremity, and never filiform or sectaceous.
                                    The wings are always extended. The old genus <hi

                                <p>The females of these insects deposit their eggs in little
                                    prepared chambers in the earth or in wood, and place alongside
                                    of them a supply of insects or their larvae. They also pierce
                                    spiders with their stings, and close them up as provision for
                                    their young. The larvae are without feet, and spin a cocoon
                                    before passing into the nympha state. T⅛ <hi rend="superscript">

                                    assume in several the form of a trunk. The numerous minor genera
                                    derived in recent times from the genus just named, are

                                    distant from the origin of the upper wings. The legs are always
                                    short, or of moderate length. The head, seen from above, appears
                                    transverse, and the eyes extend as far as the exterior border.
                                    The abdomen forms an elongated semi-cone, rounded on the sides,
                                    near the base. 1he labrum is entirely exposed, or very salient.

                                    posteriorly, almost always varied with black and yellow, or
                                    reddish, and smooth. The antennae are approximate at the base,
                                    slightly geniculate at the second article, and enlarged towards
                                    the extremity. The mandibles are narrow, lengthened, dentated on
                                    the inner side, and crossed. The tibiae and tarsi are provided
                                    with little spines or cilia, which are particularly obvious on
                                    the anterior tarsi of the females. There are frequently one or
                                    two raised teeth beneath the abdomen of the male. The flight of
                                    these insects is extremely rapid, and they dart from flower to
                                    flower with a sharp and interrupted sound. Several species smell
                                    of the odour of roses.</p>

                                    fierceness, and endeavours to thrust its sting through its

                                    the hardness of the Parnopes’s skin. Others have the maxillary

                                    published a monograph, forming an exception.</p></note> The
                                    antennae are generally geniculate, and elubbed, or enlarged
                                    towards the extremity. The eyes are emarginate. The prothorax is
                                    prolonged posteriorly on each side to the origin of the wings,
                                    of which the superior have three or two closed cubital cells,
                                    the second of which receives the two recurrent nervures. The
                                    body is smooth, or nearly so, black, and more or less spotted
                                    with yellow or fawn colour. Many of the species dwell in
                                    temporary societies, composed of three kinds of individuals,
                                    males, females, and workers or neuters. A few females which have
                                    withstood the rigour of the winter season commence the building
                                    of the nest, and attend to the young first produced, which are
                                    usually neuters—and these speedily aid their parent in all
                                    matters of household management. The family is composed of two
                                    tribes.</p>

                                <p>In these the antennae seem at first sight to be composed of only
                                    eight articulations; the eighth forming with the ensuing ones an
                                    almost solid mass, rounded or obtuse at the end, with the
                                    articulations indistinct. The ligula is terminated by two
                                    threads capable of being withdrawn within a tube formed by its
                                    base. The upper wings have only two complete cubital cells. The
                                    middle of the anterior margin of the elypeus is emarginate, and
                                    receives the labrum in that emargination. The genera are few in
                                    number. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Masaris</hi> proper (Plate
                                    CCXXXII. fig. 17), the antennae, a little longer than the head
                                    and thorax, have the first article lengthened, and the eighth
                                    forming an obconic elub, rounded at the extremity. The abdomen
                                    is long. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Celonites,</hi> Lat. the
                                    antennae are scarcely longer than the head, and their first two
                                    articulations are much shorter than the third; the eighth and
                                    following form an almost globular body. The abdomen is scarcely
                                    longer than the thorax.</p>

                                <p>In these the antennae always exhibit distinctly thirteen
                                    articulations in the male and twelve in the female, and
                                    terminate in an elongated mass, pointed, and sometimes hooked
                                    (in the males) at the end; they are always geniculate, at least
                                    in the females and neuters. The ligula is sometimes divided into
                                    four plumose filaments, sometimes into three lobes, having four
                                    glandular points at the end, one on each lateral lobe, and the
                                    two others on the intermediate one, which is larger, widened,
                                    and emarginate or biful at the extremity. The mandibles are
                                    strong and dentated.- The elypeus is large. Beneath the labrum
                                    there is a little piece in the form of a ligula, analogous to
                                    that which Réaumur observed in certain bees (bourdons), and

                                    are only two. The labial palpi are moreover longer than those of
                                    the maxillae. The species occur in South Africa, and the warmer

                                <p>In all the following genera the superior wings are folded, and
                                    present three complete cubital cells.</p>
                                <p>Sometimes the mandibles are much longer than broad, and
                                    approximate anteriorly in the form of a rostrum. The ligula is
                                    narrow and elongate. The clypeus is nearly heart-shaped or oval,
                                    with the point anterior, and more or less truncate. All the
                                    species arc solitary, and each is composed of only males and
                                    females. The latter provision their young both before their
                                    birth and during the continuance of the larva state. Their nests
                                    are usually formed of earth, and are either concealed in the
                                    holes of walls, beneath the ground, in old wood, or are
                                    external, and placed on plants. Each nest contains a supply of
                                    caterpillars or other larvae, which the female piles up in a
                                    circular form. She sometimes also stores up spiders, which she
                                    has the precaution previously to pierce with her sting.</p>

                                    is divided into four long plumose filaments, without glandular
                                    points at their extremity. The mandibles of some of the males
                                    are very large. The species arc few in number, and
                                    characteristic of Africa. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Eumenes,</hi>

                                    thicker at the base. Such are <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                    >Pterochile</hi> of Klug, remarkable for the great length of the

                                    The female perforates deep holes in sand, or in the plaster of
                                    walls, at the orifice of which she forms an outer tube, at first

                                    arranged in thick contorted threads. In the cavity of the

                                    scaffolding. The abdomen in others has its first segment narrow
                                    and elongat’d in the form of a pear, and the second bell-shaped.

                                    resembling paper or pasteboard in its nature, and construct
                                    nests containing horizontal combs suspended from above by one or
                                    more pedicles; on the inferior side there is a range of vertical
                                    cells in the form of hexagonal and truncated pyramids. These

                                    nymphs. The amount of combs forming the same nest varies; and
                                    the nest itself is sometimes open or exposed, sometimes
                                    surrounded by an envelope, pierced by a common and almost always
                                    central opening, which corresponds with a string of holes for

                                    according to the species.</p>
                                <p>The females commence their labours in spring, and in the first
                                    place in a state of solitude. In a nest of small dimensions they
                                    deposit the eggs of neuters or workers, which, as soon as they
                                    are hatched and attain maturity, enlarge the dwelling, and
                                    assist in rearing additional members of the body politic. For a
                                    considerable time the society consists only of the original
                                    founder of the colony, that is, the female parent, and of
                                    neuters. Towards the end of summer or beginning of autumn, young
                                    males are hatched, along with additional females. But all such
                                    larvae and nymphs as have not completed their final
                                    metamorphosis before the month of November are murdered by the
                                    neuters, and torn from their cells. These destroyers are
                                    themselves ere long destroyed, in common with the males, by the
                                    first frosts of winter. The latter sex never work. A few females
                                    alone survive the rigours of the winter season, and these again,
                                    on the return of spring, become each the founder of a new but
                                    equally transitory empire. Of the death and desolation which is

                                    monarchical as that of bees. It partakes rather of the
                                    republican order, as many females dwell together in amity during
                                    the autumnal season. These Vespae are almost omnivorous. They
                                    prey on other insects, on flesh and fruits of every kind,
                                    especially when ripe and sweet. They appear to an uninstructed
                                    eye as very gluttonous; but their apparent greed becomes more
                                    excusable, when we consider that they are catering, not f&lt;)ζ

                                    they shut up their cells, and fabricate a cocoon.</p>

                                    Its combs contain an excellent honey, resembling in consistence
                                    that of our own domestic species, but possessing at times the
                                    singular quality of rendering those who eat it furious, or void
                                    of reason. It has been known from ancient times that common
                                    honey is occasionally possessed of very deleterious properties,
                                    arising probably from the nature or condition of the flowers
                                    from which it is collected. The naturalist just named, and two
                                    men by whom he was accompanied, nearly perished in consequence
                                    of eating of the Brazilian honey in its poisonous state.</p>
                                <p>In other wasps the superior portion of the inner margin of the
                                    mandibles, or that which succeeds the angle, is as long if not
                                    longer than the other portion of that margin. The central part
                                    of the front of the clypeus is widely truncated. The abdomen is
                                    always ovoid or conical. These constitute the genus <hi

                                    builds its nest in sheltered places, such as barns, old walls,
                                    wooden posts, and hollow trees. It is of a roundish shape,
                                    composed of coarse materials, and resembles an old leaf in
                                    colour. This species devours other insects, and robs bees of
                                    their honey. Though a well-known English insect, it has not yet
                                    been found in Scotland. The common wasp, <hi rend="italic">V.

                                    combs, and is sheltered in a hole in the earth. <hi

                                    saucer. It is sometimes observed abroad, in barns, or attached
                                    to the beams of garrets, and has even been found in hives. It is

                                    collecting the pollen of flowers.<note anchored="true"

                                    groups from those of every other family of insects. The first
                                    articulation of the tarsi of the hinder legs is very large,
                                    compressed, and in the form of a square pallet, or of a reversed
                                    triangle. The maxillae and the labium are usually very long, and
                                    constitute a kind of trunk. The ligula is generally shaped like
                                    the head of a lance, or resembles a lengthened filament, of
                                    which the extremity is silken or hairy. The larvae are fed
                                    exclusively on honey, or the fecundating pollen of flowers. The
                                    perfect insects restrict their own diet to the nectareous juices
                                    of flowers, and (when Flora’s kingdom has fallen before the
                                    approach of winter) to the secretion which they form from these,
                                    which we call honey. These Hymenoptera, embracing the great
                                    genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Apis</hi> of Linnaeus, are divided by
                                    Latreille into two sections.</p>

                                    females. Their mandibles are simple, or termi nated at most by
                                    two dentations. The labial palpi resem ble the maxillary, and
                                    the latter have six articulations. The ligula is divided into
                                    three portions, of which the lateral are short, and in the form
                                    of auricles. The niajorit&gt; of the females collect the pollen
                                    of plants by means of th hairs of their hinder legs, and mixing

                                    or in fields, and o’ considerable depth. In these they place
                                    their paste, and depositing an egg along with it, they close up
                                    the entrance with earth.</p>
                                <p>Some have the middle division of the ligula widened at the
                                    extremity, almost heart-shaped, and doubled in repose. Such is

                                    to several other species of analogous habits. The interior of
                                    these nests contains about a dozen cells, in each of which the

                                    construction of their nests perfectly oval or circular pieces of
                                    leaves, which they cut out with the most remarkable dexterity.
                                    These pieces are conveyed to their straight cylindrical holes,
                                    which they previously excavate in the earth, or sometimes in
                                    walls, or the decayed trunk of an old tree. They line the bottom
                                    of the cavity with these cuttings, and form a thimble-shaped
                                    cell (ibid. fig. 27), in which they deposit the honeyed
                                    provision on which the larva is destined to feed. After laying
                                    an egg, they close the cell by means of a flattish or slightly
                                    concave lid, also formed of a portion of leaf. These little
                                    cells are repeated one over the other till the hole is filled
                                    up. To this division of the genus belongs the <hi rend="italic"

                                    by Latreille. In the genus Os-MiA of Panzer the maxillary palpi
                                    consist of four articulations, or at least of three very
                                    distinct ones, and the abdomen is convex above. The habits of

                                    considerably, and polishes the interior. The genus is composed

                                    their bodies are almost smooth and coloured like those of wasps,
                                    sometimes partially clothed or hairy. The labrum assumes the
                                    form of a lengthened and truncated triangle, or is short and
                                    almost semicircular. The mandibles are narrow, ending in a
                                    point, and at most uni-dentated on the inner side. The
                                    paraglossae are often long, narrow, and setiform. The scutellum
                                    in several is emarginate or bidentated; in others it is
                                    tubercular. These insects correspond to the <hi rend="italic"

                                    is inserted nearer to the internal angle of its extremity than
                                    to the opposite one. The outer side of that first angle, as well
                                    as the corresponding part of the tibiae, is furnished with thick
                                    and close-set hairs, forming, especially in several exotic

                                    receives a recurrent nervure.</p>
                                <p>Sometimes the maxillary palpi consist of from four to six

                                    nests either under ground, or in the clefts of old walls.
                                    Several prefer ground which has been cut perpendicularly, and

                                <p>Our second principal division of the Apiariae is constituted by
                                    many interesting insects, such as the garden and humble bees, so
                                    remarkable for their peculiar <hi rend="italic">regime,</hi> and
                                    the gregarious habits of the species, each of which consists of
                                    three kinds of individuals—males, females, and neuters, as the
                                    workers are often called. The posterior tibiae of these last
                                    named are furnished on their external face with a smooth
                                    depression called the basket, in which they place the pollen <pb

                                    with which the inner face of the first joint of the posterior
                                    tarsi is provided. The maxillary palpi are very small, and
                                    consist of a single articulation. The antennae are
                                    geniculate.</p>
                                <p>Sometimes the posterior tibiae are terminated by two spines, as
                                    in the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Euglossa,</hi> Lat. (Plate
                                    CCXXXII. fig. 26), which has the labrum square, and the false
                                    proboscis, or prolonged parts of the mouth, as long as the body.
                                    The labial palpi terminate in a point formed by the two other
                                    articulations. The species are peculiar to South America.
                                    Latreille supposes that we owe to the one which we have here

                                    esteemed in the Antilles. We are still ignorant of the habits of
                                    these insects. In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Bombus</hi>
                                    (ibid. fig. 29), the species of which we recognise in this
                                    country as <hi rend="italic">humble-bees,</hi> the labrum is
                                    transverse, and the proboscis obviously shorter than the body.
                                    The second articulation of the labial palpi terminates in a
                                    point, bearing the two others on its outer side. There are few
                                    associations of our childhood more deep and lasting than those
                                    connected with the pursuit and capture of these beautiful
                                    creatures, some of which are remarkable for their size, and the
                                    rich contrast which they exhibit of velvet black and crimson,
                                    with bars of brilliant yellow. This splendid attire, however,
                                    saves them not from being rudely handled; and we remember the
                                    day when an artificial <hi rend="italic">bink,</hi> that is, a
                                    little box made of clay, with a piece of glass at one end, and a

                                <p>Be this as it may, the species of the genus Bombus inhabit
                                    subterranean dwellings, assembled together in social groups
                                    amounting to from fifty to sixty individuals, or even in certain
                                    cases to between two and three hundred. These unions, however,
                                    differ from those of the honey or garden-bee in this, that they
                                    are dissolved, like those of wasps, on the approach of winter.
                                    They consist of <hi rend="italic">males,</hi> distinguished by
                                    the smallness of their size, their feebler heads, their narrower
                                    mandibles, terminated by two dentations, and bearded, as we11 as
                                    by their frequent difference of colour; of <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Jemales,</hi> which are larger than the other individuals, and
                                    have spoon-shaped mandibles; and of <hi rend="italic"
                                    >workers,</hi> of which the mandibles are likewise spoon-shaped,
                                    and the size intermediate between the two preceding kinds. Of
                                    these workers, Réaumur was the first to distinguish two
                                    varieties,-—one comparatively large and strong, the other
                                    smaller, but more lively and active. This curious fact was
                                    afterwards verified by Huber the younger. According to the
                                    observations of the Genevese observer, several of the workers
                                    born in spring couple during the month of June with males sprung
                                    from a common mother, and soon afterwards deposit eggs, from
                                    which, however, males alone are produced. These latter couple
                                    with the females which are born towards the end of the season,
                                    and which continuing through the winter in a pregnant state,
                                    become each the founder of a colony in spring. In the mean time,
                                    all the others perish, without excepting even the smaller
                                    females. The workers, then, though, in common with those of the
                                    garden-bee, often called neuters, are in fact females, but of
                                    smaller size than the more regular mothers, and with the
                                    productive faculty imperfectly developed. No sooner has the
                                    genial influence of spring penetrated the mossy cells where
                                    these more ponderous matrons have enjoyed their winter sleep,
                                    than they rouse themselves from their repose, and wing their
                                    dubious flight in search of the first opening crocus, or other
                                    garden flower; or, if remote from man, and destined to boom amid
                                    wild uplands or other pastoral wastes, the flowering <hi

                                    which so often skirt the edges of our mountain streams, and
                                    beautify the crystal waters by the reflection of their golden
                                    blossoms, afford them a sufficing food. The lover of nature
                                    knows how, even among sterile solitudes, a few bright sunny days
                                    call into life and beauty many fragrant flowers, not long
                                    unvisited by these glad labourers, who ere long settle in some
                                    fit abode, and lay the foundations of a future city.</p>
                                <p>The nests of humble-bees are generally formed beneath the earth,
                                    and at a depth of one or two feet. Dry plains, fields, sloping
                                    banks, and the sides of hills, are their common localities.
                                    These subterranean cavities are of considerable extent, wider
                                    than high, and in the form of a dome. The ceiling is constructed
                                    of earth and carded moss, carried thither fibre by fibre. The
                                    inner walls are plastered over by a coating of coarse wax.
                                    Sometimes a simple opening serves as a passage to the foot of
                                    the nest; sometimes a tortuous road, of one or two feet in
                                    length, leads to the habitation. The bottom of the cavity is
                                    lined with a layer of leaves, for the reception of the brood.
                                    The female first places in it masses of brown irregular wax,
                                    called <hi rend="italic">pâtée</hi> by Réaumur, and compared to
                                    truffles by that naturalist, on account of their shape and
                                    colour. Their cavities arc destined to contain the eggs and
                                    larvae. The latter live together in society until such time as
                                    they are ready to assume the nympha state; they then separate
                                    and spin ovoid silken cocoons, vertically fixed against each
                                    other. The nymph is always found in a reversed position, or with
                                    the head downwards, like those of the females of the honey-bee;
                                    and the cocoons are uniformly pierced at their lower end when
                                    the perfect insect escapes from its prison. Réaumur asserted
                                    that the larvae fed upon the wax which formed the walls of their

                                    protection from cold and moisture; and the actual food consists
                                    of an ample provi<pb break="no" facs="nls:193748326"

                                    honey, which the labourers provide for the helpless objects of
                                    their instinctive affection. When the supply is exhausted, they
                                    pierce the cover of the cells, put in an additional supply, and
                                    reclose the protecting habitation. We may truly observe, in
                                    relation to these delightful labours, that it is not alone in
                                    the “ great waters” that man may behold the wonderful works of
                                    an omnipotent Creator ; for literally the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >earth</hi> is “ full of his goodness.” These affectionate
                                    labourers, so pervaded by the instincts of maternity, though
                                    themselves for the most part barren, watch like rejoicing
                                    mothers over the destiny of the future citizens ; and as soon as
                                    they perceive that a generous diet has increased their
                                    dimensions, they enlarge the size of their habitations. We find
                                    moreover in these nests three or four small bodies resembling
                                    goblets, composed of brown wax, or of the same consistence as
                                    the <hi rend="italic">patée,</hi> always open, and more or less
                                    filled with good honey. The exact situation in the hive of these
                                    honey jars is by no means constant. It has been said that the
                                    workers make use of the empty cocoons for the same purpose ; but
                                    their doing so is deemed very doubtful by Latreille, in as far
                                    as these cocoons are not only formed of a silky substance, but
                                    are perforated on the under side.</p>
                                <p>The larvae are hatched in about five days after the deposition of
                                    the eggs, and accomplish their metamorphoses in the months of
                                    May and June. It was formerly supposed that labourers alone were
                                    produced at this period ; but we have already alluded to the
                                    simultaneous production of a certain number of males. The
                                    labourers immediately proceed to assist the female founder in
                                    her operations ; and from this period the number of cells which
                                    serve as habitations for the larvae and nymphs is greatly
                                    augmented. They form irregular combs, rising in stages, on the
                                    edges of which the pâtée of Réaumur is particularly observable.
                                    According to Huber, the workers are extremely greedy of the eggs
                                    of the female, and sometimes in her absence open the cells in
                                    which they are deposited, in order to suck the milky fluid they
                                    contain ! a most extraordinary fact, as La- treille observes,
                                    and one which seems to belie the noted attachment which they
                                    entertain for the germs of that race of which they are the
                                    natural and appointed guardians. The wax secreted by humble-bees
                                    is elaborated by the same peculiar process as that which
                                    produces the more beautiful material with which the garden
                                    species constructs its honeyed cells. It in fact results from
                                    honey, transuded through the intervals of the rings of the
                                    abdomen.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                                    The insect before us,” says Mr Kirby, “differs so slightly from
                                    the description which 0. Fabricius has given of that which he
                                    mistook for the <hi rend="italic">Apis alpinα</hi> of Linné,
                                    that there can be little or no doubt of their identity. He
                                    confesses that his specimens (and this bee appears to have
                                    abounded in West Greenland, as it was also observed to do in
                                    Melville Island, and wherever the expedition landed within the
                                    arctic circle) did not in all things agree with the characters
                                    assigned to that species. But he states, that as Linné had seen
                                    only a single specimen, he did not think himself at liberty to
                                    make a new species on account of an insignificant difference.
                                    Although, however, Linné had seen this bee only once, it has
                                    since been more frequently taken ; and having received specimens
                                    of it from Sweden, through the kindness of Major Gyllenhal,
                                    which agree with the Linnaean description in every point but
                                    size (a circumstance easily explained, by supposing the original
                                    specimen a queen and those sent to me neuters), I can venture to
                                    assert that the two insects are perfectly distinct. <hi

                                    vol. iv. p. 518. We shall merely observe, in regard to the
                                    conversion of the neuter or working bee into a queen-mother,
                                    that a great degree of obscurity seems still to pervade the
                                    writings of all entomologists, whenever that singular subject is
                                    touched upon. Nothing in the history of these creatures has been
                                    more clearly demonstrated than the fact of such convulsion,—but
                                    how a change of food should operate in the course of a few days
                                    a determinate change in the organic form and instinctive
                                    character of an insect, is as yet a mystery. We are more willing
                                    to believe than competent to understand several of Μ. Hubers
                                    tacts. It is easy to^conceive a greater development of
                                    particular organs, the germs of which previously existed, but
                                    the positive alteration in the structure of the feet and
                                    maxillae is not so readily accounted for. We still require some
                                    more precise and detailed information regarding this mysterious
                                    transmutation than the observations even of the Hubers have
                                    furnished. It would tend greatly to elucidate the subject if a
                                    series of comparisons could be made at different periods of
                                    their development, between the larvae, nymphs, and perfect

                                    that the domestic culture of the honey-bee is of an origin so
                                    remote as to be lost in the depth of ages. It served among the

                                    an imported species. Our land expeditions did not observe its

                                    journey westward, carried hives along with them. According to Mr
                                    Warden, the hive-bee was not found to the westward of the
                                    Mississippi prior to the year 1797 ; but it is now well known,
                                    and has been so for a considerable time, as high up the Missouri
                                    as the Maka nation,—having proceeded westward six hundred miles
                                    in fourteen years.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                                    Such a distance seems great for these tiny creatures to advance

                                    direction. It is at the rate of forty-three miles a year ; but
                                    they have perhaps been smitten by the Yankee passion for

                                    the hymenopterous order) is that called <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                    >Melipona</hi> by Illiger and Latreille. It is distinguished
                                    from the preceding genus by the form of the first articulation
                                    of the posterior tarsi, which is narrower at the base, or in the
                                    shape of a reversed triangle, and without striae on the silky
                                    brush of its interior face. The upper wings have only two
                                    complete cubital cells, while there are three in the genus Apis.
                                    These Hymenoptera inhabit South America, and build their nests,
                                    which resemble bagpipes, on the tops of trees, or in their
                                    cavities. Their honey is extremely sweet and agreeable, but very
                                    liquid, and apt to corrupt. The Indians form from it a favourite
                                    spirituous liquor. These details apply to <hi rend="italic">Μ.

                            a sheath or guard on either side of the tongue when rolled up. The

                            once precise and philosophical, that it is composed of the same pieces,
                            and that these pieces are peculiarly appropriated to the functions which
                            they are required to perform ; thus some parts of little use exist in a
                            merely rudimentary condition, while others of a more in-, dispensable
                            nature have gained an increase of development. The component parts are :
                            a labrum, often nearly invisible, conical, or subulated ; two corneous
                            mandibles, very small, rudimentary, hairy, or garnished with small
                            scales, and fixed, or apparently useless ; two corneous maxillae, in the
                            form of tubular threads, generally much extended, and soldered together
                            as far as the origin of the palpi, and forming by the union of their
                            inner <hi rend="subscript"> ¼</hi> edges the trunk or sucker, of which
                            the interior presents three canals ; two maxillary palpi, often almost
                            imperceptible, consisting of from one to three articulations, and
                            inserted near the bend of the maxillae ; two labial or inferior palpi of
                            three articulations, closely set with hairs or scales, and rising on
                            each side of the trunk, of which they form a kind of sheath. The labium
                            is composed of a single piece, flat, and triangular.</p>
                        <p>The antennae vary in the different groups, but they are always composed
                            of a great number of articulations. In the diurnal tribes they are
                            simple, and generally terminated by a small inflation or knob ; in the
                            crepuscular they assume the form of an elongated or fusiform mass ; in
                            the nocturnal they arc filiform or setaceous, whether pectinated or
                            simple, and often plumose, especially in the males. In many species we
                            find a pair of stemmatic eyes concealed among the scales, and placed
                            between the ordinary eyes or organs of vision. The latter are
                            hemispherical, of considerable size, and composed of innumerable
                            facettes. The trunk is either ineffective or altogether wanting in some
                            of the crepuscular and nocturnal tribes. The three segments of which the
                            thorax of many other hexapod insects is visibly composed, seem here
                            united into one,—the anterior being very short and transversal, as in
                            the hymenopterous and dipterous orders. The form of the thorax is
                            extremely uniform, and any apparent variety of aspect is caused chiefly
                            by the extension of its hairy or sealycovering, which sometimes assumes
                            the shape of a crest. The abdomen is composed of from six to seven
                            segments. It is attached to the thorax by a very small portion of its
                            diameter, and never offers either sting or ovipositor, although in a few
                            females (as in <hi rend="italic">Cossus)</hi> the terminal rings are
                            narrow, and lengthened into the form of a pointed and retractile
                            oviduct. The scales of the wings, on which their gorgeous beauty
                            depends, are implanted by means of a small pedicle. Their figure is
                            variable. They are usually somewhat elongated, rounded at the base from
                            the side of the pedicle, and truncated at the outer extremity, which is
                            generally toothed or serrated. The under wings frequently form on their
                            inner margins a kind of canal for the reception of the abdomen. Among
                            many of the diurnal kinds, the four wings, in a state of repose, are
                            raised perpendicularly, so as to meet above the back ; in the two other
                            great sections they are horizontal or inclined ; and in these there is
                            often a strong spine or bristle on the anterior margin of the inferior
                            wings, which being received by a buckle-like process of the under
                            surface of the superior pair, maintains them in their position.</p>
                        <p>The legs of the Lepidoptera are as usual six in number, and the tarsi are
                            composed of five articulations, and are terminated by a pair of hooks.
                            In several diurnal genera the anterior pair are much shorter than the
                            others, are useless as locomotive organs, and are folded on the sides of
                            the chest ; their tarsi being large, indistinctly articulated, and
                            destitute of apparent hooks. The existence of the sense of smell in the
                            class of insects is clearly demonstrated by the habits of many species
                            of this order. The males of many nocturnal Lepidoptera discover the
                            females of their own kind at a great distance, even when the latter are
                            carefully and intentionally concealed from sight. The female is
                            generally for the most part perceptibly, and in many instances
                            considerably, larger than the males. They deposit their eggs, by an
                            admirable and wisely granted instinct, not on the plants which they
                            themselves affect during their first buoyant courses, but on such as are
                            best adapted for the future nourishment of their crawling and wingless
                            offspring.</p>
                        <p>The larvae of Lepidoptera, usually known under the name of Caterpillars,
                            are composed of twelve annular segments, exclusive of the head. They are
                            furnished with nine stigmatic openings on each side, and the three
                            anterior segments of the body are respectively furnished with a pair of
                            short legs of a sealyconsistence, terminated by a hook, and
                            corresponding to the true legs of the perfect insect. There are,
                            besides, from four to ten membranous or false feet upon the other
                            segments. The body of caterpillars is generally elongated, soft, almost
                            cylindrical, and frequently adorned by bright or beautiful colours,
                            besides being variously provided with spines, hairs, or tubercles. Many
                            are however naked, or unprotected by any other than a cutaneous
                            covering. The head is harder than the other parts, and is covered by a
                            corneous or sealyskin. It presents on each side six small shining
                            grains, which are regarded as simple or stemmatic eyes ; and two very
                            short conical antennae are likewise perceptible. The mouth is composed
                            of two strong mandibles, a pair of maxillae, a labium, and four palpi.
                            The food of caterpillars consisting not of vegetable juices alone, but
                            of the actual substance of the leaves and roots, and even of the
                            well-matured woody fibres of timber trees, the masticating organs are
                            beautifully adapted to their functions. But no sooner is the creeping
                            and voracious larva about to transform itself into the “ angelic
                            butterfly,” which floats on gaudy <pb break="no" facs="nls:193748365"

                            sustains itself only on the most ethereal of their nectareous juices,
                            than the parts of the mouth undergo a change not less remarkable than
                            that of the general form and aspect, and the long tubular proboscis
                            above described is developed, in subservience to the habits of a new
                            existence. The change, however, is by no means sudden or immediate, but
                            is effected through the transitionary state of chrysalis, of which we
                            have already said perhaps more than enough in our attempted exposition
                            of the mysteries of transformation. We cannot, however, here avoid to
                            notice the elaboration of that silky substance which, towards the
                            termination of the caterpillar’s career, becomes so singular a feature
                            in its natural economy, and one of such vast importance in the
                            artificial <hi rend="italic">habits</hi> of the human race. It is formed
                            in two long tortuous interior vessels, which, becoming gradually more
                            slender at their upper extremities, terminate in a small conical spinner
                            at the end of the labium. Had these insignificant secreting organs not
                            existed in the silk-worm, or Other allied species, what a difference of
                            character would have been manifested in the lustrous aspect of baronial
                            halls, and even of the courts of kings ! It is curious, indeed, to
                            consider how the breeding of a few millions of caterpillars should
                            occasion such a disparity at different times in the circumstances of
                            different tribes of the human race. When the wife and empress of
                            Aurelian was refused a garment of silk, on account of its extreme
                            costliness, the most ordinary classes of the Chinese were clad in that
                            material from top to toe ; and although among ourselves week-day and
                            holiday are now alike profaned by uncouth forms, whose vast
                            circumference is clothed “ in silk attire,” yet our own James the Sixth
                            was forced to borrow a pair of silken hose from the Earl of Mar, that
                            his state and bearing might be more effective in the presence of the
                            ambassador of England,—“ for ye would not, sure,” said the royal pedant,
                            “ that your king should appear as a scrub before strangers.”<note

                        <p>Many caterpillars, in walking, fix the anterior feet on the plane of
                            their position, and, bending their body upwards, they advance and fix
                            their anal feet, assuming for a time the form of a loop. They then unfix
                            their anterior hold, and stretching forward their bodies, proceed as it
                            were by spanning the ground. They are hence called surveyors <hi
                            rend="italic">Çarpenteuses)</hi> by the French naturalists. Others,
                            known under the name of <hi rend="italic">Batons,</hi> fix themselves,
                            in repose, to twigs and branches by their hinder feet, and thus hold
                            themselves out stiff and immoveable for many successive hours. It may
                            easily be supposed that this extraordinary attitude must require the
                            exercise of, comparatively speaking, most enormous strength. No
                            vertebrated animal, not in a state of catalepsy, could sustain it even
                            for a few seconds. We find accordingly (through the laborious

                            >ligniperda,</hi> a species which lives in trees, but does not exercise
                            itself in the way alluded to, there are above 4000 muscles. Many move
                            along the ground rapidly by the successive motion of each segment, as if
                            a wave were flowing over or pervading their bodies. The intestines of
                            caterpillars consist of a large canal without inflections, the anterior
                            portion being sometimes slightly separated in the form of a stomach, and
                            the posterior forming <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> wrinkled cloaca.
                            There are also four very long biliary vessels, usually inserted pretty
                            far back.</p>
                        <p>The habits of caterpillars are very various in the different kinds.
                            Although a great majority feed on vegetable substances, many of the
                            smaller kinds are extremely de- structrve among stuffed birds, and all
                            kinds of woollens. I hey will even devour leather, lard, wax, wafers,
                            and all tatty matters. Many confine themselves to one particular
                            substance, while others are polyphagous. Some unite in society, and form
                            a silken tent to screen themselves from their natural enemies, and the
                            extremes of heat and cold ; others are independent and solitary. As they
                            increase in size they cast their skins, and this process of sloughing
                            generally takes place about four tinies. A great proportion, before
                            assuming the chrysalis state, spin around them a web or cocoon, more or
                            less compact according to their kind. In some (as in <hi rend="italic"
                            >Bombyx mori,</hi> or the silk-worm) it is of a rich saffron colour, and
                            of exquisite fineness; in others it is of a membranous texture, from
                            being originally more compactly glutinous, instead of consisting of
                            distinct threads. Many mingle with their funeral web or windingsheet,
                            particles of earth or decayed vegetable substances, which greatly
                            increase the size of their cocoons. The chrysalids of the diurnal
                            Lepidoptera are, however, naked or exposed, and are usually suspended by
                            the posterior extremity, or fastened by a silken cord or girth around
                            the middle of the body. They are also angular in their forms, while
                            those of moths are rounded or cylindrical. In one or two of the
                            crepuscular kinds, or Sphingides, the proboscis projects, and is
                            encircled by a separate envelope, even in the chrysalis state. All the
                            other parts are, however, swathed in a coriaceous covering, although the
                            form of the wings and other members may be traced externally, in slight
                            though distinct relief. The abdominal segments are capable of motion,
                            like the “ thews and sinews” of a warrior in plaited mail. The period of
                            repose varies from a few weeks to one or two years. Such as assume the
                            chrysalis state late in autumn, do not appear in the winged condition
                            till the ensuing spring. Many remain in the egg state all winter ; and
                            such diurnal Lepidoptera as have two <hi rend="italic">flights</hi> in
                            the year are generally produced in the first place in spring from
                            chrysalids which have lain torpid all winter, and become themselves the
                            parents of another flight, which make their appearance at a later period
                            of the same season. Thousands perish before attaining the perfect state,
                            not only as the natural food of most passerine birds, but as the living
                            bed of the Ichneumonides, which deposit their eggs in the fatty
                            substance of the caterpillar, and thus by degrees deprive it of the
                            source of life.</p>
                        <p>The observance of these and of other singularities, which we cannot here
                            detail, will afford a never-fading source of interest to the student of
                            nature’s mysteries, and will assuredly yield an ampler and more enduring
                            recompense than “ Pyrrhos’ maze or Epicurus’ stye.” In spite, however,
                            of all that has been said and written of the wonders of entomology (and
                            the subject, to be understood, must rather be seen than listened to, or
                            even reflected on through the pages of the best instructed author), we
                            fear that many continue to regard it with very inadequate notions. But
                            how may not piety itself revolt at the thought of the most numerous
                            works of an Almighty Creator s hand being regarded as trifling or
                            unworthy of a deep and most reverential consideration. When Solomon,
                            whose earthly glory never equalled the lustre of the <hi

                            as the most important parts of the creation that he drew his example:—“
                            Go to the <hi rend="italic">ant,</hi> thou sluggard ; consider <hi

                            impulse, he who is himself emphatically called the “ wisest of men.” Yet

                            folly and ignorance not seldom combine to illustrate whatever is mean,
                            insignificant, or worthless, by a reference to some unfortunate form of
                            insect life. Even the pious Newton (not Sir Isaac, but the author of <hi
                            rend="italic">Cardiphonia,</hi> whose name was John) somewhere likens
                            the extremest act of thoughtlessness and folly to a person breaking off
                            from some worldly and important presence to “ pursue a butterfly.” Did
                            the excellent author forget, or never know, that a butterfly is not only
                            in itself a creature of such exquisite beauty that neither the “ sea of
                            light,” nor any other of the most famous gems which ever from the brow
                            of an eastern tyrant dazzled the dark eye of a trembling slave, can
                            compare with it in varied and gorgeous lustre ;—or did he expunge from
                            his recollection that the same divine hand which formed man after his
                            own likeness, also created every other thing which breathes the breath
                            of life, and that all were declared <hi rend="italic">good</hi> when
                            seen by that eye, before whose brightness even the angels veil their
                            faces ? Compared with the eternal interests of man, we admit that all
                            earthly pursuits, including even the best and purest—those of
                            science—are as dust in the balance ; but, bearing in mind our higher
                            destiny, and yet believing that as there are celestial bodies and bodies
                            terrestrial, so we cannot be better occupied than in devoting a
                            convenient season to study (without which we cannot understand) the
                            works of God,—for “ the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of
                            the terrestrial is another,” and both, though differing from each other
                            in brightness, co-exist in divinest harmony, simply because</p>
                        <p>The hand that made them is itself divine.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, though ourselves among the most loyal of liege subjects, we
                            should not hesitate to pursue a butterfly, if wanting to our collection,
                            “ even in the presence of a crowned king.” But this, we fear, is a
                            digression.</p>
                        <p>In lepidopterous insects in the perfect state, we find a first lateral
                            stomach or crop,—a second, inflated or turgid, —a small intestine,
                            tolerably long,—and a caecum near the cloaca.</p>
                        <p>The order is naturally divisible into three families, viz. <hi
                            rend="smallcaps">Diurna,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Crepuscularia,</hi>
                            and <hi rend="smallcaps">Nocturna.</hi></p>

                            <p>FAMILY I.—DIURNA.</p>
                            <p>The insects of this family, commonly called Butterflies, are never
                                seen on the wing except during the day, and in a state of repose
                                usually hold their wings erect. Their antennae are capitated, or
                                terminated by a club or knob, with a few exceptions, such as the
                                splendid genus <hi rend="italic">Morpho,</hi> in which they are
                                almost filiform, and the Fabrici an genus <hi rend="italic"
                                >Urania,</hi> in which they become more slender towards their
                                extremities. The caterpillars have always sixteen feet, and the
                                chrysalids arc naked and angular. These are the only lepidopterous
                                insects in which we never find the exterior margin of the inferior
                                wings presenting a rigid seta or bristle, for the retention of the
                                superior pair.</p>
                            <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Papilio</hi> of Linnaeus, divided into
                                certain sections, contained the whole of that splendid and
                                infinitely-varied tribe which we call Butterflies, of which the
                                species are so numerous and diversified that naturalists soon felt
                                the necessity of multiplying the genera, both because it was right
                                so to do, and for the mere convenience of restricting the amount of
                                species contained in each. In the later editions of the <hi

                                Butterflies, or diurnal Lepidoptera, were divided into six
                                phalanges. The first, called <hi rend="italic">Equites</hi> (which
                                now correspond to the true genus <hi rend="italic">Papilio,</hi> as
                                restricted by Latreillc), was divided into <hi rend="italic"
                                >Troes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Achivi,</hi> a division since
                                ascertained to be rather unfortunate in some respects, in as far as
                                it occasionally separates the males and females of the same species
                                ; the second was named <hi rend="italic">Heliconii;</hi> the third

                                Degeer and Olivier likewise so far follow Linnaeus as to retain the

                                in consequence of his generic characters being drawn from the

                                which are of little or no value, except for the formation of
                                artificial sections, or the discrimination of species. In the
                                earlier works of Fabricius, scarcely any alterations were made in

                                has since successfully applied the same method to all the European
                                species. Our ignorance of the history of the greater proportion of
                                exotic groups has unfortunately retarded the more general

                                science. Even in our own country, where natural history is so
                                sparingly patronised, and so lightly valued, this beautiful branch
                                of zoology has been rather sumptuously exhibited, and the names of

                            <p>Contains all those butterflies which have but a single pair of spurs
                                or spines to their tibiae, and placed at the posterior extremity of
                                these parts. When in a state of repose they raise their wings
                                perpendicularly, joining them at the tips. Their antennae are
                                usually clubbed or inflated at the extremity, sometimes almost
                                filiform. In this section are included the genus Papilio and the
                                Hesperiae <hi rend="italic">ruricoae</hi> of Fabricius. It is itself

                            <p>Some of the genera of this subdivision are hexapod or six-footed,

                                identical in both sexes. Their chrysalids, in addition to the common
                                attachment by the posterior extremity, are fixed by the passing of a
                                silken thread across the body. A few are enclosed in a rude cocoon.
                                The central cell of the lower wing is closed inferiorly.</p>
                            <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Papilio</hi> (proper) of Latreille (Plate
                                CCXXXIII. fig. 2), the inferior palpi are extremely short, scarcely
                                reaching the clypeus with their upper extremity ; their third joint
                                is indistinct. The species of this genus are remarkable both for
                                elegance of shape and beauty of colouring. Those spotted with red on
                                the breast form the division of <hi rend="italic">Eguites</hi><hi

                                tropical countries of both hemispheres, but are rare in more
                                northern countries. Indeed we are not aware that more than three
                                exist in Europe, viz. <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                                counties of England. The caterpillars of this genus are naked, and
                                when alarmed protrude from the superior part of the neck a soft
                                forked horn, that usually diffuses a penetrating and unpleasant
                                odour. The chrysalis is exposed, and is supported by means of a
                                silken band. In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Parnassius</hi> of

                                the inferior palpi evidently extend above the clypeus, taper to a
                                point, and are distinctly triarticulated. The terminal button of the
                                antennae is short, almost ovoid and straight. The females are
                                provided with a kind of corneous boat-shaped sack at the posterior
                                extremity of the abdomen. The species of this interesting genus seem
                                peculiar to the alpine or subalpine countries of Europe and the
                                north of Asia. Their caterpillars possess a retractile tentaculum,
                                like those of the preceding genus ; but they form, prior to their
                                transformation, a cocoon of leaves united by filaments of silk. The
                                species which we have figured in the present work is a noted Swiss
                                insect, <hi rend="italic">P. Apollo.</hi> It inhabits alpine

                                >Thais</hi> of Fab. ( late CCXXX∏L fig. 5), the palpi resemble those
                                of the preceding, but the terminal button of the antennae is
                                elongated and curved, and there is no corneous pouch at the
                                extremity of the abdomen of the female. The species are <hi

                                (Plate CCXXXHL fig. 7), the antennae are twice the length of the

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Acraea,</hi> Fab. the antennae are shorter, and

                                with spines or tubercles. In the former, of which several
                                specieshave the wings elevated and elongated, the inferior palpi are
                                distant throughout their entire length, the hooks of the tarsi are
                                simple, and the club of the antennae oblong. In the latter the club
                                is short and abrupt, the hooks of the tarsi are unidentated, and the
                                inferior palpi are distant only at their extremity. The inferior
                                wings are often rounded. These butterflies are remarkable for the

                                the antennae, which are terminated abruptly by a short turbinated or

                                to our present genus. It is, however, placed in the genus <hi

                                genera the antennae terminate in an elongated club, or are almost
                                filiform. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Libythia</hi> of Fab. the males
                                alone have the anterior pair.of feet extremely short, and
                                tippet-like. The inferior palpi project observably in the manner of
                                a beak. The upper wings are very angular. In <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Biblis,</hi> Fab. the palpi are also longer than the head, but more
                                obtuse, and curved a little at their extremity. The anterior legs
                                are abbreviated in both sexes, and the antennae terminate in a much
                                smaller club. The nerves of the superior wings seem strongly
                                inflated at their origin. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Nymphalis,</hi>
                                Lat. (Plate CCXXXIV. figs. 5, 7, 9), the legs resemble those of the
                                preceding, but the inferior palpi are shorter. The club of the
                                antennae is more elongated than in Vanessa, from which they are not
                                strongly distinguished. Their caterpillars are, however, different
                                (ibid. fig. 4), being less spiny, and more elongated towards the
                                posterior extremity, which is slightly forked. The species of this
                                genus (of which, as a British example, we may name the Purple
                                Emperor, placed in the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Apatura</hi> by Mr
                                Stephens) are frequently ornamented by brilliant and varied colours,
                                and, when in prime condition, are highly prized by collectors. They
                                are distinguished by the strength and thickness of their wings,
                                which enable them to exercise a smooth, powerful, and sustained
                                flight. Their motions are .consequently not of that zigzag nature
                                observable in many species, but steady and continuous, like the
                                soaring of a bird of prey. They frequently haunt the summits of
                                forest trees, and other elevated stations, and are therefore
                                difficult to capture. This disadvantage, however, is to a certain
                                extent obviated by the boldness of their disposition ; for, when
                                their situation is accessible, they are not deterred by an
                                unsuccessful attack from settling again on the spot where they were
                                first observed. The European species, such as the Purple Emperor
                                above named <hi rend="italic">{N. Iris),</hi> are taken by means of
                                bag-nets, fixed to poles thirty feet high. They are said to be
                                attracted by the odour of acrid or fermenting substances, and such
                                are sometimes used by entomologists to induce them to descend from
                                their inaccessible positions. The genus is very extensive. Μ.

                                enlarged towards the extremities, but not clubbed. All the species
                                are peculiar to South America, and are well deserving the special
                                attention of those who desire to form a just notion of the splendour
                                and magnificence of many lepidopterous insects. We could describe

                                >Erycina,</hi> Lat. (Plate CCXXXV. figs. 2 and 4), the anterior pair

                                >Urania</hi> of Fab. just alluded to (ibid. figs. 9 and 14), the
                                antennae, at first filiform, become attenuated or setaceous at the
                                extremity, and the inferior palpi are slender and elongated, with
                                the second article greatly compressed, and the last much more
                                attenuated, almost cylindrical, and naked. “ The butterflies,” says
                                Mr Swainson, “ comprising this remarkable genus, are perhaps the
                                most splendid insects in creation. No art can effectually represent

                                of the wings, and which varies with every change of light. The
                                typical species are found in Tropical America, where they fly with
                                amazing rapidity, and perform, like their prototypes the swallows,
                                annual migrations. When at rest, the anterior wings are flat or

                            <p>The most prominent species of this family are known by the name of
                                Sphinxes or Hawk-moths. They are furnished with a spine or strong
                                bristle on the anterior margin of the inferior wings, which being
                                received by a process of the under surface of the superior pair,
                                maintains them m a horizontal or somewhat inclined position in

                                character just mentioned is indeed perceptible also among the
                                nocturnal tribes ; but our present family is distinguished by the
                                antennae, which are prismatic or fusi-</p>
                            <p><hi rend="superscript"> 0r,</hi> ιι&gt; usually thickest m the
                                middle. These insects fly with great strength and celerity, owing to
                                the extent and rum consistence of their wings, the powerful muscles
                                by ' which they are moved, and the bird-like manner in which their
                                taper bodies are poised. From their name, we would naturally infer
                                that they are observed chiefly during the morning and evening
                                twilight ; but many species may be seen darting from flower to
                                flower even at mid-day. As their capture is difficult, and their
                                rearing from the caterpillar precarious, they are in general highly
                                prized by collectors. In the larva state they have always sixteen
                                feet. The chrysalis is cylindrical, blunt-headed,, with a conical
                                abdomen, and destitute c f those points or angular prominences
                                observable in so many of the diurnal Lepidoptera. They are usually
                                enclosed in a cocoon, or concealed either in the earth or under some
                                protecting body. They are supposed to derive the name of <hi
                                rend="italic">Sphinx</hi> from the peculiar attitude assumed by
                                several of their caterpillars, which in some respects bear a
                                resemblance to the fabled monster of antiquity. A few produce a
                                humming sound. Latreille divides the family into four sections,
                                which, in corresponding order, answer to the genera <hi
                                rend="italic">Castnia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sphinx</hi> of
                                Fabricius, and to those which he at first named <hi rend="italic"
                                >Sesia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Zygaena.</hi></p>
                            <p>The first section, named <hi rend="smallcaps">Hesperi-Sphinges,</hi>
                                is composed of those species which connect the Hesperides of the
                                preceding family with the Sphinges properly so called. The antennae
                                are always simple, thickened towards the middle, or at the
                                extremity, which forms a hook, narrowed to a point, without any tuft
                                of scales, at the end. They are all furnished with a distinct
                                proboscis, and the inferior palpi are composed of three very
                                apparent joints.</p>
                            <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Agarista,</hi> Leach (Plate
                                CCXXXVI. fig. 1), the inferior palpi are elongated, with the second
                                joint strongly compressed, and the last slender and almost naked ;
                                the antennae are simple, gradually thickened towards the middle, and
                                then becoming attenuated, terminate in an elongated hook. In the
                                genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Coronis,</hi> Lat. (ibid. fig. 2), the
                                club of the antennae is more developed. In the genus <hi

                                (ibid. fig. 3), all of which are from the new world, the antennae
                                resemble those of Agarista ; but the palpi are shorter, broad, and
                                cylindrical.</p>
                            <p>The second section, named <hi rend="smallcaps">Sphingides,</hi> have
                                the antennae always terminated by a little flake of scales ; the
                                inferior palpi are broad, or transversely compressed, thickly
                                clothed with scales, and the third article generally indistinct.
                                Most of the caterpillars have a smooth body, elongated, thickest
                                towards the posterior extremity, which is furnished with a horn, the
                                sides obliquely or longitudinally striped. They feed on leaves, and
                                undergo their metamorphoses under ground, without spinning a cocoon.
                                Many seem, however, to form a little vaulted chamber, with
                                agglutinated walls, which protects them from the circumjacent earth.
                                Here are arranged many fine insects belonging to the genus <hi
                                rend="smallcaps">Sphinx</hi> properly so called (Plate CCXXXVI.
                                figs. 5 and 6), of which the antennae, from about their centre, form
                                a kind of prismatic mass, either simply ciliated, or transversely
                                striated on one side, in the manner of a rasp. The trunk is very
                                distinct. These insects fly with great velocity, sometimes giving
                                utterance to a humming noise, occasioned no. doubt by the rapid
                                vibration of their wings. Instead of settling upon flowers like bees
                                and other insects, they are frequently observed merely to hover over
                                or before them, and to extend their long tubular trunks towards the
                                nectaries.. This peculiar motion has probably obtained for <pb

                                commonly called the death’s-head moth, is one of the finest of the
                                European species. When seized it sometimes utters a shrill cry,
                                caused, according to Réaumur, by the friction of the palpi on the
                                trunk,—in the opinion of Μ. Lorey, by the escape of air from two
                                cavities in the abdomen. It makes its appearance in the perfect
                                state during autumn. The caterpillar, at least in Britain, feeds
                                voraciously on potato-leaves. It is difficult to rear beyond the
                                chrysalis state. We had six specimens alive at one time during the
                                summer of 1826, all of which entombed themselves after a time
                                beneath the earth, but never made their appearance in the perfect
                                state. On being examined after the lapse of ten or twelve months,
                                they were found lying some inches below the surface, in the state of
                                chrysalis, each in an egg- shaped hollow, formed by the caterpillar.
                                They were quite light and stiff, and of course dead and unproductive

                                in common with several others of the genus, is very widely
                                distributed. We have received it from Africa and the East Indies ;
                                and Μ. Boisduval informs us that it is well known in the Isle of
                                France. The natives of the latter country believe that the dust
                                which it casts from its wings in flying through an apartment, is
                                productive of blindness to the visual organs on which it falls. It
                                is difficult to trace the origin of this fable, recorded by St
                                Pierre in his Voyage to the Isle of France. We have many other

                                Plate CCXXXVI. figs. 7, 12, and 13), the antennae terminate in a
                                little tuft of scales. The wings are horizontal, and composed of
                                clearer vitreous portions, interrupted by darker coloured veins. The
                                posterior extremity of the body is brush-like. Several species
                                exhibit to a casual observer rather the appearance of wasps or
                                flies, than of lepidopterous insects. The genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Thyris</hi> of Hoffmansegg (ibid, fig. 8) resembles Sesia ; but the
                                antennae are more slender, almost setaceous, and without any
                                terminal tuft. The</p>
                            <p>wings are angular and indented. The abdomen terminates in a point. In
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">aegocera</hi> of Lat. (ibid. fig. 9), the
                                antennae also want the tuft, but they are evidently thickened
                                towards the middle, and fusiform ; the second joint of the inferior
                                palpi is furnished with a bundle of hairs, which project in a
                                beak-like fashion. The abdomen likewise terminates in a simple
                                point. The wings are inclined, and entirely covered with scales.</p>
                            <p>The fourth and final section of our present family is that of the <hi
                                rend="smallcaps">Zygaenides.</hi> It consists of Lepidoptera in
                                which the antennae, always terminated by a point destitute of a
                                tuft, are sometimes simple in both sexes, fusiform, or resembling
                                the horn of a ram, sometimes thickened towards the middle, almost
                                setaceous, pectinated in both sexes, or at least in the males ; the
                                inferior palpi of medium size, or small, nearly cylindrical, and
                                always formed of three distinct articulations. The wings, when at
                                rest, are inclined; that is, sloped down laterally like the roof of
                                a house, and present vitreous spots in many species. The abdomen is
                                not brush-like at the extremity. The spurs of the posterior legs are
                                usually small. The larvae of these insects live exposed on various
                                Leguminosae, and other plants. They are short, inflated about the
                                middle, and attenuated towards either end. Their bodies are smooth,
                                or but slightly haired. In the course of their transformations they
                                spin a pretty solid and coriaceous cocoon, attached to the stalk of
                                a plant. The perfect insect issues from the chrysalis in a few
                                weeks. The flight is somewhat heavy, and both sexes may frequently
                                be taken together, reposing on the plants on which the female lays
                                her eggs.</p>
                            <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Zygaena</hi> of Lat. (Plate
                                CCXXXVI. figs. 4 and 10), which appears to be as yet unknown in the
                                new world, the antennae are simple in both sexes, and terminate
                                abruptly in a fusiform mass, or one like a ram’s horn. The inferior
                                palpi rise above the elypeus, and are pointed at the end. This genus
                                contains the Burnet moths of the English collectors, of which <hi
                                rend="italic">L. loti</hi> and <hi rend="italic">filipenduloe</hi>
                                are well- known examples. The genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Syntomis</hi> of Illiger differs from Zygaena chiefly in the
                                antennae, which are not so thick, but slender, or insensibly
                                fusiform. The inferior palpi are short and obtuse. In the genus <hi
                                rend="smallcaps">Atychia</hi> of Hoffm. (ibid. fig. 16), the
                                antennae are simple in the females, and bipectinated in the males.
                                The inferior palpi are very hairy, and extend obviously beyond the
                                clypeus. The wings are short. The spurs at the extremity of the
                                posterior legs are strong. The genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Procris</hi> of Lat. (ibid. fig. 17) approaches the preceding so
                                far as respects the antennae, but the inferior palpi are shorter and
                                less hairy. An ornamental insect, the <hi rend="italic">Sphinx
                                Statices</hi> of Linn, affords a good example of this genus. It is
                                called the green forester by Harris, and forms with another species
                                the genus <hi rend="italic">Inο</hi> of Leach and Stephens. Other
                                Lepidop- tera of this section have the antennae in both sexes bipec-
                                tinated, or furnished with a double row of elongated teeth. Such of
                                them as have a distinct trunk form the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Glaucopis</hi> of Fab. (ibid. fig. 18)—those in which that organ is

                                of the preceding family. Their position is either horizontal or
                                inclined ; sometimes they embrace the sides and upper surface of the
                                abdomen. The antennae are setaceous, or become gradually narrower
                                towards the extremity. They are frequently feathered or pectinated,
                                especially in the males, and are usually more ample in that sex than
                                in the females. The legs of the larvae vary from ten to sixteen in
                                number. In certain species both sexes seem to want the tongue ; and
                                the females of a few have no wings, or but the merest rudiments of
                                those organs. The chrysalids are always rounded, or without angular
                                points.</p>
                            <p>These insects, as their family name imports, are seldom seen on the
                                wing till after sunset. They continue their flight, throughout the
                                mild and dewy nights of summer, till the morning twilight. During
                                the brightness of the day season they conceal themselves in tangled
                                vegetation, on the shady side of walls and buildings, on the under
                                side of large leaves, or in the crevices of the gnarled bark of
                                ancient forest-trees, and other sombre places. So astounded indeed
                                are the greater number by the “ garish eye of day,” that when
                                discovered by the sharp-sighted entomologist, they allow themselves
                                to be taken prisoner without an effort to escape. A few, however,
                                present exceptions to the general rule. Such, for example, are the
                                males of <hi rend="italic">Bombyx</hi><hi rend="italic">zigzag,</hi>
                                which fly throughout the whole day, and fear not the brightest beams
                                of “ glorious Apollo.” This same species presents a remarkable
                                confirmation of what we have formerly stated, in the introductory
                                portion of the present article, regarding the sense of smell in
                                insects. The female of the moth just named is extremely sluggish,
                                and seems seldom, if ever, to use her wings. When placed at an open
                                window or elsewhere in an observable position, she will be speedily
                                seen to receive the visits of the males, which fly swiftly towards
                                her from all directions, undoubtedly guided by the sense of
                                smell.</p>
                            <p>The classification of this family presents great difficulties to the
                                entomologist in the way of a natural division into sections and
                                sub-genera, and to it applies with peculiar force an observation
                                made by Latreille regarding the entire order,— <hi rend="italic"

                                of the mouth, from the complex and greatly varied, yet clearly
                                defined structure of which, in the masticating insects, so many
                                excellent and available characters have been deduced, are among the
                                lepidopterous tribes in general restricted in number, simple in
                                form, and very similar in composition. The antennae, too, especially
                                among the nocturnal tribes, become rather sexual than generic
                                distinctions ;—and as the metamorphosis and general habits and
                                history of many of the exotic species, which form the finest

                                classification. An accurate, perspicuous, and philosophical
                                arrangement of the Lepidoptera, is therefore still a desideratum in
                                our science.</p>
                            <p>Latreille, in his latest work <hi rend="italic">(Règne</hi><hi
                                rend="italic">Animal,</hi> second edition), divides the nocturnal
                                Lepidoptera into <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> sections. 1he species of
                                which the wings are entire, or without fissures or digitations,
                                compose the first nine. All those which, under the form of larva,
                                live almost entirely exposed, or in fixed retreats, and of which
                                many have less than sixteen feet, and which in their perfect state
                                are characterized by very small or concealed upper palpi, more or
                                less triangular wings, horizontal or decumbent, and not folding
                                around the body, compose the first eight. The eighth itself is the
                                only one of which the caterpillars have fourteen feet, of which two
                                are anal. If in certain others e same number exists, the anal are
                                wanting.</p>
                            <p>The first four sections correspond to the divisions <hi rend="italic"
                                >Attacus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bombyx</hi> of the genus
                                Phalaena of Linnaeus. The trunk is usually rudimentary or very
                                small, and its two filaments are not united. The inferior palpi,
                                with a few exceptions, are small and almost cylindrical. The
                                antennae, at least in the males, are pectinated or serrated. The
                                wings are horizontal or decumbent, and in several the lower project,
                                in a state of repose, beyond the upper pair. In some, also, the
                                buckle-like process formerly mentioned as fixing the wings together,
                                is here wanting. ‘ The thorax is smooth or uniform, as well as the
                                abdomen, and woolly. The latter portion is for the greater part very
                                voluminous in the females. The cocoon of the chrysalis is generally
                                what may be called well <hi rend="italic">felted,</hi> and of pretty
                                solid consistence. Although the Nocturna of Latreille’s fourth
                                section <hi rend="italic">(Aposura)</hi> bear a close relation to
                                those which precede them, their caterpillars nevertheless offer a
                                character unique and unexampled in the lepidopterous order,—the
                                absence of the anal feet. We shall here give a brief sketch of the
                                general characters of the nocturnal tribes, in accordance with the
                                system of Latreille.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Section 1st, Hepialites.</hi></p>
                            <p>We may here name as types the genera <hi rend="italic">Hepialus</hi>
                                and <hi rend="italic">Cossus</hi> of Fabricius. The caterpillars are
                                rarely met with, as they conceal themselves in the interior of the
                                plants on which they feed. The cocoons which they form are composed
                                in great part of particles of those same plants. The edges of the
                                abdominal rings or segments of the chrysalis are toothed or spinous.
                                The antennae of the perfect insect are always short, and most
                                generally present only one kind of small, short, rounded, and
                                close-set teeth. Those of some others terminate always in a simple
                                thread, but are furnished inferiorly in the males with a double row
                                of barbs. The trunk is always very short, and not very obvious. The
                                wings are decumbent, and generally elongated. The last rings of the
                                abdomen in the female form a kind of oviduct or tail. In the larva
                                state these insects are very destructive to trees, edible plants,
                                and other useful products of the vegetable kingdom.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes the antennae, almost conformable in both sexes, have only
                                very short teeth disposed in one or two rows. Such are the three
                                following genera. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Hepialus</hi> of Fab. the
                                antennae are almost granular, and much shorter than the thorax. The
                                under wings are usually destitute of the curb or spine. The
                                caterpillars dwell in the earth, and gnaw the roots of plants (Plate
                                CCXXXVI. fig. 27). A very abundant species, called the Ghost-moth,
                                <hi rend="italic">H. humuli,</hi> Fab., is characterized by the
                                upper wings of the males being of a silvery white, without
                                spots,—those of the female reddish yellow, with spots of a deeper
                                hue. The larva is extremely destructive to hops, and also exists in
                                great quantities in districts where that useful plant is unknown. It
                                is often seen hovcring over churchyards with a short pendulous
                                motion to and fro, and is also frequently observed in
                                pasture-fields, and plots of grass in garden grounds. In the genus
                                Cossus of Fab. (ibid. fig. 14), the antennae are at least as long as
                                the thorax, and present on their inner side a range of small
                                lamellar teeth, short and rounded at the end. The caterpillars live
                                in the interior of trees, and make use of the saw-dust produced by
                                the action of their mandibles in the formation of their cocoons. The
                                chrysalids advance by a peculiar and instinctive motion to the
                                external apertures of their ligneous dwellings, just at the moment
                                of their final development, when their wings are about to expand. We
                                doubt not that the little spinous projections with which the sides
                                of the abdomen arc armed, aid them greatly in that progressive
                                motion. A wriggling movement would naturally produce an advance
                                upwards or forwards, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193748456"
                                xml:id="kp-eb0709-8456-0246"/> but retreat would be impossible. The
                                <hi rend="italic">Cossus</hi><hi rend="italic">ligniperda</hi> is a
                                noted example of the genus. In the larva state (ibid. fig. 19) it is
                                extremely destructive to elm trees, which it perforates almost to
                                the core, and by degrees produces first an unhealthy condition,
                                rendered visible by a peculiar colour of the leaves, and finally
                                decay and death. In the company of an honoured friend, the Rev. John
                                Fleming of Rairigg, Windermere, we lately witnessed the hewing down
                                of an old elm tree, which had braved the blasts of many stern
                                winters, but had evidently become paralysed in its vital functions
                                by the inroads of some insidious foe. By accident the large
                                sealyhead of a caterpillar was one day seen protruding from the
                                rugged bark ; and some other circumstances led to the belief that
                                the tree was infested. To ascertain the cause of the disease with
                                certainty, and to stay if possible its progress through the
                                neighbouring groves, the sylvan monarch was consigned to the tender
                                mercies of the woodmen of Bowness ; and on being felled and hewn in
                                different parts, we discovered several dozens of very large
                                caterpillars of <hi rend="italic">Cossus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                                >ligniperda,</hi> chiefly in the thickest part of the tree, a few
                                feet above the ground, and several inches within the bark. They gave
                                out, as we extracted them, a very peculiar odour, of an oily nature,
                                and sufficiently repelling, we should suppose, to render it
                                improbable that these larvae were eaten by the ancients. It is
                                however a well-received opinion, that the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Cossus</hi> described by Pliny, and regarded by the Romans as a
                                most delicious fare, was the caterpillar in question. It is
                                frequently found in the willow as well as in the elm, and may
                                possibly extend its ravages to the oak, the nidus assigned by Pliny
                                to his edible worm. The latter, however, was most likely the larva
                                of <hi rend="italic">Prionus</hi><hi rend="italic">coriarius,</hi>
                                or some other of the larger long-horned beetles ; the more
                                especially as we know from Madame Merian and other writers, that the
                                grub of a congener, <hi rend="italic">Cerambyx da- miconis,</hi> is
                                eaten in Surinam and the West Indies, both by slaves and freemen.
                                The perfect insect of the <hi rend="italic">Cossus</hi><hi
                                rend="italic">ligniperda</hi> is of an ashy grey, with numerous
                                small black lines on the upper wings. The posterior extremity of the
                                thorax is yellowish, with a black line. We forgot to mention, that
                                the oily odour of the caterpillar is by some considered to proceed
                                from a reservoir of a peculiar fluid which the insect disgorges, for
                                the purpose, it is believed, of softening the timber on which it
                                feeds, and in which, as it increases in size, it perforates its
                                hidden chambers. It is also remarkable as having afforded the
                                subject of an extraordinary anatomical investigation by Lyonnet,
                                detailed in his famous <hi rend="italic">Traite Anatomique de la
                                Chenille du Saule.</hi> The enthusiasm of a French writer has
                                induced him, while lauding the merits of that signal publication, to
                                allude to its subject-matter under the dignifying appellation of “

                                external aspect, by inspecting the 19th figure of our 236th plate.

                                Bengal. The first of these species appears to be identical with the
                                <hi rend="italic">Ph. paphia</hi> of Dr Roxburgh. It occurs in great
                                abundance in Bengal, and in many parts of the adjoining country, and
                                affords a plentiful supply of a very durable though coarse and
                                dark-coloured silk called <hi rend="italic">Tussch,</hi> much used
                                by the Brahmins and other sects of Hindoos. This species cannot be
                                domesticated ; but the hill people go into the jungles, and when
                                they perceive the dung of the caterpillars under a tree, they
                                immediately search for them among the branches, and carry off
                                whatever they require. These they distribute on the asseen trees
                                (<hi rend="italic">Terminalia alata</hi><hi rend="italic"
                                >glabrata</hi> of Roxb.), and as long as they continue in the
                                caterpillar state, the Pariahs guard them from birds by day and from
                                bats by night. The natural food of this species is the <hi

                                distinct species, of this insect. The Arrindy silk-worm, however,
                                belongs to an entirely different species, the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Phalaena cynthia</hi> above named. It appears peculiar to two
                                districts in the interior of Bengal, viz. Rungpore and Dinagepore,
                                where it is reared in a domestic state. The food of this caterpillar
                                consists entirely of the leaves of the common <hi rend="italic"

                                caterpillar feeds on the leaves of the mulberry, and spins an oval
                                cocoon of a close tissue of the finest silk, usually of a yellow
                                colour, but sometimes white. A variety is now preferred abroad,
                                which always yields the latter colour. Although this sumptuous
                                product is now “ familiar as household words,” its nature and origin
                                were but obscurely, if at all, known in ancient times ; and even in
                                the days of Aurelian it was valued at its weight in gold. This was
                                probably owing to the mode in which the material was procured by the
                                merchants of Alexandria, who had no direct intercourse with China,
                                the only country in which the silk-worm was at that time reared.
                                According to Latreille, the city of Turfan, in Little Bucharia, was
                                for a long time the rendezvous of the western caravans, and the
                                chief entrepôt of the Chinese silks. It was the metropolis of the
                                Seres of Upper Asia, or of the Serica of Ptolemy, placed, according
                                to that author, between the Ganges and the Eastern Ocean. Hence the
                                <hi rend="italic">Serica vestis</hi> of the Romans, and the word <hi
                                rend="italic">Sericum,</hi> their name for silk. Driven from their

                                Bucharia and in India. It was from one of their colonies, Ser-hend
                                <hi rend="italic">(Ser-indι),</hi> that certain Greek missionaries,
                                in the reign of Justinian, carried the eggs of the silkworm to
                                Constantinople. Its cultivation spread, at the period of the first
                                Crusades, from the Morea into Sicily, the kingdom of Naples, and,
                                several centuries afterwards, under the administration of Sully more
                                especially, into France, to which country it is now a source of

                                insect origin were incorrectly informed of the natural mode of its
                                formation. The court of the Greek emperors, which surpassed even
                                those of the Asiatic sovereigns in splendour and magnificence,
                                became profuse in its display of this costly luxury ; but as the
                                Persians, from the advantages which their local situation gave them
                                over the merchants from the Arabian Gulf, were enabled to supplant
                                them in all those marts of India to which silk was brought by sea
                                from the East, and as they had it in their power to cut off the
                                caravans which travelled by land from China through their own
                                northern provinces, Constantinople thus became dependent on a rival
                                power for an article which its sumptuous nobles deemed essential to
                                the enjoyment of refined life. Of course the Persians, with the
                                usual rapacity of monopolists, raised the price to an exorbitant
                                height, and many attempts were made by Justinian to free his
                                subjects from such exaction. An accidental circumstance is said to
                                have accomplished what the wisdom of the great legislator was unable
                                to achieve. Two Persian monks, who had been employed as missionaries
                                in one of the Christian churches established in India, had
                                penetrated into the country of the Seres, that is, to China, where
                                they observed the natural operations of the silk-worm, and acquired
                                a knowledge of the arts of man in working up its produce into so
                                many rich and costly fabrics. The love of lucre, mingled perhaps
                                with a feeling of indignation that so valuable a branch of commerce
                                should be enjoyed by unbelieving nations, induced them to repair to
                                Constantinople, where they explained to the emperor the true origin
                                of silk, and the various modes by which it was prepared and
                                manufactured. Encouraged by the most liberal promises, they
                                undertook to transport a sufficient supply of these extraordinary
                                worms to Constantinople, which they effected by conveying the eggs
                                in the interior of a hollow cane. They were hatched, it is said, by
                                the heat of a dunghill, and the larvae were fed with the leaves of
                                wild mulberry.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                                of this insect live in society on oak trees, where, when young, they

                                They frequently change their domicil until after the third casting
                                of their skins, on which they remain more stationary, forming a new
                                habitation resembling a kind of sack, divided interiorly into
                                several cells. They usually issue forth in the evening, in a very
                                singular order of procession. A single individual takes the lead,
                                and serves as guide, two others follow, forming the second line,
                                then three abreast, next four, and so on for many ensuing columns,
                                each regularly augmented by the addition of a single larva, and all
                                following the course of their first adventurous leader. After a
                                certain time each spins a cocoon alongside that of its neighbour,

                                in great communities,—a commonwealth of worms. Their nest is
                                sometimes three feet high, and so closely packed with cocoons (500

                                upper wings exhibit no dentations on their inner border. In the

                                >Orgyia</hi> of Ochs. (ibid. fig. 2), the females are almost
                                apterous (fig. 3), and the caterpillars (fig. 4) are beautifully
                                adorned with aigrettes, or little plumes or tufts of hair. In others
                                of the same tribe the caterpillars creep rather than walk, their
                                feet being extremely short, and even the sealyones retractile ; the
                                body is oval like that of an oniscus, with the skin soldered above
                                from the second ring, so as to form a kind of arch, beneath which
                                the head is withdrawn. These compose the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"

                                by the possession of a very distinct trunk, which, when unrolled,
                                extends far beyond the head. The disposition of their colours
                                somewhat resembles that of those diurnal species called chess-boards
                                <hi rend="italic">(damiers)</hi> by the French. Many of them are
                                extremely rich and beautiful in their adornment. In <hi

                                decumbent in repose, the antennae pectinated in the males, the
                                inferior palpi very hairy, and the trunk short. To this genus
                                belongs that common but superb species commonly called the
                                Tiger-moth <hi rend="italic">(B.caja,</hi> Fab.). It is produced
                                from the blackish-brown creeping caterpillar usually known in
                                Scotland as “ the hairy worm.” In <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Callimorpha,</hi> Lat. (ibid. fig. 6), the wings are also
                                decumbent, but the antennae are at most only ciliated in the males ;
                                the inferior palpi are merely covered by little scales, and the
                                trunk is long. <hi rend="italic">C. Jacoboea</hi> is an ornamental

                            <p>The insects of this division are characterized by a peculiarity
                                already alluded to,—the want of feet on the anal segment of the body
                                of the larvae. They derive their name from that circumstance. The
                                posterior extremity of the body terminates in a point, which in
                                several is forked, or even exhibits two articulated appendages, long
                                and flexile, and forming a kind of tail. The perfect insects differ
                                but little from the preceding in regard to their trunk, palpi, and
                                antennae. Some, such as <hi rend="smallcaps">Dicranoura</hi> of
                                Godart (Plate CCXXXVII. fig. 7), have the external aspect of
                                Sericaria and Chelonia, with the antennae of the males terminating
                                in a small simple curved thread. The posterior extremity of the
                                larva is forked (ibid. fig. 8). Others, such as <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Platypterix,</hi> Lat. bear a great resemblance to the Phalaenae
                                properly so called. Their wings are broad, and the superior angle of
                                the posterior extremity of the anterior pair is somewhat prolonged
                                or falcated. The body is slender. That of the caterpillar terminates
                                in a simple truncated point. In that state they bend over the edges
                                of the leaves of plants, and fix them down by silken cords, so as to
                                form a protecting habitation, which at the same time they partly
                                consume as their natural food. The cocoon of the chrysalis is very
                                bare.</p>

                            <p>The species of this extensive section are similar to the preceding
                                insects in the figure and relative proportion of their wings, and
                                their position in repose ; but they present the two following
                                distinguishing characters : A horny, spirally rolled, and generally
                                elongated trunk ; inferior palpi, terminated abruptly by a very
                                small article, much more slender than that which precedes it,—the
                                latter being broader and compressed. These genera have the body more
                                covered by scales than by a woolly down. Their antennae are usually
                                simple. The thorax is frequently crested above, and the abdomen
                                assumes the form of an elongated cone. Their flight is rapid, and
                                some of the species make their appearance during the day. The
                                caterpillars have usually sixteen feet. Some have only twelve or
                                fourteen, but the posterior or anal pair are never wanting ; and in
                                those which present but twelve the anterior pair of the membranous
                                ones are as long as the next ensuing. The greater proportion spin a
                                cocoon, in which they undergo their metamorphosis. These Lepidoptera
                                correspond to the division named <hi rend="italic">Noctuoe</hi>-of
                                the genus <hi rend="italic">Phalaena</hi> of Linn.</p>

                                the terminal joint of the palpi is elongated, elevated, cylindrical,
                                or slightly compressed, and naked. With the exception of a single

                                those of which the caterpillars march after the manner of the
                                surveyors or Geometrae. Some have sixteen feet, of which the

                                ornamented with golden or silvery spots upon the upper wings. Such
                                are two well-known British species, <hi rend="italic">N. gamma</hi>

                                affords a pregnant instance of the power of Providence to let loose
                                an animal to the work of destruction and punishment. Though common
                                with us, it is seldom the cause of more than trivial injury ; but in
                                the year 1735 it was so incredibly multiplied in France as to infest
                                the whole country. On the great roads, wherever you cast your eyes,
                                you might see vast numbers traversing them in all directions to pass
                                from field to field ; but their ravages were particularly felt in
                                the kitchen gardens, where they devoured every thing, whether pulse
                                or pot-herbs, so that nothing was left besides the stalks and veins
                                of the leaves. The credulous multitude thought they were poisonous,
                                report affirming that in some instances the eating of them had been
                                followed by fatal effects. In consequence of this alarming idea,
                                herbs were banished for several weeks from the soups of Paris.
                                Fortunately these destroyers did not meddle with the corn, or famine
                                would have followed in their train. Réaumur has proved that a single
                                pair of these insects might in one season produce 80,000 ; so that,
                                were the friendly Ichneumons removed, to which the mercy of Heaven
                                has given it in charge to keep their numbers within due limits, we
                                should no longer enjoy the comfort of vegetables with our animal
                                food, and probably soon become the prey of scorbutic diseases.”<note

                                The caterpillars of some other species have the habit of eating the
                                petals of the flowers of the plants on which they dwell. The
                                antennae of certain kinds are pectinated, such as <hi rend="italic"
                                >ĴV.</hi><hi rend="italic">graminis,</hi> an insect which has
                                sometimes proved extremely destructive to the meadows in Sweden. We
                                may conclude by observing that caterpillars believed to belong to
                                this genus have been seen to exercise a curious, and, as we would
                                suppose it, an unnatural instinct,—they seize upon other larvae,
                                even of their own species, transfix them by the middle, and sucking
                                out their interior juices, leave them nothing but their own skins.
                                When we mention that Olivier (in <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie
                                Méthodique)</hi> describes 459 species of the Fabrician genus
                                Noctua, the reader will readily admit that many of the new' generic
                                groups, to which we have been unable to do more than allude, are
                                extremely desirable, were it for nothing else than mere convenience,
                                independent of any higher reasons resulting from the nature of

                            <p>These are very nearly allied to the Lepidoptera of the two preceding
                                sections. The upper wings, of which the posterior margin is arcuated
                                at the base and then restricted, and their short and broad contour,
                                forming a truncated oval, bestows a peculiar physiognomy upon the
                                species in question. They are named by the French <hi rend="italic"
                                >Phalènes à</hi><hi rend="italic">larges</hi><hi rend="italic"

                                are all provided with a distinct trunk, and the inferior palpi are
                                generally very like those of Noctua, but somewhat projecting. They
                                are of smallish size, agreeably coloured, with the wings decumbent,
                                but flatfish, or almost horizontal, and covering the body,—the inner
                                margins of the upper pair even overlapping each other a little in a
                                state of repose. The caterpillars have sixteen feet, a smooth body,
                                or but slightly haired, and dwell in leaves, which they roll up or
                                convert into tunnels by means of silken cordage. They live upon the
                                parenchyma of their own leafy dwellings, which thus serve them both
                                for food and clothing. Others form their dwellings by uniting
                                several leaves together, while a few are found in different kinds of
                                fruits. Several have the posterior part of their body narrower than
                                the others, and these were named <hi rend="italic">chenilles

                                in some kinds formed of pure silk, in others of mixed, materials.
                                These insects compose the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Pyralis</hi> of
                                Fab. (Plate CCXXXVII. fig. 16). Many of the species are destructive
                                to fruit-trees and vines. <hi rend="italic">P. pomona</hi> in the
                                caterpillar state lives in the interior of apples, of which it eats
                                the pippins. We may name as a British species <hi rend="italic">P.
                                prasinaria,</hi> which is the largest known. It measures about two

                                streaks in the centre, the thorax is green, the under wings white.
                                This species, with that which we have figured, form the genus <hi

                            <p>Here are comprised a numerous assemblage of nocturnal Lepidoptera, in
                                which the body is usually slender, with the trunk either apparently
                                wanting, or generally but slightly lengthened, and almost membranous
                                ; the inferior palpi are small and nearly cylindrical ; the wings
                                ample, extended, and almost horizontal, or flatly decumbent. The an-
                                tennae are pectinated in several males. The thorax is always even,
                                or without a crest. The caterpillars have in general only ten legs,
                                though some <hi rend="italic">(Ph. margaritaria)</hi> have twelve ;
                                the anal pair arc always present. These insects correspond to the

                                of progression, already described in our observations introductory

                                then resemble little broken twigs of the plant on which they rest ;
                                and their colours, and the inequalities of their surface, aid the
                                deception. They thus no doubt frequently escape the observation of
                                their natural foes. Roe- sel states that his gardener, mistaking one
                                of these ligneous-looking larvae for a dead twig, the brittleness of
                                which he no doubt expected would admit of his instantly snapping it
                                asunder, started back in the greatest alarm when he found by its
                                consistence and motion that it was a living creature. The chrysalids
                                are almost naked, their cocoons being thin and poorly supplied with
                                silk.</p>
                            <p>According to Latreille’s views, by which we are at present guided,
                                this section, when considered in relation to the perfect insects
                                alone, contains but a single genus, that of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Phalaena</hi> properly so called (Plate CCXXXVII. figs. 13 and 15)
                                of which the characters consequently agree with those just assigned
                                to the section itself. A very different view, however, has been
                                taken by the greater mass of entomologists, foreign and indigenous ;
                                and a roll of names of fearful length and deep construction, has
                                been received by many as constituting a proper portion of our
                                scientific nomenclature. Thus Mr Stephens’ family <hi rend="italic"
                                >Geometridae,</hi> corresponding to the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Phalaenites</hi> of Latreille, contains above eighty British
                                genera. The number is precisely eighty-three in Mr Rennie’s <hi
                                rend="italic">Conspectus.</hi> Many naturalists believe that no such
                                divisions as genera exist in nature, and consequently that all our
                                generic distinctions are artificial, and constructed merely for
                                convenience, as a helping instrument for ourselves, and an easier
                                mode of mutual communication between ourselves and others. But all
                                naturalists admit that there is a différence in the value of the
                                characters chosen, and that such as are selected as generic should
                                be pervading and influential over a pretty obvious group, not chosen
                                arbitrarily or at hazard from the examination of the limited
                                productions of any one confined insular region, but on mature
                                deliberation, and after a kindly and extended study of the analogous
                                productions of foreign lands. Characters drawn from form and
                                structure are much less liable to accidental variation, and are
                                likewise of more comprehensive application, than such as are derived
                                from colour ;—the former have consequently been used to distinguish
                                the greater groups, including genera, —the latter are chiefly
                                available in the discrimination of species, and their mode, range,
                                and frequency of variation, of themselves afford most interesting
                                subjects of study and reflection, in relation to the varieties of
                                each particular kind. It is doubtful, however, whether the use of
                                the evanescent shades of so superficial a character as colour, is
                                advisable in the distinction of genera. The great test of a good
                                generic character consists in its being in some way connected with
                                or influential over the natural habits of the species which it is
                                assumed to distinguish,—so that it may fairly be presupposed to
                                exist in other species of similar instinctive modes of life. These
                                traits are no doubt difficult to obtain in the insect creation,
                                where the species are so numerous, and the gradations so often
                                insensible from one group to another. But still we know that colour,
                                though occasionally extremely characteristic of natural groups, is a
                                distinction too flighty and fantastical to be generally applied with
                                advantage, otherwise than for artificial combinations. For these and
                                other reasons not necessary to be here adduced, we have hitherto
                                failed to sec the propriety of such characters as “ first pair of
                                wings somewhat rufous, with darker streaks,” “ second pair pale,
                                with a red streak,” “ wings banded with green,” “ the first pair
                                greenish, spotted with black, the second pair dull,” &amp;c. being
                                adopted as <hi rend="italic">generic</hi> distinctions, —the more
                                especially as they would prove not very efficient even for the
                                purposes of <hi rend="italic">specific</hi> discrimination.</p>
                            <p>There is no doubt, however, that the great extent of the genus in
                                question requires that it should be reduced by subdivision within
                                manageable bounds ; and if determinate and distinctive characters of
                                sufficient value can be attached to each, a generic name may as well
                                be used as a sectional mark. Hubner has described and figured above
                                400 European species, and MM. Lepelletier de Saint Fargeau and Ser

                                which they spread horizontally, a kind of delta, with a re-entering
                                angle in the middle of the posterior edge, producing a forked
                                aspect. The an- tennae are usually pectinated or ciliated. Our

                                The wings frequently combine, with extreme beauty of colouring, the
                                most brilliant little stripes and masses of shining silver and
                                burnished gold, which under the microscope exhibit a most radiant
                                richness. This lustrous aspect of many species is however but a poor
                                recompense for the injury which we receive from many more while in
                                the larva state. These clothe themselves at our expense in the
                                warmest woollen garments, which they traverse in all directions,
                                leaving behind a gnawed and worn-out path, so thin and bare as to
                                yield to the slightest pressure. They also destroy furs, hair,
                                feathers, and many other articles of domestic economy, and are the
                                exterminating pests of zoological museums. To them we no doubt owe
                                the destruction of the famous Dodo, once preserved in the Ashmolean
                                Museum of Oxford, and never since seen by human eyes. By means of
                                their max- illae these little larvae shear down the surface of
                                various substances, and uniting the particles by means of their
                                glutinous silk, they thus form protecting habitations, which partake
                                of the nature of the woollen or other stuffs on which the foresight
                                of their parents has placed them. When they themselves increase in
                                bulk, so as to find their abodes as inconvenient as a strait
                                waistcoat, they split them down the middle, and interpose a piece,
                                proportioned no doubt to their expected as well as actual increase.
                                They add to the length also by fresh materials to the anterior end.
                                These observations are easily made by removing the young larva in
                                its first restricted case, from a piece of white to a piece of
                                scarlet or other coloured flannel. When about to undergo their

                                to feed on the neighbouring heaps. It is a somewhat analogous
                                species which in bee-hives pierces the waxen cells on which it feeds
                                ; and by thus causing the honey to flow out, occasions great loss to

                                a paler colour than the rest. These are the sub-cutaneous galleries
                                of certain very small larvae of garden-moths, many of them extremely
                                beautiful, and so minute as to dwell at ease between the upper and
                                under surface of the leaf. Others dwell and feed upon the surface,
                                but screened from immediate observation by a covered way of silk,
                                which they spin along their devious courses. Referring the curious

                                according to Latreille, the only Tineites of which the superior or
                                madxillary palpi are not distinctly perceptible ; but as they mav be
                                concealed by the inferior or labial palpi, it is difficult, in
                                relation to this point, to establish a fixed and rigorous line of
                                demarcation. For this reason the French entomologist has not
                                arranged the Tineites according to the number of the palpi. Μ.

                                rend="italic">P. pyralides</hi> of Linn. Their wings are decumbent,
                                generally flattened, or but slightly raised, and form a kind of
                                delta or elongated triangle. In the ensuing genera the trunk is
                                apparent, and serves for the performance of the usual functions. The
                                larvae live on various plants. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Botys,</hi>
                                Lat. (CCXXXVII. fig. 11), the larvae roll up leaves, and do not
                                differ externally from the others except in the respiratory organs.
                                In <hi rend="smallcaps">Hydrocampe,</hi> Lat. (ibid. fig. 12), the
                                species are analogous to the preceding, but the caterpillars are
                                aquatic, and are usually furnished with filiform appendages, the
                                interior of which contain tracheae. They fabricate tunnels or
                                covered ways with the leaves of various aquatic plants. Such are <hi

                                wanting, or nearly so. The four palpi are exposed, and the wings
                                form a flattened triangle,—the upper having no emargination at their
                                extremity. <hi rend="italic">A. pinguinalis,</hi> Réaum. iii. xx.
                                5-11, occurs on walls in houses. The caterpillar is smooth or
                                shorthaired, of a brownish black, and shining. It feeds on various
                                fatty substances, and also attacks leather,—on which account it is
                                called <hi rend="italic">fausse-teigne</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                                cuirs</hi> by Réaumur. It is destructive to the binding of books,
                                and is therefore an inconvenient companion in a library. Its case
                                consists of a long tunnel, applied close to the substance on which
                                it lives, and covered by particles of excrementitious matter.
                                According to Linnaeus, it occurs, though rarely, in the human
                                stomach, where it occasions effects much more dangerous and alarming
                                than those caused by ordinary intestinal worms. “ Un médecin
                                éclairé, “ says Latreille, “ et dont je ne puis révoquer en doute la
                                véracité, m’a envoyé des chenilles de cette espèce, qu’une jeune
                                famille avait vomies.” Another species, <hi rend="italic">P.
                                farinalis,</hi> feeds on flour. In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Galleria</hi> of Fab. the scales of the clypeus or epistoma form a
                                projection which covers the palpi. The upper wings, proportionally
                                narrower than those of Aglossa, and emarginate on the posterior
                                border, are, in common with the inferior, very decumbent, and raised
                                posteriorly like a cock’s tail, as in many species of the ensiling
                                genera. <hi rend="italic">G. cereana,</hi> Fab. is the species the
                                larva of which is designated <hi rend="italic">fausse-teigne</hi><hi
                                rend="italic">de la cire</hi> by Réaumur. It is extremely
                                destructive in bee-hives, in which it pierces the honey cells, and
                                constructs as it advances a silken tunnel covered with
                                excrementitious particles composed of the wax which it has devoured.
                                The cocoons of the chrysalids are sometimes found assembled in
                                heaps.</p>
                            <p>In other groups of Tineites the superior palpi are not always very
                                distinct. The upper wings are long, narrow, sometimes moulded or
                                rolled upon the body, sometimes applied perpendicularly to the
                                sides. In this state the insect has always an elongated and narrow
                                form, approaching that of a little cylinder or cone, when the wings
                                are closed.</p>
                            <p>In the next-named four genera the inferior palpi, always large, are
                                borne, as it were, in advance, the last joint at most being raised.
                                The palpi are apparent. <hi rend="smallcaps">Crambus,</hi> Fab.
                                (Plate CCXXXVII. fig. 20), has a distinct trunk. The inferior palpi
                                project straight forwards like a beak. These Lepidoptera occur in
                                dry pastures and on various plants. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Alucita,</hi> Lat. (ibid. fig. 22), has also a distinct trunk, but
                                the inferior palpi are raised. The antennae are simple. In <hi
                                rend="smallcaps">Euplocampus,</hi> Lat. (ibid, fig.' 18), the trunk
                                is'shortana inconspicuous, and the last article of the inferior
                                palpi is; likewise raised, the scales of the preceding one forming
                                aļ faisceau. The antennae of the males are furnished with ; double
                                row of little barbs. The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Phycis</hi> of
                                Fab. i? closely allied to Euplocampus, but the antennae at most an
                                merely ciliated.</p>
                            <p>In the following genera the inferior palpi are entirely raised, and
                                even recurved over the head in several. Sometimes the inferior palpi
                                are very apparent, and of medium size. The antennae and the cyes are
                                distinct In the two following genera the inferior palpi scarcely
                                surpass the front. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Tinea</hi> (ibid. fig.
                                21) the trunk is very short, and formed of little membranous
                                disjointed threads. The head is erected. The species of this genus,
                                which has been greatly restricted since the time of Fabricius, are
                                particularly destructive among our clothes and other household
                                concerns. We shall here notice a few of the principal kinds. <hi

                                wings black on the basal portion, their posterior part being white.
                                This is the species represented by our figure.<note anchored="true"

                                forms an arched gallery, lengthening as it advances. <hi
                                rend="italic">T. sαrci- tella</hi> is of a silvery-grey colour, with
                                a white spot on each side of the thorax. Though very abundant and
                                extremely destructive in most parts of Europe, its synonymy and
                                consequent history are somewhat confused. The figures given by
                                Réaumur,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                                authors, appear (at least if we judge from the eleventh) to belong
                                to another genus. The inferior palpi are large, recurved and
                                pointed, a character which rather allies it to the genus <hi

                                suspected that these two insects are the same. According to the
                                last-named authority, the <hi rend="italic">T. sarcitella</hi> is of
                                a silvery grey, as above described. In <hi rend="italic">T.
                                vestianella</hi> the upper part of the head, of the thorax, and even
                                the base of the superior wings, are white. The inferior palpi,
                                recurved in the manner of horns, are of the same colour, ringed with
                                black. The wings lie horizontally on the body, are whitish, and
                                shining, and the upper surface of the superior pair presents some
                                blackish spots of different sizes. The inferior are of a uniform
                                colour, bordered posteriorly, as is also the internal margin of the
                                upper pair, with long fringes. This species is extremely common, and
                                it has been presumed that Linnaeus having given an inadequate
                                description from a defective specimen, its identity became difficult
                                to recognise, and that thus Scopoli bestowed a new name, that of <hi

                                spindle-shaped, which it covers with detached hairs or particles of
                                wool. <hi rend="italic">T. pellionella,</hi> Fab. has the upper

                                it destroys with ease and satisfaction to itself, by gnawing off the
                                hairs at the base. The wings of <hi rend="italic">T. granella</hi>
                                are elevated behind, and marbled with grey, brown, and black. Its

                                preventing or removing moths are care and cleanliness. Let articles

                                that whatever is used or often handled would form an unsafe nidus
                                for her tender young. In depositing her eggs she therefore selects
                                the one and rejects the other ; and hence a careful housewife, who
                                fcels a lively interest in her own concerns, and frequently examines
                                and refolds or arranges her household gear, may live for half a
                                century and never see a moth. At the same time, if articles are
                                rolled up in a perfectly close and well- ordered tissue, they are
                                safe from these destructive creatures, which are certainly never <hi
                                rend="italic">bred</hi> from the things they consume, however old or
                                ill-conditioned. But if a single unsuspected crevice should chance
                                to admit one solitary female moth, “ the spinster’s occupation’s
                                gone,” and a colony of worms is suddenly produced from innumerable
                                eggs, which would strike horror into the heart of a Malthusian.
                                Where things must be left unexposed to changes of light and air, and
                                yet cannot be hermetically closed, the use of camphor, spirit of

                                preventives, are tried with more or less success. Exposure to a
                                brisk fire is the most effectual means of expelling the larvae from
                                stuffed birds, quadrupeds, &amp;c.</p>
                            <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Ilithyia,</hi> Lat. (Plate
                                CCXXXVII. fig. 23), the inferior palpi resemble those of the
                                preceding genus, but the trunk is distinct, and of the ordinary
                                size, and the last article of the inferior palpi is obviously
                                shorter than the preceding. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Iponomeuta,</hi>
                                Lat. (ibid. fig. 24), the trunk is also distinct, and of tolerable
                                size, but the terminal article of the inferior palpi is at least as
                                long as the preceding one. These insects, according to Latreille,
                                are related to Lithosia. <hi rend="italic">Y. evonymella</hi> (Tinca

                                recommence their ravages, which are found to be extremely injurious
                                to the health of the tree, and its productive powers. The branches
                                seem as if covered with patches of dusty and discoloured crape. In

                            <p>This, our concluding section of the nocturnal Lepidop- tera, exhibits
                                many relations to the preceding, in respect to the narrow and
                                elongated form of the body and upper wrings ; but it differs from
                                it, as well as from all the other sections, in this, that a pair, if
                                not all, of the .wrings, are as it were split or cloven throughout
                                their whole length, so as to present a branched or digitated
                                appearance, bearded on the edges. The parts look like feathers, so
                                that the wrings of these fantastically formed creatures somewhat
                                resemble those of birds. They formed the division of <hi
                                rend="italic">Pha- laenoe alucìtaeciï</hi> Linnaeus, and were named
                                Phalènes-tipules by Degeer. Geoffroy, Fabricius, and Latreille
                                include them under the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Pterophorus.</hi>
                                Their larvae have sixteen feet, live on leaves and flowers, and
                                construct no cases. The chrysalids of the greater number are naked,
                                coloured, and suspended by a thread. In others they are enclosed in
                                a translucent cocoon. The genus has been lately subdivided. In some
                                the inferior palpi are recurved from their origin, entirely
                                garnished with small scales, and do not exceed the length of the
                                head ; these constitute the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Pterophorus</hi> properly so called, of Latreille (Plate CCXXXVII.
                                fig. 26). Their chrysalids are exposed, beset with hairs or small
                                tubercles, and are sometimes suspended by a thread, sometimes fixed
                                by means of hooks at the posterior extremity to a little bed of
                                silk, imposed upon a leaf or other vegetable body. <hi rend="italic"
                                >P. pentadactylus,</hi> Fab. is an example of this division. The
                                wrings are of an almost snowy whiteness, the upper pair being
                                divided into two, the lower into three parts. In others the inferior
                                palpi are projected, longer than the head, with the second article
                                thickly covered writh scales, and the terminal one almost naked, and
                                turned up. The chrysalis is enclosed in a cocoon of silk. To these
                                Latreille has applied the generic name of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Orneodes</hi> (ibid. fig. 27). The <hi rend="italic">0.
                                hexadactylus</hi> measures about six lines in length. It is of an
                                ash-coloured grey, writh a tinge of brown. The wings, especially the
                                upper ones, are traversed by obscure or blackish bands, with some
                                spots of a paler grey ; and each wring is divided to its base into
                                three principal parts, of which the first is subdivided into two
                                radii, and the second into three : the third is simple. The
                                caterpillar of this species has sixteen feet, and lives on the

                            the base of the membranaceous wings, and derive their origin from the
                            second segment of the thorax, the parts in question are not genuine

                            the mouth consists of a labrum, two mandibles, a pair of maxillae, each
                            bearing a very small uniarticulate palpus, and a labium without palpi.
                            The head presents two large eyes, hemispherical, granose, and slightly
                            pediculated ; two antennas, approximate at the base, placed upon an
                            elevation in common, almost filiform, short, and composed of three
                            articulations, of which the first two are very short, and the third,
                            greatly elongated, is divided from its origin into two long compressed
                            lanceolate branches, applied against each other. The stemmatic eyes are
                            wanting. The thorax, in its peculiar form and divisions, resembles that
                            of several Cicadariae, Psyllae, and Chrysides. The abdomen is nearly
                            cylindrical, composed of eight or nine segments, and is terminated by
                            pieces which seem to bear an analogy with those which we find at the
                            posterior extremity of the Hemiptera above named. The six legs are
                            almost membranous, compressed, nearly equal, and terminate in filiform
                            tarsi, composed of four membranous articulations, which appear vesicular
                            at their extremity, and of which the terminal one, somewhat larger than
                            the others, is unfurnished with hooks. The four anterior legs are
                            approximate, the posterior pair I <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> &gt;eing
                            thrown pretty far back by themselves. The space comprised between the
                            latter pair is ample, and divided into two by a longitudinal groove or
                            furrow. The posterior extremity of the metathorax is prolonged over the
                            abdomen in the manner of a large scutellum, and its sides, which serve
                            as points of insertion to the posterior legs, are much dilated
                            backwards, and form a kind of inflated buckler, which defends the
                            exterior and lateral base of the abdomen.</p>
                        <p>These singular insects were first observed by Rossi, who concluded,
                            because they were parasitical, that they must belong to the
                            hymenopterous order, to which they certainly bear a greater affinity
                            than to any of the dipterous tribes, among which they were arranged by
                            Μ. Lamarck. Latreille inclines to consider them as related (although at
                            the same time differing in various ways) to certain hymenopterous
                            species, such as those of the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Eulo-
                            phus.</hi> In the larva state they live, between the abdominal plates of
                            hymenopterous insects belonging to the genera <hi rend="italic"
                            >Andrena</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Polistes.</hi> It has been supposed
                            that the elytra-like portions, already described, serve to disengage the
                            perfect insects with greater facility from the living chambers in which
                            they are incased. They are said to frisk about with a simultaneous
                            motion of these organs and the true wings. Latreillc calls them the <hi
                            rend="italic">Oestri</hi> of insects. We know that a species of Conops
                            likewise undergoes its transformations in the interior of a Bombus, or
                            wild bee.</p>
                        <p>This order contains only two genera,— <hi rend="smallcaps">Xenos</hi> of
                            Rossi, and <hi rend="smallcaps">Stylops</hi> of Kirby. Their exact
                            nature is still of difficult determination, as will be perceived from
                            the following quotation :—“ The true place in nature,” says Mr Mac-
                            leay, “ of the singular genera <hi rend="italic">Xenos</hi> and <hi
                            rend="italic">Stylops,</hi> is indeed very difficult to determine ; and
                            what remarks, therefore, I am now about to offer on them ought to be
                            received by the reader with great caution, as well because it has
                            hitherto been out of my power to become acquainted with them, except
                            through the medium of the works of Kirby, Latreille, Savigny, and
                            Lamarck, as because the total variance in the statements of these
                            authors respecting them demonstrates that their true nature is as yet by
                            no means ascertained.</p>
                        <p>“ Professor Peck and Savigny, however, have both most satisfactorily
                            shown that the <hi rend="italic">Ŝtrepsiptera</hi> are provided with
                            true mandibles and palpigerous maxillae ; and therefore have completely
                            set aside the opinion of MM. Lamarck and Latreille as to their affinity
                            with the <hi rend="italic">Ωiptera.</hi> Proceeding, then, on the fact
                            that they belong to the <hi rend="italic">Mandi- bulata,</hi> which, by
                            the by, appears at last to be admitted by Latreille, we necessarily make
                            inquiry as to the particular part of this class in which they ought to
                            be placed. Now, the only chasms of importance which we have noticed in
                            the column, are one between the <hi rend="italic">Trichoptera</hi> of
                            Kirby and the <hi rend="italic">Tentliredines,</hi> and the other
                            between the <hi rend="italic">Hyrnenορtera</hi> and the <hi
                            rend="italic">Coleoptera.</hi> The deficiency of ocelli, the structure
                            of the whole insect, but particularly that of the wings prove that the
                            <hi rend="italic">Ŝtrepsiptera</hi> cannot occupy any vacancy near the
                            <hi rend="italic">Trichoptera.</hi> It therefore only remains for <hi

                            Mr Kirby ; for, in his very remarkable paper on those insects, in the
                            eleventh volume of the <hi rend="italic">Linnaean Transactions,</hi> he
                            says, ‘ With respect to the place of <hi rend="italic">Ŝtrepsiptera</hi>
                            in the system, it seems to me that this order should follow <hi

                            metamorphosis being different from that of <hi rend="italic"

                            of the <hi rend="italic">Coleoptera,</hi> this seems its most natural
                            station, considered as an elytrophorous order, especially since, if it
                            be inserted between <hi rend="italic">Ôrthoptera</hi> and <hi
                            rend="italic">Hemiptera,</hi> with both of which it .has some affinity,
                            it would interrupt the series of semicoplete metamorphosis, by which,
                            besides other characters, these two orders are so closely united.’ He
                            had previously noticed a circumstance which at once distinguishes them
                            from all <hi rend="italic">Colcoptera</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Ôrthoptera,</hi> and gives them an affinity with the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Hymenoptera,</hi> namely, a narrow collar instead of an ample thoracic
                            shield. And it is worthy of remark that Rossi, in the work which
                            informed naturalists of their existence, placed them among the <hi
                            rend="italic">Hy- rnenορtera,</hi> induced to this, as Mr Kirby
                            supposes, by the economy of their larvae. Such, then, is in all
                            probability their true place in nature, though certainly my opinion on
                            the subject, for the reasons already stated, ought to be received, as it
                            is advanced, with great caution. The <hi rend="italic">Xenos,</hi>
                            beyond a doubt, is, with the <hi rend="italic">Stylops,</hi> the most
                            puzzling insect to place naturally that we know ; it is truly ‘ <hi
                            rend="italic">animal</hi><hi rend="italic">animum excrucians</hi> and no
                            better proof of this can be given than that when Lamarck and Latreille
                            make the <hi rend="italic">Strepsiptera</hi> a division of <hi
                            rend="italic">Diptera,</hi> they seem absolutely to have pitched on the
                            most artificial situation for them which they could have chosen.
                            Latreille has remarked that the body of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Strepsiptera</hi> bears a striking relation to that of some <hi
                            rend="italic">Homοptera</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and to judge from
                            the descriptions given by Mr Kirby of these insects, their wings are
                            folded like those of <hi rend="italic">Ôrthoptera,</hi> while the form
                            of their head resembles that of some <hi rend="italic">Neuroptera.</hi>
                            To the <hi rend="italic">Diptera</hi> they have no visible affinity, and
                            scarcely any analogy, except such as we might expect from their
                            proximity to the <hi rend="italic">Hymenop- tera.</hi> How far I am
                            right in adopting Mr Kirby’s opinion as to their real affinities,
                            remains yet to be seen ; but it is no weak argument in support of its
                            accuracy, that they possess the very precise kind of metamorphosis which
                            insects in the hiatus between the <hi rend="italic">Coleoptera</hi> and
                            <hi rend="italic">Hymenop- tera</hi> ought to have from analogy.</p>
                        <p>“ The <hi rend="italic">Strepsiptera</hi> ought probably to be considered
                            as an osculant order ; and they undoubtedly form a group which is
                            apparently of much greater importance, and is marked with much stronger
                            characters, than the <hi rend="italic">Dictuoptera.</hi> These can
                            scarcely be said to afford a type of any very peculiar construction, and
                            may therefore, perhaps, with more propriety, be viewed as an annectent
                            tribe falling into the extensive order of <hi rend="italic"

                            antennae is composed of three small articulations. The abdomen is fleshy
                            and retractile. N. <hi rend="italic">Melittae,</hi> Kirby, measures
                            about a line and a half in length, and is quite black, with brown legs.
                            The wings are longer than the body. The larva is soft, almost
                            cylindrical, and whitish. Its head is advanced, homy, heart-shaped, a
                            little flattened, of a reddish colour, black posteriorly, and somewhat
                            concave beneath. It lives m the bodies of <hi rend="italic"
                            >Andrenae,</hi> and when about to be transformed to a chrysalis or pupa
                            (Plate CCXXXI. fig. 29), it fixes itself more outwardly, between the
                            abdominal plates. It occurs in Britain and the continent of Europe.
                            Additional species have been lately discovered by Mr Dale and others,
                            and will be found described in the works of Messrs Curtis and

                            Xenos are readily known by the unnatural swelling of the fourth segment
                            of the abdomen, from which the insect in the perfect state is usually
                            found to emerge. Sometimes one, not seldom two, and occasionally three,
                            are seen to escape from the same wasp. They generally come forth in the
                            winged state in August and September ; and if during that period the

                            covering broken open, and the white tunic carefully stripped away,
                            living specimens may be obtained. The mode in which these parasites are
                            originally placed on their living prey is not yet known. It is possible
                            that the egg may be laid in the larva of the wasp before its cell is
                            closed. Rossi at least seems to be of this opinion, although Mr Kirby,
                            reasoning from analogy, thinks it unlikely that it should be deposited
                            on the wasp in its first state, while the larva feeds on it in its last.
                            It has been a subject of wonder to naturalists that these Vespae, after
                            supporting one or more parasites, should survive ; yet we know that they
                            are often met with in a most active and vigorous condition, with only
                            the exuviae of the Xenos remaining in them. It has been stated as an
                            explanation of this, that the time during which the insect remains in
                            the larva state is very short ; and as it does not attack the thorax of
                            the wasp, the muscular energy and general vital powers of the latter
                            thus escape destruction. The other species to which we alluded is the
                            <hi rend="italic">X. Pechii</hi> (Plate CCXXXI. figs. 30 and 31), so
                            named after an American naturalist, Professor Peck, by whom it was made
                            known to Mr Kirby. This species measures one and a half lines in length.
                            It is of a blackish-brown colour, the legs livid, the tarsi brown. The
                            branches of the antennae are subdiaphanous, and spotted with white. The
                            larva inhabits a North American wasp called <hi rend="italic">Polistes
                            fuscata,</hi> of which it so distorts the abdomen that, according to
                            Professor Peck, there is no difficulty in distinguishing the infested
                            individuals even on the wing. “ Taking them,” he observes, “ with the
                            gauze forceps, bringing them into a close room, and permitting them to
                            fly to the windows, I caught them again with a wine glass and a card,
                            fed them with sugar, and thus preserved them till their parasites were
                            disclosed. I had not the pleasure to see them emerge, but found them
                            soon after.” “ In the feeding state the head of the larva is near the
                            abdomen of the wasp, as I found by dissection. When the feeding state is
                            passed, it is easy to conceive that it turns, and with its flattened
                            head separates the membrane which connects the abdominal scuta, and
                            protrudes itself a little way, accurately closing the aperture, which is
                            but just large enough to admit it. All this time the wasp is active, and
                            associates with its companions. When just protruded, the head of the
                            larva is of a pale-brownish colour ; by degrees it assumes a rounder
                            form, and becomes almost black. The chrysalis state ensues ; but I
                            suspect that only the part exposed to the air, and that immediately
                            under the pressure of the'abdominal rings, becomes hard.”<note

                            The mouth consists of from two to six setaceous pieces of a

                            probosciform sheath, terminated by two lips, or covered by one or two
                            inarticulate laminae, which form the sheath.<note anchored="true"

                        <p>Dipterous species, like all other hexapod insects, are Composed of three
                            principal portions. The head is more or less globular or hemispherical,
                            often concave posteriorly, so as to fit better on the front of the
                            thorax, and is susceptible of turning on itself, as on a pivot, from
                            right to left, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> The greater part
                            of its surface, especially in the males, is generally occupied by the
                            eyes, which are often very beautiful, being composed of a vast number of
                            facettes, lighted up as it were with a metallic splendour. When ocelli
                            or stemmatic eyes exist in this order, they are always three in number,
                            and placed upon the vertex. &gt;. When the mouth (which is not adapted
                            for chewing or bruising solid substances, but only for extracting and
                            transmitting fluids) consists of six pieces, it then exhibits all the
                            parts analogous to those of masticating insects. Of these parts a single
                            superior portion represents the labrum, and a single inferior portion
                            the ligula properly so called, of the coleopterous and orthopterous
                            orders. The four other parts are disposed in pairs ; the upper pair
                            corresponding to the mandibles, the lower to the terminal portion of the
                            maxillae of the masticating orders. The basal portion of the maxillae
                            also exists, but it is always very short, and confounded with the fleshy
                            mass, which serves as the base of the trunk, and precedes its first
                            geniculation. Thus in the Muscides, for example, the sucker consists of
                            only two setae, and is yet accompanied by a pair of palpi, which,
                            according to analogy, can only be those of the maxillae. Seeing that the
                            piece representing the labrum is inserted, with the other portions of
                            the sucker, near the geniculation of the trunk, and at some distance
                            from the anterior margin of the head,—and that, in other insects, the
                            labrum is always fixed to that margin,—it becomes necessary that a
                            portion of the base of the clypeus, or epistoma as it is now called,
                            should be incorporated with the support of the sucker. We have just
                            stated that the inferior portions of the maxillae are likewise united
                            with the supporting part, which, when not in action, is withdrawn into
                            the oral cavity. It is not thus with the Lepidoptera and Hemiptera,—the
                            corresponding portion of the maxillae in these orders being fixed and
                            immoveable, and the labrum always preserving its relative· position. In
                            some Diptera the sucker is composed of only four pieces, and then the
                            <hi rend="italic">mandibular</hi> setae are wanting or imperceptible.
                            Indeed in a great number we perceive only two pieces, and in that case
                            it is the single pieces only <hi rend="italic">(impaires),</hi> that is,
                            the labrum and ligula, which are cognisable. The reduction in the number
                            of these parts is, according to Latreille, a proof of the inferiority of
                            the dipterous order, when compared with the generality of insects. The
                            sucker in our present order performs the office of a lancet, by piercing
                            the envelope of vegetable fluids, or the vessels which contain the
                            juices of animals. These liquids, by pressure of the parts, are then
                            forced to ascend the internal canal to the pharynx, situate at the inner
                            base of the sucker. The lancets are often grooved or furrowed, by which
                            they become more compactly enclosed, and act in common. The sheath or
                            external part merely serves to maintain the lancet <hi rend="italic">in
                            situ,</hi> and seems to represent the lower lip of the triturating
                            orders. It i <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> frequently bent upon itself,
                            at an angle more or less acute, when the insect is using the sucker.
                            This becomes obvious when we examine a gnat or mosquito in the act of
                            pumping our blood.</p>
                        <p>The antennae of the Diptera are usually inserted on the front, and are
                            approximate at their base. In the famii called Nemocera by Latreillc
                            (<hi rend="italic">Culex</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tipula,</hi> Linn.)
                            these organs resemble those of the nocturnal Lepidopterε in form and
                            position, but in his other families theyseldoir consist of more than two
                            or three articulations, the last of which is fusiform, or shaped like a
                            lenticular or prismatic pallet, provided either with a little styliform
                            appendage or a thickish hair or seta, itself sometimes simple, sometimes
                            pilose.</p>
                        <p>The thorax appears as if composed of only a single segment, the first, or
                            prothorax, being very short, or some times evanescent, and the
                            metathorax being also ver; short, and occupying only the posterior
                            extremity, situate beneath the scutellum. The mesothorax, or
                            intermediate portion, thus becomes the principal apparent segment It
                            bears on each side a pair of stigmata, of which, however, the anterior
                            is frequently alone distinguishable.</p>
                        <p>The neuration of the veins of the wings is simple. These parts are
                            usually horizontal. Meigen’s figures of the wings (of which we have
                            availed ourselves in the plates connected with this article) are
                            extremely exact. He confines himself, however, chiefly to the antennae
                            in the formation of his generic characters, without having recourse to
                            Jurine’s method of employing the neuration of the organs of flight,—a
                            method, indeed, the application of which in the dipterous tribes is
                            attended with greater difficulties than among the hymenopterous order.
                            It has, however, been used in relation to the Diptera by Fallen, and
                            other systematic authors.</p>
                        <p>Above the true wings, and a little behind them, are two small moveable
                            bodies, almost membranous or slightly corneous, usually pale in colour,
                            nearly linear in the greater part of their extent, but with a knob or
                            button-like mass at the extremity, capable of dilatation. These are the
                            balancers or <hi rend="italic">halteres,</hi> of the nature and supposed
                            uses of which we have already spoken at sufficient length in our general

                        <p>Above the balancers we find two membranous or papyraceous pieces, usually
                            white or yellowish, ciliated, united together by one of their sides, and
                            having the form of two valves of a shell applied upon each other. These
                            are the winglets, or <hi rend="italic">ailerons</hi> of the French

                            during flight the valves are held in separation, or nearly on the same

                        <p>The abdomen of dipterous insects is frequently attached to the thorax by
                            a portion only of its transverse diameter. It is composed of from five
                            to nine apparent segments, and in the females usually terminates in a
                            point; in those, however, in which the segments are fewer, the terminal
                            ones form a kind of ovipositor, presenting a succession of small tubes
                            which slip into each other somewhat after the fashion of the différent

                            entomologists, derived additional weight from Sir Everard Home’s papers
                            on the subject, illustrated by drawings from the always admirable pen of

                            has been variously described by different authors, and by some in such a
                            manner as (supposing their descriptions accurate) to render the organs
                            unfit for the uses supposed, or at least for the particular mode of
                            action assigned by Derham and Home, and coincided in by Messrs Kirby and

                            described the house-fly as having the soles of its feet beset underneath
                            with small bristles or tenters, like the wire teeth of a card for
                            working wool, and which he conceived to give them a strong hold upon any
                            object having irregular or yielding surfaces. In regard to glass, which
                            is neither yielding nor irregular, he imagined that it bore upon it a
                            kind of smoky substance, penetrable by the points of the bristles.<note

                            Mr Blackwall to inspect the parts minutely under a good compound
                            microscope, when he immediately became convinced that the function
                            assigned by the writers we have first named was incompatible with the
                            actual organization. “Minute hairs,” he observes, “ very closely set,
                            and directed downwards, so completely cover the inferior surface of the
                            expanded membranes, improperly denominated suckers, with which the
                            terminal joint of the tarsi of flies is provided, that it cannot be
                            brought into contact with the objects on which those insects move, by
                            any muscular force they are capable of exerting. The production of a
                            vacuum between each membrane and the plane of position is therefore
                            clearly impracticable, unless the numerous hairs on the under side of
                            these organs individually perform the office of suckers; and there does
                            not appear to be any thing in their mechanism which in the slightest
                            degree countenances such a hypothesis.”<note anchored="true"

                            them in clear jars and phials of transparent glass, the interior surface
                            of which they traversed in every direction with the greatest facility,
                            even walking upon it with their backs downward, while they remained in
                            full vigour ; but when enfeebled either by exposure to cold or by the
                            fatigue of over exertion, the identical individuals ascended the sides
                            of the same jars and phials with difficulty (falling from them
                            frequently), and were altogether incapable of adhering in an inverted
                            position. No sooner, however, were they recruited by repose or an
                            increase of temperature, than they again repeated those extraordinary
                            feats, to which custom makes us callous, with all their original
                            exterity. He likewise found, that flies which are unable to maintain an
                            inverted position on highly polished °odies, will frequently adhere
                            firmly, with their backs</p>
                        <p>downward, to glass defective in polish or slightly soiled. 1his and other
                            facts plainly indicated that flies are not supported on the vertical
                            sides of smooth bodies either by the pressure of the atmosphere or by
                            the aid of a glutinous secretion (as conjectured by some authors), but
                            by means strictly mechanical, as suggested by Dr Hooke It has been
                            found, in fact, that the house-fly, while it retains its vital powers
                            unimpaired, can not only traverse the upright sides, but even the
                            interior of the dome of an exhausted receiver; and that the cause of its
                            relaxing its hold, and ultimately falling from the station it occupies,
                            is a diminution of muscular force attributable to impeded
                            respiration.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                        <p>In regard to the anatomical structure of the dipterous order, the
                            following is the substance of the observations on the subject given by
                            Μ. Marcel de Serres, in his admirable memoir <hi rend="italic">Sur le
                            Vaisseau</hi><hi rend="italic">dorsal</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                            Insectes.</hi> The dorsal vessel (now regarded as the heart) is itself
                            narrow, and its pulsations frequent. The respiratory system consists of
                            vesicular tracheae, communicating with each other by tubular tracheae,
                            and unfurnished with those cartilaginous hoops which we find in the
                            Orthoptera. The nervous system is generally composed of a small
                            cerebriform ganglion with approximated lobes, from which proceed large
                            optic nerves ; two medullary cords of the ordinary kind (already
                            described in our preceding general introduction) form from space to
                            space about nine ganglia, of which three belong to the thorax and six to
                            the abdomen. The intestinal tube presents, Isŕ, an oesophagus extending
                            to the base of the abdomen ; 2d, a rather elongated stomach, somewhat
                            narrow, and furnished at its origin with a considerable number of
                            hepatic vessels ; 3<hi rend="smallcaps">d</hi>, a cylindrical duodenum,
                            also accompanied by hepatic vessels, but of narrower dimensions; 4∕∕z, a
                            short and muscular rectum.</p>
                        <p>All the Diptera dissected by Μ. Dufour were provided with salivary
                            glands, a character which that accurate observer regards as being common
                            to all insects furnished with a sucker. The structure, however, of those
                            parts varies according to the genus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                            type="authorial"><p>recherches Anatomiques sur ľHippobosque des Chevaux,
                            Annales des Sciences Nat. vi∙ 301.</p></note> They no doubt serve to
                            increase the fluidity of the nutritive juices absorbed by the sucker. We
                            may add, that both Dufour and Dutro- chet have observed that the stomach
                            of many Diptera is accompanied by a kind of paunch, in which a portion
                            of the aliments is deposited.</p>
                        <p>Many tribes of this extensive order, if not decidedly noxious, at least
                            occasion us great annoyance, not only by sucking our own blood, but by
                            laying their eggs on the bodies of our living domestic animals, and on
                            whatever uncooked fleshy viands they can attain to, especially during
                            sultry weather, when the process of corruption is the most speedy, and
                            the insects themselves are in their prime of strength and vigour. On the
                            other hand, they may be regarded as serviceable, on account of the rapid
                            consumption, by their most gluttonous larvae, of all animal and several
                            vegetable substances in a state of putridity. Their term of life in the
                            perfect state is but of short duration. A few months or even weeks
                            elapse, and their merry course is run. Such as contrive to fight their
                            way to the conclusion of the ambiguous autumn, perish on the first
                            approach of frost. A few half-benumbed house-flies indeed are generally
                            seen in our apartments till Christmas time ; and the delusive gleam of a
                            sunny winter day not <pb break="no" facs="nls:193748612"
                            xml:id="kp-eb0709-8612-0258"/> seldom re-animates their feeble forms so
                            far as to produce a dubious buzz about our windows ; but such as show
                            themselves in open places are speedily snapped up by redbreasts and
                            other feathered epicures, greedy of insect food at that unaccustomed
                            season ; and it is probable that few survive till spring. As their eggs,
                            however, are generally deposited in a putrescent nidus, adapted to the
                            propensities of the incipient young ; and as that nidus is not of a
                            nature to remain for a length of time unconsumed, it may be fairly
                            inferred that our summer swarms are produced originally from a few
                            individuals, which in some snug corner have survived the most inclement
                            season of the year, and are not the result (as happens in the case of
                            many lepidopterous kinds) of eggs which have been laid during the
                            preceding autumn. It is possible that such as assume the pupa state
                            towards the close of summer under ground, may rest secure in that
                            condition, till called into their winged existence by the returning
                            warmth of the enlivening spring.</p>
                        <p>All these insects undergo a complete metamorphosis, and are remarkable in
                            this, that the larvae do not change their skins except at the period of
                            their passing into the nympha state. Some form a kind of cocoon ; but
                            others remain uncovered, and can scarcely be even said to change their
                            skin, which seems to harden over them, so as to form an egg-like case
                            for the enclosed pupa. Dipterous larvae are apodal or without feet,
                            although some which belong to the family Nemocera of Lat. are provided
                            with appendages which serve the same purpose. The head is sometimes
                            projected and constant in its form, sometimes variable in figure,
                            capable of being withdrawn into the body, and undistinguishable from the
                            other segments except by its anterior position, and the existence of the
                            parts of the mouth. This soft and changeable form of the head is, we
                            conceive, peculiar to the larvae of the present order. It is generally
                            furnished with one or two retractile hooks, and some nipple-like
                            projections. The principal orifices of respiration are almost always
                            placed at the posterior extremity ; and in many species there is also a
                            pair of stigmatic openings on the segment next the head. Such as dwell
                            in water, or inhabit corrupt and fluid matters, have their bodies
                            terminated posteriorly by a tail-like prolongation, susceptible of being
                            lengthened or withdrawn according to circumstances, and ending in a
                            radiated expansion, which communicates with internal tracheae. There are
                            few pieces of natural mechanism so ingenious and admirable as the
                            respiratory systems of the rat-tailed worm, and of the larvae of gnats
                            and other aquatic Diptera.</p>
                        <p>We have already alluded to the peculiar transformation of these insects.
                            The skin of the larva seems to harden over and enclose the nymph. The
                            body of the contained insect first detaches itself to a certain extent
                            from the outer skin, leaving on its inner surface the exuviae of its
                            external organs. In its early state it presents only a soft or
                            gelatinous mass, without distinct characters ; but after a time the
                            parts or the perfect insect begin to be developed, and it finally
                            escapes from its prison by butting with its head against the upper part
                            of the case, which ere long opens as it were upon a hinge, like the lid
                            of a cylindrical snuff-box.</p>
                        <p>The general characteristics of this order are obvious to the eye of an
                            ordinary observer, and are designated in the works even of the most
                            ancient naturalists. Yet Fabricius, by placing with the Diptera certain
                            Arachnides, and the parasitical species of the genus Pediculus,
                            falsified the essential nature of the order. It cannot be denied,
                            however, that here, as in all other great natural groups, there are
                            anomalous or aberrant genera, which depart in a great measure from the
                            ordinary conditions of their kind. Thus, among the pupiparous tribes,
                            the wings, the balancers, and the usual sheath of the sucker, show a
                            tendency to disappear in many species ; and in <hi rend="italic"

                                <p>The species of this and of some nearly allied genera are
                                    extremely troublesome towards evening, especially in the
                                    neighbourhood of moist or marshy places. They are greedy of
                                    blood, and under the well-known names of Gnats, Mosquitoes,
                                    &amp;c. they persecute man and beast, not only sucking our “
                                    life-stream,” but instilling a poison which, though feeble from
                                    its minute quantity, yet often produces pain and inflammation.
                                    Although abundant in Italy and all the warmer countries of the
                                    earth, they are nowhere more troublesome than amid the barren
                                    wastes of Lapland. They feed also on vegetable juices. The
                                    female deposits her eggs in the water to the amount of several
                                    hundreds, and the larvae are consequently very frequent in all
                                    stagnant pools in spring and summer, where they may be seen when
                                    undisturbed, suspended from the surface, with their heads
                                    downwards. At this time they breathe by the caudal extremity ;
                                    but in the nympha state, during which they are still aquatic,
                                    the respiratory organs are placed upon the thorax. On assuming

                                <p>The manners of these insects have been studied by Geoffroy and
                                    Réaumur. The larvae have a long flattened body, covered by a
                                    coriaceous or rather solid skin, divided into segments, of which
                                    the last three, more slender and elongated than the others, form
                                    a tail terminated by a radiated expansion of barbed or plumy
                                    hairs. The head is scaly, small, oblong, and provided with a
                                    great many appendages and hooks, with which they agitate the
                                    water in which they dwell. They respire by an opening in the
                                    caudal segment, while suspended from the surface. Their skin
                                    becomes the cocoon of the nymph. The latter scarcely change
                                    their form, but they assume a rigid consistence, and become
                                    incapable of motion. They float upon the water, and their tails
                                    frequently form a right angle with the body. The perfect insect
                                    issues from a cleft which opens in the second ring. The species
                                    are few in number. About half a dozen are found in Britain.</p>

                                    remarkable for the great length and singular uses of their
                                    caudal extremity. It serves as a respiratory organ. The insect
                                    lies at the bottom of stagnant waters, generally concealed in
                                    the mud ; but the point of its attenuated tail is meanwhile in
                                    contact with the surface. Réaumur found, by increasing the depth
                                    of water, that the larva could extend its respiratory tube to
                                    the height of five inches. After that, however, it was seen to
                                    leave the mud, and ascend the side of the vessel in which it was
                                    contained, that it might attain to the surface with greater
                                    ease. The tail seems composed of two parts, one of which slips
                                    into the other like the portions of a telescope. They are
                                    composed of annular fibres, and when these are contracted, each
                                    tube is greatly increased in length.</p>

                                    it appeared in unusual abundance in the fields adjoining

                                <p>, 78, 15, pl. xi. f. 14-22. Found in England, the south of
                                    Scotland, and various parts of the continent. The genus contains
                                    upwards of fifty species, none of them much exceeding three
                                    lines in length ; nearly the half inhabi⅛Bri- tain. The larva of
                                    the one above mentioned is described by Degeer. He found it
                                    under ground in the month of May. It is white, cylindrical,
                                    eight lines in length, with a pointed or conical anterior. The
                                    head varies in ιorm, being often sunk into the first segment. On
                                    the fourth of June it became a nymph, of a much shorter and
                                    thicker shape than the larva. It was then very restless, rolling
                                    about incessantly, with a constant movement of the abdomen. The
                                    perfect insect appeared on the 27th of the same month.</p>

                                    exciting such a degree of inflammation in the membrane on which
                                    they rest, as to cause the secretion of lymph or pus. Mr Clark
                                    has usually found these larvae in the horns or frontal sinuses,
                                    though he has remarked that the membranes of those cavities were
                                    scarcely at all inflamed, while those of the maxillary sinuses
                                    were highly so. From this he is led to suspect that they inhabit
                                    the maxillary sinuses, and crawl, on the death of the animal,
                                    towards the horns and frontal sinuses. In common with <hi
                                    rend="italic">OE. Bovis,</hi> they do not seem confined to any
                                    particular season, for young and old are found together at the
                                    same time. When full grown they fall through the nostrils, and
                                    change to the pupa state, lying on the earth, or adhering by the
                                    side to a blade of grass. The fly bursts the shell of the pupa
                                    in about two months.</p>
                                <p>The manner in which the perfect insect lays its eggs is difficult
                                    to determine, owing to its obscure colour and extremely rapid
                                    movements. The great agitation of the sheep also interferes with
                                    accurate observation, but its general motions and method of
                                    defence leave little doubt that the eggs are deposited on the
                                    inner margin of the nostril. “ The moment,” Mr Clark observes, “
                                    the fly touches this part of the sheep,, they shake their heads,
                                    and strike the ground violently with their fore feet; at the
                                    same time, holding their noses close to the earth, they run
                                    away, looking about them on every side, to see if the fly
                                    pursues ; they also smell to the grass as they go, lest one
                                    should be lying in wait for them. If they observe one, they
                                    gallop back, or take some other direction. As they cannot, like
                                    the horses, take refuge in the water, they have recourse to a
                                    rut, or dry dusty road, or gravel pits, where they crowd
                                    together during the heat of the day, with their noses held close
                                    to the ground, which renders it difficult for the fly to get at
                                    the nostril.” Mr C. imagines that the last-named part, from the
                                    constant attacks, and the consequent rubbing upon the ground,
                                    becomes inflamed and painful, which occasions their touch to be
                                    so greatly dreaded by the sheep.</p>
                                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Oestrus Bovis,</hi> in the perfect state,
                                    is a very beautiful insect, and one of the largest of the
                                    European species. The wings are without spots ; the abdomen has
                                    a central band of black, and is clothed at the extremity by
                                    reddish-yellow hairs. Although its effects on cattle have been
                                    often remarked, yet the fly itself, as Mr Clark has observed, is
                                    rarely seen or taken, “as the attempt would be attended with
                                    considerable danger.” It inflicts greater pain in depositing its
                                    eggs than any other species. “ When one of the cattle is
                                    attacked with this fly, it is easily known by the extreme terror
                                    and agitation of the whole herd : the unfortunate object of the
                                    attack runs bellowing from among them to some distant part of
                                    the heath, or the nearest water, while the tail, from the
                                    severity of the pain, is held with a tremulous motion straight
                                    from the body, in the direction of the spine, and the head and
                                    neck are also stretched out to the utmost. The rest, from fear,
                                    generally follow to the water, or disperse to different part« of
                                    the field. And such is the dread and apprehension i∣ the cattle,
                                    of this fly, that I have seen one of them mee the herd when
                                    almost driven home, and turn them back regardless of the stones,
                                    sticks, and noise of their drivers nor could they be stopped
                                    till they reached their accustomed retreat in the water. When
                                    oxen are yoked t∣ the plough, the attack of this fly is attended
                                    with rea danger, as they become perfectly uncontrollable, and
                                    wiľ often run with the plough directly forwards, through the
                                    hedges, or whatever obstructs their way.” The attack o: this
                                    small but dreaded foe has indeed been often described, and by
                                    none with more of taste and accuracy than b∙ the “ Mantuan

                                <p>The female deposits her eggs with great rapidity, and does not
                                    remain above a few seconds on the back of the animal. The larvae
                                    live beneath the skin, between it and the cellular membrane, in
                                    a proper sack or abscess, rather larger than the insect. When
                                    young they are smooth, white, and transparent, become darker as
                                    they increase, and when full grown are of a deep-brown colour.
                                    After a time they work their way out, fall to the ground, and
                                    assume the state of chrysalis, in which they continue from about
                                    the latter end of June till towards the middle of August, when
                                    the perfect insect makes its appearance.</p>

                                    its young a situation in the stomach of the horse is truly
                                    singular, and is effected in the following manner;—When the
                                    female has been impregnated, and the eggs are sufficiently
                                    matured, she seeks among the horses a subject for her purpose,
                                    and approaching it on the wing, she holds her body nearly
                                    upright in the air, and her tail, which is lengthened for the
                                    purpose, curved inwards and upwards : in this way she approaches
                                    the part where she designs to deposit the egg, and suspending
                                    herself for a few seconds before it, suddenly darts upon it, and
                                    leaves the egg adhering to the hair : she hardly appears to
                                    settle, but merely touches the hair with the egg held out on the
                                    projected point of the abdomen. The egg is made to adhere by
                                    means of a glutinous liquor secreted with it. She then leaves
                                    the horse at a small distance, and prepares a second egg, and,
                                    poising herself before the part, deposits it in the same way.
                                    The liquor dries, and the eggs become firmly glued to the hair :
                                    this is repeated by various flies till 400 or 500 eggs are
                                    sometimes placed on one horse. The horses, when they become used

                                    the horse touches the egg, its <hi rend="italic">operculum</hi>
                                    is thrown open, and a small active worm is produced, which
                                    readily adheres to the moist surface of the tongue, and is from
                                    thence conveyed with the food to the stomach.” Mr Clark has
                                    often clipped off some hairs with eggs on them, and holding them
                                    in his hand, moistened with saliva, has seen them hatched in a
                                    few seconds. If the larvae pass the dreadful ordeal of
                                    mastication, and are transmitted uninjured to the horse’s
                                    stomach, they attach themselves to every part of it, but are
                                    generally most numerous about the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >pylorus.</hi> Sometimes, but much less frequently, they occur
                                    in the intestines. Their numbers are very various,—from half a
                                    dozen to above a hundred. They generally hang in clusters, being
                                    fixed by tl e small end to the inner membrane of the stomach, to
                                    which they adhere by means of two small hooks or <hi
                                    rend="italic">tenta- cula.</hi> When removed from the stomach
                                    they will attach themselves to any loose membrane with which
                                    they may come in contact, and even to the skin of the hand. On
                                    attaining to their full size, they pass by the intestinal canal,
                                    drop to the ground, and enter the chrysalis state.</p>
                                <p>pon the whole, Mr Clark does not regard these insects as hurtful
                                    to horses, but rather views them favourably, as natural <hi

                                    as the cause of the epidemic malady which in 1713 earned oft so
                                    many horses in the territories of Mantua and the Veronese.<note

                                    resting on the stems of trees.</p>
                                <p>The larva of this species lives in cow-dung. It is yel- <hi

                                    ical, and composed of many segments. At the rncuth or narrowest
                                    end it has only one hook, and four short fleshy horns or warts.
                                    The hinder end or anus is, as it were, four-cornered and
                                    truncated, and has two circular brown spots, which are slightly
                                    raised, and are each perforated by a single air-hole. The two
                                    anterior airholes are placed on the sides of the first segment.
                                    The larva changes itself in its own skin into a dark-brown
                                    nymph, which is nine-cornered behind, or nearly circular, and
                                    the posterior air-holes are observable. In summer the fly
                                    appears in a few weeks, but the nymphs formed late in the season
                                    continue throughout the winter, and produce the perfect insect
                                    in the spring.</p>

                                    known. A white crust forms upon the abdomen, which becomes
                                    greatly distended, and the segments become distant from each
                                    other, so as to produce a ringed appearance. In this condition
                                    it is frequently found dead, adhering to walls, and sometimes to
                                    the stalks or leaves of plants. Its body is at this time filled
                                    with a fatty matter, which has been observed to have exploded on
                                    all sides through the pores.</p>

                                last volume of the German author we do not, however, find any
                                indication of <hi rend="smallcaps">Division</hi> IT. Presuming,
                                nevertheless, from the strong disparity of character presented by
                                the <hi rend="smallcaps">Coriaceae,</hi> when compared with the
                                preceding families, that they must constitute the other principal
                                branch of the dipterous order, we have applied the name of <hi
                                rend="smallcaps">Eproboscideae,</hi> as significative of the
                                division sought for. It was so applied by Latrei)le {Gen. Crust, et
                                Insect, t. iv∙ p&gt; 360), as well as (excepting Nycteribïd) by Dr
                                Leach ( Wernerian Memoirs, vol. ii. p. 547), to the family in
                                question. The species of which it is composed are in truth of a very
                                singular structure and economy, and altogether of a nature so
                                anomalous, as to cause some doubts as to their proper position in
                                the system. They are now regarded as constituting a separate order,
                                under the name of Ho- <hi rend="smallcaps">molopteka,</hi> by Leach,

                                family <hi rend="smallcaps">Pupipara</hi> of Latreille. Some
                                contrariety of opinion still exists regarding the structure of the
                                mouth. We shall here satisfy ourselves by a quotation from the last-
                                named entomologist, to whom we have been already so deeply indebted.
                                “ La tête de ces insectes, vue en dessus, est divise'e en deux aires
                                ou parties distinctes, dont l’une postérieure et principale, ou
                                composant plus spécialement la tête, porte les yeux, et reçoit,,dans
                                one échancrure antérieure, l’autre partie· Celle-ci se partage aussi
                                en deux, dont la postérieure plus grande et coriace porte
                                latéralement les antennes, et dont l’autre constitue l’appareil
                                manducateur. La cavité inférieure et buccale de la tête est occupée
                                par one membrane ; on voit sortir de son extrémité un suçoir,
                                naissant d’un petit bulbe ou pédicule avancé, composé de deux filets
                                ou soies très rapprochés, et recouvert par deux lames coriaces,
                                étroites, alongées et velues, qui lui font l’ufiice de gaine. Que
                                ces lames ou va - vules représentent, ainsi que je l’ai présumé, les
                                palpes des autres diptères, ou qu’elles soient les pièces d’une
                                gaine proprement dite, comme le,pense Μ. Dufour, a l’occasion d’une
                                espèce d’ornithomyie {Annales des Scienc. Nat. x. 243, xi. 1), où il

                                prend pour des palpes, il n’en serait pas moins vrai, que la trompe
                                de ces insectes différerait sensiblement de celle des diptcies
                                précédents, et que la gaine, dans ce cas, aurait plus de rapports
                                avec celle de la trompe de la puce, dont elle s’éloignerait
                                cependant par l’absence d’articulations. {Règne Animal, t. v. p.

                                <p>We are still indebted to Réaumur for the greater part of our
                                    knowledge regarding the very singular mode of production in the
                                    genus Hippobosea, or forest-flies, as these insects are
                                    sometimes called. That delightful observer has named them <hi
                                    rend="italic">Mouches Araignées.</hi> The larva is hatched and
                                    nourished within the body of the mother, and remains there till
                                    after its transformation to the nympha state. Hence the term <hi
                                    rend="italic">pupiparous,</hi> as applied to the Hip- poboseae
                                    and other genera of the tribe. The nymph, or rather cocoon, is
                                    at first of a milky whiteness, with a large plate (plaque) at
                                    one end, black and shining, like ebony. It is of a round and
                                    flattened form, emarginate at the plated end, where it forms two
                                    rounded or horn-like eminences. It becomes entirely black soon
                                    after exclusion, and the skin or covering, of a cartilaginous or
                                    sealytexture; resists a strong pressure of the fingers, and is
                                    even difficult to cut with the sharpest scissors. The body of
                                    the mother scarcely equals the dimensions of the nymph, and it
                                    has often been a subject of marvel how the greater should
                                    proceed from the less. It appears, however, that the cocoon is
                                    possessed of an expansive power, which is probably exercised the
                                    moment after its exclusion from the body of the parent. The
                                    hardness and solidity of the skin, though well qualified to
                                    defend the nymph from injury, might seem to present a serious
                                    obstacle to the escape of the perfect insect. But nature, so
                                    complete and bountiful in all her doings, and so pervaded even
                                    in her minutest operations by the perfect wisdom of her great
                                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Author,</hi> has provided against this
                                    seeming inconvenience by a beautiful contrivance. When we
                                    examine the larger end by means of a microscope, we shall
                                    perceive the feeble trace of what in fact constitutes a kind of
                                    cap or cowl, and which may sometimes be made to spring off even
                                    by the touch of a penknife. When the perfect insect is ready for
                                    exclusion, it finds it an easy matter to manage this piece of
                                    natural mechanism. The coriaceous envelope to which we have
                                    alluded is, in fact, the distended and somewhat altered skin of
                                    the larva, and within it Réaumur succeeded in detecting the
                                    exuviae of the nymph. The phenomena of transformation are,
                                    therefore, so far analogous to what we observe in the coarctate
                                    pupae of some other dipterous tribes, and the chief anomaly
                                    consists in the larva passing the entire period of its exis<pb

                                    of birds, but never on quadrupeds,—a fact in their history

                                    Latreille thinks that their metamorphoses resemble those of the

                                    position of which very various opinions have been entertained.
                                    The species are in fact entirely apterous, having neither wings
                                    nor halteres. They bear a general resemblance to spiders. The
                                    head is extremely small, and as it were implanted on the
                                    anterior and dorsal portion of the thorax, in the form of a
                                    little capsular tubercle. The eyes seem composed of minute
                                    grains. The thorax is semicircular. Even Latreille (in his
                                    earliest work) was so far misled by the anomalous aspect of
                                    these insects as to mistake the very <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                    >Class</hi> to which they belonged. He consequently placed them
                                    among the Arachnides. In this he was followed by Dr Leach,<note

                                <p>These curious insects, as far as yet known, occur on bats, over
                                    which they move with great rapidity ; but when withdrawn from
                                    their natural nidus they become quite confused, and almost
                                    incapable of locomotion. Their heads being placed as it were
                                    upon their dorsal aspect, it was difficult to understand how
                                    they satisfied their appetite ; and we owe to Colonel Montagu
                                    the observation, that when they suck the blood of bats they
                                    place themselves in a reverse position on their backs. Of the

                            furnished on each side with a little circular eye, behind which, and
                            lodged in a groove, we find certain small moveable articulated bodies,
                            which are the true antennae. Towards the anterior part of the head, and
                            near the origin of the sucker, are placed another pair of appendages,
                            which Latreille and others have regarded as the antennae, but which are
                            now with greater propriety considered as maxillae, or parts of the
                            mouth. Between these is placed the sucker, composed of a bivalvular
                            articulated sheath, and three setae. The sheath, according to Dugès,
                            corresponds to the labial palpi, while two of the setae represent the
                            mandibles, and the remaining one is regarded as the analogue of the
                            ligula.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the species,—“ Chacun," says Latreille, “connait la Puce
                            commune.” In this country we call <hi rend="italic">ıtß,ea;</hi> and,
                            presuming that it is nearly as well known here as in France, we shall
                            not trouble our readers with a detailed description. The female lays
                            about a dozen eggs, of a white colour, and slightly viscous. From these
                            ere long proceed little lively worms, which move like serpents, or roll
                            themselves about spirally, or in circles. They are at first white, but
                            become ere long of a reddish hue, and are composed of a sealyhead,
                            without eyes, furnished with two minute antennae, and of numerous
                            segments bearing little tufts of hair, and two hooks at the caudal
                            extremity. The mouth exhibits some small moveable pieces, of which the
                            larva makes use in pushing itself forward. They remain about twelve days
                            in that condition, and then each larva encloses itself in a little silk
                            cocoon, where it becomes a nymph, and from which, after about an equal
                            lapse of time, the perfect insect issues forth. The common flea (called
                            by naturalists <hi rend="italic">PRulx irritans,</hi> see the figure
                            last referred to) occurs in almost all countries. It is parasitical on
                            the bodies of several other animals besides the human kind (of which it
                            prefers children and the gentler sex, owing to the superior softness of
                            their skin), such as dogs, cats, hares, among quadrupeds,—and pigeons,
                            poultry, and swallows, among birds. Defrance, who has published some
                            interesting observations on the eggs and larvae, has also shown that
                            bathing domestic animals has no effect in ridding them even of the
                            perfect insect, which he has seen resume its wonted functions after a
                            continuous immersion of twenty-two hours. The process, however, is
                            useful, in as far as it appears to annoy the pregnant females, which do
                            not endure immersion above eleven hours. In Dalecarlia the natives place
                            hare-skins in their beds, and other parts of their houses, for the fleas
                            to nestle in. They then destroy them by dipping the skins in hot water,
                            or holding them over a fire.</p>
                        <p>The genus Pulex is by no means numerous in species. A large yellow kind
                            occurs upon the mole, and a banded species <hi rend="italic">(P.</hi><hi

                            some regarded as belonging to a distinct genus. Its sucker is as long as
                            its body (fig. 14, 6). It introduces itself beneath the toe nails, or
                            under the skin of the feet, where the female speedily acquires a
                            considerable bulk in consequence of the growth of her eggs (fig. 14, a).
                            The numerous young to which these give birth sometimes occasion
                            malignant ulcers, difficult to cure, and occasionally mortal. They are
                            extirpated by using a lavement of tobacco juice, or other acrid
                            infusion. The negroes, from frequent practice, extract them with great

                        <p>The insects of this order, like those of the preceding, are apterous, or
                            without wings. In addition to the usual number of legs, they are
                            provided, either along their sides, or at the extremity of the abdomen,
                            with peculiar organs, which assist the purposes of locomotion. They are
                            masticators, that is, furnished with mandibles and maxillae. They do not
                            undergo metamorphoses. All the species are of small size, of rather soft
                            consistence, and are generally covered either with shining silvery
                            scales or hairs. They avoid strong light, and seldom quit their retreats
                            till the shades of night have fallen. Some inhabit the interior of
                            houses, keeping themselves concealed in presses, in the interstices of
                            shutters, window-sashes, and other wooden fabrications ;—others occur
                            under stones and in humid places. The order is divisible into two
                            families.</p>

                                of Linnaeus. The antennae are setaceous, usually very long, and
                                divided from their base into many small articulations. The palpi are
                                distinct and projecting. The abdomen is furnished inferiorly on each
                                side with a range of moveable appendages in the form of false legs,
                                and is terminated by articulated setae, of which three are more
                                obvious than the others. The body is of an elongated form, and
                                covered with small shining silvery scales. The mouth is composed of
                                a labrum, two almost membranaceous mandibles, a pair of maxillae,
                                each furnished with a palpus of from five to six articulations, and
                                of a labium of four emargι∙ nations, bearing two quadri-articulate
                                palpi. The thorax consists of three perceptible portions. The
                                abdomen, which becomes gradually narrower towards its posterior
                                extremity, is provided, in addition to the false legs just
                                mentioned, with an anal appendage or sealystyle, compressed, and
                                composed of two pieces, after which we may observe the three
                                articulated setae prolonged beyond the body. The legs are rather
                                short—the haunch often very large, much compressed, and squamiform.
                                Several species occur in window-sashes which are seldom opened,
                                beneath the planks of presses where there is any damp or
                                moisture.</p>

                                head. The body is convex and arched above, and the abdomen is
                                terminated by small setae, adapted for leaping, and of which the
                                central one, placed above the others, is much the longest. The
                                maxillary palpi are very large, and pe- diform. The thorax is

                                arched. These insects leap well and frequently. They dwell in stony
                                and covered places. The species are few in number, and, as far as

                                preceding genus. The body is flattened, and the three terminal setae
                                are inserted on the same line, and are not adapted for leaping. The
                                haunches are very large. The greater number are found in the
                                interior of houses. They run swiftly, and when seized their silvery
                                scales come off upon the fingers. The softness of the masticating
                                organs in this genus would induce us to believe that they are
                                incapable of gnawing hard materials. The most common species, <hi
                                rend="italic">L. saccharina,</hi> is said by Linnaeus and Fabricius
                                to feed on sugar and decayed wood,—and, according to the former, it
                                likewise gnaws books and woollen garments. Geoffroy, however, is of
                                opinion that it preys on the little <hi rend="italic">Ρsocus

                                This Lepisma measures about four lines in length. It is of a silvery
                                white, with a tinge of lead colour, and without spots. It is said to
                                have come originally from America. Another species, which is
                                represented by the figure last referred to, is distinguished By its
                                ash-coloured body, spotted with black, and marked down the back by
                                four black lines. Its localities are similar to those of the

                                articulations. The mouth does not exhibit distinct and projecting
                                palpi. The terminal seta is forked, and when not in action is kept
                                bent beneath the abdomen. These insects are extremely small, the
                                body soft, elongated, with an oval head and tvyo eyes, each formed
                                of eight small granules. The legs exhibit only four distinct joints.
                                The tail is soft, flexible, and composed of an inferior piece,
                                moveable at the base, with two articulated appendages at the

                                during the prevalence of a strong frost. The aquatic species do not
                                long survive a removal from the water. They speedily shrivel up and
                                die. But the terrestrial species support uninjured the heat of the
                                mid-day sun even in dry and dusty regions. As far as we know, all
                                the aseertained species are European, though we doubt not the genera
                                exist in other quarters of the globe.</p>
                            <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Podura</hi> properly so called (Plate
                                CCXXXIX. figs. 12 and 12 «), the antennae are of nearly equal
                                thickness throughout, and without annuli or small articulations at
                                their extremity. The body is almost linear or eylindrical, with the
                                thorax distinctly articulated, and the abdomen narrow and
                                oblong.</p>
                            <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Smynthurus,</hi> Lat. <hi
                                rend="italic">(Podura,</hi> Linn.), the antennae become attenuated
                                towards the extremity, and are terminated by an annulated portion,
                                composed of small articulations. The thorax and abdomen seem united
                                into a single globular or ovate mass. This genus corresponds to the
                                second section of the <hi rend="italic">Podurae</hi> of Degeer. When
                                touched, these insects make great leaps into the air by means of a
                                setiform process at the end of the abdomen, resembling that of the
                                preeeding genus ;—but they are moreover furnished with a very
                                extraordinary organ, which we do not find in Podura proper. Beneath
                                their body, and just between the points of the two forks of the
                                tail, there exists an elevated cylindrical portion, from which issue
                                two long membranous threads, transparent, extremely flexible, and
                                glutinous or humid. They are rounded at the extremity, almost as
                                long as the insect’s body, and are thrown out with force and
                                celerity, one on either side, from the cylindrical portion just
                                mentioned, according to the insect’s pleasure.</p>
                            <p>In regard to the uses of these peculiar parts of structure, Degeer
                                observed that some Smynthuri which he had placed in an earthen
                                vessel ejected their slimy organs whenever they found themselves,
                                against their will, slipping down the sides of their prison. They
                                then hung, as it were, suspended by these filaments, until they had
                                time to take up a fresh position.<note anchored="true"

                                reasonably inferred that their natural use or function is to prevent
                                the insect’s falling, when, after the execution of a powerful leap,
                                it happens to alight upon a perpendicular or inclined surface.

                        <p>The insects of this, our concluding order, are apterous, like those of
                            the preceding; but their bodies are unprovided with articulated
                            appendages, or other organs of locomotion, except the legs. Their organs
                            of sight seem to consist solely of smooth or simple eyes <hi
                            rend="italic">(yeux lisses).</hi> Their mouth is in great part internal,
                            and exhibits externally either a muzzle or projecting protuberance,
                            enclosing a retractile sucker, or two membranaceous approximate lips,
                            with a pair of hooked mandibles. These insects form in the Linnaean
                            system the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Pediculus,</hi> containing an
                            extensive and varied group, known under the general and repulsive name

                            notwithstanding the associations by which we unavoidably connect their
                            existence with that of wretchedness and vice.</p>
                        <p>The unrestricted genus may be said to be generally characterized by a
                            flattened body, almost transparent, and divided into eleven or twelve
                            distinct segments, of which the anterior three bear the six legs. The
                            first of these segments often assumes the form of a thorax. The
                            stigmatic openings are very distinct. The antennae are short, of uniform
                            thickness, composed of five articulations, and frequently inserted in an
                            emargination. On each side of the head there are one or two small simple
                            cyes. The legs are rather short, and are terminated by a very strong
                            claw, or by a couple of hooks directed one towards the other. These
                            parasites, as many know by experience, attach themselves to man, beast,
                            and feathered fowls. They likewise fix their eggs to hair and feathers ;
                            and as their generations are neither few nor far between, their
                            superabundant increase under certain circumstances, not yet clearly
                            understood, is sometimes such as to produce disease and death. The
                            malady is called <hi rend="italic">phthiriasis,</hi> from <hi
                            rend="italic">φόιίξ,</hi> the Greek for louse.<note anchored="true"

                            <hi rend="italic">Anthata</hi> (or Diptera), guided no doubt by a
                            consideration of the parts of the mouth ; while Dr Nitzsch, who has
                            studied these insects with great attention, now ranks them with the
                            Hemiptera, and at the same time classes the cognate genus Ricinus in the
                            orthopterous order.</p>
                        <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Pediculus</hi> properly so called
                            (Plate CCXXXIX. fig. Il and 11 «), the mouth is very small,
                            mammillaeform, and tubular, placed at the anterior extremity of the
                            head, and, while not in action, enclosing a sucker. The tarsi consist of
                            an articulation almost equal in size to the tibia, and terminated by a
                            very strong claw, which, bending inwards upon a small projection, forms
                            as it were a kind of nipper. Such of the species as Latreille has
                            examined presented only a pair of simple eyes, one on each side.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Of</hi> the three species which infest the human race,
                            <hi rend="italic">P. humanus corporis</hi> is without spots. It infests
                            the inner garments of beggars, and others who attach no importance to
                            personal cleanliness, and is the cause of the disease above alluded to.
                            The second species, <hi rend="italic">P. humanus capitis,</hi> is more
                            of an ash colour, with brown or blackish spots around the stigmatic
                            openings, and the lobes of the abdomen are more salient. It occurs on
                            the heads of children, and of dirty adults. In both these species the
                            head and thorax are obviously distinct from the abdomen. In the third
                            species, which forms the genus <hi rend="italic">Phthirus</hi> of Dr
                            Leach, the body is broad and rounded, the thorax very short and almost
                            confounded with the abdomen, and the four posterior legs are very
                            strong.</p>
                        <p>Of all these insects the powers of multiplication are great. Swammerdam
                            viewed them as hermaphrodites, in as far as he could not satisfy himself
                            regarding their distinctive sexual characters. But Lecuwenhoeck and De-
                            geer, and recently Latreille and Doctors Nitzsch and Ali- bert, have
                            shown that they do not differ essentially in these respects from other
                            allied tribes. They are all oviparous, and their eggs are deposited on
                            hair (see Plate CCXXXIX. fig. 11 <hi rend="italic">l&gt;)</hi> or
                            garments. The young are hatched in five or six days, and after several
                            castings of their skin, or in about eighteen days, they become fit to
                            reproduce their kind. In this way it has been calculated that a brace of
                            females may prove the parents <hi rend="italic">of eighteen thousand
                            young</hi> in the space of two months. Oviedo remarked that the pediculi
                            left the Spanish sailors at a certain latitude during their voyage to
                            the Indies, and made their appearance again on the homeward progress
                            about the same latitude. This we think was somewhere near the tropics;
                            but the observation does not seem to have been confirmed by any special
                            observations in more modern times. It is said, however, that in India
                            they occur only on the head. These insects, however disgusting to people
                            of refinement, are greedily sought after and <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Ricinus</hi> of Lat. (Plate CCXXXIX.
                            fig. 10), which corresponds to <hi rend="italic">Nirmus</hi> of Hermann
                            and Leach, the mouth is placed beneath, and consists exteriorly of two
                            lips, and a pair of hooked max-illae.<note anchored="true"

                            found on dogs, are all bird-lice, that is, parasitical on the feathered
                            creation. Their head, which, in common with the antennae, occasionally
                            differs in the sexes, is usually very large,—in some of a triangular
                            form, in others semicircular or lunate,— and is frequently furnished
                            with angular projections. Latreille has perceived a pair of simple eyes
                            on each side of the head in several species. Besides the parts of the
                            mouth just mentioned, Savigny satisfied himself of the presence of
                            maxillae, each bearing a very small palpus, and concealed by the labium
                            or lower lip, which is also palpigerous. There is likewise a kind of
                            tongue. The Ricini are much less sluggish in their movements than the
                            Pediculi properly so called. They glide about among the feathers of
                            birds with considerable agility, and are captured with difficulty, by
                            reason of the flatness of their forms and adhesive propensities. When a
                            bird dies, however, they assemble together about the base of the beak,
                            and other parts of the head, and moving about with an air of inquietude,
                            they seem to watch for an opportunity of making their escape to some
                            living prey. M. Leclerc de Laval detected portions of the plumage in
                            their stomachs, and he is of opinion that these constitute their sole
                            subsistence ; but Degeer found the Ricinus of the chaffinch gorged with
                            blood ; and their extreme anxiety to change their quarters the moment
                            that circulation ceases, argues a fancy for something more than
                            feathers.</p>
                        <p>We have at last brought to a conclusion an article which the reader may
                            possibly regard as of inordinate length, but which the writer has
                            certainly found far too narrow for the proper elucidation of several

                            that it is the very perfection of the divine workmanship which leads
                            every inquirer to imagine a surpassing worth, and grace, and dignity, in
                            his own special department of it. The fact is altogether notorious, that

                            which of all others he conceives to be most enriched by all that is
                            fitted to entertain the intellect or arrest the admiration of the
                            enamoured scholar. The astron» mer who can unravel the mechanism of the
                            heavens, or the chemist who can trace the atomic processes of matter <pb

                            earth, or the metaphysician who can assign the laws of human thought, or
                            the grammarian who can discriminate the niceties of language, or the
                            naturalist who can classify the flowers, and the birds, and the shells,
                            and the minerals, and the insects which so teem and multiply in this
                            world of wonders,—each of these respective inquirers is apt to become
                            the worshipper of his own theme, and to look with a sort of
                            indifference, bordering on contempt, towards what he imagines the far
                            less interesting track of his fellow-labourers. Now each is right in the
                            admiration he renders to the grace and grandeur of that field</p>
                        <p>which himself has explored ; but all are wrong in the distaste they feel,
                            or rather in the disregard they castôn the other fields which they have
                            never entered. We should take the testimony of each to the worth of that
                            which he does know, and reject the testimony of each to the comparative
                            worthlessness of that which he does not know; and then the unavoidable
                            inference is, that that must be indeed a replete and a gorgeous universe
                            in which we dwell,—and still more glorious the Eternal Mind, from whose
                            conception it arose, and whose prolific fiat gave birth to it in all its
                            vastness and variety.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
