                    by means of variable magnitudes, which may be brought to approach or <hi
                    rend="italic">exhaust</hi> them more nearly than any assigned interval or
                    remainder.</p>
                <p>Thus, a regular poly <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> gon may be inscribed in a
                    circle, and by repeatedly doubling the multitude of sides, or increasing it by
                    other given laws, this variable figure may be made so to <hi rend="italic"
                    >exhaust</hi> the circle as to leave a remainder less than any given area. And
                    because similar polygons inscribed in different circles have always the
                    duplicate ratio of the diameters, it has been perceived that the circles
                    themselves must be as these exhaurient polygons, which Euclid proves strictly by
                    the method of exhaustions.</p>
                <p>A rectilineal figure may be inscribed in a segment of a parabola, so as to leave
                    less of the parabola than any area assigned, and also to be nearer four thirds
                    of the greatest inscribed triangle than any given difference. Hence Archimedes
                    proves, by the method of exhaustions, that the segment of the parabola exceeds
                    the triangle by one third of the same triangle.</p>
                <p>The first lemma of Newton’s <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> brings the method of
                    exhaustions to general application. It is in these words:</p>
                <p>“Quantitates, ut et quantitatum rationes, quae ad aequa-litatem tempore quovis
                    finito constanter tendunt, et ante finem temporis illius propius ad invicem
                    accedunt quam pro data quavis differentia, fiunt ultimo acquales.</p>
                <p>“Si negas; fiant ultimo inaequales, et sit earum ultima differentia D. Ergo
                    nequeunt propius ad acqualitatem accedere quam pro data differentia D: contra
                    hypothesin. ’</p>
                <p>Many authors have not rightly understood this lemma, as Horsley in his note upon
                    it; Hutton on Prime and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751290"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-1290-0464"/>Ultimate Ratios, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionary;</hi> and Woodhouse, <hi rend="italic">Principles of Analytical
                    Calculation,</hi> paragraph 105, where it is said to be “merely a definition,”
                    and, again, that “it gave a new signification to the term equality.”</p>
                <p>If our opinion be just, it gives no signification to the term equality which was
                    not given by Euclid and Archimedes. The novelty is in giving to the word <hi
                    rend="italic">ultimate,</hi> or the adverb <hi rend="italic">ultimately,</hi> an
                    extension beyond what it ordinarily includes; as, in the technical language of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Principia,</hi> things are often said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">ultimately</hi> what, by their definition, they are incapable of
                    becoming.</p>
                <p>In this language, as explained by its author, an ultimate quantity, or that which
                    a quantity ultimately becomes <hi rend="italic">(fit ultimo),</hi> is what is
                    otherwise called the <hi rend="italic">limit</hi> of the quantity; that to
                    which, repeating the words of this lemma, <hi rend="italic">tempore</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">quovis finito constanter tendit, et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ante</hi><hi rend="italic">finem temporis illius propius accedit quam pro data
                    quavis differentia.</hi> Thus, in the <hi rend="italic">Scholium,</hi> after the
                    eleventh lemma, our author says, <hi rend="italic">ad ultimas</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">quantitatum evanescentium summas,</hi><hi rend="italic">id</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">est, ad limites</hi><hi rend="italic">summarum.</hi></p>
                <p>Few as are the words of the demonstration of this celebrated lemma, it must be
                    concluded from them that it only concerns quantities of which it could be
                    questioned whether they have a <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> difference. Applied
                    to variables, it can therefore only compare them in some simultaneous
                    magnitudes. Among simultaneous magnitudes, Newton, for the sake of brevity,
                    includes limits; and, in fact, only these limits are here compared. Perhaps a
                    slight change in the language may show more clearly the intention.</p>
                <p>“Quantities, as also the ratios of quantities, which in any finite time soever
                    constantly tend to equality, and before the end of that time approach nearer
                    than any difference, have equal limits.”</p>
                <p>“If not, let their limits be unequal, and differ by D. Then the variables, in
                    their approach, cannot come nearer than D, <hi rend="italic">contra
                    hypothesis"</hi></p>
                <p>This may be too concise, but is fully made out in the following manner:</p>
                <p>Let X and Y be two quantities, continually approaching, and capable of being
                    brought nearer than any difference within a finite time. Let A be the limit of
                    X, and B the limit of Y; that is, let A and B be fixed quantities, to which X
                    and Y, during their approach, maybe brought nearer than any difference
                    assignable. Then shall A and B be equal.</p>
                <p>For, if not, let A — B + D. And at any time during the approach of X and Y, let
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi> be the difference of X from its limit, and <hi
                    rend="italic">η</hi> the contemporary difference of Y from its limit. And,</p>
                <p>I. Suppose the variables to approach by the decrease of the greater and the
                    increase of the less towards their respective limits (like a∙circumscribed and
                    inscribed polygon); or X = A + <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> Y = B — <hi
                    rend="italic">n.</hi> Then X — Y = A</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">B-1-m-1-n = D-1-m-j-n,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic smallcaps"> so</hi> that X and Y necessarily differ by more than D,
                    <hi rend="italic">contra hypothesin.</hi></p>
                <p>II. Suppose both variables to decrease towards their limits; or X = A + m and Y =
                    B + <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> Then X — Y</p>
                <p>— A — B + <hi rend="italic">m</hi> — <hi rend="italic">n</hi> = 1) + <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">η.</hi></p>
                <p>Now if <hi rend="italic">n</hi> were greater than <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> we
                    might decrease Y by a part of <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> which we will call <hi
                    rend="italic">y,</hi> greater than <hi rend="italic">m</hi> itself, and still
                    greater than its part (x), the contemporary decrement of X; and putting X' and Y
                    ’ for the variables thus decreased, we should have X ’ = X — <hi rend="italic"
                    >x,</hi> Y' = Y _ <hi rend="subscript"> y</hi>, <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> ∏d
                    thence X —- Y' = X — Y ÷ <hi rend="italic">(y —</hi><hi rend="italic">%);</hi>
                    so that the difference of the variables would be augmented by bringing them
                    nearer to their limits. Therefore <hi rend="italic">n</hi> cannot be greater
                    than <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> consequently D + <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">η</hi> cannot be
                    less than D, or the difference of X and Y cannot become less than D, <hi
                    rend="italic">contra hypothesin.</hi></p>
                <p>HI. It only remains to examine the case where both increase towards their limits,
                    or X = A — <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> Y ≡ β ¶</p>
                <p>and X — Y = A — B + <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> D + <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">m.</hi></p>
                <p>Here if <hi rend="italic">m</hi> exceeded <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> we might
                    increase X by a quantity a? greater than <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> and still
                    more exceeding <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> the contemporary increment of Y, and
                    putting X' and Y' t <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> signify the variables thus
                    increased, X' — Y' = X + <hi rend="subscript"> χ</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Çd + y), or</hi><hi rend="italic">X'</hi><hi rend="italic">-Y</hi>
                    ’ <hi rend="italic">= X</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Y + <hi rend="italic"
                    >(x</hi><hi rend="italic">—y),</hi> so that the variables would again diverge.
                    Therefore again D + ∏</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">m</hi> cannot be less than D, or X and
                    Y cannot differ by less than D, <hi rend="italic">contra hypothesin.</hi></p>
                <p>If X, Y, A, B, D, <hi rend="italic">m, n, x, y,</hi> represent <hi rend="italic"
                    >measures of ratios,</hi> the proof includes the <hi rend="italic">quantitatum
                    rationes.</hi></p>
                <p>There results no absurdity from supposing the limits of two quantities which
                    continually approach to have a difference D; but then the approaching quantities
                    must always differ still more, contrary to one of the conditions.</p>
                <p>By making <hi rend="italic">n</hi> nothing in Case II. we make Y constant, and
                    coincident in magnitude with B. The proposition obtained by the reasoning is,
                    for this case, that whatever quantity A (suppose it a parabolic segment) may be
                    an acknowledged limit of a variable X, if X can at the same time be proved to
                    approach indefinitely to Y or B (suppose it a triangle equal to four thirds of
                    the greatest triangle in the parabolic segment), A is equal to B. This is to
                    prove that limits of the same variable are equal, which is neither giving a new
                    signification to equality, nor concluding an identical proposition, nor indeed
                    one which an ancient geometer would have admitted without formal proof. We come
                    to a similar conclusion by making <hi rend="italic">m</hi> nothing in Case
                    III.</p>
                <p>It is true that, in the <hi rend="italic">Principia,</hi> when a fixed quantity
                    is proved to be a limit to a variable, and the variable then pronounced
                    ultimately equal to the fixed quantity, the author or editors refer to the first
                    lemma, when reference might as well be made to the definition of ultimate
                    quantities there implied; only (what is the main thing) the demonstration of the
                    lemma teaches how, by admitting the limit as a particular value of the variable,
                    we cannot produce an error measured by any fixed quantity, while if an error
                    were admitted at all, it <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be of fixed amount. Thus in
                    Lemma IV. where the same multitude of rectangles is supposed to be inscribed in
                    the two figures AαcE, PjorT, and when this multitude is indefinitely increased,
                    and consequently the breadth of the rectangles and the remainder of the areas
                    indefinitely diminished, each rectangle in the one figure has, by hypothesis,
                    the same ratio to a corresponding rectangle in the other; it is concluded that
                    this is also the ratio of the whole figures. For the ratio of the area AαcE to
                    PprT may be viewed as compounded of AαcE to the rectangles within itself, of
                    these to the contemporary rectangles within PprT, and of these latter rectangles
                    to P∕+T. But the first and last of the component ratios being <hi rend="italic"
                    >ultimately</hi> of equality, the compound ratio is the constant ratio of the
                    contemporary rectangles. For let L be the measure of the ratio of the inscribed
                    rectangles, and let it be asserted that the compound ratio differs from L by a
                    ratio whose measure is D. The first and last of the component ratios being
                    ultimately of equality, their contemporary values may be made such that the
                    measures <hi rend="italic">(m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n)</hi> of the ratios
                    by which the former exceeds equality and the latter falls below it, may be each
                    less than D, and, <hi rend="italic">a fortiori,</hi> th <hi rend="superscript">
                    eir 1</hi> ' ference less than D. But L + <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">n</hi> is the true r∏θ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> a</hi> sure of the compound ratio; therefore L does not di
                    <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> from the true measure by D.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751303" xml:id="kp-eb0709-1303-0465"/>
                <p>Thus, by admitting ultimate values, no error is admitted. The method of
                    exhaustions, which Newton’s first lemma reduces to an enunciable proposition,
                    only requires it to be allowed that fixed quantities either have a fixed
                    difference or are equal. What is often called the principle of limits is to
                    comprehend limits at once in the conclusion of a demonstration which does not
                    apply to them. Newton’s lemma serves to admit them through the method of
                    exhaustions. According to the foregoing exposition, it is neither an identical
                    proposition nor an arbitrary extension of the meaning of a term, though these
                    inconsistent charges have both been brought against it. A and B are proved to be
                    equal in the old signification of equality; and whilst it is said that X and Y
                    are <hi rend="italic">ultimately</hi> equal, X and Y are also ultimately A and
                    B. (o. o. o.)</p>
