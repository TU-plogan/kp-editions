                <p>The origin of this interesting race, from whom have descended some monuments of
                    the earliest humanity, appears to have puzzled the ancients as much as it has
                    perplexed the moderns; and, notwithstanding all that has been written on the
                    subject, particularly by the Italian antiquaries, it is still beset with
                    difficulties and involved in obscurity. The question chiefly agitated amongst
                    the ancients was whether the Etruscans were Pelasgi from Greece, Lydians from
                    Asia Minor, or an indigenous and aboriginal race in Italy; and the moderns have
                    added more than an equal number to the hypotheses of the ancients. Herodotus
                    represents them as a colony of Lydians, who, having been compelled by famine to
                    emigrate from Asia, arrived, after various wanderings, in Umbria, where they
                    settled and called themselves Tyrrhenians, from Tyrrhenus, son of their king
                    Atys, the conductor of the emigration. This tradition, whencesoever derived, has
                    been almost implicitly followed by the ancient writers; indeed Cicero, Strabo,
                    Velleius Paterculus, Seneca, Pliny, and Plutarch, all agree in repeating the
                    assertion that the Etruscans originally came from Lydia.</p>
                <p>But the moderns have not in general evinced the same deference for the authority
                    of Herodotus in this particular, and have advanced a variety of hypotheses, some
                    of them, perhaps, not much more tenable nor better founded than the story told
                    by the father of history. Dempster, who may be said to have laid the foundation
                    of an accurate knowledge of Etruscan history and antiquities, is of opinion that
                    there existed an original nucleus of inhabitants in Etruria, which was
                    successively augmented by the Lydian immigration, and by Pelasgic colonies from
                    Thessaly and Arcadia. Bochart coincides pretty nearly with Dempster, but
                    maintains that there must have existed a direct intercourse between the
                    Etruscans and Phoenicians, as many of the fables, superstitions, customs, and
                    monuments of the former were, according to him, of oriental origin. Winckelman
                    and the Count de Caylus, admitting an ancient communication with the East by
                    means of the Mediterranean, substitute Egypt for Phoenicia; and to the supposed
                    intercourse between Etruria and the land of the Pharaohs the former ascribes the
                    remarkable progress made by the Etruscans in the sciences and liberal arts;
                    whilst the latter is of opinion that this people borrowed every thing from
                    Egypt, and that the origin of science and art in Etruria is coeval with the
                    commencement of their commercial connection with that country. Improving upon
                    these views, some writers have advanced a step further, and maintained that the
                    Etruscans not merely carried on an intercourse with Egypt, but were actually of
                    Egyptian descent, in fact a colony or branch of the great nation established in
                    the Delta and valley of the Nile. This opinion has been adopted by Buonarotti,
                    Gorius, Mazzochi, Maffei, Guarnacci, and Lord Monboddo; but it has been
                    strenuously opposed by a number of the most learned Italian, French, and German
                    archaeologists, particularly by Bardetti, Pelloutier, Fréret, Funccius, Adelung,
                    and Heyne, who, though differing from one another in some points, have generally
                    contended for the northern and Celtic origin of the Etruscans. Lanzi, without
                    pretending to investigate the origin of this remarkable people (who, he
                    nevertheless seems to think, were Lydians, augmented at different times by the
                    accession of Pelasgic tribes), endeavours to prove that, whatever may have been
                    their descent, the language, religion, learning, and arts of the Etruscans, were
                    of Greek origin; that the period of their greatest perfection in the arts of
                    design was posterior to the subjugation of Etruria by the Romans, when the
                    intercourse with Greece had rendered them familiar with the beautiful models of
                    that country; and that, even admitting all languages to have been originally
                    derived from the East, and many Greek words to have sprung from Hebrew or
                    Phoenician roots, still there exist in the Etruscan such evident traces of
                    Hellenic descent, particularly in the names of gods and heroes, as to render it
                    almost impossible to derive their origin from any other source. Further, in
                    support of this theory, the learned Italian attempts to show from the
                    inscriptions on the Eugubine tables, that the Etruscan was Aeolic Greek, without
                    either the monosyllabic characteristics of the northern dialects, or the
                    prefixes and affixes peculiar to most of the oriental languages. Humboldt,
                    again, supposes this people to have been a connecting link between the Iberians
                    and Latins, or a sort of transplanted offset from the great Celtic stem. But the
                    learned and ingenious Müller adopts an intermediate opinion. Admitting a
                    primitive population of Etruria, as to whose origin he does not venture to
                    decide, he conceives that there are nevertheless grounds for assuming that they
                    became intermingled with Pelasgic colonists from the coast of Lydia, where the
                    latter had for a time settled, and acquired the name which they afterwards
                    rendered notorious by their piracies in the Aegean Sea. It would be hopeless to
                    endeavour to reconcile these conflicting hypotheses, and endless to examine
                    their respective merits in detail.</p>
                <p>Of all those, however, who have laboured to resolve this <hi rend="italic"
                    >quoestio</hi><hi rend="italic">vexata</hi> in the archaeology of history,
                    Niebuhr has, we think, been, upon the whole, the most successful. The origin of
                    the erroneous opinions as to the extraction of the Etruscans, he traces to two
                    assumptions, which he shows to be equally fallacious: first, that the Pelasgians
                    could only be derived from Greece, a supposition which probably gave rise to the
                    story of the migration from Thessaly; and, secondly, that because the Maeonians
                    were Tyrrhenians, these Tyrrhenians, like those of Lemnos, were of the same
                    stock with the ancient inhabitants of Agylla and Tarquinii, whence arose the
                    story of the Lydian emigration of the ancient Tyrrhenians, as told by Herodotus.
                    But, on the authority of Xanthus, Dionysius proves that the account of Herodotus
                    was not founded upon a Lydian tradition; and, from the complete difference of
                    the two nations in language, usages, and religion, he justly contends that it
                    would deserve no credit, even if there had been a tradition to the effect
                    stated. He asserts that the Etruscans spoke a language which bore no affinity to
                    any other known form of speech; and this assertion would deserve full credit,
                    even if we had only the evidence of Dionysius, inasmuch as Etruscan was then,
                    and for a considerable time afterwards, a living language, in which, as we
                    gather from Lucretius,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Non Tyrrhena retro volventem carmina frustra Indicia occultae Divûm
                    percurrere mentis.</p></note> books were written and read. It is further
                    confirmed by the inscriptions still extant, in which every resource of etymology
                    has failed to detect any analogy between the Etruscan and the Greek language or
                    the kindred branch of the Latin; and these singular monuments, which have thus
                    resisted the utmost eι∙ forts of modern scholarship and ingenuity, will to all
                    appearance remain for ever a dead treasure, unless a key shall accidentally be
                    furnished for their interpretation, by the discovery of a bilingual inscription.
                    In opposition to the unanimous evidence of the ancients, who distinguish the
                    Etruscan from the Sabine and Oscan, it has indeed been maintained that all the
                    nations of Italy, remains or whose language occur in inscriptions, spoke only
                    dialects of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193750263" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0263-0385"
                    />same radical form of speech; but this opinion, which has chiefly prevailed
                    amongst the Italian scholars, is at variance with the results of unbiassed
                    investigation; and it appears to have been completely established that the
                    Etruscan language, being wholly original and peculiar, bore as little affinity
                    to the Sabine and Oscan as to the Latin aŋd Greek, with which fanciful
                    etymologists have vainly sought to connect it.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The names of Tuscan and Etruscans were as
                    foreign to this people as that of Tyrrhenians. They called themselves <hi

                    to them were evidently arbitrary, accidental, or hypothetical. The ancient Homan
                    terms were <hi rend="italic">Etruria</hi> for the country, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tusci</hi> for the people; that of <hi rend="italic">Etruscus</hi> did not come
                    into use till after Cato’s time, though subsequently it became the more usual in

                    mouth of the people; for under the later emperors the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tuscia,</hi> which had never before been used in writing, was applied to the
                    country, and in the middle ages passed into <hi rend="italic">Toscana,</hi>

                    Rome,</hi> p. 90, Cambridge, 1828.) Professor Müller thus sums up his researches
                    into the origin of the Etruscans: “It remains that we regard the Tuscan nation
                    as an original and peculiar people of Italy; their language is widely different
                    from the Greek; the names of their gods are not those which we find among the
                    earliest Greeks, whom we call Pelasgi, and which passed from them to the
                    Hellenes; there is much too in the doctrine of their priests entirely foreign to
                    the Greek theology. But it appears to have been the fate of this nation, which
                    never displayed any independent civilization, but only adopted that of the
                    Greeks, to have been indebted for its first impulse towards improvement to a
                    Greek, or at best half Greek tribe. The Tuscans themselves, in their native
                    legends, referred their polity and civilization to the maritime town of
                    Tarquinii and the hero Tarchon, both probably only variations of the Tyrrheni.
                    Here it was that the much-dreaded Pelasgians of Lydia landed and settled,
                    bringing with them the arts which they had acquired at home, or on their way.
                    For the first time, the barbarous land saw men covered with brass array
                    themselves for battle to the sound of the trumpet; here first they heard the
                    loud sound of the Lydo-Phrygian flute accompanying the sacrifice, and perhaps
                    witnessed for the first time the rapid c &gt;urse of the fifty-oared ship. As
                    the legend, in its propagation from mouth to mouth, swells beyond all bounds,
                    the whole glory of the Tuscan name, even that which did not properly belong to
                    the colonists, attached itself to the name of Tarchon, the disciple of ⅛es, as
                    the author of a new and better era in the history of Etruria. The neighbouring
                    Umbrians and Latins named the nation, which from this time began to increase and
                    diffuse itself, not from the primitive inhabitants, but from these new settlers.
                    For since, in the Ēugubine tables, <hi rend="italic">Tursce</hi> occurs along
                    with <hi rend="italic">Tu</hi><hi rend="italic">scorn</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    formed Tursicus, Turscus, Tuscus; as from the root OP, Opscus and Oscus; so that

                    Italian forms of one and the same name.” <hi rend="italic">[Die</hi><hi

                <p>The Etruscans, during the most prosperous period of their history, inhabited
                    Etruria proper, and the country about the Po, besides distant colonies. The
                    Raetians and other Alpine tribes were also of Etruscan origin; and so were the
                    Lepontians and Camunians, perhaps also the Etr°∙aneans, who inhabited Venetia
                    before the founding of Patavium. It has been suggested by Niebuhr that the
                    language spoken by the people of Groeden in the Tyrol, a language which seems to
                    stand alone in its peculiar roots, may have some claims to be considered as a
                    relic of the ancient E⅜ruscan.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Hormayr, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >von Tyrol,</hi> p. 139. This suggestion is eminently deserving of attention and
                    verification. Foras the Etruscan alphabet is known, the determination of a few
                    roots would serve as a fulcrum, by means of which the great lever of tentative
                    interpretation might be applied.</p></note> The Brenner formed the northern
                    boundary of the Raetians, and consequently of the Etruscan race, who in the time
                    of their greatness had probably occupied the mountains as a bulwark against
                    irruptions from the north. Some, however, are of opinion that Raetia was the
                    original home whence the Etruscan people issued, and spread first in Upper
                    Italy, and afterwards across the Apennines; and the harshness of the Etruscan
                    language, which seems still to survive in the Florentine pronunciation, has been
                    adduced as an argument for the Alpine origin of the people.</p>
                <p>In the ancient history of the Umbrians it was related that the Etruscans had
                    conquered three hundred towns of their nation. The Umbrians, therefore, must
                    have once occupied the greater part of the countries, including Tuscany, which
                    the Etruscans possessed in the zenith of their power. According to the tradition
                    of the Lydian migration, Pisa, and the whole country to the rocky summits of the
                    Alps, were wrested from the Umbrians by the Tyrrhenians; and Pliny considers the
                    Umbrians as the ancient inhabitants of Etruria who were expelled by the
                    Pelasgians. Without entering into the question whether Cortona was Etruscan or
                    not, still Caere, Graviseae, Alsium, and Saturnia, were certainly occupied by
                    the Etruscans as conquerors, after expelling the people called in Italy
                    Sicu-hans, and in Greece Pelasgians and Tyrrhenians. The Pelasgians were also in
                    possession of Tarquinii before the Etruscans; Populonia was called a colony of
                    the Volater-rans, who had driven the Corsicans from the coast; and Pisa is
                    mentioned by Dionysius amongst the places which the Etruscans had wrested from
                    the Pelasgians. But all statements, however probable or well attested, were at
                    length forced to give way to the story of a Lydian extraction, which of
                    necessity placed the first settlement of the immigrants on the lower sea, and
                    thus involved the whole question in perplexity. What the native annals of the
                    Etruscans related as to their origin we know only negatively; in them the Lydian
                    legend which has created so much embarrassment had no place.<note

                    would appear, for the infamous honour of erecting an utar to Tiberius; and this
                    ridiculous and humiliating question was argued in presence of the tyrant, before
                    that degraded senate t'h ° <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi> ⅛ had publicly taunted
                    with their abject servility. On this occasion the Sardians, one of the
                    contending parties, insisted on <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> eir affinity to
                    the Etruscans; in proof of which they produced a decree of that people,

                    attesting the original confraternity of the Sardians with the ancient
                    inhabitants of Etruria. This is the statement of Taci- ' <hi rend="superscript">

                    θ of credit may be due to a document founded upon a vague tradition, flattering
                    to popular vanity, produced in such cause before such judges, and as to the
                    authenticity of which the historian is silent, our readers will not, perhaps,
                    find it difficult to ermine. The only thing surprising is, that in such a
                    competition of servility and adulation, a grave historian should have sought
                    materials to support an hypothesis, improbable in itself, and at variance with
                    the best authorities on the subject.</p></note> According to this view, then,
                    there appear to have been two consecutive conquests: that of the Umbrians by the
                    Pelasgians; and that of the Pelasgians by the Etruscans, who, as it were,
                    absorbed all the others, and ultimately became the dominant people. The
                    principal stock of the nation, however, seems to have been formed out of that
                    great Pelasgian race which at one time extended from the rivers Po and Arno in
                    Italy to the Phyndacus in Asia, but which, even when intermingled by conquest
                    with other tribes, never succeeded in spreading itself over the whole of
                    Northern Italy. The Etruscans, indeed, at no period of their history possessed
                    the whole of Cisalpine Gaul. On the westward their territory extended only to
                    the Ticinus, where dwelt the Ligurians, who were afterwards driven back by the
                    Gauls; and the land to the south of the Po was also <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193750276" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0276-0386"/>either occupied by the
                    latter, or rendered uninhabitable by swamps. When the Gauls made their irruption
                    the Umbrians were still masters of the country now called Romagna; but between
                    the Veneti and the Gauls, Etruscan settlements maintained themselves until the
                    time of the Romans.</p>
                <p>This people appear to have had twelve cities to the north of the Apennines, and
                    an equal number to the south of that range. Amongst the former, of which we can
                    give but a very indistinct account, may be classed Verona, which is denominated
                    a Raetian city by Pliny, and Mantua, which is called Tuscan both by him and by
                    Virgil. Hatria, Melpum, and Felsina were also included in the twelve cities
                    north of the Apennines. Hatria, once a place of great commerce, gave its name to
                    the upper sea; Melpum, to the north of the Po, was destroyed by the Boii,
                    Senones, and Insubres, on the same day that Camillus took Veii (in the year of
                    Rome 358); and Bononia, under the name of Fcl-sina, was once the capital of
                    Etruria. The twelve cities south of the Apennines, which were leagued together
                    as the chief places of their respective districts, are nowhere enumerated by
                    name; but Livy incidentally mentions eight of them, namely, Caere, Tarquinii,
                    Populonia, Volaterra, Arretium, Perusia, Clusium, and Rusellae, as having
                    contributed to forward Scipio’s preparations. Cortona was also accounted one of
                    the chief places in Etruria, and both Veii and Vulsinii were probably included
                    in the original number. But whether Capena, or Cossa, or Faesulae, completed the
                    twelve, it is now impossible to decide. The changes produced by time and by
                    conquest have involved this part of the subject in impenetrable obscurity.</p>
                <p>The territory belonging to each of these capitals had several provincial towns,
                    some of them dependent colonies, and others inhabited by subjects, the
                    descendants of the old population who had been subdued. But as the Etruscan
                    state was founded on conquest, the government naturally assumed the character of
                    an aristocratical oligarchy. It was not by popular assemblies, nor even by the
                    deliberations of a numerous senate, but by meetings of the chiefs or magnates of
                    the land <hi rend="italic">(^principes</hi><hi rend="italic">Etruriae),</hi>
                    that the general affairs of the nation were decided on. The assemblies held at
                    the temple of Voltumna were of this exclusive kind, and hence in no degree
                    corresponded with the institutions of really free nations, such as the Latins
                    and the Samnites. These Etrurian chiefs were the persons from whom the Roman
                    youth received instruction in the sacred sciences of divination; they were at
                    once a warlike and sacerdotal caste, the Lucumones whose ancestors had committed
                    to writing the revelations of Tages. But they were patricians, not kings, as has
                    been commonly supposed. Lucumo of Clusium, Lucumo who succoured Romulus, and
                    Lucumo who removed from Tarquinii to Rome, were only powerful men in their
                    respective cities; the Cilnii and Caecinae were Lucumoncs in Etruria, just as
                    the Claudii and Valerii were patricians in Rome, and were not less noblc in
                    birth than the latter, though, as Romans, reckoned only amongst the commons. But
                    these ruling houses were exposed to the violent revolutions which everywhere
                    threaten an oligarchy, even in the midst of its own body, when it is not upheld
                    by some powerful protection from without. The chiefs expelled each other by
                    force of arms, or were driven into exile by the combinations of intrigue; and it
                    was in the spirit of these feuds for the refugees to be restored by the
                    dangerous mediation of the common enemy, the Romans. Even so late as the second
                    Punic war, the government of the Etruscan cities remained exclusively vested in
                    the senators, or nobility; the latter were, what Louis XIV. called himself, the
                    state; and, when a ferment began in Etruria, it was entirely suppressed by
                    securing the submission of⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> senate at Arretium. The
                    people, who had no political existence as such, were out of the question. A free
                    and respectable commonalty was never formed amongst the Etruscans; on the
                    contrary, the species of feudal system anciently established by conquest, was
                    obstinately maintained and extended; the mass of the population were mere serfs;
                    and hence arose the remarkable weakness of the great Etruscan cities in their
                    contests with Rome, when the victory was to be determined by a numerous, brave
                    and steady infantry. National impotence ever follows the degradation of the
                    people. What the Etruscans might have been if, some centuries earlier, they had
                    had a country, is evinced by the effect of the Roman franchise conferred upon
                    them at the conclusion of Sylla’s war. In this contest the part taken by the
                    chiefs was taken by all; and every free man, however excluded or restricted by
                    the old but now expiring constitutions of his own country, obtained the
                    privileges of Roman citizenship; nor was the boon either undeserved or
                    misapplied.</p>
                <p>The regal office, which was not hereditary in a single family, as in Greece, but
                    elective for life, as at Rome, continued at Veii until its fall. At Arretium,
                    however, the king may perhaps have been chosen from amongst the Cilnii, a family
                    of high distinction. The twelve federal cities nominated a common high priest,
                    who presided at the national festivals. In common enterprises the supreme
                    command was generally committed to one of the twelve Lucumones, who received a
                    lictor from each city. Even For-senna, highly as he is celebrated in the old
                    legends, is in Roman history only king or chief of Clusium; yet he had influence
                    sufficient to set the whole power of the nation in action. In like manner all
                    the twelve cities paid homage to Lucumo Tarquin; and in the earlier times a
                    closer union seems occasionally to have been effected by the power of a supreme
                    chief, as Mezentius or Coeles Vibenna. But such union appears to have been the
                    exception rather than the rule, and to have depended on accident rather than on
                    organization; nor have we been able to discover satisfactory evidence of the
                    existence of a distinct federal constitution, such as some writers have rather
                    gratuitously imagined. Yet loose as was the federal bond in Etruria, it seems to
                    have had the effect of preventing wars between the cities, of which no trace is
                    to be found in history. Such, then, being the nature of their association, it is
                    probable that the islands subject to the Etruscans were not under the dominion
                    of the whole nation, but under that of the adjacent maritime cities; and,
                    accordingly, it seems as if the Caerites stood alone when, leagued with the
                    Carthaginians, they attacked the Phocaeans of Alalia, which happened in the year
                    of Rome 220. The principal insular dependency of the Etruscan states was
                    Corsica, which paid them a tribute; but it is not improbable that they had also
                    settlements in the island of Sardinia.</p>
                <p>The maritime cities of Etruria having early engaged in navigation, were
                    stigmatised and hated on account of the piracies they committed in the western
                    seas, which, anterior to the founding of the Grecian colonies in Sicily, were
                    thus rendered impassable to peaceful navigators. *ae· buhr is, however, inclined
                    to think that this reproach ma; have applied chiefly to the Pelasgian
                    Tyrrhenians, whom the Etruscans afterwards subdued; and indeed all the corsairs
                    of the lower sea seem to have been considered by Greeks as Tyrrhenians. But
                    without entering into any tails respecting their nautical adventures, whether P
                    <hi rend="superscript"> ιra 1</hi> cal or other, it may be observed, that

                    time of Aristotle, treaties, by which the rights of trade were respectively
                    determined and secured, subsisted between these cities and Carthage. Amongst the
                    subjects of this commerce maybe mentioned the produce of the iron mines of
                    Elba,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Insula inexhaustis
                    chalybum generosa metallis. (Aen. x. 174.)</p></note> and of others upon the
                    mainland of Etruria, which yielded a more abundant supply of a purer kind of
                    metal than any in the ancient world. The same island also furnished copper for
                    their coinage, and for those works in brass or bronze in which they so <hi
                    rend="subscript"> or</hi> eatly excelled. Müller supposes them to have also
                    traded m amber, which substance, he thinks, they received by an inland route,
                    extending from the shores of the Adriatic to those of the Baltic; but as his
                    chief reason for this supposition appears to be, that, in Pliny’s time, amber
                    was conveyed by the same route into Italy, and as no safe conclusion can be
                    drawn respecting the extent of early communications, from those which are found
                    established at a later period, when circumstances had wholly changed, the
                    conjecture in question must, we suspect, be dismissed as untenable. On the
                    subject of Etruscan commerce, however, the information which has reached us is
                    too scanty and imperfect to enable us to deduce any distinct conclusions, either
                    as to the extent to which it was carried on, or the particular channels in which
                    it flowed.</p>
                <p>The works constructed by the Etruscans still astonish us even in their ruins, and
                    could scarcely have been executed in small states without taskmasters and
                    bondsmen. The everlasting monuments of Egypt are the products of the direst
                    tyranny acting remorselessly upon the most abject slavery. But the scarcely less
                    durable works of the Etruscans differ from those in the valley of the Nile, in
                    having all of them been directed towards some great ob-ect of public utility.
                    Labour was not uselessly or wan-only expended in the erection of pyramids,
                    obelisks, and emples, to gratify the inordinate vanity of despots, or to ιxtend
                    the empire of superstition; if the people suffered in he hard service imposed on
                    them, it was not for vain or idle imposes; they were employed by their rulers on
                    what- !ver seemed best calculated to promote the defence or aug-nent the wealth
                    of the nation at large. The walls of their ities, constructed of huge blocks of
                    polygonal stones, still ubsist in imperishable solidity, where pains have not
                    been aken to demolish them; the theatre at Fiesole, and a olossal building near
                    it, are on a scale of equal gran-cur; and other monuments might be mentioned
                    which ιave been constructed in the same Cyclopean style. The ich valley of the
                    Arno, anciently a lake and a swamp, vas drained by means of a cut through Mount
                    Gonfalina, vhich blocked up the valley, but which, by means of this peration,
                    was made to afford a passage for the stream owards Pisa; the arms, too, by which
                    the Po discharges tself, were also excavated or directed by the Etruscans; nd
                    its Delta was likewise the fruit of their labours. Anther useful art practised
                    by this people consisted in letI mg off, by means of tunnels, lakes which had
                    been formed i the craters of extinct volcanoes. In the territory of θrugia there
                    are traces of many such lakes, which have ≡en completely dried up, by means of
                    the tunnels, which, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ough now unknown and never
                    cleared out, still drain off le water as before.</p>
                <p>The renown which belongs to a nation that excelled in , <hi rend="superscript">
                    le</hi> arts has become as it were the inheritance of the 'buscans. But from the
                    peculiar constitution of govern- -‘t and society in ancient Etruria, it has been
                    conjec- <hi rend="superscript"> lr</hi> ed, not without appearance of reason,
                    that the works in <hi rend="superscript"> 0nze</hi> and clay, and the
                    bas-reliefs, attributed to them, were the produce, not of the dominant race, but
                    of their subject bondsmen or serfs; and that in reality the Etruscans, properly
                    so called, were as little given to the arts as the Romans by whom in their turn
                    they were subdued. The striking difference observable between Tarquinii and
                    Arretium in their works of art, seems to correspond with the different origin of
                    the earlier inhabitants of northern and southern Etruria. Volaterra was
                    naturally led, by the stone quarries in its neighbourhood, to engage in the
                    works for which it became celebrated. The two former cities, however, wrought
                    only or chiefly in clay. Arretium made red vases, with elegant figures in
                    relief, in a style altogether peculiar. Those of Tarquinii were painted, and
                    both in colour and design resemble some discovered near Corinth, of which
                    Dodwell has given engravings. Painted vases are found only in the district∙of
                    Tarquinii, and where they occur those of Arretium are never met with; besides,
                    they differ from the Campanian in all those peculiarities for which the Greek
                    works of the same kind are distinguished. The resemblance which is thus found to
                    exist between the vases of Tarquinii and of Corinth irresistibly reminds us of
                    the story of Demaratus, who is said to have been accompanied by the potters
                    Euchir and Eugrammus; a circumstance evidently designed to express that
                    Tarquinii derived from Greece her skill in handling clay, and the elegant
                    drawing with which her vases were adorned.. The earliest Etruscan statues were
                    of clay; but the statues belonging to the first ages of Rome were almost
                    uniformly of bronze, and the master-pieces which shed lustre on Etruscan art are
                    all of the same material. That this art received its refinement from the Greeks
                    cannot, we think, be reasonably questioned. Works of primitive antiquity attest
                    its original rudeness; and to the Greeks alone, improving on Egyptian models by
                    a close study of the finer forms and proportions of nature, belonged that skill
                    which throws life and beauty into the delineation of the human figure. Hence the
                    subjects of many of the most beautiful Etruscan works of art are obviously taken
                    from the Greek mythology, which, in Etruria, was found as well adapted to the
                    purposes of the artist as in the land to which it was native. But the Etruscans,
                    when their taste had once been formed, treated their own conceptions in the
                    spirit of their masters; and, though no doubt inferior in grace and delicacy of
                    execution, they acquired a correctness in drawing which may almost be stated as
                    a national characteristic. In the she-wolf of the Capitol we have an example of
                    the perfection to which Etruscan art had attained about the middle of the fifth
                    century of Rome; nor are the finest gems probably of a much more recent
                    date.</p>
                <p>As a national heroic story was wanting to Etruscan art, it sought for subjects in
                    the Greek mythology; and the legends of Thebes and of Ilium must have been
                    familiar to the people. The Greek poems were read in Etruria, and Greek legends,
                    transfused into Etruscan, lived in the speech of the nation, or in compositions
                    in the native tongue. Indeed the works of art are not unfrequently inscribed
                    with the names of the Greek heroes, adapted to the forms of the Etruscan
                    language, of which it is matter of regret that so little is yet known. Varro
                    mentions Tuscan tragedies by one Volnius, who, it appears, lived not long
                    before, and probably intended these as an experimental attempt to introduce a
                    national drama. But be this as it may, the Grecian construction of the theatre
                    at Faesulae is evidence that Greek dramas, either originals or translations,
                    were performed there, as well as at Tusculum and Bovillae in Latium; nor can it
                    be doubted that this <pb break="no" facs="nls:193750302"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-0302-0388"/>theatre is much earlier than the time of Sylla,
                    since in size and magnificence it far surpasses the scale of a Roman military
                    colony, which, besides, cannot be supposed to have had any taste for the
                    exhibitions peculiar to such a place. The amphitheatre was the only place to
                    which such colonists would have repaired for amusement. It is proper to add,
                    however, that in Etruscan inscriptions <hi rend="italic">we</hi> do not find any
                    thing bearing the slightest resemblance to Greek rhythms, which could scarcely
                    have been concealed even in an unintelligible language; and that the place
                    whence the Fescennine musical dialogue received its name was a Faliscan, not an
                    Etruscan town.</p>
                <p>The music of the Romans was derived from Etruria, whence also they obtained their
                    scenic or histrionic singers. This is the only branch of art in which the
                    ancients attributed to the Etruscans the honour of invention; but here the
                    invention related merely to the instrument; for we do not read of any mood or
                    measure ascribed to the Etruscans. This instrument was the flute, which the
                    Romans regarded as native to Etruria, though modern antiquaries pretend that it
                    is to be considered as of Lydian origin, and even as a proof of the Lydian
                    immigration mentioned by Herodotus. The celebrity which the Etruscans obtained
                    in music, as well as in other accomplishments, was, no doubt, in part owing to
                    their having been the neighbours of a rude and uncultivated people like the
                    Romans, who naturally admired whatever was new or strange, and who, until they
                    became acquainted with the Greeks, derived all that was ornamental in their
                    system of public and private life from Etruria.</p>
                <p>The literature of the Etruscans presents the singular phenomenon of an alphabet
                    almost perfectly deciphered, with a language completely unintelligible. A
                    combination so strange has led more than one writer to maintain that the
                    language is Pelasgic or Aeolic Greek, and to appeal in proof of this to the
                    alphabet; but, unfortunately, there is a total want of connection between the
                    premises and the conclusion; and the result of all the investigations yet
                    instituted has been to disprove this notion. The Etruscan characters were formed
                    like the Greek, from that one amongst the various Asiatic alphabets whence all
                    the modes of writing in use throughout Europe appear to have been derived. That
                    Etruria received them directly from the Phoenician would not certainly be proved
                    by the direction of the writing from right to left; but when to this we add the
                    omission of the short vowels, the practice of noting double consonants by a
                    single letter, as in all the Aramaic systems of writing, and the want of the
                    vowel 0, which are peculiarities purely Punic, the presumption in favour of
                    Phoenician origin is considerably increased. From this last circumstance,
                    however, nothing can be decisively determined as to the pronunciation, inasmuch
                    as the Semitic languages are not defective in the vowel, which is wanting to the
                    Etruscan. The Phoenicians also distinguished numbers by letters; but not so the
                    Etruscans. What we denominate the Roman numerals are of Etruscan origin, and
                    occur frequently on their monuments, being probably the abbreviated remnants of
                    a hieroglyphical art of writing <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> in use before the
                    alphabetical, and, like the Aztecan numerals, representing objects connected
                    with particular numbers. Niebuhr thinks them indigenous to the west. But however
                    this may be, the literal form which these numerals have now assumed cannot
                    mislead any one as to their hieroglyphical origin. With respect to the Etruscan
                    language, which remained harsh in sound and uncouth in its forms, all the labour
                    which has hitherto been bestowed in attempting to interpret it, though valuable
                    for its collateral results, has proved wholly fruitless in reference to its
                    direct object. Lanzi, abandoning the oriental and northern etymology,
                    endeavoured to explain the Etruscan from the Pelasgic; and for many years after
                    the appearance of his Essay, his explanations were acquiesced in, and even made
                    the basis of various etymological hypotheses But when at length credulity gave
                    place to inquiry and examination, it was perceived that his modes of proceeding
                    were much too arbitrary; that he had produced no evι-dence of the existence of
                    the words and forms which he had assumed to be Greek, in order to identify them
                    with the Etruscan; and that other monuments, discovered since his time, could
                    not in any way be explained by his system. In short, his interpretation was
                    purely tentative and conjectural, without even accidental felicities of
                    supposition; and hence, of all the Etruscan words, of which pretended
                    explanations have been given, only two <hi rend="smallcaps">(avil ril,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vixit annos,</hi> or rather perhaps <hi rend="italic">oetatis
                    annos)</hi> seem to have been really interpreted. Professor Müller’s
                    observations on this subject are well deserving of attention, especially in
                    reference to the expectations which appear to be entertained of the enlargement
                    of our historical knowledge by the comparison of languages.</p>
                <p>“.We might give much ampler satisfaction,” says he, “if, after Lanzi’s method, we
                    sought in the monuments of the Etruscan language for single sounds resembling
                    the Greek and Latin, and, persuaded that similar sounds must have a similar
                    meaning, endeavoured to explain all that could not be brought to agree, by an
                    arbitrary pro-thesis, epenthesis, paragoge, and similar cheap expedients.
                    Without blaming the learned Italian, in whose time the most eminent literati had
                    very confused ideas of the formation of language, we may maintain that his
                    leading principle (that analogy is the character only of cultivated languages,
                    and that the ruder any language is, the greater liberty might be taken in the
                    use of it) is entirely false. This may justify us for having paid so little
                    regard to etymologies, which, as they are arbitrary in themselves, suppose an
                    arbitrary character in the language to which they are applied. <hi rend="italic"
                    >If</hi> we use only genuine monuments, and require a certain evidence for every
                    explanation of a root or a grammatical form, our apparent knowledge of the
                    Etruscan language shrinks almost to nothing lt is not probable that the
                    application of the still existing remains of the languages of the north and
                    north-west of Europe should have those beneficial results for our knowledge of
                    Etruscan which some appear to anticipate. The Germans and Celts are originally
                    divided in a very marked manner, by their locality, from the nations of the
                    Mediterranean; they only gradually approach these and come into collision with
                    them; and even though the languages of both nations may belong to that great
                    family which from time immemorial has diffused itself throughout Europe and
                    Asia, yet they have distinct peculiarities, which we have no reason to believe
                    are found in those oł Italy-One fundamental and indelible characteristic of the
                    Celtic languages seems to be, that they mark grammatical forms by aspiration and
                    other changes of the initial consonants; a thing not practised in any other
                    European language, but found in all the branches of the Celtic, as the Welsh,
                    Cornish, Gaelic, Irish, and <hi rend="italic">Bas Breton.</hi> This mutability
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">oγ'</hi> the consonants is a circumstance which must be
                    perceptible even in a small number of written remains, and which could not well
                    have escaped us had t <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> Etruscan been Celtic. The
                    Iberian family, once wide y diffused on the shores of the Mediterranean, may
                    have dwelt in close vicinity to the Etruscans; but the remains of its language
                    in the Basque are completely dilleren from the rest of Europe; and its grammar
                    shows so hit ≡ affinity with what we know of the Etruscan, as to afford very
                    slight support to the opinion of the affinity of the two na tions. What may have

                <p>Any attempt indeed to interpret the Etruscan, without the aid of bilingual
                    inscriptions, such as those on the Rosetta stone and obelisk of Philae, which
                    afforded a key to the Egyptian phonetic hieroglyphics, will be pure loss of
                    labour. The discovery of such monuments, however, is, in regard to time and
                    manner, an incalculable event; but still it is within the range of probable
                    calculation; and the <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> σ <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi>
                    which has witnessed the interpretation of Egyptian hieroglyphics by means of
                    such aids should not hastily despair of any thing. If a translation were
                    discovered, not in Latin or Greek, but in Oscan or even Umbrian, the latter have
                    so much affinity to the Latin, that much might be learned from such a version
                    for the explanation of the Etruscan. We repeat, however, that without the aid of
                    bilingual inscriptions, the language of ancient Etruria is likely to remain as
                    great a mystery as the inscriptions of Persepolis, or the arrow-headed legends
                    contained on bricks found amidst the ruins of Babylon.</p>
                <p>Of the early history of Etruria <hi rend="italic">we</hi> can only collect a few
                    detached facts of little importance, which are to be gleaned from Livy, and from
                    short notices in the Greek historians and poets; and must ever deplore the loss
                    of the works of Aristotle and Theophrastus on the civil institutions of the
                    Tyrrheni, as well as regret that the history of the Emperor Claudius has
                    disappeared. We find this people engaged in a contest with Tarquinius Priscus
                    (about 610 B. c.), but obliged to acknowledge at least a nominal dependence on
                    the power of Rome. They joined the Carthaginians in an attack on the Phocaeans,
                    who having left Asia Minor (about 547 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.)</hi> to escape
                    the persecutions of Cyrus the elder, had settled in Corsica, and threatened to
                    dispute with them the supremacy of the western seas. For the next two centuries
                    they appear to have enjoyed tranquillity; until, roused to exertion by the ever
                    encroaching spirit of the Romans, they determined to make an united effort to
                    check the power of their dangerous neighbours. The hostile forces met (309 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.)</hi> near Lake Va-diman, which is still to be seen on
                    the east of Etruria, near the Tiber, below the modern village of Bassano; and
                    the result was, as usual, favourable to the cause of Roman supremacy. The
                    Tuscans were completely defeated; and from this moment were compelled to
                    co-operate in extending and strengthening the power of the conqueror. They now
                    became incorporated with the Roman people, and can no longer be considered as a
                    separate nation.</p>
