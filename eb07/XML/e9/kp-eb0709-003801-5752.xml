                <p><label type="entry">ENGLISH LANGUAGE</label>. When the Romans invaded the south
                    of Britain, they found the country possessed by a people of Celtic origin, and
                    speaking a dialect of the Celtic tongue. This invasion took place about
                    fifty-five years before the birth of Christ, and the invaders retained their
                    ascendancy till the commencement of the fifth century. During this interval, the
                    Romans imparted to the rude natives some tincture of their own intellectual
                    refinement, but must have left the British language as they found it: the
                    foreign settlers were not sufficiently numerous to produce any changejn the
                    speech of the original inhabitants. When the huge fabric of the Roman empire
                    began to decay, the Britons, who had the advantage of a remote and insular
                    situation, found means to assert their independence. They however divided
                    themselves into many petty states, and exercised many petty animosities, which
                    impaired the national strength, and rendered them an easy prey to foreign
                    invaders. The pirates of Saxony had long been accustomed to make occasional
                    depredations on their coasts. The Picts and Scots, that is, the Goths and Celts
                    of North Britain, infested them on the frontier; and at length the sense of
                    common danger produced some degree of union in their councils and exertions. In
                    this condition of their affairs, the Saxons obtained a permanent footing in the
                    country. In the year 449, Vortigern, king of the Britons, had recourse to the
                    aid of Hengest and Horsa, who first appeared as allies, but were soon converted
                    into the most formidable enemies.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The Saxons, like other Gothic tribes, derive their origin from a mighty horde
                    which wandered from the east, and gradually overran the best portions of Europe.
                    So early as the time of Ptolemy the geographer, this particular tribe had
                    proceeded as far to the westward as the banks of the Elbe, and their primitive
                    seat was between that river and the Eyder. Although at first they were not very
                    formidable for their numbers, they gradually obtained a powerful ascendancy in
                    Germany. Towards the middle of the third century, they entered into a league
                    with the Franks for the purpose of opposing the Roman arms; and they afterwards
                    enlarged their connexions and increased their influence till it predominated in
                    a territory of great extent, reaching from the Eyder to the Rhine. This wide
                    tract of country was not entirely peopled by Saxons: it included various
                    nations, united by the ties of a kindred origin, and actuated by a sense of
                    common interest or danger; but such was the ascendancy of the Saxons that they
                    communicated their name to the entire confederacy, which, among other nations,
                    comprehended the Jutes, who inhabited the south of Jutland, and the Angles, who
                    inhabited the adjacent district of Anglen. Hengest and Horsa, the leaders whom
                    we have already mentioned, were not Saxons, but Jutes. The subsequent emigrants
                    were for the most part Angles, and their descendants were long distinguished by
                    the name of Anglo-Saxons. The first part of the name denotes the predominant
                    tribe, the second denotes the original relation of that tribe to the Saxon
                    confederacy. The new country which they acquired was denominated Engla-land, or
                    the land of the Angles. These German invaders established themselves in the most
                    fertile districts, and gradually displaced the Celtic inhabitants, till at
                    length they were chiefly confined to the fastnesses of Wales, where the
                    prevalence of the ancient language still indicates the continuance of their
                    race. Eight new states were formed by the Anglo-Saxons, who maintained their
                    independence till the year 1016, when they were subjected to the yoke of a
                    Danish conqueror. Canute, and his two sons, Harold and Hardicanute, reigned in
                    England for the space of twenty-six years. A Danish court, and a Danish army,
                    with other settlers, must have had some influence 6n the common speech,
                    especially as the language of the conquerors was not very dissimilar to that of
                    the conquered. But the laws and other public documents continued to be written
                    in the Saxon tongue, and this new dynasty soon finished its course. The Saxon
                    line of kings, which was restored in 1042, terminated in 1066, when Harold the
                    Second was slain at the battle of Hastings, and William duke of Normandy
                    ascended the throne of England. The Saxon dominion had thus continued for the
                    best part of three centuries; and as the great body of the people was still of
                    this race, it is obvious that their national language must have survived their
                    political power. A writ in the Anglo-Saxon tongue was issued by Henry the Third,
                    who began his reign in the year 1216.</p>
                <p>In the language spoken by this ancient people, a great variety of literary
                    reliques has been preserved. “The Anglo-Saxon literature,” says Professor Rask,
                    “possesses in many respects, even for its own sake, no small degree of interest.
                    The numerous anςient laws throw considerable light upon the laws of the old
                    Germans and Scandinavians, as well as upon their customs and civil institutions.
                    The old chronicles and genealogies are important sources for the ancient history
                    of the Low German and the Scandinavian nations. The various documents illustrate
                    much in English history. Even the theological remains, shewing the constitution
                    and doctrine of the ancient church, are not devoid of value for ecclesiastical
                    history, especially to the modern English and Scottish churches. The translation
                    of several parts of Scripture may likewise be advantageously employed in
                    biblical researches. But of all, the poetical pieces are the most interesting,
                    especially the great Anglo-Saxon poem in forty-three cantos, published at
                    Copenhagen in 1815, by the Royal Archivarius G. J. Thorkelin,<note

                <p>The language of the conquerors became the language of the king’s court and of all
                    the courts of law. The pleadings of counsel and the decisions of judges were
                    couched in a dialect which is commonly described as Norman French, but which in
                    the mouths of English lawyers became utterly barbarous; and more curious
                    specimens of composition are scarcely to be found than those which occur in the
                    reports of cases written in a jargon halfFrench half-English. Lawyers have in
                    all ages been conspicuous tor their stiff adherence, with or without reason, to
                    those forms and maxims in which they themselves have <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129559&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=49" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0049-0039"/>
                    been duly trained. Long after French had ceased to be the language of legal
                    proceedings, they adhered to the practice of reporting cases in the motley
                    dialect used by their predecessors; for, as Blackstone remarks, “the practisers
                    being used to the Norman language, and therefore imagining that they could
                    express their thoughts more aptly and more concisely in that than in any other,
                    still continued to take their notes in law French; and of course, when those
                    notes came to be published, under the denomination of reports, they were printed
                    in that barbarous dialect; which, joined to the additional terrors of a Gothic
                    black letter, has occasioned many a student to throw away his Plowden and
                    Littleton, without venturing to attack a page of them."<note anchored="true"

                    that for the future all pleas should be pleaded, shewn, defended, answered,

                    Latin. The statutes of the realm long continued to be promulgated in French; and
                    it was only from the accession of Richard the Third that Englishmen were
                    governed by laws written in their native tongue.</p>
                <p>The Norman conquest proved fatal to the entire race of Anglo-Saxon nobility, many
                    of whom lost their lives, and almost all of them their property. Not a few of
                    the number sought refuge in different monasteries. Some of them became abbots,
                    and others closed their career as monks. The lands of the Saxon earls were
                    occupied by the Norman barons, who found it necessary to consult their personal
                    safety by inhabiting fortified towns and castles. They must have had but little
                    intercourse with their vassals, whom they probably did not respect, and whom
                    they had much reason to fear. They retained their native tongue, and seldom
                    acquired any other. For a long period of time, the peasantry continued unmixed
                    with foreign settlers: they continued to cultivate the same soil; and when the
                    written language of the kingdom had received many foreign accessions, the rustic
                    dialect preserved its primitive elements with very few material changes. Much of
                    the patois of different countries consists, not in adulterations of the modern,
                    but in remnants of the ancient language. Many Anglo-Saxon words and idioms,
                    unintelligible to persons of a refined education, are still current among the
                    rural population of particular districts of England.</p>
                <p>The English monarchs of the Norman race were liberal patrons of such literature
                    as they themselves understood. French poetry seems to have been much relished at
                    the court of England; and, according to a very competent judge, Μ. de la Rue, it
                    was from England and Normandy that the French received the first works which
                    deserve to be cited in their language. The works of many Anglo-Norman poets have
                    been preserved, and they certainly form a curious subject of literary research.
                    In this department, a learned lady, Marie de France, makes a prominent figure.
                    Her poems have been recently edited by Μ. de Roquefort; and one of the
                    historical poems of Wace still more recently by Μ. Pluquet. A history of the
                    Anglo-Norman poets and poetry is speedily expected from Μ. de la Rue, who has
                    already exhibited sufficient evidence of his being well qualified for such an
                    undertaking.</p>
                <p>Of the language spoken by the great body of the people about a century after the
                    conquest, the reader may in some degree be enabled to judge from the following
                    specimen of Lyamon’s translation of Wace’s <hi rend="italic">Brut d'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Angle</hi><hi rend="italic">terre.</hi> The translator describes
                    himself as a priest of Ernlye upon Severn, and he is supposed to have completed

                <p>“When the mass was sung, out of the church they thronged. The king amid his folk
                    to his meat fared, and many of his nobility: joy was in the household. The
                    queen, on the other side, sought her harbour (or lodging): she had wonderfully
                    many women.” Here, and in a much more ample specimen of the same work, we
                    perceive no mixture of French words. The idiom is essentially Anglo-Saxon, but
                    with some indications of its being already in a state of transition: the
                    vestiges of the language, in its more modern form of English, may be distinctly
                    traced. Of the language in a state more considerably advanced, we find a
                    specimen in a facetious poem published by Dr Hickes.</p>

                <p>In this poem, which apparently belongs to the thirteenth century, we perceive a
                    further deviation from the Anglo-Saxon idiom. In the preceding extract, the
                    obsolete spelling is not retained, and the language is thus rendered more
                    intelligible. The subsequent quotation is from a metrical history of England,
                    written by Robert, a monk of Gloucester, who appears to have lived about the
                    year 1278. This rhyming chronicle, as Mr Warton has remarked, is totally
                    destitute of art or imagination. The author thus describes the island of
                    Ireland, nor does he fail to mention its exemption from venomous reptiles.</p>

                <p>A more curious specimen of composition is to be found in the Vision of Piers
                    Plowman, which appears to have been written about the year 1362, and which is
                    commonly ascribed to Robert Langland. a secular priest. The work, which
                    comprehends a series of visions, is replete with satire on the different orders
                    of men, especially on the clergy, both regular and secular; but it is likewise
                    diversified by a succession of incidents, and furnishes abundant evidence of the
                    author’s talents for description. His mode of versification is not unworthy of
                    particular notice. Alliteration supplies the place of rhyme: the corresponding

                <p>After these specimens of verse, we shall exhibit a specimen of prose, selected
                    from the seventh chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, as translated by John
                    Wycliffe. The translator, who was born about the year 1324, and died in the year
                    1384, may be regarded as the father of English prose. He was the author of
                    various works in Latin as well as English; but the most important of bis
                    literary labours was a complete version of the Scriptures. He was the great
                    precursor of Luther, who appeared after an interval of one hundred and fifty
                    years; and it may perhaps be safely affirmed, that to him the cause of
                    reformation was more deeply indebted than to Luther himself.</p>
                <p>“This Moises ledde hem out, and dide woundris and signes in the lond of Egipte
                    and in the Reed See, and in desert fourti gheeris. This is Moises that seide to

                    the aungel that spak to him in the mount Syna and with oure fadris, which took

                <p>Contemporary with Wycliffe was Geoffrey Chaucer, who is commonly regarded as the
                    father of English poetry, and who closed his life in the year 1400. Dr Johnson
                    has remarked that “he may, perhaps, with justice, be styled the first of our
                    versifiers who wrote poetically.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    acquaintance with writers in several languages. For the native poets who
                    preceded him, he appears to have entertained but little respect: he sought for
                    better models among the Latin, Italian, and French writers, and in all these
                    languages he found works which he either translated or imitated. He possessed a
                    lively fancy, and was a shrewd observer of life and manners. He improved the
                    language, and refined the taste of his contemporaries. He taught them to write,
                    if not with new harmony, at least with new terseness. The work by which he is
                    best known are his Canterbury Tales; and in these he not only exhibits many
                    characteristic delineations of manners, but likewise evinces a rich vein of
                    native humour. They commence with the following verses, which we have selected
                    on account of the elaborate analysis to which they have been subjected by Mr

                <p>In the English language, as it thus appeared in the fourteenth century, the
                    Anglo-Saxon vocabulary was still predominant, but the words had been greatly
                    curtailed in their inflexions. This plan of simplifying the structure of speech
                    is to be traced in other instances, where a rude or a strange race is mingled
                    with a people who have cultivated a more complex language, bearing little or no
                    resemblance to their own. The most essential part of the vocabulary may be
                    acquired without difficulty; but it is not so easy to become acquainted with the
                    inflexions of nouns and verbs, or with some other niceties which belong to
                    language in its more complicated form. Many French words had now been
                    incorporated with the English language; but the compositions of this period
                    began to be marked by an affectation of words derived immediately from the
                    Latin. If Chaucer did not set the example, he at least followed it; and when he
                    aims at a more ornamented style, his use of such phraseology is sufficiently
                    copious. In this respect, he was however exceeded by some of his successors,
                    particularly Hoccleve, Lydgate, and Hawes, who inherited no portion of his
                    strength and originality. Being deficient in taste as well as genius, they
                    devised a verbose and languid style, interspersed with many sonorous and
                    polysyllabic terms, with terms “aureate and mellifluate,” which did not
                    assimilate with their native tongue. The same false taste was at length
                    communicated to the Scotish poets. Dr Nott has remarked that Barbour had given
                    his countrymen a fine example of the simple energetic style, which resembled
                    Chaucer’s best manner, and wanted little to make it the genuine language of
                    poetry; and that other poets of the same nation, particularly James the First
                    and Henryson, adhered to this model of a simple diction, and affected no other
                    ornament than what the proper use of their language supplied.<note

                    the false taste, which had infected the English poets, was communicated to their
                    brethren of the north.</p>
                <p>Gower and Lydgate, whose names are very frequently mentioned with that of
                    Chaucer, are well known to the readers of early English poetry. Thomas Hoccleve,
                    whom his editor supposes to have been born about the year 1370, makes a more
                    inconsiderable figure in the literary annals of that age, but seems nevertheless
                    to claim a passing notice. He was deficient in the essential qualifications of a
                    poet; and, in the opinion of Mr Warton, “his chief merit seems to be, that his
                    writings contributed to propagate and establish those improvements in our
                    language which were now beginning to take place.”</p>
                <p>The greater part of the fifteenth century was highly unfavourable to the progress
                    of literature in England. The repeated contests for the crown, and the civil
                    wars which they occasioned, were attended with a great waste of human blood, and
                    with that incertainty of possession, and those reverses of fortune, which leave
                    the mind but little relish for such pursuits as are chiefly calculated to
                    gratify the taste. Some individuals, Sir John Fortescue, and a few other
                    writers, have left favourable specimens of prose composition; and they were
                    succeeded by others, who made further improvements in style. Among these we must
                    include Sir Thomas More, Archbishop Cranmer, Sir Thomas Elyot, and Roger Ascham.
                    But from the death of Chaucer, more than a century elapsed before another
                    writer, deserving the name of a poet, appeared in England. This writer was Henry
                    Howard, earl of Surrey, son and heir apparent to the duke of Norfolk, whom
                    however he did not survive. He was beheaded in 1547, in the thirtieth year of
                    his age. Although thus cut off before the full maturity of intellectual vigour,
                    he lived long enough to effect some very material improvements in English
                    poetry. The versification of preceding poets was more properly rhythmical than
                    metrical. Although some improvements had been introduced by Chaucer, he left the
                    number of syllables too indefinite, and did not reach the harmony and
                    compression, of which this noble poet afterwards exhibited an example. One of
                    the changes which he introduced was the use of the heroic blank verse. Langland
                    and other poets had indeed dispensed with rhyme; but their alliterative lines
                    were constructed in a very different manner. In the following sonnet, he bewails
                    the death of another eminent poet, Sir Thomas Wyatt.</p>
                <p>Divers thy death do diversely bemoan: Some, that in presence of thy livelihed</p>
                <p>Lurked, whose breasts envy with hate had swoln, Yield Caesar’s tears upon
                    Pompeius’ head. Some that watched with the murd’rer’s knife, With eager thirst
                    to drink thy guiltless blood, Whose practice brake by happy end of life, Weep
                    envious tears to hear thy fame so good.</p>
                <p>But I, that knew what harboured in that head, What virtues rare were tempered in
                    that breast, Honour the place that such a jewel bred, And kiss the ground
                    whereas thy corpse doth rest. With vapoured eyes, from whence such streams avail
                    As Pyramus did oh Tbisbe’s breast bewail.</p>
                <p>Before the close of the sixteenth century, the English language had in a great
                    measure attained that form and structure which it continues to exhibit. A great
                    improvement of taste had been introduced by a more critical and more general
                    study of the ancient classics. William Lilly, the famous grammarian, who had
                    learned Greek at Rhodes, and who had afterwards acquired a polished Latinity at
                    Rome, became the first teacher of Greek at any public school in England. This
                    was at St Paul’s school in London, of which he was appointed the first master
                    about the year 1500.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    rend="superscript"> s</hi> The language soon began to be more regularly taught
                    in the universities. At Cambridge the study of it was zealously and successfully
                    recommended by Smith, Cheke, and Ascham, who were themselves distinguished by
                    their proficiency. The elegancies of Latin style began to be better understood,
                    and monkish barbarism was gradually banished. Ascham and Haddon acquired
                    distinction by the style of their Latin prose; and some of the verses of Leland
                    discover a classical vein previously unknown to his countrymen. Before the close
                    of the century, many of the Greek and Latin writers appeared in an English
                    dress, and classical story, with classical <pb break="no" facs="nls:193745804"

                    reader. In addition to the French, the Italian and Spanish languages attracted a
                    great degree of attention; and from an these languages, especially the two
                    former, many works were likewise translated. New sources of knowledge, as well
                    as of fancy, were thus opened, and the English tongue was enriched with a more
                    copious and variegated phraseology. Surrey and Wyatt were succeeded by poets of
                    great genius, by Shakspearé and Spenser, as well as by many others who, though
                    of inferior powers, were yet possessed of a vigorous and brilliant imagination.
                    The pròse compositions of Bacon and Raleigh, partaking of the native energy of
                    their authors, exhibited specimens of a condensed and forcible style, to which
                    the preceding age had never attained. During the earlier part of the seventeenth
                    century, ancient learning was assiduously cultivated; and men of great
                    erudition, Selden, Gataker, and Others, adorned the literary annals of their
                    country. The prevailing taste of scholars had however a strong tendency tq what
                    was scholastic, if not pedantic; and even the poets, such, as Domie and Cowley,
                    substituted the subtilties of metaphysical conceits for flights of poetic fancy.
                    Many words, derived immediately from the Latin, were introduced by the learned
                    writers of the period to wħieh we now refer. A considerable, number of these has
                    been subsequently rejected, while others' are incorporated in the vocabulary. In
                    tfie mean time, English poetry had nearly reached its highest limits. Milton s
                    Paradise Lost, so eminently distinguished as a viyork of creative genius,
                    affords the ιpost remarkable illustration of the compass, power, and. harmony of
                    the language. Nor is Dryden unworthy of being mentioned with this mighty master
                    of the English lyre. His powers of, mind were no doubt different in kind and
                    degree, but he wμs possessed of a genius truly poetical; and his prose, as well
                    as his verse, exhibits a rich and copious vein of English phraseology.</p>
                <p>The, subsequent progress of the language our narrow limits will not permit us to
                    trace· The history of the Scotish íaŋguageås involved in more obscurity. The
                    Celtic; tongue is supposed to have been originally spoken in every district of
                    this kingdom; nor has iţ been found an easy , task to accoμnt for the
                    introduction of a Gothic dialect, bearing a very close affinity to English. That
                    the Şcotish language is merely a&lt;dialectof the English, seems indeed to be
                    the more prevalent opinion; and this foreign speech is supposed to have been
                    gradually adopted by the Piets, who are at the same time described as a people
                    of Celtic origin. The ancient history of every race of men which is possessed of
                    no ancient records, and which has not attracted much attention from more
                    enlightened nations, must ever be involved in doubt and íncertainty. In the
                    present instance, we have little to guide our enquiries, besides a, few
                    scattered and contradictory notices, added,to the ordinary and well-ascertained
                    progress of human speech. When other records fail, the history of a nation may
                    sometimes be traced in the history of its language; and a very moderate degree
                    of reflection will énable üs to determine the probability of a Celtic people
                    thus unlearning their native tongue, and from'deliberate choice adopting another
                    speech completely and radically different.</p>
                <p>Dr Geddes, in a Dissertation on the Scoto-Saxon Dialect, has strenuously
                    maintained this‘extraordinary opinion, which has likewise been adopted by a
                    ihoi’ë recent writer, possessing no portion of his acuteness or learning!</p>
                <p>The names,” it is stated, “of all the rivers, mountains, towns, villages, and
                    castles, of any note or antiquity, from</p>
                <p>Berwick-law to Buchanness, and from Buchanness to Arder-Sier, arc all evidently
                    Celtie. We must then either <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> suppose that the
                    language of the Picts was a dialect of the Celtic; or that they were not the
                    original inhabitants of the country; or, in fine, that, after the.extinction of
                    the Pietish empire, or rather its union with the Irish-Scots, the language of
                    these latter universally prevailed, and effaced the very remembrance of its
                    Gothic predecessor. The second of these suppositions is contrary to history; the
                    third is belied by experience; the first then is the only one that is founded in
                    probability.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    408.</p></note> This observation with respect to the prevalence of Celtic names,
                    though too strongly stated, is not without foundation. We may therefore admit
                    that the south of Scotland was at some remote period inhabited by a Celtic
                    people; but it is not a necessary inference that this people must be identified
                    with the Piets. Whatever hypothesis may be adopted, it is not denied that many
                    Celtic names of places have been retained where the inhabitants have long ceased
                    to speak any dialect of the Celtic language. It may very easily be conjectured
                    that this primitive race of Celts was finally supplanted by new settlers: and
                    that those settlers, whether Scandinavians or some other Gothic tribe, adopted
                    many of the names which the original inhabitants had applied to mountains,
                    rivers, and other conspicuous objects. That à similar process has been followed
                    in innumerable instances, must be obvious to every person acquainted with the
                    history of European settlements in other quarters of the globe: the native
                    appellations are almost always retained to a certain extent, and are mingled
                    with other names, borrowed from the language of the colonists.</p>
                <p>If we should suppose the Picts to have been a Celtic people, a very hard problem
                    will remain to be solved :— by what extraordinary means could a distinct race of
                    men, placed in such circumstances, be induced to reject one lan-Ŝuage, and to
                    adopt another? This radical and unprece-ented change Dr Geddes is disposed to
                    ascribe to the operation of such causes as the following; to the temporary
                    subjection of the southern provinces of Scotland by the Northumbrians; to the
                    immense number of captives seized during the ancient wars with the English; to
                    the planting of English garrisons in several of the Scotish towns; to the
                    amicable intercourse of the Piets with the English; and, finally, to the
                    influence of Malcolm Canmore’s courtiers, whom he supposes to have learned the
                    English language from Queen Margaret and her retinue. But it may without
                    temerity be affirmed that, in the entire annals of the human race, such an
                    effect was never produced by śueh causes. In a more refined state of society,
                    the love of knowledge, the hope of gain, or the influence of fashion, may induce
                    many individuals to betake themselves to the acquisition of foreign languages;
                    but the great body of the people will ever be disposed to rest perfectly
                    satisfied with the speech, whether rude or cultivated, which they have derived
                    from their parents. It is only by some great revolution, by a total conquest, or
                    by an overwhelming extent of colonization, that the current language of a
                    country can be materially changed. After the, Norman conquest, when French
                    became the language of the court and of the law, and when Norman barons were
                    planted in almost every corner of England, did the combined operation of such
                    causes eradicate the old, and establish a new language in its place? Many new
                    words were unquestionably' introduced, but these were merely engrafted on the
                    old stock of the Anglo-Saxon. “Had the Saxon,” as Dr Jamieson well observes,
                    “found <pb break="no" facs="nls:193745817" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5817-0043"/>its way
                    into Scotland in the manner supposed, it would necessarily have been
                    superinduced on the Gaelic. This has always been the case, where one language
                    prevailed over another; unless the people who spoke the original language were
                    either completely or nearly exterminated. Thus was the Norman gradually
                    incorporated with the Saxon, as the Frankish had been with the Latinized Celtic
                    of France. But the number of Gaelic words to be found in what is called Broad
                    Scots bears a very small proportion to the body of the language.”<note

                    that the inhabitants of the south of Scotland cannot be sprung from Celtic
                    ancestors. Dr Geddes has ventured to specify the reign of Malcolm the Third,
                    which commenced in the year 1057, as the period of a general denization of the
                    Saxon tongue in Scotland. “That monarch,” he remarks, “had been bred in England,
                    and married an English princess. Hcr retinue were all English. English, in
                    consequence, would become the language of the court. The courtiers would carry
                    it to their respective homes; their domestics would be ambitious to speak the
                    language of their masters; and thus it would be gradually introduced into ’
                    every fashionable circle.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    to introduce a language into every fashionable circle, is somewhat different
                    from rendering it the current speech of the people: French has long been the
                    court language, and the language of fashionable circles in England, and yet the
                    great body of the people still persist in speaking English.</p>
                <p>The insuperable difficulty of accounting for such a transition as has thus been
                    supposed, a transition from a Celtic to a Gothic dialect, renders the conclusion
                    obvious and unavoidable, that the Gothic speech of Scotland was derived from a
                    Gothic race of ancestors. Nor is this conclusion altogether free from
                    difficulties, though they arc of very inferior weight to those which are to be
                    deposited in the opposite scale. It is the opinion of a late writer, who has
                    investigated the subject with much ability, that the Picts emigrated from
                    Scandinavia;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Pinkerton’s

                    origin of the Picts, bestows sufficient commendation on Mr Pinkerton’s learning
                    and research, and to a certain extent is disposed to adopt his leading opinion;
                    but at the same time he declares himself unable to approve of all the arguments
                    by which it is supported, especially of those which rest upon erroneous
                    interpretations of Scandinavian words and antiquities; nor does he fail to

                    spoken two dialects of the same original tongue. The history of these kindred
                    dialects may be illustrated from that of some others, derived from the same
                    Gothic origin. The I⅛landic, Swedish, and Danish languages are all descended
                    from the ancient Scandinavian. Island, which, as the learned Bishop Müller has

                    in another suggestion; namely, that it is not more strange to perceive that the
                    Italian, French, and Spanish languages were originally termed Romance. They were
                    all described by this common name, because they were all derived from the
                    language of the Romans; but we arc not inclined to believe that the Scotish and
