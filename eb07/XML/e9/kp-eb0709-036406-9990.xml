                <p><label type="entry">ERSKINE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas, Lord
                    Erskine</hi></label>, a distinguished lawyer and statesman, was the third and
                    youngest son of David Henry Erskine, tenth earl of Buchan, in Scotland. He was
                    born in Scotland, and received his education partly at the high school of
                    Edinburgh, and partly at the university of St Andrews. From the contracted
                    resources of his family, it was necessary for him to fix upon a profession. He
                    chose the navy, and having embarked at Leith as a midshipman, he quitted his
                    native country, which he did not revisit until a few years before his death. In
                    the navy he experienced no advancement, and, after four <hi rend="subscript">
                    ζ</hi> years ’ service, he entered the army in the year 1768. In 1770 he
                    married, and shortly after this event he accompanied his regiment to Minorca,
                    where he remained during three years. It is not certain whether his abilities as
                    an officer ever rendered him conspicuous, but the versatility of his talents,
                    and the acuteness of his intellect, thus early brought him a high reputation. By
                    the earnest persuasion of his mother, who, it would appear, was a woman of more
                    than ordinary penetration, he was induced to quit the army after six years of
                    military probation. The legal profession was the one which appeared best adapted
                    for the character of his mind; and in 1777 he entered as a fellow commoner at
                    Trinity College, Cambridge, for the purpose of obtaining a degree, which he was
                    entitled to as the son of a nobleman, and thereby of shortening his passage to
                    the bar. At the same time he entered himself as a student at Lincoln’s Inn. In
                    1778 he was called to the bar, where his success was immediate and remarkable.
                    In a ease of libel, in which he advocated the cause of Captain Baillie, the
                    defendant, he displayed so much eloquence and talent, that the legal world was
                    astonished, and thirty retainers were put into his hand by attomies before he
                    left the court. A few months after this event he was honoured by being chosen to
                    appear at the bar of the House of Commons, as counsel against a bill of Lord
                    North’s to restore to the universities the monopoly in almanacks. The bill was
                    lost by a large majority, and the speech which Mr Erskine made upon the occasion
                    so established his reputation for forensic skill, that he was from this period
                    engaged, either on one side or another, m every case of importance, during a
                    practice of twenty-fiy <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> years. To this period also
                    belongs his famous speech m defence of Lord George Gordon, which was a case of
                    what <pb break="no" facs="nls:193750003" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0003-0365"/>is called
                    constructive treason. Erskine procured a clear acquittal of his client, which
                    was for the time a deathblow to the tremendous doctrine of constructive treason.
                    In May 1783 he received a silk gown, and the same year was elected member of
                    parliament for Portsmouth, for which borou <hi rend="superscript"> σ</hi> h he
                    was on every election re-chosen, until his advancement to the peerage rendered
                    that honour unnecessary. When the eldest son of George III. obtained his
                    establishment as Prince of Wales, he chose Mr Erskine as his attorney-general.
                    But there is nothing in the life of this eminent man which reflects so much
                    honour on his memory as his exertions in defence of the privileges of juries.
                    The rights of those <hi rend="italic">pro tempore</hi> judges he strenuously
                    maintained upon all occasions, particularly in the celebrated trial of the Dean
                    of St Asaph, for libel, when Justice Buller refused to receive the verdict of
                    <hi rend="italic">guilty of publishing only,</hi> as returned by the jury. In
                    1789 another opportunity was afforded him to display his peculiar powers. This
                    was the defence of a Mr Stockdale, a bookseller, who was tried on an information
                    filed by the attorney-general, for publishing what was charged as a libellous
                    pamphlet in favour of Mr Hastings. The situation of the latter, whose celebrated
                    but protracted trial was then dragging its slow length along, gave Erskine
                    admirable scope for that animated appeal to the feelings, by which his speeches
                    are so much distinguished. It is one of his finest orations; and, whether we
                    regard the wonderful skill with which the argument is conducted, the soundness
                    of the principles laid down, and their happy application to the case, the
                    vividness of fancy with which these are illustrated, and the touching language
                    in which they are conveyed, it is justly to be regarded as a consummate specimen
                    of the art of addressing a jury. This masterly defence procured a clear
                    acquittal for Stockdale, although the fact of publication was admitted. Not long
                    afterwards he advocated the cause of Mr Perry, editor of a London newspaper, who
                    was also charged with publishing what the jealous loyalty of those times
                    construed into a libel; and his speech produced a similar result. But the most
                    arduous effort of his professional life arose out of the part cast upon him, in
                    conjunction with Mr, afterwards Sir Vicary, Gibbs, in the trials of Hardy,
                    Tooke, and others, for high treason in 1794. These trials lasted several weeks,
                    and the ability displayed by Mr Erskine upon this memorable occasion was
                    acknowledged and admired by men of all parties. His speech in defence of Mr
                    Frost, which, however, preceded those above mentioned, is another of those
                    almost miraculous exertions, which, in that momentous crisis, Mr Erskine made
                    for the liberties of his country. Frost was accused of uttering seditious words,
                    which, however, turned out to have been spoken at random in a coffee-house
                    whilst the accused was in a state bordering on intoxication. In the violence of
                    that day, the exertions of Erskine failed of their accustomed effect, and Frost
                    was found guilty. But the impression of his defence; <hi rend="superscript">
                    vas</hi> not lost; and it deterred the government from risking its credit on
                    such precarious speculations, until, as we have noticed, the charges of high
                    treason were brought forward, when the whole force of the bar was marshalled
                    against the prisoners, and every effort used to beat down and paralyse their
                    undaunted defender. But his spirit rose superior to <hi rend="superscript">
                    e</hi> ' <hi rend="superscript"> er</hi> y difficulty, and then it was that his
                    consummate talents ’hone forth in their native lustre. His indefatigable
                    patience, his sleepless watchfulness, his unceasing activity of body and mind,
                    his untameable spirit, his quickness and subtilty of intellect, together with a
                    herculean strength of institution, counterbalanced the host to which he was
                    opposed. Such were the gigantic powers of the man; the " <hi rend="superscript">
                    0l</hi> jderful eloquence of the forensic orator is only to be <hi
                    rend="superscript"> n</hi> °f <hi rend="superscript"> secon</hi> ð <hi

                <p>r Erskine was a warm partizan of Mr Fox, and the liberal party of that time. He
                    strenuously opposed the war with France, and published a pamphlet against it,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">A View of the Causes and Consequences of the War with
                    France,</hi> which had an immense sale. In 1802 the Prince of Wales not only
                    restored him to his office of attorney-general, of which he had been deprived,
                    but made him keeper of the seals for the duchy of Cornwall. On the death of Pitt
                    in 1806, when Lord Grenville received orders to form a new administration, Mr
                    Erskine was created a peer, by the title of Lord Erskine, of Restormel Castle in
                    Cornwall, and elevated to the dignity of lord high chancellor of Great Britain.
                    His previous experience in the courts of common law scarcely fitted him for the
                    judicial functions of this dignified office; but there seems little doubt that
                    his natural quickness of intellect would have triumphed over every difficulty,
                    had not a dissolution of the administration of which he formed part been
                    accelerated by the obstinacy of the king on the subject of the Catholic claims.
                    His public career may be said to have terminated with this event, and the
                    remainder of his life was undistinguished by any great exertion, whilst it was
                    unhappily embittered by pecuniary difficulties, which were enhanced, it is said,
                    by an unfortunate second marriage. His mind, however, retained its native
                    elasticity, and in his retirement he employed himself in editing several of the
                    state trials. He also wrote the preface to Fox’s speeches, a political romance
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Armata,</hi> and several pamphlets in support of the
                    Greek cause. Whilst accompanying one of his sons by sea to Edinburgh, he was
                    seized with an inflammation of the chest, which compelled him to land at
                    Scarborough. He reached Scotland by easy stages, but expired on the 17th of
                    November 1823, at the seat of his brother, situated a few miles from Edinburgh.
                    The peculiar character of Lord Erskine’s eloquence has already in some measure
                    been described. In his capacity of advocate he possessed the power of summoning
                    upon the instant all the resources of his mind, and bringing them to bear upon
                    the subject before the court with extraordinary effect. In this respect his
                    speeches bear a resemblance to those of Mr Pitt, whilst they far surpass them in
                    impassioned fervour, in brilliancy of imagination, in copiousness of imagery,
                    and in that quality of mind expressed by the emphatic word genius. His dexterity
                    was likewise unrivalled at the bar; and these qualifications, united with a
                    courage which nothing could daunt, and a firmness which was never overcome,
                    rendered him almost irresistible on the defensive side of political persecution.
                    Amidst all the struggles of the constitution in parliament, in council, and in
                    the field, during that momentous period of our national history, there was no
                    man to whose individual exertions it owed so much as to those of this celebrated
                    advocate. In stemming the tide of state prosecutions, this single patriot may be
                    said to have saved his country from the horrors of a general proscription. As a
                    senatorial orator his claims were but secondary; and as a political writer he is
                    not entitled to much distinction. His sphere was the bar, and there, as the
                    advocate of injured worth or persecuted political honesty, he never had a rival
                    before, and he has left no equal behind him.</p>
                <p>By his first wife, who died in 1805, Lord Erskine had three sons and five
                    daughters. His speeches have been frequently printed; the last edition is in 5
                    vols. 8vo. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r.</hi> R. R.)</p>
