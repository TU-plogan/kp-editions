                    Thomas,</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi> celebrated orientalist, born at Gorcum in
                    Holland, on the 7th September 1584. Observing his aptitude for learning, his
                    father sent him to Leyden at the early age of ten; and it was in that city that
                    he commenced his studies. At the end of several months, however, he went to
                    Middelburg, where he remained some time; but in about a year he returned to
                    Leyden, where he had opportunities of indulging his tastes with greater
                    facility. His progress was so rapid, that at a very tender age he was admitted
                    into the university of that city, and in 1608 took the degree of master of arts.
                    At the solicitation of Scaliger he learned the oriental languages whilst taking
                    his course of theology, and even then gave promise of the distinction which he
                    was destined to attain in that department of learning. After he had completed
                    his studies he travelled in England, France, Italy, and Germany, forming
                    connections with learned men, and availing himself of the information which they
                    communicated. During his stay at Paris, he contracted a friendship with
                    Casaubon, which lasted during his life, and also took lessons in Arabic from
                    Joseph Barbatus, otherwise called Abu-dakni. At Venice he held conferences with
                    both Jews and Mahommedans, and profited by his residence in that city to perfect
                    himself in the Turkish, Persic, and Ethiopic languages. After a long absence,
                    Erpenius returned into his own country in 1612, rich in the learning which he
                    had acquired during his travels, as well as beloved and esteemed by all the
                    learned whom he had visited. His acquirements being already known and
                    appreciated, he was, on the 10th February 1613, appointed professor of Arabic
                    and other oriental languages, Hebrew excepted, in the university of Leyden. From
                    this period he devoted himself solely to the teaching of these languages, to
                    facilitate the study of them, and to extend a knowledge of them by means of his
                    works. Animated by the example of Savary de Breves, who had established at his
                    own charge an Arabic press at Paris, he caused new Arabic characters to be cut
                    at a great expense, and erected a press in his own house. In 1619 the curators
                    of the university of Leyden instituted a second chair of Hebrew in his favour.
                    In 162′), the States of Holland sent him to France, to endeavour, by the promise
                    of a chair of theology, to induce Pierre Dumoulin or André Rivet to settle in
                    that country; but this first journey proved unsuccessful, and was followed, the
                    year after, by a second, which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193749990"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-9990-0364"/> had the desired effect, as Rivet closed with the
                    terms offered him, and passed into Holland. Some time after the return of
                    Erpenius, the States appointed him their interpreter; an office which imposed
                    upon him the duty of translating and replying to the different letters of the
                    Moslemin princes of Asia and Africa. The king or emperor of Morocco, it is said,
                    took great pleasure in reading his Arabic letters, and in pointing out the
                    elegance and purity with which they were written. But be this as it may, ζhc
                    reputation of Erpenius had now spread throughout all Europe; and several
                    princes, the kings of England and Spain, and the archbishop of Seville, made him
                    the most flattering offers; but he constantly refused to leave his native
                    country, and died of a contagious distemper on the 13th of November 1624, at the
                    early age of forty. Erpenius left several works, which are doubtless not
                    perfect; but if we consider that he lived in an age when pursuits like his were
                    exceedingly rare, if not wholly new, that he had little or no assistance of any
                    kind, and that in fact he formed himself; and if w e judge him, not according to
                    the present state of oriental literature, but by what he actually achieved under
                    every disadvantage, we must conclude that, in the immensity and difficulty of
                    his labours, he probably surpassed all the orientalists who have followed him;
                    and that if his career had not been cut short by a premature death, he would
                    have greatly enlarged the boundaries of that literature of which his name will
                    always remain one of the greatest ornaments. The following is a list of his
