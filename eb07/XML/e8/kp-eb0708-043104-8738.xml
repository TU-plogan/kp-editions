                <p><label type="entry">EDRISI, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Aldrisi</hi></label>, the
                    most eminent of the geographers who have written in the Arabic language. There
                    is no individual of equal eminence over whose life there hangs a deeper veil of
                    mystery, the various parts of it affording rather subjects of controversy to the
                    learned than of precise information to the biographer. The place, and even the
                    country in which he was born, compose the first subject of disputation. Sionita
                    and Hezronita, who published a Latin translation of his work at Paris, make him
                    a Nubian, and gave to their work the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geographia</hi><hi rend="italic">Nubiensis,</hi> the Nubian Geography. They
                    proceeded upon the expression there used, namely, “the Nile of Egypt, which cuts
                    <hi rend="italic">our</hi> land” Hartmann was at once led to suspect the
                    correctness of this inference, by observing that Nubia was one of the countries
                    of which Edriβi gives the most meagre and imperfect account; and his suspicions
                    were confirmed by learning that Ockley, on examining two manuscripts in the
                    Bodleian Library, had found in both “that land," instead of “<hi rend="italic"
                    >our</hi> land.” It seems now generally agreed, therefore, that there is no
                    reason to suppose him of Nubian origin. Others have given him an Egyptian one,
                    which seems more probable, yet rests solely upon the erroneous reading above
                    referred to. In 1663, Bochart stated that he had found in a manuscript of Leo
                    Africanus, that Edrisi was born at Mazara, in Sicily, in 1098. Next year,
                    however, the manuscript was edited by Hot-tinger, in an appendix to his work
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Bdiliothecarius Quadripartibus,</hi> when it appeared
                    that the person supposed to be Edrisi was there named Esseriff Essachalli.
                    Esseriff, or Scheriff, is indeed an usual appellation of Edrisi, but it is
                    common to many, and is rather a title than a name. The rest of the name, and the
                    date of birth, are materially different, so that there seems very little reason
                    to doubt that Bochart was here mistaken.</p>
                <p>The most positive statement on the subject is that of Casiri, who says <hi
                    rend="italic">(Bibliotheca</hi><hi rend="italic">ArabicoHispanice,</hi> ii. 9),
                    that if Edrisi, as appeared probable, were the person designated by the
                    Mahommedan writers under the long appellation of Abu Abdallah Mohamad Ben
                    Mohamad Ben Abdallah Ben Edris, he was born at Septa, or Ceuta, on Lite coast of
                    Morocco, in the year of the Hegira 493 <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic smallcaps"> d.</hi> 1099). Casiri not only qualifies his statement
                    with this condition, but he does not state the authorities from which it is
                    derived; so that it rests only upon the confidence reposed in his learning and
                    accuracy. Edrisi was long a mighty name in Northern Africa; but in 919 the
                    dynasty was subverted by Mahedi Abdallah, and the proscribed wrecks of the
                    family, according to D’Herbelot, afterwards sought refuge in Sicily. This
                    certainly tends to strengthen the Sicilian origin of our author, though it is
                    not probable that many would seek refuge by concealment in their native
                    country.</p>
                <p>If we may trust the information of Casiri, Edrisi pursued his studies at Cordova,
                    then equally famed as a seat of Moorish empire and a seminary of Arabic
                    learning. From the accurate and particular description he has given of Spain, it
                    is probable that he had travelled through a great part of that country. Various
                    circumstances prove that he removed to Sicily, and began to compose his great
                    work under the patronage, and indeed at the express desire, of Roger IL king of
                    that island. It was completed about the year of the Hegira 548, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 1153.</p>
                <p>It has been a subject of pretty warm controversy among the learned whether Edrisi
                    was a Mahommedan or a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328751"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-8751-0432"/>Christian. Sionita, who adopts the latter opinion,
                    observes that he repeatedly calls our Saviour the Lord Jesus, and on one
                    occasion simply the Lord, a title which is said never to be applied by
                    Mahommedans unless to Mahommed, while they merely say “Jesus, to whom be peace,”
                    or “Jesus, to whom be safety.” He also speaks with profound respect of the holy
                    Virgin, and of various saints, using in regard to the latter the Italian
                    expression instead of the Arabic. These arguments are strenuously repelled by
                    Hartmann, though not, as appears to us, on very solid grounds. He justly
                    remarks, indeed, that the Mahommedans speak always with the highest respect of
                    every thing connected with the origin of Christianity. But though this may
                    impair the force of Sionita’s arguments, there seems nothing of any importance
                    to place in the opposite scale. Hartmann lays much stress on the circumstance
                    that Edrisi, amongst his numerous names, bears that of Mohamad, which he says
                    was never borne by any Christian; but though this may imply that he was a
                    Mahommedan by birth, it does not authorize us to infer that he may not have
                    become a convert to the opposite faith. He evidently wishes to offend persons of
                    neither profession, and thus writes in a style from which no positive inference
                    can be drawn. But considering how high religious differences ran in that age, it
                    does not appear very probable that he could have resided in Sicily, or been in
                    such high favour with Roger, without adopting the religion of the monarch and
                    country.</p>
                <p>The only thing relative to the life of this eminent author which remains even a
                    subject of controversy, is the period of its termination. Bochart has fixed it
                    in the year 1122; but this date clearly proves that he had some quite different
                    person in view; since it appears by the preface to Edrisi’s own work, that its
                    completion took place in the year 1153. No other notice, nor even conjecture,
                    relative to the time or manner of his death, is to be found in any author.</p>
                <p>From these meagre notices respecting the life of Edrisi, we shall proceed to give
                    some account of his work. It has appeared under various titles. The first and
                    fullest appears to have been, <hi rend="italic">The going out of a Curious Man
                    to explore the Regions of the Globe, its Provinces, Islands, Cities, and their
                    Dimensions and Situation.</hi> This is sometimes abbreviated into <hi
                    rend="italic">The going out of a Curious Man to explore the Regions of the
                    Globe</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and sometimes merely <hi rend="italic">The
                    going out of a Curious Man.</hi> Sionita published it under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Relaxation of the Curious Mind</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">Nubian Geography,</hi> which he and his companion
                    imposed upon it, though it has become general in Europe, is, as already
                    observed, altogether arbitrary.</p>
                <p>The work contains a full description of the whole world, as far as it was known
                    to the author, with its countries, cities, and all its features, physical and
                    political. These are arranged, not according to any of the methods to which we
                    are accustomed, but in a manner peculiar to itself. The world is divided into
                    seven <hi rend="italic">climates,</hi> commencing at the equinoctial line, and
                    extending northwards to the limit at which the earth is supposed to be rendered
                    uninhabitable by cold. Each climate is then divided by perpendicular lines into
                    eleven equal parts, beginning with the western coast of Africa, and ending with
                    the eastern coast of Asia. The whole world is thus formed into seventy-seven
                    equal square compartments, resembling those upon a chess-board, or those formed
                    upon a plane map, by the intersecting lines of latitude and longitude. The
                    geographer begins with the first part of the first climate, including the
                    western part of Central Africa, and proceeds eastward through the different
                    divisions of this climate, till he finds its termination in the Sea of China. He
                    then returns to the first part of the second climate, and so proceeds till he
                    reaches the eleventh part of the seventh climate, which terminates in the
                    north-eastern extremity of Asia. The inconveniences of such an arrangement must
                    be abundantly obvious. Instead of each country, or at least each region of
                    similar physical character, being described by itself, it is severed by these
                    mechanical sections into fragments, which are described in different and distant
                    parts of the work; and no connected view is given of any great country.</p>
                <p>The only valuable unpublished manuscripts of Edrisi which now exist in Europe are
                    two which are preserved in the Bodleian Library. The first, which was brought
                    over from Egypt by Greaves, is written in the Arabic character peculiar to
                    Northern Africa. It is illustrated by a map of the known world, and by
                    thirty-three other maps, containing each part of a climate, so that there are
                    maps only for the first three climates. The second manuscript, brought by
                    Pococke from Syria, is written in the Arabic character, as used in that country,
                    and bears the date of 906 of the Hegira, or <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi>
                    1500. It consists of 320 leaves, and is illustrated by one general and
                    seventy-seven particular maps, the last consequently including all the parts of
                    every climate. The general map has been published by Dr Vincent in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Periplus</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Erythreean Sea.</hi></p>
                <p>There is a manuscript (Cod. DLXXX) in the Royal Library at Paris, which professes
                    to be the production of Edrisi; but D’Herbelot, it appears, has not made use of
                    it as such; and De Guignes expresses positive disbelief on the subject.
                    Hartmann, however, found it to coincide in many particulars with the geography
                    of Edrisi. A copy of our author’s work was contained at one time in the library
                    of the Escurial, but it was destroyed by a great fire in the year 1671.</p>
                <p>The geography of Edrisi, in the original Arabic, was printed at Rome in 1592, at
                    the Medicean press, from a manuscript preserved in the grand-ducal library at
                    Florence. Both the paper and printing are exceedingly neat, the latter being
                    made to resemble manuscript. This unfortunately constitutes the whole merit of
                    the edition, which swarms with typographical errors, and forms, besides, only an
                    epitome of the original work. This epitome seems made, indeed, in the oriental
                    style, by the simple omission of those parts which appeared to the editor to be
                    superfluous; but these comprise many essential and important passages. The
                    description of Mecca, for example, which had been unaccountably omitted, is
                    supplied by Pococke from his manuscript. Hartmann gives instances where
                    reference is made to the description of places of which there occurs no other
                    mention. D’Herbelot and Casiri equally remark the imperfections of this edition;
                    and the information obtained by the writer of this article, at Oxford, as to the
                    result of a comparison between it and the manuscripts in that university, tends
                    entirely to confirm their statements. In most bibliographical works, this
                    impression has been characterized as one of the rarest of books; but Adler, in a
                    visit to Florence, found in the palace there 1129 copies, which were publicly
                    exposed to sale at a moderate rate. If, therefore, the book be wanting, even in
                    many extensive public libraries, it is merely because those libraries have not
                    taken the trouble to procure it.</p>
                <p>In 1619, two oriental scholars, Gabriel Sionita and John Hezronita, published at
                    Paris a Latin translation of Edrisi’s work, bearing the title, as already
                    observed, of <hi rend="italic">Geographia</hi><hi rend="italic">Nubiensis.</hi>
                    It is not executed with all that care and accuracy which might have been
                    expected from these learned personages. They have been particularly careless as
                    to the proper names, which are given sometimes in Latin, sometimes in Arabic,
                    sometimes in neither, nor in any intelligible language. In consequence of the
                    Arabic<pb break="no" facs="nls:193328764" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8764-0433"/>
                    original being occasionally appended, it has been supposed to have been
                    reprinted along with it; but this is a mistake, there being no edition ever
                    printed except the Roman one. George Hieronymus Velschius, an eminent German
                    scholar, had prepared a copy of the Arabic origi- ∙ nal, with a Latin
                    translation, which he intended to have illustrated with notes; but death
                    prevented the execution of this design, and his manuscript remains deposited in
                    the library of the university of Jena. Casiri <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Bibliotheca</hi><hi rend="italic">ArabicoHispanica,</hi> ii. 13) mentions
                    that, at the request of many friends, he had determined to re-edit this work,
                    but he appears never to have executed this intention. The part relating to
                    Africa, pre-eminent certainly in point of importance, has been very ably edited
                    by Hartmann, professor of oriental languages at Marburg (Edrisi, <hi
                    rend="italic">Africa,</hi> Göttingen, 1796). Instead of following the awkward
                    division into climates, he has collected together all the notices relating to
                    each particular country, and has annexed the statements of the countrymen and
                    contemporaries of Edrisi, so that his work forms nearly a complete body of
                    Arabian geography, as far as relates to Africa. <hi rend="smallcaps"
