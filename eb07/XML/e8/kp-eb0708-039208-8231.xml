                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">EBERHARD, <hi rend="smallcaps">John Augustus</hi></label>, an
                    eminent German theologian and philosopher, was born at Halberstadt, in Lower
                    Saxony, on the 31st of August 1739. His father was the singing-master at the
                    church of St Martin’s in that town, and also teacher of the school of the same
                    name; a man, it is said, of a lively disposition, and considerable literary
                    attainments. Young Eberhard was educated partly at home and partly in the school
                    above mentioned. In the seventh year of his age he repaired to the University of
                    Halle, with the view of prosecuting his theological studies. Towards the end of
                    the year 1759 he returned to his native town, and became tutor to the eldest son
                    of the Baron Von der Horst, to whose family he attached himself for a number of
                    years. In the year 1763 he was appointed con-rector of the school of St
                    Martin’s, and second preacher in the Hospital Church of the Holy Ghost; but he
                    soon afterwards resigned these offices, and followed his patron to Berlin.</p>
                <p>The advantages be enjoyed, in this family, of being introduced into the best
                    company, tended to polish his manners, and to form, even at an early period, a
                    style of writing which served as a model to many of his contemporaries. His
                    residence at Berlin gave him an opportunity of extending his knowledge, and of
                    cultivating the acquaintance of some of the most eminent literary characters in
                    Germany. Amongst these were Nicholai and Mendelssohn, with whom he associated
                    upon terms of intimate friendship.</p>
                <p>In the year 1768 he accepted the situation of preacher or chaplain to the
                    work-house at Berlin, along with that of preacher in the neighbouring fishing
                    village of Stralow. The income from these livings was small; but his object was
                    to continue at Berlin, and he had at the same time the promise of further
                    preferment upon the first vacancy. He now applied, with renewed ardour, to the
                    study of theology, philosophy, and history; and the first fruits of his talents
                    and application soon appeared in his <hi rend="italic">New Apology of
                    Socrates;</hi> a work exhibiting such originality of thought and eloquence of
                    style as at once established his character as a writer. This work was occasioned
                    by an attack which was made on the sentiments contained in the fifteenth chapter
                    of Marmontel’s <hi rend="italic">Belisarius,</hi> by one Peter Hofstede, a
                    clergyman of Rotterdam, who, with a contemptible industry, raked up the vices of
                    the most celebrated characters in the pagan world, and even went so far as to
                    maintain that the most virtuous amongst the heathen were no fit objects of
                    divine mercy. He seemed particularly desirous to blacken the character of
                    Socrates; and from this circumstance Eberhard was induced to give to his work
                    the title which we have mentioned above. The greater part of it is occupied with
                    an investigation of some of those peculiar doctrines which have been admitted as
                    dogmas of the Christian church, upon the authority of some of the early fathers;
                    and an examination of those texts of Scripture upon which they are founded. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Apology</hi> itself, which constitutes but a small part of the
                    book, is esteemed a masterpiece of clear, dignified, and persuasive eloquence.
                    The whole work exhibits much reading and philosophical reflection; but the
                    liberality of his reasoning gave great offence to many of the strictly orthodox
                    divines of his time, and is believed to have obstructed his preferment in the
                    church.</p>
                <p>In the year 1774 he was appointed to the living of Charlottenburg; and he
                    employed the leisure he had in this situation in publishing a second volume of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Apology;</hi> in which he not only endeavours to obviate
                    some objections which were taken to the former part, but continues his inquiries
                    into the doctrines of the Christian religion, religious toleration, and the
                    proper rules for interpreting the Scriptures. Perceiving that his further
                    promotion in the church would be attended with difficulty he resolved, although
                    reluctantly, to accept the situation of professor of philosophy at the
                    University of Halle <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328244"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-8244-0393"/>which became vacant in 1778, by the death of G. F.
                    Moier. But however excellent as a writer, and however just his ideas upon
                    philosophical subjects, he does not appear to have been peculiarly qualified to
                    excel as a teacher. He was highly esteemed, indeed, both by professors and
                    students; but his lectures, although they attracted at first a considerable
                    concourse, never acquired any degree of popularity. He continued, however, to
                    lecture very regularly; and published several manuals for the use of nis
                    pupils.</p>
                <p>On his arrival at Halle, the philosophical faculty presented him with a diploma
                    as doctor in philosophy and master of arts. In 1786 he was admitted a member of
                    the Berlin Academy of Sciences; and in 1805 the king of Prussia conferred upon
                    him the honorary title of a privy councillor. In 1808 he obtained the degree of
                    doctor in divinity, which was given him as a reward for his theological
                    writings. He married in 1778, but had no children. He died on the 6th of January
                    1809, being then in the seventieth year of his age.</p>
                <p>Eberhard’s attainments in philosophy and literature were extensive and profound.
                    He was master of the learned languages, spoke and wrote French with facility and
                    correctness, and understood English, Italian, and Dutch. He had read a great
                    deal, was thoroughly versed in the philosophical sciences, and possessed a just
                    and discriminating taste for the fine arts. He was a great lover of music, and
                    was himself a proficient in that science. His manners were mild and unassuming;
                    and his amiable and cheerful disposition, no less than his talents and virtues,
                    endeared him to a numerous circle of friends.</p>
                <p>The following is a list of his works:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Neue Apologie</hi><hi rend="italic">des Socrates,</hi> &lt;⅛c.
                    2 vols. 8vo. The first volume was published in 1772, the second in 1778; both
                    have been since republished.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Allgemeine Theorie des Denkens und Empfindens,</hi> &amp;c.
                    Berlin, 1776, 8vo. This essay obtained the prize assigned by the Royal Society
                    of Berlin for that year. A new edition appeared in 1786.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Von dem Begriff der Philosophie und ihren Theilen,</hi> Berlin,
                    1778, 8vo. A short essay, in which he announced the plan of his lectures on
                    being appointed to the professorship at Halle.</p>

                    Berlin, 1782, 8vo. This work was written with the view of counteracting the
                    influence of those sceptical and Epicurean principles in religion and morals
                    which were then so prevalent in France, and thence rapidly spreading amongst the
                    higher ranks in Germany. It is composed with great elegance and perspicuity, and
                    exhibits much philosophical reflection, and knowledge of the world. The story is
                    simple, and seems to have been merely intended as a vehicle for the
                    sentiments.</p>

                    Halle and Leipsic, 1795-1802, 6 vols. 8vo. This is esteemed a classical work on
                    the Synonymes of the German Language. An abridgment of it was published by ' the
                    author in one large volume 8vo. Halle, 1802.</p>

                <p>Besides the works above mentioned, Eberhard contributed a number of small tracts
                    and essays to various periodical and scientific publications, and translated
                    several foreign works. He was also the editor of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Magazine,</hi> Halle, 1788-1792, and of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Archives,</hi> Halle, 1793-1795. These two periodical works,
                    which are now little read, were instituted for the purpose of controverting the
                    metaphysical principles of Kant, and of vindicating the doctrines of Leibnitz
                    and Wolf.</p>
                <p>Frederick Nicoai published a Memoir on the life and character of Eberhard, Berlin
