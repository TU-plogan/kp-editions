                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">EMERSON, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>, an
                    eminent mathematician, was born on the 14th May 1701, at Hurworth, a village
                    about three miles south of Darlington; at least it is certain that he resided
                    here from his childhood. His father Dudley Emerson taught a school, and was a
                    tolerable proficient in mathematics; and without his books and instructions,
                    perhaps his son’s genius, though eminently fitted for mathematical
                    disquisitions, would have never been unfolded. The latter was instructed in the
                    learned languages by a young clergyman, then curate of Hurworth, who was boarded
                    at his father’s house. In the earlier part of his life he attempted to teach a
                    few scholars’; but, whether from his concise method of explaining his ideas, in
                    which he was not happy, or from the warmth of his natural temper, he made no
                    progress in his school; he therefore soon left it off, and, satisfied with a
                    moderate competence left him by his parents, he devoted himself to a studious
                    retirement. Towards the close of the year 1781, being sensible of his
                    approaching dissolution, he disposed of the whole of his mathematical library to
                    a bookseller at York; and on the 20th of May 1782 he died of a lingering and
                    painful disorder, at his native village, in the eighty-first year of his
                    age.</p>
                <p>Mr Emerson in his person was rather short, but strong and well made, with an open
                    countenance and ruddy complexion. He was exceedingly singular in his dress and
                    manners, and his appearance, which was rather clownish, if not boorish, did not
                    bespeak the man of science; but his eccentricities were more than atoned for by
                    the uncompromising independence of his character, and by the possession of
                    strong natural parts, of which he has left ample evidence in his writings. He
                    always walked up to London when he had any thing to publish, and revised it
                    sheet by sheet himself. It was a favourite maxim with him to trust no eyes but
                    his own. He never advanced any mathematical proposition which he had not first
                    tried in practice, constantly making all the different parts himself on a small
                    scale, so that his house was filled with all kinds of mechanical instruments
                    together or disjointed. Fishing was a diversion which he was remarkably fond of,
                    and while engaged in it he would frequently stand up to his middle in water. He
                    used to study incessantly for some time, and then seek relaxation by taking a
                    ramble to any potale-house where he could get any body to drink with and talk
                    to. The Duke of Manchester was highly pleased with his company, and used often
                    to come to him in the fields and accompany him home, but could never persuade
                    him to get into a carriage. He was a married man, and his wife used to spin on
                    an old-fashioned wheel, of which a very accurate drawing is given in his
                    Mechanics. He was deeply skilled in the science of music, the theory of sounds,
                    and the various scales both ancient and modern, but as a performer he had
                    nothing to boast of.</p>
