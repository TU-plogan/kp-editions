                <p><label type="entry">ELBA</label>, an island of the Mediterranean, separated by a
                    narrow channel from the western coast of Italy. It is situated in long. 10. 9.
                    24. E. and lat. 42. 49. 6. N. In length it is about eighteen miles, and its
                    greatest breadth is about ten miles. The area may be stated at about 154 square
                    miles.</p>
                <p>Elba is supposed to have been first peopled by a colony of Etruscans; but it was
                    afterwards occupied by a body of the Greeks who founded Marseilles. It
                    subsequently fell under the dominion of Carthage, and was taken by the Romans
                    during the first Punic war. In the second, Elba supplied iron for naval and
                    military purposes, and was considered as one of the states which had saved the
                    republic. In the contest between Sylla and Marius, the adherents of the latter
                    fled thither for refuge, and Elba became thus involved in prescription and
                    devastation, from the effects of which it never recovered under the Roman
                    dominion. In modern timeβ it became attached to the commercial republic of Pisa,
                    under the auspices of which it rose to a comparatively flourishing state. On the
                    annex- ∙ation of Pisa to Milan, Elba, with Pianosa, Monte Cristo, Piombino, and
                    other territories, was formed into a little principality, which continued for
                    about two centuries in the hands of Gherardo d’Apiano and his successors; though
                    it was repeatedly occupied as a military station by Charles V. and his ally, the
                    grand duke of Tuscany. Being thus involved in the wars of that monarch with the
                    Porte and the Barbary states, Elba became exposed to the incursions <pb

                    the Turkish corsairs. It was laid waste with fire and sward, once by Barbarossa,
                    and twice by Dragut, and it has never fully recovered from these ravages. Under
                    Philip III. it fell into the possession of Spain, and that prince ordered the
                    construction of Porto Longo, which proved a barrier against the incursions of
                    the corsairs. Several transferences afterwards took place, the result of which
                    was, that after 1735 the king of Naples had possession of Porto Longo, and the
                    grand duke of Tuscany of Porto Ferrajo. Elba continued in this state till the
                    French revolution, when it first became part of the kingdom of Etruria, and was
                    then annexed to France. It afterwards attracted a remarkable degree of attention
                    by becoming the temporary residence of Napoleon Bonaparte. Upon his second
                    downfall, Elba was ceded to the grand duke of Tuscany.</p>
                <p>The island of Elba is entirely filled with mountains, which are formed into three
                    distinct clusters, separated by a valley, which widens as it approaches the sea.
                    The highest are those situated on the western part of the island, the pinnacle
                    of which, called Monte Capanna, rises upwards of 3000 feet above the level of
                    the sea. The greater part of these hills present an arid, rugged, and often
                    ruinous aspect; but a few are embellished with myrtles, laurels, wild olives,
                    and other verdant shrubs. The western part is almost entirely composed of
                    granite, which forms also the basis of the soil in this quarter of the island.
                    Rock crystal abounds, and is often found in large masses, but somewhat injured
                    in its transparency, and, when combined with alum and slate, it produces
                    numerous varieties of calcedony, particularly that called <hi rend="italic"
                    >cachalong.</hi> The eastern mountains are composed of serpentine and schistus,
                    and abound with aluminous mixtures; but they are chiefly distinguished by the
                    iron which they contain.</p>
                <p>Except husbandry, which is wholly that of the spade or the hoe, the chief
                    employment of the inhabitants consists in mining, and iron is the chief article
                    of exchange.</p>
                <p>The population in 1778 was estimated at 8000, but it has since risen to 13,500
                    souls. The Elbese are a race differing in many respects from that which inhabits
                    the continent of Italy. They are well made and robust, and often attain a great
                    age without experiencing ailment or infirmity. They are brave, active, hardy,
                    laborious, and at the same time kind-hearted and hospitable. They are, however,
                    very irritable, and impatient of contradiction. They are almost universally
                    ignorant and credulous, yet have a certain liveliness of imagination, which
                    renders them fond of extravagant and romantic tales. The females are not in
                    general handsome, but to this there are some exceptions; they are generally
                    virtuous, however, and make good wives and mothers.</p>
                <p>The principal town is Porto Ferrajo, which contains a population of 3000 souls.
                    The houses are small and inconvenient. Porto Longo is a well-fortified town,
                    with an agreeable and picturesque neighbourhood, and contains 1500 inhabitants.
                    Rio is poor, and is only supported by the great iron mine which is situated in
                    its neighbourhood; its population amounts to about 1800 souls. Other villages
                    and districts are Capo Liveri, Campo, and Marciano.</p>
