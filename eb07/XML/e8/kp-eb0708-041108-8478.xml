                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Edinburgh,</hi> a city, the capital of Scotland, and chief
                    town of Mid-Lothian, or Edinburghshire, is situated within two miles of the
                    south shore of the Frith of Forth, at the distance of about 392 miles north from
                    London, in 55. 57. 20. north latitude, and 3. 10. 30. west longitude· The
                    situation of this ancient city is exceedingly romantic. It occupies a congeries
                    of hills and elevated grounds, rising gradually from the shore of the Forth, and
                    attaining in some parts to a considerable height above the level of the sea. The
                    central elevation, which has been compared to nothing so aptly as a wedge lying
                    flat upon the ground, is terminated at its highest or western extremity by a
                    mass of rock, seven acres in superficies at top, and about two hundred and fifty
                    feet above the surrounding country; on which stands Edinburgh Castle, the
                    nucleus of the city. From the castle, along the descending slope towards the
                    east, and for a mile in length, the original, or, as it is now called, Old Town,
                    was built in the shape of a spacious street. In latter times, the city, by means
                    of bridges, was extended to the grounds on the south and north.</p>
                <p>The etymology of the name Edinburgh is obscurely but certainly found in the
                    history of its origin. Subse<pb break="no" facs="nls:193328491"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-8491-0412"/>quently to the year 449, or the era of Anglo-Saxon
                    dominion in Lothian, the Castle became the occasional residence of the chiefs of
                    the Northumbrian dynasty; and from Edwin, the potent king of the territory, the
                    appellation <hi rend="italic">Edwin’s burgh</hi> was introduced. At a period
                    coeva with or preceding the era of Edwin, the name applied to the fort was <hi
                    rend="italic">Mai-din</hi> in British, or <hi rend="italic">Magh-dun</hi> in
                    Gaelic which may either signify the fortified mount in the plain, or the good
                    fort; but when the English language came inte use, some busy fancies conceived
                    that <hi rend="italic">Mai-din</hi> was the same as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Maiden,</hi> and hence arose the title which it obtains in old writings, of <hi
                    rend="italic">Castrum Puellarum,</hi> the castle of maidens, and the fable that
                    it had been the residence of the daughters of the British kings. The origin of
                    Edinburgh can now with tolerable accuracy be traced to the beginning of the
                    seventh century, or the era of Edwin, from which period it gradually though
                    slowly increased in size. In the year 856 it is described as a considerable
                    village; and, with the castle, it was often the object of contest in the wars
                    which took place between its Anglo-Saxon possessors and the natives of Scotland.
                    From the period of the cession of Lothian to the Scots, in 1020, the Castle
                    continued to be the frequent residence of their monarchs; and here the widowed
                    consort of Malcolm Ceanmore, the pious and worthy Margaret, died in the year
                    1093. In the reign of David I. the Castle continued a royal residence, and the
                    town increased so much as to be considered one of the four chief burghs in the
                    kingdom. Soon after his accession the munificent David founded the Abbey of
                    Holyrood, on the plain at the eastern extremity of the rising ground on which
                    Edinburgh was built. On the canons of this abbey he conferred the privilege of
                    building a suburb westward from their church, along the ridge, in order to meet
                    the burgh; and the new town thus reared by the monks received from them the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">Canonsburgh,</hi> or popularly <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canongate,</hi> which title the eastern part of the old city still retains. For
                    a considerable period after the reign of David, the houses of Edinburgh were all
                    thatched with straw; but it nevertheless rose into importance, and in the
                    twelfth century it was constituted a royal burgh by William I. surnamed the
                    Lion.</p>
                <p>The death of Alexander, king of Scotland, proved fatal to Edinburgh. In June 1291
                    the town and castle were surrendered to Edward I.; but in 1313 they were
                    recovered by assault, under the conduct of Randolph earl of Moray, and the
                    castle was destroyed. The English again took and repaired the castle under
                    Edward III., who resided there and placed a strong garrison in it. In 1337 the
                    castle, still in the custody of the English, was besieged by Sir Andrew Moray,
                    the guardian of Scotland, though without success; and it was only by an
                    ingenious stratagem, employed by Sir William Douglas, in 1361, that the fortress
                    was secured by the Scottish patriots. I</p>
                <p>From the era of the murder of James I. at Perth, in 1436-37, the origin of
                    Edinburgh as a national capital may be dated. Neither Perth nor Scone, Stirling
                    nor Dunfermline, being able to secure royalty against the designs of the
                    nobility, Edinburgh and its castle were therefore selected as the only places of
                    safety for the royal household and the functionaries of government. The infant
                    sovereign was crowned in the chapel of Holyrood, in which sat the first
                    parliament of his reign. James II. was particularly attached to Edinburgh, and
                    bestowed on it a variety of grants as to the holding of fairs and markets, the
                    levying of customs, and also rights to property. Besides, in 1450, he conferred
                    upon the city the pre-eminent privilege of erecting walls and bulwarks for its
                    defence. Throughout the turbulent reign of James III. Edinburgh was the seat of
                    the court and regular parliament; and this king conferred additional immunities
                    upon the city, especially one assigning sites for certain markets, which to the
                    present day partly continue in the places thus fixed upon. I On account of the
                    loyalty of the people in assisting him against Edward IV. he moreover granted
                    the inhabitants I a banner, with power to display the same in defence of i their
                    king, their country, and their own rights. This flag, , which is still esteemed
                    a sort of palladium of the city, is called from its colour the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Blue Blanket,</hi> and remains in i the custody of the convener of the trades.
                    In 1497 Edinburgh being visited by a loathsome distemper, imported i from
                    abroad, the king by a proclamation ordered the magistracy to put out of the town
                    all infected persons, who, in order to free the city, were transported by boats
                    to the island of Inchkeith in the Frith of Forth, which thus served as a
                    lazar-house for the time. James III., in his latter years, made Edinburgh Castle
                    the repository of his treasure, valuable effects, and ordnance. In 1488, when;
                    this prince was murdered near Stirling, the whole fell into the hands of his
                    rebellious subjects.</p>
                <p>The first parliament of James IV. was held at Edinburgh; and in 1503, on the
                    marriage of this prince with Margaret, the eldest daughter of Henry VII. of
                    England, it was the scene of a gorgeous royal pageant, which is fully recounted
                    by the historians of the time. In 1508 the king empowered the town to let the
                    grounds of the Boroughmuir on the south; but the citizens were no sooner in
                    possession of this grant, than they set about clearing the ground of its wood,
                    and so many trees were cut down that they could not be disposed of; wherefore
                    the magistrates enacted, that whosoever should buy as much as would form a new
                    front to a house, might extend the same seven feet farther into the street. In
                    consequence of this preposterous edict, Edinburgh was in a short time filled
                    with houses of wood instead of stone, and the principal street was reduced
                    fourteen feet in breadth. The year 1513 was the epoch of a dreadful plague, and
                    also of the great national calamity, the defeat at Flodden. With James perished
                    the magistrates and many of the burgesses; the privy council removed to Stirling
                    for safety; the walls of the city were greatly extended to the south, and better
                    fortified; and at the same time, 1514, the corporation of the burgh raised the
                    civic military corps called the town guard, which remained in force till the
                    year 1817.</p>
                <p>Throughout the minority of James V. the capital was the constant scene of
                    tumults, especially one between the Hamiltons or Arran’s party, and the
                    Douglasses or party of Angus, which is known in history by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Clear the Causeway.</hi> May 1532 is the era of the greatest event
                    in the annals of the Scottish metropolis. This was the establishment of the
                    College of Justice, or series of supreme courts and their functionaries. The
                    city now became a place of resort from all parts of the kingdom; and the
                    magistrates for the first time had the High Street repaired and paved, and gave
                    orders to the citizens to light it. In 1538 the town was the scene of
                    rejoicings, on the entrance into the city of James, with his wife Mary of
                    Guise.</p>
                <p>In 1544 the regency having refused to ally the young Queen Mary to the son of
                    Henry VIII., an English fleet and army were sent to ravage Scotland; and in
                    prosecution of this object the Earl of Hertford landed with a force near Leith,
                    and set fire to the city in several places. In 1548 Edinburgh was garrisoned by
                    French troops under D’Esse, who prevented the English from committing any
                    further serious damage.</p>
                <p>Disturbances consequent on the change of religion in Scotland broke out in 1556,
                    at which time a concourse of people assembled to protect John Knox from the
                    violence of the ecclesiastical judicatory. During the struggle which ensued in
                    effecting the reformation, Edinburgh formed the chief position of the reformers,
                    as Leith was of the French <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328504"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-8504-0413"/>and Catholic party. By the assistance of a
                    Protestant army sent by Queen Elizabeth, the reformers were finally triumphant,
                    and the first assembly of the reformed kirk met at Edinburgh on the 15th of
                    January 1560.</p>
                <p>A new object of excitement soon appeared in the person of Mary, the young queen
                    of Scots, who on the 9th of August 1561 arrived at Leith from France. On the 1st
                    of September she made her public entry into the city. Darnley was proclaimed
                    king at the market-cross in July 1565, and next morning was married to the queen
                    in the chapel of Holyrood. In June following the queen was delivered of a son,
                    afterwards James VI.; and in February 1567 Darnley was blown up by gunpowder in
                    a house at the Kirk of the Field, on the site of which the college now stands.
                    Mary’s marriage with Bothwell occasioned fresh disturbances in Edinburgh; and
                    during the period of the irregular warfare which ensued between the king’s and
                    queen’s parties, the city suffered very severely. At length the young king
                    himself entered upon public life, and on the 17th of October 1579 arrived in the
                    metropolis with a cavalcade of two thousand horse, and held his first parliament
                    in person. In the year following, the Earl of Morton was beheaded in Edinburgh,
                    by an instrument called the <hi rend="italic">Maiden,</hi> which he had himself
                    introduced, and which is now preserved in the Museum of the Society of
                    Antiquaries. The character of the city was about this period greatly improved by
                    the erection of the college, which was commenced in 1581, and its first
                    professor appointed in 1583. The infatit institution was warmly patronized by
                    King James, who, on the occasion of a temporary visit which he made to Scotland
                    in 1617, desired that it should thenceforth be called King James’ College. In
                    1585-86 the city was visited by the plague, and suffered severely from that
                    affliction. In 1591 the city was alarmed by an attempt of the Earl of Bothwell
                    to <hi rend="italic">seize</hi> upon the person of the king in Holyrood Palace.
                    The attempt, however, was defeated by the promptitude and vigour of the
                    citizens. Bothwell himself escaped, but eight of his followers were taken and
                    put to death on the following day. In 1596 the clergy and citizens united in
                    tumultuary resistance to an attempt made by the king to control the language of
                    the pulpit. Unable to subdue or restrain the insurrectionary spirit which he had
                    excited, James withdrew from the town, and ordered all the public courts to be
                    removed from it. A reconciliation, however, soon afterwards took place, and the
                    offended monarch returned peaceably to his capital. In 1599 the first regular
                    dramatists appeared in Edinburgh. They were from England, and there is some
                    reason to suppose that the immortal Shakspeare was amongst the number.</p>
                <p>Three years after this the regal dignity of Scotland became extinct, or rather
                    merged in that of England. On the 24th of March 1603, James was called to the
                    throne of the sister kingdom. Two days before his departure, he addressed the
                    citizens in St Giles’ Church, promising them a continuation of his countenance,
                    and expressing the regret which he felt at leaving them. Amongst the marks of
                    royal favour with which James visited Scotland after his accession to the throne
                    of England, was his empowering the magistrates of Edinburgh, in 1609, to have a
                    sword of state carried before them, and to wear gowns; this, it is believed,
                    being the earliest appearance of magisterial robes in Scotland. In 1617 James
                    paid a long-promised visit to his native country. He entered Edinburgh by the
                    West Port, and was conducted through the city with great pomp, and every
                    demonstration of rejoicing. On the 28th of June he convened his twenty-second
                    parliament at Edinburgh. In this assembly there were several remarkable acts
                    passed, and amongst these one for the restitution of archbishops, bishops, and
                    chapterj. Four years after this, namely, in 1621, an act of the estates and town
                    council was passed for coping houses with lead, slates, or tiles, instead of
                    thatch, which had hitherto been the covering commonly employed. In the same year
                    water was introduced by pipes into the city; and three new bells were imported
                    from Campvere in Holland, two for St Giles' Church, and one for the Netherbow
                    Port.</p>
                <p>Edinburgh seems to have enjoyed uninterrupted tranquillity during the remaining
                    period of King James’s reign. When he died, in 1625, the ministers of the city
                    eulogised him as the “most religious and peaceable prince that ever was in this
                    unworthy world.” After the accession of Charles to the throne, which was
                    proclaimed at the cross by the officers of state, a convention was held; and the
                    town council, in consequence of certain ships of war being wanted, and forts for
                    securing the coasts, not only agreed to advance the assessment when called upon,
                    but also to contribute towards the maintenance of 10,000 men. Some time
                    afterwards, a subsidy for four years having, at the king’s desire, been granted
                    by parliament, the inhabitants of Edinburgh generously advanced at once their
                    quota, amounting to L.40,000 Scots. For these acts of kindness his majesty
                    expressed his gratitude, by sending a sword and gown to be worn by the provost
                    in the manner appointed by his father. Like his father, too, Charles resolved to
                    visit his native country, and though prevented for some years from fulfilling
                    his design, he at last accomplished it in 1633. He was received by the
                    inhabitants with much pomp, and the celebrated Drummond of Hawthornden was
                    appointed to address him on his arrival, which he did with all the
                    characteristic poetical embellishment peculiar to the times. On the 18th of
                    June, Charles was crowned in the Abbey Church of Holyrood, and on the 20th he
                    assembled his first Scottish parliament in the Tolbooth. During his residence in
                    the city on this occasion, Charles erected the bishopric of Edinburgh, a measure
                    which was by no means popular, and gave rise throughout the country to a series
                    of civil disturbances, the principal focus of which seems to have been
                    Edinburgh. During the civil war in 1640, the magistrates fortified the town
                    against the castle, and disciplined the citizens. The governor, on perceiving
                    these demonstrations of hostility, fired upon the city; but being soon
                    afterwards invested by General Leslie, he was compelled to surrender from want
                    of provisions.</p>
                <p>Charles visited the city a second time in 1641, and was received and entertained
                    by the magistrates with the utmost deference and respect. A parliament met on
                    the 15th of July, the result of whose proceedings was an entire change in the
                    government, Charles retaining only the name of king, and the kingdom the
                    appearance only of a monarchy. He agreed to an act of oblivion, by which his
                    opponents were pardoned at the expense of his friends; and after a residence of
                    four months in the northern metropolis, he returned to London, having entrusted
                    his Scottish affairs to a committee of the estates. Two years after this, in the
                    month of July, the Solemn League and Covenant for the extirpation of prelacy was
                    signed in the High Church; and shortly afterwards the city raised and supported
                    a regiment of twelve hundred men, to assist the English parliamentary forces
                    against Charles, at a cost of L.60,000 Scottish money. For this and several
                    other acts of hostility to the king, the town was in 1645 threatened with a
                    visit from the Marquis of Montrose; but it was saved from this disaster by the
                    presence of another. This was the plague, which committed great ravages amongst
                    its population. It was, however, the last visit which this dreadful scourge paid
                    to the metropolis. Shortly after this (such were the changes of these eventful
                    times), the city borrowed L.40,000 Scots to raise troops for the national <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193328517" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8517-0414"/> engagement in
                    favour of Charles. This debt they afterwards refused to pay, on the plea that it
                    was contracted in an unlawful cause. The impartial justice of Cromwell, however,
                    subsequently compelled them in 1652 to refund the money. In May 1650 the Marquis
                    of Montrose was conveyed a prisoner into Edinburgh. Three days afterwards he was
                    brought to trial, condemned to death, and suffered on a gallows erected at the
                    cross. Two months subsequently Charles II. was proclaimed on the same spot; and
                    in the end of September following, the town was in the possession of Cromwell.
                    On this occasion the magistrates fled to Stirling, then the head-quarters of the
                    king’s forces. The town was thus left without any other civic rulers than that
                    of a body of thirty citizens, chosen by the inhabitants to discharge in part the
                    functions of the magistracy, who absented themselves from the 2d of September to
                    the 5th of December 1651. About this period the town council granted liberty to
                    one Adam Woodcock to establish a stage-coach between Edinburgh and Leith; which
                    is amongst the first notices of a public conveyance of the kind in Scotland, and
                    on that account sufficiently remarkable.</p>
                <p>On the 11th of May 1660, the magistrates sent the town-clerk to Charles, who was
                    at Breda, expressing their concurrence in his meditated restoration, already
                    agreed to by both houses of parliament in England, and their joy at the prospect
                    of such an event. Their messenger “had a most gracious acceptance and, in the
                    name of the burgh, presented “a poor myte of L.1000, which he did graciously
                    accept, as though it had been a greater business." The feelings of delight which
                    the arrival of the king in England excited in Edinburgh, were expressed in the
                    customary mode of costly feasting, a sumptuous banquet having been served up by
                    the town council at the cross. This attachment on the part of the citizens was
                    ill requited by Charles, who, in settling the affairs of the kingdom,
                    re-established episcopacy in Scotland, in opposition to the oath and obligation
                    of honour by which he was bound. It is not surprising, therefore, that the
                    Scottish people, so attached to presbyterianism, should have expressed their
                    indignation at his conduct in the most open manner. But when the liberty of the
                    press, and freedom in matters of religion, were in consequence also 6peedily
                    infringed upon, the whole country rose in arms, particularly the western
                    counties. The attempt, however, which was made upon the life of Archbishop Sharp
                    in the streets of Edinburgh led that prelate to advise those milder measures
                    which were soon afterwards adopted by government. In 1679, James, then duke of
                    York, came to reside in Edinburgh, and took up his abode in the Palace of
                    Holyrood, where he remained till May 1682. During this period he rendered
                    himself extremely odious by his opposition to the Covenanters, and by his
                    attempting the revival of the drama, and encouraging other amusements to which
                    the people were exceedingly averse.</p>
                <p>Two years after this, the magistrates set up for the first time a regular state
                    carriage; and were so much pleased with the accommodation and conveniency of
                    this novelty, that they ordered two coaches from London for their own especial
                    use, with the addition of four horses. On the demise of Charles II. in 1685, the
                    town council erected an equestrian statue to him in the Parliament Square, as a
                    proof of their gratitude to and affection for that monarch. Soon after James’
                    accession, the unfortunate Earl of Argyll was brought a prisoner into Edinburgh;
                    and after being ignominiously paraded through the streets, his head was struck
                    off by the Maiden, this being the last time, it is believed, that the instrument
                    was employed. After a series of disturbances and tumultuary proceedings,
                    occasioned by the attempts of James VII. to restore the Roman Catholic religion,
                    a convention of estates was held at Edinburgh, in which it was declared that
                    James had forfeited the crown; a resolution which was followed in March 1689 by
                    an offer thereof to William and Mary.</p>
                <p>The next epoch in the history of Edinburgh is formed by the celebrated Darien
                    expedition in 1696. The intervening period is not without interest, but it
                    exhibits no event of any importance in relation to the city. The occurrences
                    during that time were-wholly of a national character, and are therefore more
                    properly to be looked for in the history of the kingdom. In the famous bubble
                    alluded to, Edinburgh was deeply interested, and was full of the high
                    anticipations which this speculation had diffused throughout Scotland. About
                    L.400,000 sterling were subscribed in the country. Six ships of considerable
                    force and burthen, and laden with various commodities, sailed from the Frith of
                    Forth; and in 1699, when intelligence arrived of the settlement being formed,
                    the rejoicings in Edinburgh were unbounded. On the other hand, the
                    disappointment excited on learning in the following year of its failure, filled
                    the streets for several days with tumult and riot; and the city altogether
                    presented such a scene of lawless anarchy, that the commissioner and officers of
                    state deemed it necessary, for their personal safety, to retire until the
                    popular fury had somewhat abated.</p>
                <p>In 1702 a similar commotion was excited, from an apprehension on the part of the
                    populace that one Captain Green, and his accomplices, four in number, who had
                    been condemned for piracy and murder on the high seas, were, through the
                    connivance of the authorities, to be permitted to escape the consummation of
                    their sentence. The Lord Chancellor, in passing from the privy council in his
                    coach, was attacked at the Tron Church, the glasses were broken, and he himself
                    was dragged from the carriage. He was rescued by some of his friends; but it was
                    found necessary to sacrifice the seamen to the resentment of the populace. The
                    following year was distinguished by its presenting the last exhibition of the
                    ancient Scottish national pageant called the Riding of the Parliament. This
                    parting show took place on the 6th of May 1703. In 1704 the inhabitants of
                    Edinburgh were gratified by a ceremony quite in accordance with the spirit of
                    the age. By an act of the privy council, a large quantity of vestments, beads,
                    chalices, crucifixes, and other appurtenances of Catholic worship, were brought
                    to the cross, and there publicly burnt before the eyes of a delighted
                    populace.</p>
                <p>The tumults to which the city bad been so frequently subject were revived in
                    1707, on the occasion of the proposed union of the kingdoms. This, as is well
                    known, was at first an exceedingly unpopular measure in Scotland; and the
                    consequence was a series of the most violent and outrageous proceedings on the
                    part of the mob, in order to intimidate those members of the Scottish parliament
                    who were favourable to the obnoxious project. The deed, however, was finally
                    accomplished, though not without great danger to the lives of its most active
                    promoters. A small summer house in the Regent Murray’s garden is still pointed
                    out as the place where the last signatures were attached to the document which
                    terminated the independence of Scotland as a separate kingdom.</p>
                <p>In the civil war of 1715 Edinburgh was little further involved than from the
                    circumstance of an unsuccessful attempt made by the Jacobites to surprise the
                    Castle. About this period the provost received a regular salary of L.300 per
                    annum in order to defray his expenses; and in 1718 the scheme which had for some
                    time been framed of extending the pier and building docks at Leith was in part
                    executed; the town’s debts, which even then amounted to L.25,000, being thereby,
                    in the space of five years, nearly doubled.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328530" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8530-0415"/>
                <p>The next occurrence of any importance in the annals of the city, was the
                    celebrated tumult designated the Porteous Mob, which took place in September
                    1736. The accounts of this remarkable affair are so numerous, so easily
                    accessible, and withal in general so full, that it is deemed unnecessary to give
                    more than a mere outline in this place. Porteous, whose name distinguishes the
                    transaction, was captain of the city guard. At the execution of a criminal of
                    the name of Wilson, whose fate had excited an extraordinary sympathy, Porteous,
                    dreading a rescue by the mob, who suddenly became tumultuary, ordered the guard
                    to fire on them. Six people were killed by the discharge, and eleven wounded.
                    For this Porteous was tried and condemned to death; but he was afterwards
                    reprieved by Queen Caroline, then regent. Resolved however that he should not
                    thus escape the fate which they conceived he merited, the mob, on the evening of
                    the day previous to that on which he was to have been executed, broke into the
                    jail in which he was confined, and having dragged him out, led him to the
                    Grassmarket, the usual place of execution at that period, and there hanged him
                    by torch light on a dyer’s pole.</p>
                <p>On the 17th September 1745 Edinburgh was taken possession of by the rebels under
                    Prince Charles Edward. A party of the Highlanders secured the Netherbow port,
                    and thus made themselves masters of the city. The main body of the rebel army
                    arrived shortly afterwards at the King’s Park, headed by the Chevalier in
                    person, who took up his residence in Holyrood, where he held open court, and was
                    visited by great numbers of the inhabitants. The city remained on this occasion
                    in the hands of the rebels till the 31st of October, when, finding it impossible
                    to reduce the castle, they proceeded on their march towards England.</p>
                <p>The public transactions of an historical nature which occurred in the metropolis
                    after these events, are not, except in a few instances, such as to require a
                    particular description. On the 2d of February 1779, an infuriated mob, under the
                    influence of religious fanaticism, burnt one Roman Catholic chapel and plundered
                    another. Twelve years later, on the outbreaking of the revolution in France, a
                    considerable body of the inhabitants manifested their admiration of the new
                    political principles which were then brought so prominently forward, by forming
                    themselves into associations for supporting the cause of political regeneration.
                    These societies, the members of which received the appellation of Friends of the
                    People, at length drew down upon them the notice and vengeance of government.
                    Several persons accused of having been concerned in spreading sedition, and
                    engaged in treasonable practices, were arrested and brought to trial. One of
                    them named Watt, was condemned and beheaded, whilst others were transported.
                    Subsequently, during the war with France, the citizens showed great zeal in
                    support of the government, by forming themselves into regiments of volunteers,
                    consisting of yeomanry, artillery, and several corps of infantry. On the last
                    night of the year 1812, being the season devoted to innocent festivity, the
                    streets of Edinburgh were disgraced by a series of riots, outrages, and
                    robberies, hitherto unparalleled. During almost the whole night, after eleven
                    o’clock, a gang, principally composed of young men, armed with bludgeons and
                    other weapons, infested some of the principal streets of the metropolis, and
                    knocked down, robbed, and otherwise wantonly maltreated almost every person who
                    had the misfortune to fall in their way. In the dreadful tumult and scuffles
                    which ensued, one officer of police was killed and many persons dangerously
                    wounded, some of whom died in consequence, whilst a great number received severe
                    contusions. Several rioters were seized, and being brought to trial, three were
                    condemned and hanged, whilst some others were transported. This fearful
                    outbreaking of juvenile delinquency led to the adoption of several beneficial
                    plans for the better instruction of the lower classes, the benefits of which
                    still continue to be felt.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable event in which Edinburgh was more particularly concerned
                    since that period was the visit of George IV. to Scotland in 1822, when he spent
                    upwards of a fortnight in the metropolis, inspecting its public institutions,
                    and receiving the congratulations of his Scottish subjects. Being the first
                    crowned head that had entered Edinburgh since Charles II. in the year 1650, his
                    late majesty’s visit caused the greatest excitement throughout the country, and
                    produced such an influx of people from the surrounding counties, particularly
                    from the west and north, as never before perhaps took place in Edinburgh. His
                    majesty arrived in Leith Roads on the 14th of August, and landed on the 15th, on
                    which occasion he made a grand progress from Leith through several of the
                    streets of the New Town to the Palace of Holyrood, and thence drove to the Duke
                    of Buccleuch’s house at Dalkeith, where he resided during his stay in Scotland.
                    On the 17th he held a levee in Holyrood Palace, and on the 19th received the
                    addresses of the commission of the Gener^ Assembly of the Church of Scotland.
                    Next day he held a drawing-room, and on the 22d he went in procession from
                    Holyrood House to the Castle. On the 23d he reviewed a body of cavalry on
                    Portobello Sands, and on the same evening attended a ball given in honour of the
                    royal visit by the peers of Scotland. On the 24th his majesty presided at a
                    banquet given by the civic authorities, and on this occasion conferred on Sir
                    William Arbuthnot, then Lord Provost, the honour of baronetcy. On the 26th his
                    majesty attended a ball given by the Caledonian Hunt; on the evening of the 27th
                    he appeared at the theatre; and on the 29th, after a visit at Hopetoun House, he
                    embarked at Port Edgar, near Queensferry, on his return to England.</p>
                <p>In 1824 the city suffered from a series of conflagrations of a most destructive
                    and appalling description. The first of these commenced on the 24th of June,
                    when some of the private dwellings in the Parliament Square, with a part of the
                    High Street, and several closes, were consumed. The second and the most
                    extensive began on the evening of the 15th November, and continued for three
                    days, destroying an immense number of houses, chiefly between the High Street
                    and Cowgate, also several fronting the High Street at the Cross, another portion
                    of the Parliament Square, and likewise the spire of the Tron church, which had
                    accidentally caught fire from the flying brands.</p>
                <p>In no part of the united kingdom was the passing of the reform bill more
                    strenuously insisted upon, or received, when framed into a law, with more
                    heartfelt demonstrations of joy, than it was by the citizens of Edinburgh. The
                    first election of members of parliament under that act took place at the cross
                    on the 2İst of December 1832; and never, except perhaps during the visit of
                    George IV. was such a multitude of people collected upon its streets.</p>
                <p>Edinburgh is surrounded on all sides, excepting on the north, where the ground
                    slopes gently towards the Frith of Forth, by lofty hills. On the east, in the
                    immediate vicinity of the city, are the abrupt and rocky elevations of Arthur’s
                    Seat, Salisbury Crags, and the Caiton Hill, the first of which rises to the
                    height of 800 feet above the level of the sea. On the south are the Braid and
                    Pentland Hills, and on the west the hill of Corstorphine. Salisbury Crags form a
                    continued range of naked and perpendicular cliffs, which rise like a mural crown
                    from the summit of the hill, and at a distance have a singularly wild and
                    romantic appearance, the interest of which is heightened<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193328543" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8543-0416"/> by the contrast of the
                    splendid city over which they tower majestically. The town stands on high and
                    uneven ground, being built on three eminences, which run parallel to one another
                    from east to west. The most elevated of these, on which the city was originally
                    built, is terminated abruptly on the west by a precipitous rock surmounted by
                    the Castle, whilst to the east it gradually inclines to the plain from which
                    rises the lofty elevation of Arthur’s Seat. The valley to the north of this
                    ridge, which was formerly filled with water, has been of late years drained, and
                    is now laid out in public gardens. It still retains, however, its original name
                    of the North Loch.</p>
                <p>Till the middle of the eighteenth century, Edinburgh continued to occupy little
                    more than the same space of ground which it had covered in the reigns of James
                    III. and James IV.; namely, the ridge between the Castle on the west and
                    Holyrood House on the east, with the hollow called the Cowgate on the south, and
                    part of the rising ground beyond. In a great proportion of this Old Town the
                    buildings are crowded and irregular, and the houses in some parts rise to the
                    unusual height of eleven stories. The principal, or High Street, which is
                    somewhat more than a mile in length, and is in some parts ninety feet in
                    breadth, occupies the centre of the ridge, and extends, under different
                    designations, nearly in a straight line from the Castle on the western extremity
                    to the Palace of Holyrood on the eastern. Both sides of the ridge occupied by
                    this street are covered with buildings crowded together in the closest array,
                    and descending from the High Street, chiefly in narrow lanes, or closes as they
                    are termed, which are seldom broader than six feet, and which, consisting of
                    high houses on either side, are inhabited by numerous families, with little
                    regard either to health or cleanliness. A proposal in the reign of Charles II.
                    to extend the town over the lands to the north, beyond the hollow called the
                    North Loch, having been frustrated, nothing was done till 1751, when an old
                    building having fallen, by which one person was killed, a strong feeling
                    regarding the inconvenience and decayed condition of the houses began to be
                    expressed. The first decided step towards extending the city was taken by
                    Provost Drummond, on the 21st of October 1763, when he laid the foundation-stone
                    of what is now styled the North Bridge, in order to connect the town with the
                    properties on the north. This edifice consists of three great central arches,
                    each seventy-two feet in width and sixty-eight in height, with small side
                    arches, making the total length 310 feet. In 1767, whilst this work was
                    proceeding, an act for extending the <hi rend="italic">royalty</hi> was
                    obtained; and a plan for the New Town being then formed by Mr Craig, architect,
                    the foundation of the first house was laid on the 20th of October the same year.
                    By this plan the chief streets of the New Town of Edinburgh were disposed in
                    three parallel lines from east to west; that on the south side, formed like a
                    terrace, and facing the Old Town, being called Princes Street; a similar street
                    facing the north, called Queen Street; and the third, which was named George
                    Street, running up the centre. An elegant square at the west end of George
                    Street, styled Charlotte Square, corresponded to another at its eastern
                    extremity, designated St Andrew Square. Between Princes Street and George Street
                    a narrow street of inferior houses runs along the whole length, and a street of
                    nearly the same appearance is situated between Queen Street and George Street.
                    Seven cross streets, namely, St Andrew, St David, Hanover, Frederick, Castle,
                    Charlotte, and Hope Streets, intersecting these parallel thoroughfares at right
                    angles from south to north, completed the plan. Coeval with the erection of
                    these splendid streets and squares, a lofty street was opened from the extremity
                    of the North Bridge and Princes Street, towards Leith Walk, or main road to
                    Leith, opening an excellent communication with that sea-port. The whole of the
                    new edifices according to Mr Craig’s plan were completed about the year 1815,
                    but the greater part much earlier. Only one serious error was committed by the
                    local authorities in connection with the building of the New Town. This was the
                    formation of a huge mass of earth called the Earthen Mound, which was laid down
                    in the valley of the North Loch, parallel to the North Bridge, and calculated to
                    serve the purpose of a second bridge. It was begun about 1781, out of the
                    accumulation of the rubbish from the excavations of the New Town, and has been
                    recently completed. It is computed to contain upwards of two millions of cart
                    loads, and now serves as a thoroughfare from Hanover Street to the upper part of
                    the Old Town.</p>
                <p>Such was the success attending the building of the New Town, that in time a
                    second extension of the same nature was projected, still farther towards the
                    north, beyond an open area in front of Queen Street. The design of this second
                    town intimately resembled that of its predecessor, consisting of a terraće in
                    front and rear, a large central street, with two intermediate narrow ones, and
                    cross streets in continuation of those in the former New Town. This vast and
                    splendid addition to Edinburgh was commenced in 1801, and was nearly finished in
                    the year 1826. Its central street is entitled Great King Street, and, as in the
                    case of George Street, it is terminated by large open areas: one of these, of an
                    oblong form, is styled Drummond Place; whilst the other, of a circular shape, is
                    called the Royal Circus. Since this portion of the New Town was completed,
                    another extension, still farther towards the north, has been projected, and is
                    now partially built; and between the new streets in this quarter and the sea, a
                    distance of about a mile and a half, are now built a number of isolated villas
                    and ranges of houses, of a similarly elegant style of architecture.</p>
                <p>About the time when the second New Town approached its completion, a series of
                    superb edifices began to be erected on its north-western confines, between
                    Charlotte Square and the Water of Leith, on the property of the Earl of Moray.
                    This magnificent part of Edinburgh was erected during the years Ì823, 1824, and
                    1825. Anopen space called Moray Place forms the chief cluster of buildings, and
                    is considered as the most superb part of the modern extension of the metropolis.
                    To the westward of Charlotte Square and Princes Street another series of
                    beautiful streets and crescents have been erected, chiefly on the lands of
                    Coates. As it is by a road through these new streets that persons from the west
                    of Scotland enter the town, the appearance of so many structures on a scale of
                    uniform splendour almost unrivalled in Britain, seldom fails to excite feelings
                    of delight and admiration. This quarter of the town has latterly been
                    considerably improved by the erection of a magnificent bridge of four arches,
                    stretching across the deep dell or ravine at the bottom of which flows the Water
                    of Leith. This bridge was completed in 1832, and will henceforth serve as the
                    principal entrance to Edinburgh from the north.</p>
                <p>The extension of the New Town to the north and west absorbed public attention
                    till about the year 1813, when the idea was started of opening an entrance from
                    the east. The foundation-stone of a bridge to form a connection with the Calton
                    Hill, styled Regent Bridge, was laid in September 1815, and the work was
                    completed in 1819. The arch of this structure is fifty feet wide, by about the
                    same in height. On the top of the ledges of the bridge are arches and ornamental
                    pillars of the Corinthian order, which on either side are connected with the
                    houses in the line of street formed at the same time. The street, or <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193328556" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8556-0417"/> • Waterloo Place
                    as it has been designated, is composed of very superb houses of four stories,
                    and each is terminated at Princes Street by a pediment and pillars above the
                    lower story. From Waterloo Place, the new road by which most of the vehicles and
                    passengers from the east enter the city, proceeds by a sweep round the southern
                    face of the Calton Hill. The entrance by this thoroughfare is not less
                    commanding and beautiful than that by the west; and the semicircular range of
                    houses forming the Royal and Regent Terraces, lately erected on the slope of the
                    hill, have a very striking effect. From the northern and eastern base of the
                    hill towards Leith, the rudiments of another New Town were simultaneously
                    formed. At present (1833) only a few streets in this quarter have been
                    completed, but these are on a scale not surpassed by many of the modern
                    structures.</p>
                <p>Some years prior to the foundation of the New Town, certain private proprietors
                    began to build lines of houses, of a good style of architecture, on the grounds
                    to the south of the Old Town, and in this way George Square, Argyle Square, and
                    Brown Square were opened for the rece∣&gt;- tion of the higher class of
                    citizens. The erection of these and other edifices soon suggested the necessity
                    of a proper communication between them and the High Street, on the plan of the
                    North Bridge; and on the 1st of August 1785, the foundation-stone of a bridge
                    crossing the Cowgate, styled the South Bridge, was laid, and the thoroughfare
                    opened for passengers in March 1788. The South Bridge consists of twenty-two
                    arches, all of which are concealed by the buildings along its sides, with the
                    exception of one at the centre spanning the Cowgate. In later times the city has
                    spread very considerably towards the south; and beyond the outskirts of the
                    streets in this direction there have been erected towards Newington a variety of
                    neat and beautiful villas, which form the residences generally of the more
                    respectable mercantile classes. Front the period of the erection of the South
                    Bridge in the year 1788, no further improvements took place in this direction,
                    till after the opening of the Union Canal. The formation of this canal, to serve
                    as a water communication with Glasgow, by joining the Forth and Clyde Canal,
                    took place in virtue of an act of parliament procured in 1817 by a joint-stock
                    company. Its eastern termination is about half a mile south-west from the
                    Castle. Here the place of shipment, called Port Hopetoun, has been greatly
                    improved by the erection of various new streets, one of which communicates
                    directly with the west end of Princes Street or the New Town. In order to form
                    an equally direct line of communication with the Old Town, and, generally
                    speaking, that the High Street might be more thrown open to an approach from the
                    southern districts, an act of parliament was procured by the inhabitants in
                    1827, vesting powers in certain individuals called Commissioners of
                    Improvements, to open two lines of approach to the Old Town, one proceeding from
                    the neighbourhood of Port Hopetoun on the south-west, and the other from the
                    district on the south, adjacent to George Square and the open grounds or Meadow
                    Walks in its vicinity. Both lines were calculated to render the destruction of
                    many houses on the Castle Hill and in the Lawnmarket absolutely necessary, as
                    well as to require bridges of an expensive nature; and the outlay for the whole
                    was ordained by the same and by a subsequent act of parliament to be defrayed by
                    assessments upon the inhabitants. These improvements are now (1833) in progress,
                    and when finished will do much to renovate the more ancient part of the capital,
                    as well as to form useful thoroughfares through the town.</p>
                <p>At the present day the city extends about two miles in length and the same in
                    breadth, and presents, when viewed from the Calton Hill, one of the most
                    extraordinary panoramic scenes which can be conceived. On the right are the
                    splendid lines of streets of the New Town, constructed of white sandstone,
                    gradually spread out with a moderate descent towards the flat ornamental grounds
                    adjacent to the sea. In front we have the vista of Princes Street, nearly a mile
                    in length; and on the opposite side of the ravine of the North Loch, now
                    disposed as pleasure-grounds, the huge unbroken line of tall structures forming
                    the Old Town, terminated by the towers of the Castle. Beyond and towards the
                    south, the town is seen to spread out in lines of streets and detached houses,
                    till arrested by the fields and inclosures towards the Braid Hills, or on the
                    east by the precipitous heights called Arthur’s Seat and Salisbury Crags. The
                    view from the Calton Hill in a northerly direction is also remarkably fine,
                    comprehending a prospect of the whole Frith of Forth, and the hills of Fifeshire
                    on its opposite shore.</p>
                <p>We now proceed to notice Edinburgh in detail, commencing with a description of
                    its more remarkable public edifices.</p>
                <p>The Castle, as has already been stated, owes its origin as a regular place oľ
                    defence to the Anglo-Saxon dynasty, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> near the end
                    of the fifth century; but its fortifications ap-; pear to be of comparatively
                    modern date. The rock on which the fortress is situated rises to a height of
                    three hundred feet, and is precipitous on all sides except the east, on which it
                    is connected with the town by an open glacis or esplanade. The surface of the
                    rock measures about seven acres, and is surmounted by battlements, lofty
                    barracks, and other buildings. Amongst the buildings crowning the summit is that
                    erected by Queen Mary as a palace, in a small apartment on the ground floor of
                    which that princess was delivered of her son, James VI., on the 19th of June
                    1566. In the same part of the edifice is situated the crown room, where the
                    regalia of Scotland were lodged in 1707, and found in 1818, after being lost
                    sight of for upwards of one hundred years. These regalia consisţ of a crown,
                    sceptre, sword of state, and lord treasurer’s rod; the former is supposed to be
                    even more ancient than the time of Robert Bruce, though it has undergone several
                    changes since that period; the sword was a present from Pope Julius 11. to James
                    IV. The arsenal or storehouse of the Castle is capable of containing 30,000
                    stand of arms, and the whole buildings about 2000 men. In March 1829 an addition
                    was made to the curiosities of the castle by the restoration of an ancient piece
                    of ordnance called Mons Meg, which had been removed from the fortress and
                    carried into England in 1754. This immense cannon, for it is of an unusual size,
                    was fabricated in the year 1498, and is curious from its structure, being formed
                    of bars bound together with rings. It was employed at the siege oľ Norham
                    Castle, but was rent in 1682, when firing a salute in honour of James duke of
                    York.</p>
                <p>The charter of foundation of the Abbey of Holyrood is dated 1128. It was largely
                    endowed by the founder David 1., and was considered as one of the wealthiest
                    ecclesiastical establishments in Scotland. In 1544 it was sacked, and in part
                    destroyed, by the Earl of Hertford when he invaded Scotland; and again in 1547.
                    The chapel attached to it was desecrated and dismantled by the mob in 1688; and
                    in 1768 the roof fell in, and thus left it in the ruined condition in which it
                    now stands. Within this chapel were interred, amongst other illustrious remains,
                    those of Queen Magdalen and Darnley. The royal palace is contiguous. It is not
                    known at what time a palace was first erected on this spot. The more ancient
                    parts of that which is now in existence were built by James V.; but it has since
                    undergone many changes, and little if any of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193328569" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8569-0418"/>original building remains. In
                    the time of Cromwell it was burnt by the soldiers of that usurper, and was
                    rebuilt after the Restoration by Charles II. The architect on this occasion was
                    Sir William Bruce, and the builder who carried his designs into execution was
                    Robert Mylne. The edifice is of a quadrangular figure, with an open court in the
                    centre, surrounded with piazzas. Amongst the curiosities exhibited in the Palace
                    of Holyrood is the chamber of Queen Mary, in which may still be seen, though in
                    a decayed state, the bed of that unfortunate princess. In a hall or gallery a
                    hundred and fifty feet in length, twenty-seven and a half in breadth, and
                    eighteen in height, and which is adorned with the portraits of a hundred and six
                    Scottish monarchs, takes place the election of representative peers for
                    Scotland. The most remarkable circumstance connected with Holyrood House is its
                    privilege of affording a sanctuary to debtors. The limit of this privileged
                    territory is marked in the direction of the town by a strand or gutter at the
                    foot of the Canongate, and at the distance of about a hundred yards from the
                    palace. Altogether the sanctuary describes a circle of about five miles,
                    including Salisbury Crags and Arthur’s Seat. The immunities of the sanctuary
                    have existed since the date of the monastery. Considerable improvements were
                    made on the exterior walls of the palace during 1832, and some years previously,
                    at the expense of his majesty.</p>
                <p>Edinburgh is now chiefly distinguished as a capital by being the seat of the
                    Scottish supreme courts or College of Justice, which, as has already been
                    mentioned, was constituted in 1532 by James V. This body consists of persons
                    intimately connected with the various supreme courts, and comprehends the judges
                    or senators, the faculty of advocates, writers to the signet, solicitors in the
                    supreme courts, advocates’ first clerks, clerks to the judges, extractors,
                    keepers of the different departments, and, in a general sense, may be said to
                    include the principal professional gentlemen in Edinburgh. This influential body
                    at one time possessed some valuable privileges, the chief of which now remaining
                    are exemptions from certain local taxes, and non-liability to be sued before any
                    inferior civil court of record.</p>
                <p>The principal court connected with the College of Justice is the Court of
                    Session, or supreme civil court. This judicature possesses all those peculiar
                    powers exercised in England by the Courts of Chancery, King’s Bench, Common
                    Pleas, Admiralty, and others, being a court both of law and of equity. The
                    constitution of the court, during its continuance of three hundred years, has
                    undergone many alterations, and is now established upon an improved plan,
                    introduced by an act of parliament passed in 1830. There are thirteen judges,
                    who are separated into the first and second divisions. In the former there are
                    six lords, and in the latter seven. The presiding judge in the first division is
                    the Lord President, and in the second division the Lord Justice Clerk, a title
                    which he derives from being co-ordinately the presiding judge of the High Court
                    of Justiciary. The two divisions form distinct courts, which, excepting on
                    particular occasions, have no connection with each other. Popularly, they are
                    each denominated the Inner House, from their meetings being held in inner
                    apartments leading from the Outer House, or hall of the Parliament House. From
                    the first division are detached two judges with the title of Lords Ordinary, and
                    from the second there are detached three. Before one or other of these
                    ordinaries all causes are brought in the first instance; and, in case of
                    dissatisfaction with their judgments, the suits can be removed by appeal into
                    the inner House, but always to that division before whose ordinary the case was
                    primarily brought. The office of Lord Ordinary on the Bills, which is
                    successively discharged by the judges, is of great im portance in a national
                    sense, as, besides other duties, it includes that of supreme civil magistrate of
                    the kingdom. Cases may be removed by appeal from the Court of Session to the
                    House of Lords. The court has a winter term of four, and a summer term of two
                    months.</p>
                <p>Agreeably to certain acts of parliament, a civil jurisdiction, with the title of
                    Jury Court, was instituted in Scotland, and subsisted under various
                    modifications, between the years 1816 and 1830, when it ceased as a separate
                    court. By the act 1 William IV. cap. 69, passed 23d July 1830, the benefit of
                    jury trial in civil causes was united with the ordinary jurisdiction of the
                    Court of Session. In virtue of this act, the lords president of the two
                    divisions respectively try by jury all issues arising out of causes in these
                    divisions, and otherwise discharge all duties previously assigned to the Lord
                    Chief Commissioner of the Jury Court. In certain circumstances, the ordinary
                    lords of session may also discharge the same duties, and the Lord Chief
                    Commissioner is still qualified to act as a judge in such causes. The juries who
                    are impannelled under this branch of the jurisdiction of the Court of Session
                    are twelve in number, as in England, and must be unanimous in their verdicts or
                    findings.</p>
                <p>Every alternate Wednesday during terms, the Teind Court of Scotland, instituted
                    in 1707, is held in Edinburgh, in the apartment of one of the divisions. The
                    judges ol the Court of Session are, by commission, judges also in this. It is
                    the peculiar duty of the Teind Court to regulate the stipends of the clergy of
                    the established church of Scotland, and other secular matters touching
                    ecclesiastical polity. Nine judges form a quorum.</p>
                <p>The High Court of Justiciary was instituted in 1672, It is composed of a
                    president, styled the Lord Justice Clerk, an&lt;l five other judges, who are at
                    the same time lords of session. This supreme criminal court sits every Monday
                    during term, and in the vacations of the Court ol Session, the commissioners of
                    justiciary proceed, in small detachments, upon appointed circuits.</p>
                <p>The Commissary or Consistorial Court, the duties ol which comprehended pleas
                    relative to declarators of marriage and legitimacy, to divorce, adherence, and
                    the like, was in 1830 amalgamated with the Court of Session. The head
                    consistorial court of Scotland was thus almost entirely abolished. A certain
                    number of commissaries, however, yet remain, whose duty consists in granting
                    confirmation of testaments of persons dying abroad and leaving personal property
                    in Scotland. They have also a special jurisdiction in the county of Edinburgh,
                    the same as sheriffs in other counties.</p>
                <p>The Dean of Guild Court consists of the Dean of Guild, Old Dean of Guild, and
                    five guild counsellors. The powers of this court were formerly far more
                    extensive than they are at present, having relation to causes between merchant
                    and mariner, as well as to those between merchant and merchant. The institution,
                    however, of the Admiralty Court, by the act 1681, cap. 16, superseded its
                    interference with maritime affairs. Even yet, the functions of the individual
                    who is at the head of it do not seem to be very distinctly defined; but he is
                    independent of the burgh or bailie court. The Dean of Guild is chosen yearly,
                    and with his council has power to regulate the buildings within burgh, agreeably
                    to law. He alone is competent to grant authority, by his warrants, or jedges as
                    they are called, for pulling down or erecting houses; and he gives directions as
                    to keeping buildings and streets in proper repair. The provost and bailies have
                    no power to review the decrees of the Dean of Guild, redress being only
                    competent in the Court of Session, as in the case of judgments by the bailie
                    court. For more specific information, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Guild.</hi></p>

                <p>The Court of Exchequer is now abolished as a separate judicature, its functions
                    being included in those of the Court of Session. The only remaining branch of
                    the Scottish Exchequer establishment now consists of a variety of officers for
                    conducting the business connected with the different descriptions of revenue
                    drawn from the country, which pass through this channel. Amongst these is an
                    officer of the crown, with the title of King’s Remembrancer for Scotland, whose
                    duty it is to secure all fines payable to the king, all treasure found, and
                    property falling to the crown as <hi rend="italic">ultimus lueres.</hi></p>
                <p>The Lyon Court is now nearly extinct. The duties of the Lord Lyon, so named from
                    the circumstance of the lion forming the armorial bearing of the kings of
                    Scotland, are performed by two deputies. These duties consist in the ordering of
                    proclamations, conferring armorial bearings, and superintending the management
                    of state ceremonials and processions. He has besides a control over a large body
                    of messengers at arms, and other officials, amongst whom are six heralds, and
                    the same number of pursuivants. The fees payable at the lyon office for patents
                    of arms are, for arms without supporters L.52. 10s., and with supporters L.84;
                    but if the patent be granted as a <hi rend="italic">favour,</hi> the price is
                    L.115. 10s. The Lord Lyon receives a share of the fees to the amount of L.700 a
                    year. Altogether his office is worth about L.1300 annually. It is enjoyed by the
                    Earl of Kinnoull.</p>
                <p>The Faculty of Advocates is an association of barristers entitled to plead before
                    the supreme or any other courts of record. It consists at present of four
                    hundred and thirty members, who are presided over by a Dean. All candidates for
                    admission into this society must undergo an examination on the Roman and Scotch
                    law, and every member on entering pays a fee of nearly L.300, one halt of which
                    goes to support the library belonging to the Faculty. The appointment ofjudges
                    of the Court of Session, and the thirty-three sheriffships of Scotland, together
                    with several other government offices and dignities, are filled up exclusively
                    from this body. The Faculty, however, possesses no charter of incorporation.</p>
                <p>The Society of Writers to the Signet is also an unincorporated body, consisting
                    at present of nearly seven hundred members, qualified to conduct causes before
                    the supreme courts, and possessing the sole right of passing papers or warrants
                    under the signet or seal of his majesty, from which circumstance their
                    professional name is derived. The principal and most lucrative branch of their
                    professional employment is that of conveyancing. In order to promote the study
                    of this important department of legal practice, they, many years ago, founded a
                    lectureship, which was, in 1825, erected into a professorship in the University.
                    In order to gain admission into this Society, an apprenticeship of five years is
                    necessary. At entering into his indentures, the apprentice must show that he has
                    attended a university for two years; and, during the course of his
                    apprenticeship, he must attend the law classes in the University. A thorough
                    examination on the principles of the law of Scotland, and the practice of
                    conveyancing, takes place previously to admission into the Society. Its affairs
                    are administered at stated meetings. It possesses an extensive and very valuable
                    library; and most of the members are associated in supporting a fund for widows,
                    which, by act of parliament, must amount to L.20,000 for every hundred
                    members.</p>
                <p>The Solicitors before the Supreme Courts form a body of attorneys incorporated in
                    1797. Its members amount to between one and two hundred. With the exception of
                    the power of passing papers under the seal of his majesty, their privileges are
                    nearly the same with those of the Writers to the Signet. They have also
                    office-bearers, a hall of 1 meeting, and a library.</p>
                <p>Of the class of practitioners denominated Advocates’ First Clerks, there are not
                    a great number. They are entitled to act as attorneys in the Supreme Courts on
                    undergoing the usual examinations, and paying certain fees. Every advocate has
                    the privilege of appointing a clerk.</p>
                <p>The edifice which has been appropriated since the Union as the place of meeting
                    of the supreme courts, is the old Parliament House of Scotland, situated in the
                    centre of the Old Town, and separated from the High Street by the cathedral of
                    St Giles. This structure was erected between the years 1632 and 1640, at an
                    expense ofL.11,600 sterling to the civic corporation. In recent times, however,
                    with the exception of the great hall, it has been almost totally renewed. It
                    stands on the southern and western sides of the inclosure called the Parliament
                    Square, a place formerly surrounded with the shops of tradesmen, but entirely
                    remodelled since the destructive fires of 1824, and now exhibiting on the south
                    and west sides splendid erections in the Grecian style of architecture, with
                    piazzas underneath. These improvements, which extend over the front of the old
                    parliament-house, or present court-house, have been executed chiefly by
                    government, at a great expense. The entrance to the courts is at the south-west
                    angle of the square; the great hall is 122 feet by 49, and has a lofty roof of
                    carved oak, arched and disposed in the same style as that of Westminster Hall.
                    In this hall or outer house generally sit two of the Lords Ordinary, and the
                    floor during session is the daily resort of all persons connected with the
                    courts. On a pedestal near the south end of the hall is a statue in white
                    marble, of the late Lord Viscount Melville, executed in 1818 by Chantrey.</p>
                <p>Adjoining the Parliament House are certain spacious apartments fitted up as
                    libraries for the Faculty of Advocates and the Writers to the Signet. The
                    Library of the former body was founded in 1682, at the instance of Sir George
                    Mackenzie, then Dean of Faculty. The collection is now the largest and most
                    valuable in Scotland, and is in every sense one of the noblest national
                    libraries. By an act of parliament passed in the reign of Queen Anne, it is
                    entitled to a copy of every work printed in Britain; and, with the sums annually
                    disbursed in the purchase of useful and rare books, it is rapidly increasing.
                    The library is under the charge of six curators, a librarian, and assistants. At
                    present the collection is on the eve of removal to a large new building erected
                    for its reception on the west side of the Parliament Houβe, and facing the new
                    approach from the south.</p>
                <p>The Library of the Society of Writers to the Signet occupies a βplendid modern
                    erection of two stories, in the Grecian style of architecture, extending
                    westward from the north-west corner of the Parliament House, and having a front
                    to the Lawnmarket. This edifice contains two large and beautiful apartments,
                    decorated in front of the book-presses with rows of columns, which produce a
                    fine effect. These noble apartments have cost the society L.25,000. The library,
                    like that of the Advocates, is under the charge of curators, a librarian, and
                    assistants.</p>
                <p>The Scottish Supreme Courts possess accommodations for their records, and the
                    functionaries connected therewith, in a building styled the General Register
                    House of Scotland, one of the most remarkable national edifices in the
                    metropolis. It stan*ds at the eastern extremity of Princes Street, fronting the
                    thoroughfare of the North Bridge. The foundation was laid on the 17th of June
                    1776, and L.1200 were given by George III. out of the money arising from the
                    sale of the forfeited estates, to assist in its erection. It was fully completed
                    in 1822, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328595" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8595-0420"/>at a
                    very great expense, which has been defrayed by government. The building, which
                    was planned by Mr Robert Adam, forms a square, with a quadrangular court in the
                    centre, containing a circular edifice or dome fifty feet in diameter, which
                    joins the sides of the court, leaving spaces at the angles for the admission of
                    light. Viewed from the street, it presents a compact building of 200 feet in
                    length, by a breadth of 120. Each of the corners is surmounted by a small
                    turret, and the central tower is crowned with a dome. The interior consists
                    principally of small fire-proof chambers, in which are deposited state papers,
                    copies or records of all the title-deeds of property, and of all legal
                    contracts, mortgages, &amp;c.; also records of all suits at law from an early
                    period.</p>
                <p>The Post-Office establishment for Scotland is conducted in Edinburgh, and
                    occupies a handsome new edifice of four stories in Waterloo Place. The duties of
                    this well-regulated establishment are executed by a numerous body of
                    individuals, amongst whom are a secretary, cashier, clerks, and letter-carriers.
                    The produce of the Scottish posts is now upwards of L.207,000 annually, and the
                    expense of management about <hi rend="italic">L</hi> 55,000.</p>
                <p>The Stamp Office for Scotland is also situated in Waterloo Place, a short way
                    westward of the Post-Office, to which it bears a very considerable resemblance
                    in point of architectural design. This establishment, which is under the
                    superintendence of a comptroller, is subject to the Board of Stamps in
                    London.</p>
                <p>In looking along the noble line of Princes Street, the eye is arrested by a
                    structure of modern date, occupying a situation at the northern extremity of the
                    Earthen Mound, or that end adjoining the New Town. This edifice, which fronts
                    the opening of Hanover Street, is entitled the Royal Institution Buildings, and
                    is appropriated for the accommodation of a variety of institutions. It was
                    founded in the year 1823, on a substructure of piles and cross bearers, rendered
                    necessary by the nature of the ground, which consists of forced earth. The
                    building is from a Grecian model, executed by Mr Playfair, and has a range of
                    Doric columns on each side, and another range surmounted with a pediment in
                    front. Owing to the opposition of the Princes Street proprietors, the structure
                    is not sufficiently elevated. The interior accommodations consist of one large
                    central hall for exhibitions, and an upper and lower range of smaller apartments
                    on each side. Additions are at present making to the building by an extension in
                    the direction of the Mound, which will very much improve its appearance. The
                    Royal Institution, under whose auspices this edifice was founded, was
                    incorporated by royal charter in the year 1827, for the purpose of encouraging
                    the fine arts in Scotland. The primary object of the institution is the annual
                    exhibition of pictures of modern artists, and the purchase of those which are
                    deemed of sufficient merit to entitle them to a place in a regular gallery of
                    paintings. The institution also occasionally offers exhibitions of paintings by
                    the old masters. A separate establishment was founded in Edinburgh in 1826, by a
                    body of artists, with similar objects in view, entitled the Scottish Academy of
                    Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture, which has now also regular
                    exhibitions.</p>
                <p>The Royal Society of Edinburgh was incorporated by royal charter in 1783, for the
                    purpose of encouraging philosophical inquiry, and discussing matters connected
                    with nature and art. Its meetings, which are very numerously attended, take
                    place twice a month during winter and spring, and it has published twelve
                    volumes of transactions. It is governed by a president, several vice-presidents,
                    and twelve counsellors. It possesses very splendid apartments, an extensive
                    library, and a small museum, in the Royal Institution Buildings</p>
                <p>The Society of Antiquaries of Scotland originated in 1780, and was incorporated
                    by letters under the great seal in 1783. The society is governed by a president,
                    three vice-presidents, and a council of nine members, with a treasurer, two
                    curators, a general secretary, and a secretary for foreign correspondence. The
                    king is patron. The fee of admission is three guineas, and two guineas annually,
                    or a life premium of twenty guineas. Its meetings are held every alternate
                    Monday during winter and spring. The society possesses a museum, in which there
                    is a considerable collection of antiquities, principally Scottish. Its
                    apartments are situated in the Royal Institution Buildings.</p>
                <p>The Board of Trustees, which was instituted for encouraging trade and
                    manufactures in Scotland, was erected by letters patent in the year 1727. On its
                    erection it was endowed with the sum of L.3800, and an annuity of L.2000 from
                    government. It has since then received various accessions of revenue, chiefly
                    from the forfeited estates, which now amounts altogether to L.7961. 13s. 8d.
                    annually. The management of this capital is vested in twenty-eight trustees,
                    consisting of peers, judges of the supreme courts, the lord advocate, bankers,
                    and gentlemen of property, all of whom give their services gratis. Vacancies are
                    filled up by the crown; five members form a quorum; and meetings are held
                    periodically throughout the year. The chief object of this institution has
                    hitherto been the encouragement of the manufacture of particular kinds of linen
                    and woollen cloths; but it now extends its patronage to other branches, and
                    pays, besides, L.500 per annum to the Royal Institution of Scotland for the
                    Encouragement of the Fine Arts. It has an academy for instruction in drawing,
                    and possesses a noble gallery of casts from the ancient sculptures. It has
                    apartments in the Royal Institution Buildings.</p>
                <p>The Highland Society of Scotland originated in the year 1784. In 1787 it was
                    incorporated by royal charter, and assisted by a grant of L.3000 from the
                    forfeited estates. In 1789 it received a further and annual grant of L.800 from
                    the treasury. Its members exceed seventeen hundred, und are admitted by ballot
                    at public meetings, each paying a life subscription of L.12. 12s. or an annual
                    fee of L.l. 3s. 6d. The society is under the management of a president, four
                    vice-presidents, a treasurer and secretary, two deputy-secretaries and
                    collectors, and a body of thirty ordinary and ten extraordinary directors. The
                    object of this institution was originally confined to improving the condition of
                    the Highlands; but its patronage is now extended over the whole kingdom, and
                    embraces every species of improvement in agriculture, management of cattle, and
                    general country produce. It annually awards premiums in money and medals to the
                    amount of L.1200, for the best specimens of live stock, shows of which are every
                    season made in some particular district. The society has a handsome hall,
                    model-room, and other apartments in Albyn Place, at the west end of Queen
                    Street.</p>
                <p>The Caledonian Horticultural Society, the object of which is the promotion of
                    improvement in the cultivation of the best kinds of fruits, flowers, kitchen
                    vegetables, and the like, was established in the year 1809. It is supported by
                    the sale of shares of twenty guineas in value, or annual fees of two guineas.
                    Its affairs are managed by a president, four vice-presidents, a secretary, a
                    treasurer, an auditor, an artist, a council of twelve, a committee of prizes,
                    and a garden committee. The society has an excellent experimental garden in the
                    grounds of Inverleith.</p>
                <p>The object of the Society of Arts, instituted in 1821, is to encourage the
                    invention of machines calculated to improve manufactures, the discovery of
                    chemical preparations of utility in the arts, and the exposition of facts
                    tending to improve the natural products of the soil. The <pb break="no"

                    has honorary, associate, and ordinary members. The latter pay L.l. Is. annually,
                    or a life premium <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> of L.10.10s. It distributes
                    about L.80 every year in premiums for models, essays, and the like.</p>
                <p>Nelson’s Monument occupies the summit of a rocky eminence on the Calton Hill, and
                    is one of the most prominent, though at the same time most unsightly objects in
                    Edinburgh. It was begun by subscription soon after the death of Lord Nelson,
                    whose actions it was intended to commemorate, but it was not finished till 1815.
                    It consists of a lofty circular turret, with a stair inside, and is battlemented
                    on the top. Round the base is a low structure in the same style of architecture,
                    divided into apartments.</p>
                <p>The National Monument occupies a prominent situation on the Calton Hill. It was
                    begun by a body of subscribers in 1822, and was intended to be an exact model of
                    the Parthenon at Athens. Its object was to commemorate those Scotchmen who had
                    fallen in the different engagements by sea and land during the wars consequent
                    on the French revolution; but it has been arrested in its progress for want of
                    funds, and only twelve massive pillars of exquisite workmanship have as yet been
                    completed.</p>
                <p>A monument of a singularly elegant description, designed by Mr Playfair, and
                    which is a reproduction, with some variations, of the choragic monument of
                    Lysicrates, was erected in 1830-31 on a prominent situation on the Calton Hill.
                    It is commemorative of the late Mr Dugald Stewart, professor of moral philosophy
                    in the university of Edinburgh. A monumental erection, commemorative of
                    Professor Playfair, is also placed on the Calton Hill, at the corner of the
                    enclosure of the Royal Observatory; and more recently another to the memory of
                    Robert burns has been raised on an isolated eminence fronting the new High
                    School. David Hume’s Monument, within the old Gallon Hill burying-ground, is
                    also conspicuous.</p>
                <p>Lord Melville’s Monument, an elegant fluted column, in the centre of St Andrew
                    Square, was finished in 1828. It was raised by subscriptions chiefly among
                    gentlemen connected with the royal navy. On the summit is a colossal figure of
                    the above nobleman, cut in freestone. This beautiful column rises to the height
                    of 136 feet, is modelled after Trajan’s pillar at Rome, and forms altogether a
                    very prominent and striking object.</p>
                <p>In George Street, at the crossing of Hanover Street, stands a pedestal,
                    surmounted with a figure in bronze of George IV., erected in 1832, in
                    commemoration of the visit of his majesty to Scotland in 1822. A similar
                    pedestal and figure of Mr Pitt were erected in George Street, at the crossing of
                    Frederick Street, in 1833. Doth statues are by Chan trey.</p>
                <p>During the reign of episcopacy in Scotland, Edinburgh was the seat of a bishop.
                    It is now the place of meeting of the General Assembly of the church, and the
                    seat of a synod and presbytery. Ecclesiastically, the ancient and extended
                    royalty comprehend thirteen parochial divisions, eight of which have one
                    clergyman each, and five are double or collegiate charges. That portion of the
                    town which is not within these divisions belongs either to the parish of
                    Canongate, or to that of St Cuthbert's. Originally the city consisted of only
                    one parish, of which the ancient church of St Giles was the place of public
                    worship. This venerable fabric, which occupies a prominent situation in the
                    centre of the Old Town, on the south side of the High Street, is of unknown
                    origin and date. It has been presumed, however, that a church existed on its
                    site as early as the year 854; but the first certain intelligence regarding it
                    occurs in 1359, when a charter was granted by David II. bestowing some land on a
                    chaplain who officiated at one of its altars. The building, previously to
                    certain alterations which were made u∣*on it, was cruciform, and of Gothic
                    architecture, but rather substantial than elegant. From the centre of the whole
                    there rises a square tower, the top of which is encircled with open figured
                    stone work, whilst from each corner of the tower springs an arch, and the tour
                    meeting together produce the appearance of an imperial crown. These arches are
                    highly ornamented with small pinnacles, and from the apex rises an equally
                    ornamented short spire. This elegant object is prominent above the whole of the
                    town; and being 161 feet in height, it may be seen at a great distance. After
                    the Reformation, the church was divided by internal walls into separate places
                    of worship. By these and other subsequent alterations, the choir or eastern
                    division formed the High Church; the one occupying the centre of the building,
                    was styled the Old Church; another entering from the south-west corner, the
                    Tolbooth Church; and one at the north-west corner was named the New North
                    Church. Between the years 1829-33 this extensive edifice was remodelled, and
                    greatly improved in external appearance, by an entire casing of new walls. It
                    now forms two churches; and contains also a spacious hall intended as a place of
                    meeting for the General Assembly. The design of the remodelled church does great
                    credit to its architect, Mr William Burn.</p>
                <p>Trinity College Church, which is next in point of antiquity to St Giles, is
                    situated on the low ground east from the North Bridge. It was founded in 1462,
                    by Mary of Gueldres, widow of James II.; and in 1502 James IV. invested it with
                    some additional revenues. At the period of the Reformation it shared the fate of
                    the other ecclesiastical establishments of the kingdom. Its revenues were in
                    1567 given to Sir Simon Preston, provost of Edinburgh, who again presented them
                    to the town council as a common fund. In 1587 the magistrates restored an
                    hospital which had formerly belonged to the establishment, and which still
                    exists. The body of its royal foundress lies interred in an aisle on the north
                    side of the church, and within its walls are likewise the remains of many
                    persons celebrated in Scottish history.</p>
                <p>The Old Grayľriars Church was built in 1612, but it was not constituted a parish
                    church till 1722. Previously to this, in May 1718, its spire was blown up by
                    gunpowder, which had been lodged in it by the town authorities for security. The
                    New Grayfriars Church was built in 1721. Both of these buildings, which are
                    separated only by a wall, were erected on what was formerly the garden ground of
                    the monastery of Grayfriarβ, in the south part of the town, and which, on the
                    demolition of the friary in 1559, was conferred by Queen Mary on the town, to be
                    used as a public cemetery. The Old Grayfriars Church is remarkable for being the
                    place where the National Covenant was begun to be signed in 1638, and for having
                    had the historian of Charles V. as its minister.</p>
                <p>The Tron Church, which stands in the High Street, was begun in the year 1627, and
                    opened for public worship in 1647. Its appellation is acquired from the
                    circumstance of a tron or weighing beam having formerly stood upon the spot. Its
                    steeple, formed of wood and covered with lead, was destroyed during the great
                    fires of 1824, but has since been replaced by an elegant stone spire of 160 feet
                    in height.</p>
                <p>Lady Yester’s Church was founded in 1647, by Dame Margaret Ker, Lady Yester. This
                    pious lady gave the magistrates fifteen thousand n&gt;erks for the erection of
                    the building, and made a bequest of a thousand merks per annum for the stipend
                    of a minister. The original edifice having become ruinous, it was rebuilt in
                    1803. It is situated in Infirmary Street, and has no spire.</p>
                <p>St Andrew’s Church was erected in the year 1781. The body of the building is of
                    an oval form, with an exceedingly<pb break="no" facs="nls:193328621"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-8621-0422"/> handsome spire in front, partly resting on four
                    Corinthian pillars, and rising to a height of 168 feet.</p>
                <p>St George’s Church, which is situated on the west side of Charlotte Square, was
                    founded in the year 1811, and opened in 1814. It is a huge square fabric, in a
                    plain Grecian style, and is capable of accommodating about 1600 persons. From
                    the centre rises a tower surmounted with a dome, 150 feet in height, somewhat in
                    imitation of St Paul’s. The building cost L.33,000.</p>
                <p>St Mary’s Church stands in Bellevue Crescent, and was opened in the year 1824. It
                    is of an oblong figure, with a front of considerable elegance, ct&gt;nsisting of
                    a porticowith a range of pillars of the Corinthian order, supporting a pediment,
                    from which rises a spire.</p>
                <p>St Stephen’s Church, situated at the northern extremity of St Vincent Street, was
                    opened in 1828, and cost L.25,000. It is ornamented with a square tower of solid
                    proportions, 162į feet in height, terminated at the top with a balustrade. The
                    church can accommodate 1600 persons.</p>
                <p>The foregoing churches are all under the patronage of the civic corporation. The
                    clergy, eighteen in number, are supported by an assessment, called annuity tax,
                    levied within the ancient and extended royalty on all houses and shops, with the
                    exception of the dwelling-houses of the members of the college of justice. The
                    following table, drawn up from official documents, exhibits the amount actually
                    levied for the church establishment, on an average of fourteen years, from
                    Whitsunday 1820 to Whitsunday 1834.</p>

                <p>St Cuthbert’s Church is situated in the low ground between the western extremity
                    of Princes Street and the castle. There formerly stood on the same spot an
                    ancient edifice, one of the earliest places of Christian worship in this part of
                    Scotland. The modern church is a large plain building, with a spire at the
                    western extremity; it is of date 1789, and stands in the midst of an extensive
                    burying-ground. In modern times it has been popularly named the West Kirk, from
                    its situation to the west of the metropolis. The populous parish of St
                    Cuthbert’s has likewise at present (1833) five chapels of ease, one of which, in
                    Clerk Street, erected in 1823, is a handsome building.</p>
                <p>The church of the parish and subordinate burgh of Canongate is of date 1688, and
                    was erected at an expense of L.24,000 sterling. It is situated in the midst of a
                    burying-ground, on the north side of the Canongate, but having no spire, it is
                    not conspicuous as a place of worship.</p>
                <p>Lady Glenorchy’s Chapel, a simple square edifice, situated near the College
                    Church, was founded and endowed by the pious lady whose name it bears, in the
                    year 1772, and was opened in 1776. It is under the government of the established
                    ecclesiastical courts.</p>
                <p>The Gaelic Chapel, the only one in Edinburgh in which the service is conducted in
                    the Celtic tongue, is situated in North College Street. It was erected in the
                    year 1815, and is under the jurisdiction of the established church courts.</p>
                <p>There are five chapels in Edinburgh belonging to the communion of the Scottish
                    Episcopal church, to which a considerable number of the higher classes are
                    attached. The most elegant of these perhaps is St John's, situated at the west
                    end of Princes Street. This edifice was founded in 1816, and finished in two
                    years, at an expense ofL.15,000. It is of the florid Gothic style, from a design
                    by Mr Burn, measures 113 feet in length by sixty-two in breadth, and is
                    terminated at the western extremity by a beautiful square tower, rising to a
                    height of 120 feet. Another Episcopal chapel, of tasteful Gothic architecture,
                    is that of St Paul’s in York Place. It was designed by Mr Elliot, founded in
                    1816, and finished in 1818 at an expense of about L.12,000. It measures 122 feet
                    by seventy-three, and from each corner there rises a small circular turret. St
                    George’s Chapel, a much smaller building, is also situated in York Place, and of
                    date 1794. St James’s Chapel is erected in the line of houses in Broughton
                    Place. St Peter’s Chapel is a similar plain edifice in Roxburgh Place. St Paul’s
                    Chapel, Carrubber’s Close, is the oldest episcopal chapel in Edinburgh, having
                    been erected about the end of the seventeenth century.</p>
                <p>The Roman Catholic communion has a principal place of public worship, and a
                    subordinate one. The former is a large structure, with a Gothic gable front,
                    situated in Broughton Street, and was built in the years 1813-16, at an expense
                    of about L.8000, raised by subscriptions and collections. The latter is situated
                    in Blackfriars Wynd. Another Roman Catholic chapel is at present in the course
                    of erection in Bristo Street, in the southern part of the town.</p>
                <p>Edinburgh possesses a number of places of public worship belonging to the United
                    Secession church, and other presbyterian dissenting bodies. The following are
                    those of most note. Nicoson Street Chapel was founded in 1819, and was raised at
                    an expense of L.6000. It has a broad and lofty Gothic front, with pinnacles
                    rising to the height of ninety feet. Broughton Place chapel is a modern
                    building, with a Grecian front, portico and range of Doric columns. Rose Street
                    Chapel is a handsome structure of plain Grecian architecture, built in 1830. The
                    Cowgate Chapel, now belonging to the Secession, was formerly occupied by an
                    episcopal congregation, from whom it was purchased; a recess in the interior is
                    decorated by some oil paintings of Runciman. The other chapels are at
                    Stockbridge, Lothian Road, Bristo Street, Potterrow, and the Vennel∙</p>
                <p>Edinburgh is the seat of one of the presbyteries of the Associate Synod of
                    Original Seceders, and of two congregations. One chapel is situated at the foot
                    of Infirmary Street, and the other in Richmond Street. The former was lately
                    under the superintendence of the Reverend George Paxton, professor of divinity,
                    and author of the Illustrations of the Holy Scriptures; and the latter under
                    that of the Reverend Dr M‘Crie, author of the lives of Knox and of Melville.</p>
                <p>There is also a congregation belonging to the Original Burgher Associate Synod,
                    and one to the Cameronian communion, a representative remnant of the old
                    Covenanters.</p>
                <p>Edinburgh is likewise the seat of a presbytery of the Relief Synod, and there are
                    in the city five places of worship belonging to that communion. Besides the
                    foregoing churches and chapels in Edinburgh, there are three chapels of Scottish
                    Independents, one of English Independents, four of Baptists, one of Methodists,
                    one of Bereans, one of Unitarians, one of Glassites, one of the New Jerusalem
                    Church or Swedenborgians, one of the Society of Friends, and a Jews'
                    synagogue.</p>
                <p>Edinburgh has long derived celebrity from its educational<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193328634" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8634-0423"/> establishments, the chief of
                    which is the University. This institution dates its origin about the year 1583,
                    when the first professor was appointed; and under the patronage of James VI. it
                    soon assumed the character of an ordinary college. About the year 1660, by means
                    of benefactions from public bodies and from private individuals, the
                    establishment had attained a respectable rank among similar institutions. As a
                    school of medicine it first rose into repute under Dr Alexander Munro, who
                    became professor of anatomy in 1720; and in this branch of science it afterwards
                    attained a distinguished pre-eminence, from possessing professors remarkable for
                    their abilities and success as teachers. In the other branches of knowledge, its
                    reputation was gradually exalted to the highest pitch by Maclaurin, Black,
                    Fergusson, Stewart, Robertson, and other eminent men. The decay and
                    insufficiency of the old buildings had long been complained of; and at length,
                    in 1789, the foundation was laid of a new and extensive structure, the plan of
                    which had been furnished, by Mr Robert Adam. But this plan, after it had been
                    partly carried into execution, was altered and modified; and the building has
                    been finished in conformity with a very skilful and tasteful design furnished by
                    Mr William Playfair. It still (1839), however, wants a dome and other interior
                    finishings, to render it complete. This splendid edifice forms a parallelogram,
                    inclosing a quadrangular court. The sides of this court are occupied with the
                    class-rooms, the museum, and the library. In the middle of the front are three
                    entrances to the court, consisting of lofty portico penetrating the
                    building.</p>
                <p>The number of Professorships is about thirty, and these are divided into four
                    Faculties, viz. Theology, Law, Medicine, and Arts. The latter includes all the
                    chairs devoted to Literature and General Science. The Principal and Professors
                    constitute the Senatus Academicus; and the Lord Provost of the city for the time
                    being assumes the title of Lord Rector.</p>
                <p>The magistrates and town council are the patrons of the University, and have the
                    nomination to the greater number' of the chairs; the others are under the
                    patronage of the crown, except three, the patronage of which is shared by the
                    faculty of advocates, the writers to the signet, and the town council. The
                    degrees it bestows are the same as in the other Scottish colleges, namely, those
                    of doctor of divinity, doctor of laws, doctor of medicine, and master of arts.
                    The terms of the college are a winter session of about six months, beginning in
                    November, and a summer session of about three months, from May to August. During
                    the latter term the lectures given are confined to botany, natural history,
                    midwifery, medical jurisprudence, and clinical lectures on medicine and surgery.
                    The total number of students who matriculated in the session 1829-30 was
                    2186.</p>
                <p>The College Museum is particularly rich in objects of natural history, amongst
                    which are specimens of upwards of three thousand birds foreign and British. The
                    Museum occupies two large rooms, each ninety feet by thirty, besides minor
                    apartments.</p>
                <p>The College Library consists of upwards of 70,000 volumes. It is supported from a
                    fund formed by a contribution exigible from every student who matriculates, five
                    pounds payable by every professor on his admission, and a portion of the fees of
                    graduates both in medicine and arts. It is besides entitled, along with the
                    other libraries belonging to the Scottish universities, to a copy of every work
                    published in Great Britain. There is also an excellent collection of books on
                    theology and church history connected with the class of divinity, and which is
                    supported by certain annual fees paid by the students attending the class. The
                    principal apartment, called the Library Hall, is 198 feet in length by fifty in
                    width, and is certainly one of the most spacious and elegant apartments in the
                    kingdom.</p>
                <p>The celebrity of Edinburgh as a place of education has been in some measure
                    derived from the schools of a number of private lecturers of eminence in their
                    several departments of science, particularly in medicine. These lecturers are
                    chiefly members of the Royal College of Surgeons. This body, which was
                    incorporated by charter in 1778, confers the same privileges on medical students
                    as the University does, that of doctor of medicine excepted. The Royal College
                    possesses a beautiful edifice in Nicoson Street, from a design by Mr Playfair.
                    Towards the street it is adorned with a lofty portico which has a striking
                    effect; and the details, though elaborate, are exquisitely finished, and in
                    admirable harmony with the design. It cost the Royal College L.19,060, and forms
                    several splendid halls for the accommodation of the members and the Pathological
                    Museums. These museums, enriched by the collections of the late Dr Barclay and
                    others, exhibit a valuable repository of preparations and objects calculated to
                    advance the study of surgical science.</p>
                <p>The Royal College of Physicians was established in 1681, by a charter of Charles
                    II.; and the number of its fellows, resident and non-resident, is now about a
                    hundred. The meetings of the body take place in the Physicians' Hall, a handsome
                    edifice in George Street, of the Grecian style, and erected in 1775. It contains
                    a good library.</p>
                <p>The High School is the chief seminary in Edinburgh for classical education, and
                    has long maintained an eminent place amongst similar establishments. Its origin
                    may be traced to an early period in the sixteenth century; but it has been
                    greatly extended and improved in recent times. It now occupies a splendid
                    structure on the south side of the Calton Hill, facing the road that sweeps
                    round that eminence. The design was furnished by Mr Thomas Hamilton, and the
                    foundation-stone was laid on the 28th of July 1825. The main building extends
                    about two hundred and seventy feet in front, and in the centre of the edifice is
                    a magnificent hexastyle Doric portico On each side of the porticothere is a
                    corridor, the entablature of which is supported by six Doric columns. The
                    apartments, which are entered through a spacious play-ground, consist of a large
                    hall of seventy-five by forty-three feet, and rooms for the accommodation of the
                    various classes taught in the establishment. The cost of this extensive building
                    was about L.30,000, which was partly raised by subscription. The patronage of
                    the High School is vested in the town council of the city. The system of
                    education is conducted by a rector and four classical masters, with teachers of
                    writing, arithmetic, and mathematics. The usual number of pupils is from six to
                    seven hundred.</p>
                <p>The Edinburgh Academy is a similar institution with the High School, but its fees
                    are higher. It was begun a few years ago by a society with a capital of
                    L.12,900, which may be augmented to L.16,000, raised by proprietory shares of
                    L.50 each. The superintendence of the establishment is vested in fifteen
                    directors, chosen by the proprietors from their own body. The system of
                    education is nearly the same as that pursued in the High School. There are here
                    also four classical masters and a rector.</p>
                <p>Besides the High School and Academy, there are a number of private academies
                    throughout the city, several free schools, and many on moderate scales of
                    charges. There are several sessional schools, which are entirely under the
                    control and patronage of the kirk-sessions of the respective parishes where they
                    are situated. The teacher is allowed a fixed salary from the funds of the
                    church, so that the fees are extremely moderate. The private schools <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193328647" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8647-0424"/> of Edinburgh
                    altogether are computed to amount to about two hundred.</p>
                <p>The School of Arts was established in 1821. The students are young men belonging
                    to mechanical and trading professions, and are divided into junior and senior
                    classes. The session is from October to April, during which period there are
                    given every evening lectures on arithmetic, algebra, mathematics, geometry, and
                    other scientific subjects. The students are under the guidance of several
                    regular lecturers, and the institution possesses a library and collection of
                    apparatus and models. It is supported by the sale of tickets of admission, and
                    by voluntary subscriptions.</p>
                <p>An institution called the Edinburgh Association for Popular Instruction was
                    established in 1832, for the purpose of affording information by popular
                    lectures, on terms and at hours convenient for the middle classes of both sexes,
                    particularly those who are actively engaged during the day. The association is
                    distinguished from some other institutions for education, by being entirely
                    dependent upon the fees of subscribers, instead of relying for support on
                    gratuitous contributions. It is conducted by directors chosen annually from
                    among the subscribers.</p>
                <p>The Scottish Naval and Military Academy was opened on the 8th of November 1825.
                    ĩts principal object is to afford to young gentlemen intended for the army,
                    navy, or the East India Company’s civil or military service, a systematic course
                    of education, in order to qualify them for any of these departments. The
                    institution comprehends classes for fortification, military drawing, surveying,
                    landscape and perspective drawing, arithmetic, algebra and geometry, the higher
                    mathematics, natural philosophy and navigation, elocution, geography, ancient
                    and modern languages, fencing, gymnastics, and military exercises. The
                    establishment is supported by a body of proprietors, holding shares of L.10
                    each, subscribers who pay one guinea or more per annum, and donors. The
                    management is confided in a body of honorary office-bearers, twenty-seven
                    extraordinary and fourteen ordinary directors, with a chairman and trustees. The
                    king is patron.</p>
                <p>The Royal Academy, better known by the name of the Riding School, was established
                    about the year 1760. The members were incorporated by letters-patent in 1764,
                    with the title of the Royal Academy for Teaching Exercises. The directors of
                    this academy are eighteen in number, and are persone amongst the most elevated
                    in rank both in the city and county. The school is superintended by two
                    masters.</p>
                <p>The Botanical Garden is about twelve acres in extent. The first ground
                    appropriated to this purpose was in St Ann’s Yards, a spot situated near the
                    North Bridge. From this it was in 1767 removed to Leith Walk, and thence to its
                    present situation in the h∣verleith grounds, on the road from Edinburgh to
                    Newhaven, in 1822-24.</p>
                <p>The new Observatory is βituated on the Calton Hill, and belongs to the
                    Astronomical Institution. It is built after a design by Mr Playfair, in the form
                    of a cross, and is sixty-two feet each way. The centre is surmounted with a
                    dome.</p>
                <p>The Wernerian Natural History Society is an unincorporated association, formed in
                    1808 for the promotion of the study of natural history. The name was assumed
                    from Werner, the distinguished mineralogist. It has associate and corresponding
                    members, and holds its meetings in the university buildings.</p>
                <p>Besides those already mentioned, there are a number of other societies, namely,
                    the tlinian Society, instituted in 1823; the Diagnostic Society, institutedin
                    1816; the MedicoChirurgical Society; the Royal Physical Society; the Royal

                    Edinburgh Ethical Society, for the study and practical application of
                    phrenology, instituted in the same year. There are various other societies and
                    clubs, which have been established from time to time in the Scottish metropolis,
                    but they are of a character too unimportant to require notice in this place.</p>
                <p>ín addition to these, there are several associations of a literary nature. The
                    principal is the Edinburgh Subscription Library. This library was instituted in
                    the year 1794, and is the property of a body of subscribers, whose entrymoney is
                    twelve guineas, and who pay an annual fee of one guinea. The others are, the
                    Select Subscription Library, instituted in 1800; the Edinburgh Subscription and
                    Circulating Select Library; the Edinburgh Mechanics’ Subscription Library,

                    Record Office and Library, instituted in 1828.</p>
                <p>The chief of the associations for religious purposes is the Society for
                    Propagating Christian Knowledge, instituted in 1701, and incorporated by a
                    charter of Queen Anne in 1709. The others are, The Scottish Bible Society; the
                    Edinburgh Auxiliary Bible Society; the Edinburgh Auxiliary Naval and Military
                    Bible Society; the Scottish Missionary Society; the Edinburgh Auxiliary Church

                    the Religious Interests of Scottish Settlers in British North America; and a few
                    others.</p>
                <p>Besides these there are several societies who associate the promotion of
                    education in particular places with religious purposes, and a number of branches
                    of different English societies for the accomplishment of similar objects.</p>
                <p>Heriot’s Hospital was founded about the beginning of the seventeenth century. The
                    founder, George Heriot, ι was born in the parish of Gladsmuir, and in the year
                    1597 he was appointed goldsmith and jeweller to James VI. He died in London,
                    whither he had removed on the accession of James to the English throne, on the
                    12th of February 1624, leaving a fortune, it is supposed, of not less than
                    L.50,000.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328660" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8660-0425"/>
                <p>Of this sum L.23,625. 10s. 3∣d. were, by his bequest, appropriated to the
                    founding and endowing of the hospital which bears his name, for the maintenance
                    and education of children, the sons of burgesses of the city “who are not able
                    to maintain them.” The magistrates, town council, and ministers of the town,
                    were nominated the governors; and certain trustees were appointed to superintend
                    the execution of the will. The building of the hospital, which is from a design
                    by Inigo Jones, was begun in 1628, and, after some interruptions, completed in
                    1650, at an expense altogether of L.30,000. It was not however opened for its
                    legitimate purpose till 1659, when thirty boys only were admitted. There are now
                    one hundred and eighty on the establishment, all of whom are comfortably lodged,
                    fed, and clothed, and every pains bestowed upon their education, which
                    comprehends Greek, Latin, English, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping,
                    mathematics, and geography. On leaving the hospital they are furnished with a
                    liberal supply of articles of dress, of their own choosing; and such of them as
                    are apprenticed to trades receive an apprentice fee of L.50, besides an
                    allowance of clothing at the expiration of their indentures. Boys who
                    distinguish themselves by their literary attainments, and who are qualified to
                    enter the university with a view to the learned professions, receive bursaries
                    of L.30 per annum for four years. Ten other bursaries of L.20 each, for the same
                    period, are bestowed upon young men unconnected with the hospital who give
                    proofs of superior talents. Boys are not admitted under seven years of age, and
                    generally leave it at fourteen. The hospital is situated in the southern part of
                    the town, and is one of the most remarkable buildings connected with the city.
                    It is three stories in height in the central parts, and four stories at the
                    corners, with an interior quadrangle or court. In 1832-33, the structure was
                    improved in its external appearance, and a lodge was erected at the principal
                    entrance, which is a beautiful miniature of the hospital.</p>
                <p>The founder of George Watson’s Hospital died in 1723, leaving the sum of L.
                    12,000 sterling for the erection of an hospital for the maintenance and
                    education of the children and grandchildren of decayed merchants in Edinburgh.
                    The will of the donor, however, was not acted upon till 1738, when the original
                    sum had accumulated to L.20,000. In 1721 twelve boys were admitted: and these
                    have now been increased to eighty. In point of lodging, education, and
                    otherwise, they are upon much the same footing as in Heriot’s Hospital. On
                    leaving the house they receive an apprentice fee of L.10 per annum for five
                    years; and on attaining twenty-five years of age, if unmarried and able to show
                    testimonials of good behaviour, they receive a premium of L.50. Boys preferring
                    a college education receive L.20 per annum for six years. The managers are the
                    master and twelve assistants of the Merchant Company, with the treasurer, four
                    old bailies, the old dean of guild, and the two ministers of the Old Kirk
                    parish.</p>
                <p>In 1759 John Watson, writer to the signet in Edinburgh, bequeathed the whole of
                    his property to trustees, to be laid out in such pious and charitable purposes
                    within the city as they might think proper. In 1781 this fund amounted to
                    L.4721. 5s. 6d. From that period, by the excellent management of the trustees,
                    it accumulated to upwards of L.90,000. As the donor had not pointed out any
                    particular mode of appropriating his bequest, the trustees originally
                    contemplated the institution of a foundling hospital; but they finally
                    determined on erecting an edifice appropriated “for the maintenance and
                    education of destitute children, and bringing them up lobe useful members of
                    society, and also for assisting in their outset in life such of them as may be
                    thought to deserve and require such aid.” A splendid and extensive building, in
                    the Grecian style of architecture, after a design by Mr Burn, has accordingly
                    been erected for the purpose, on the Dean grounds, to the westward of the city.
                    Children of both sexes are here maintained and educated; the girls, however, are
                    only instructed in English, writing, and arithmetic.</p>
                <p>The Merchant Maiden Hospital originated in 1695, and was incorporated by an act
                    of parliament in 1707. Its objects are the maintenance and education of the
                    daughters of merchant burgesses in the city, who are instructed in English,
                    writing, arithmetic, geography, French, and needlework. It contains nearly a
                    hundred inmates, who are received at from seven to eleven years of age, and who
                    go out at seventeen. On leaving the establishment, each receives the sum of L.9.
                    6s. 8d. The new hospital is of Grecian architecture, and cost L.12,250. It was
                    founded in 1816, and measures a hundred and eighty feet in length by nearly
                    sixty in breadth, with a porticoin front, it is situated near the Meadows.</p>
                <p>The Trades' Maiden Hospital, for the maintenance and education of the
                    daughters∙⅛f decayed tradesmen in Edinburgh, was begun in 1704, and its
                    governors were incorporated in 1707. It was founded and· endowed by the trades
                    of the city, and since its institution it has supported about fifty girls.</p>
                <p>The Orphan Hospital was incorporated by a charter of George II. granted in 1742.
                    It receives orphans from all parts of the country, and generally maintains and
                    educates about one hundred and fifty children of both sexes. A very elegant
                    building, designed by Mr Hamilton, for this institution, has just been finished
                    (1833), on the property of Dean, near John Watson’s Hospital.</p>
                <p>James Donaldson, Esq. of Edinburgh, left at his death in 1830, about L.240,000 to
                    six trustees, for the purpose of endowing an hospital for boys, to be called
                    Donaldson’s Hospital. An establishment of this kind is therefore about to be
                    commenced.</p>
                <p>The Trinity Hospital, the oldest charitable institution in the city, was founded
                    by Mary of Gueldres in the year 1461. The number of persons maintained in the
                    house is at present forty; and there are besides about one hundred
                    out-pensioners. The funds of the institution consist of lands in the county of
                    Edinburgh, heritable property in the city and in the town of Leith, and money in
                    bonds. The magistrates and town council are the governors, and there are regular
                    office-bearers and house-directors.</p>
                <p>James Gillespie, the founder of the hospital known by his name, was a shopkeeper
                    in Edinburgh, and, by a will dated 1796, devoted the greater part of his
                    property to endow an hospital for the maintenance of indigent old men and women,
                    and for the elementary education of one hundred poor boys. A house for this
                    purpose was accordingly erected in 1801. The number of its inmates is about
                    forty. Its governors are, the master and twelve assistants of the Merchant
                    Company, four old bailies, the old dean of guild, and the ministers of the
                    Tolbooth and St Stephen’s Churches. The name of Gillespie has a preference in
                    admission.</p>
                <p>The principal resources for the support of the poor are an assessment, and the
                    collections made at church doors. The amount of money collected for their use in
                    1833 was L.13,479. 19s. 4d., whereas in 1814 it was only L.6943. 19s. 10d.
                    Edinburgh, as regards the poor, is divided into three districts, the ancient and
                    extended royalty, the parish of St Cuthbert's, and the Canongate, each of which
                    has a house for the reception of paupers, with peculiar funds and a separate
                    board of management. The City Poors-house, which was erected in 1743, supports
                    six hundred persons within doors, affords regular aid to upwards of a thousand,
                    grants to others temporary relief, ana maintains<pb break="no"

                    thirty children at nurse. The expense incurred for each individual in the
                    establishment is about L.8 per annum.</p>
                <p>Besides these public institutions for the relief of the poor, there are several
                    other charitable associations of a private nature. The principal are, the
                    Society for the Suppression of Begging; the Benevolent Strangers’ Friend
                    Society, instituted in 1816; a Society for the Relief of the Destitute Sick,
                    instituted in 1785; a Society for the Relief of Indigent Old Men, instituted in
                    1806; two similar institutions for the Relief of Indigent Old Women, instituted
                    in 1797; the Edinburgh and Leith Seamen’s Friend Society, for relieving poor
                    shipw recked or distressed seamen; and the Orkney and Zetland Society, for
                    relieving such distressed natives of these islands as casually find their way to
                    Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>The Royal Infirmary was established in Edinburgh in the year 1736. The building,
                    which is situated in Infirmary Street, consists of a body and two wings, all of
                    four stories, the floors of which are divided into wards fitted up with ranges
                    of beds sufficient to accommodate 230 patients. It also contains a theatre for
                    chirurgical operations, in which 200 students can attend. All classes of persons
                    are admissible into the Infirmary, on a guarantee being given that in case of
                    death their bodies shall be removed. Patients suffering from accidental injuries
                    are admitted without any stipulation. The expense incurred by this institution
                    is liquidated by endowments, private subscriptions, <hi rend="italic"
                    >post-mortem</hi> bequests, and collections at the doors of churches and chapels
                    of all persuasions.</p>
                <p>The Lying-in Hospital is adapted to the reception of all poor and unfortunate
                    females requiring aid. and having no home at which they can be attended to.
                    Besides this there are several other institutions of a similar nature, without
                    hospitals, such as the Edinburgh General Dispensary and In-lying Institution;
                    the Maternity Charity; the Edinburgh Lying-in Institution for delivering poor
                    married women at their own houses, instituted in 1824; the Edinburgh New Town
                    Lying-in Institution, instituted in 1825; and the Society for Relief of Poor
                    Married Women of respectable character when in Child-bed, instituted in
                    1821.</p>
                <p>The Public Dispensary, the oldest institution of this kind in the city, was
                    founded in 1776. Besides this there are the following local dispensaries: The
                    New Town Dispensary, instituted in 1815; the Western General Dispensary,
                    instituted in 1830; the Eye Dispensary of Edinburgh; the Edinburgh Western
                    Dispensary for Diseases of the Eye and Ear; and the Institution for Relief of
                    Incurables. All these benevolent establishments afford medicines and advice to
                    the poor gratis.</p>
                <p>The Magdalen Asylum, which has for its object the reclaiming of unfortunate
                    females, was founded in the year 1797. From fifty to sixty persons can be
                    accommodated in the asylum, where they are all kept employed at useful
                    occupations. The income of the house for the year ending in 1831 amounted to
                    L.1183. The building is situated in the Canongate.</p>
                <p>The Asylum for the Blind, situated in Nicoson Street, was opened in 1793, and is
                    chiefly supported by voluntary subscription. Another for females, the former
                    being confined to males, was established in 1822. The men are constantly
                    employed in making mattresses, cushions, baskets, and other articles; the
                    females in sewing and knitting. The number of inmates in these establishments is
                    about 120, who receive instruction, partly according to the Abbé Sicard’s plan,
                    and partly according to methods which have been devised in the institution. See
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Blind.</hi></p>
                <p>The Deaf and Dumb Institution, occupying a large edifice in the northern part of
                    the New Town, was established in 1810, and contains upwards of seventy boys and
                    girls, who receive the elementary and most useful branches of education. See
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Deaf and Dumb.</hi></p>
                <p>The Lunatic Asylum, situated at Morningside, was opened for patients in 1813. The
                    expense of its erection was defrayed by private subscriptions, and a grant by
                    government of L.2000 from the forfeited estates. The establishment is managed by
                    a body of directors and two physicians and surgeons. Inmates are received on
                    paving a board regulated in amount by circumstances.</p>
                <p>The most prominent of the provident and insurance societies is the Ministers’
                    Widows’ Fund, instituted in the year 1744. From this fund the widows of
                    clergymen receive annuities for life, regulated in amount by the annual
                    contribution previously made, and which varies from L.3. 3s. to L.7. 17s. 6d.
                    The management of this fund is entrusted to the presbytery of Edinburgh and the
                    professors of the university. The next in importance is a society formed for the
                    benefit of the sons of the clergy, instituted in 1790. Another has recently been
                    formed for the benefit of the daughters of the clergy. There are, besides, a
                    Friendly Society of the Ministers of the Relief Synod, instituted in 1790; a
                    Friendly Society of Dissenting Ministers, instituted in 1797; a society for the
                    management of the Episcopal Fund, for affording small additions to the stipends
                    of the poorer clergy of the Episcopal communion; a Medical Provident Institution
                    of Scotland, instituted in 1826; and a Society for Relief of the Widows and
                    Children of Burgh and Parochial Schoolmasters, instituted in 1807. There are
                    likewise a variety of humbler associations, on various principles, throughout
                    the city, as well as a large number of insurance companies.</p>
                <p>Although not an extensive trading or commercial town, Edinburgh exerts great
                    influence over all branches of commerce in Scotland, by means of its banking
                    associations, which supply capital to almost every seat of industry throughout
                    the country. The oldest institution of this description is</p>
                <p>The Bank of Scotland, which was established at Edinburgh in 1695, by charter from
                    William 111. and the Scottish parliament. The capital stock of the company was
                    originally L.10U,000 sterling, raised by shares differing in amount from L.83.
                    6s. 8d. to twenty times that sum. The capital has since been raised to a million
                    and a half sterling. Notes were first issued by this bank in 1704. The
                    establishment occupies a large and conspicuous building near the head of the
                    Earthen Mound.</p>
                <p>The Royal Bank of Scotland was instituted in 1727, by royal charter. Its original
                    capital was L.111,000 sterling. In 1738 this capital was raised to L.150,000,
                    and subsequently to L.2,000,000. The banking house is situated in St Andrew
                    Square, in the building formerly occupied by the Excise Office.</p>
                <p>The British Linen Company’s Bank was established in 1746, with a capital of L.
                    100,000. This capital has now increased to L.500,000. The banking house is also
                    situated in St Andrew Square.</p>
                <p>All the other banks in Edinburgh belong either to private persons or to
                    joint-stock companies. Of the former there are seven, only two of which issue
                    notes; these are, Sir William Forbes and Co. and Ramsays, Bonars, and Co. The
                    joint-stock banks are, the Commercial Banking Company of Scotland, instituted in
                    1810; and the National Bank of Scotland, instituted in 1825, which now possesses
                    a charter of incorporation.</p>
                <p>The present Theatre Royal was built shortly after the commencement of the New
                    Town, in 1768. Previously to this period the theatrical performances of the city
                    were exhibited in the Canoniale, where a play-house was erected in 1746, in
                    opposition to a rival establishment in the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328686"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-8686-0427"/>Cowgate. The present house, although rather small,
                    and externally of a very plain appearance, is in its internal arrangements one
                    of the neatest and most commodious houses in Britain. The company of actors
                    established here is generally considered as the best to be met with out of
                    London. But, though for many years under able management, the fortunes of the
                    establishment are by no means in a flourishing state. It is situated at the
                    extremity of the North Bridge, adjacent to Princes Street. There is also a Minor
                    or Summer Theatre, called the Adelphi, which is situated at the head of Leith
                    Walk.</p>
                <p>Assemblies and balls, under the patronage of ladies of distinction, are held
                    every winter and spring in a large building in George Street, called the
                    Assembly Rooms, erected in 1787. This ediĥce has a plain external appearance,
                    relieved, however, by a porticoand pillars in front. Its principal apartment
                    measures ninety-two feet in length by forty-two in breadth and forty in height,
                    and is occasionally used for concerts, public meetings, and other purposes.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most beautiful feature of Edinburgh in its modern state consists in
                    the highly ornamental pleasuregrounds which occupy the open spaces between the
                    Old and New Town, as well as between the latter and the second New Town. The low
                    grounds to the east and west of the Earthen Mound continued for about fifty
                    years after the commencement of the New Town in a very marshy and unprofitable
                    condition. At length, in 1821, under the authority of an act of parliament, the
                    ground on the west was drained, inclosed, laid out, planted, and highly
                    beautified with walks, and has since been opened to the proprietors or tenants
                    of property in Princes Street, or others, on payment of an annual fee. In
                    1832-33 the ground on the east was similarly inclosed and beautified. Before the
                    year 1820 the greater part of the ground north of Quecu Street was inclosed and
                    laid out in gardens or promenades in the same tasteful and pleasing style.</p>
                <p>In the year 1722 a marshy ground, part of the ancient Boroughmuir, in the
                    southern environs of the city, was inclosed, drained, and traversed by extensive
                    broad walks, skirted with trees, for the accommodation of the citizens. These
                    public grounds, which receive the appellation of the Meadows, and bear some
                    resemblance to St James’ Park in London, are bordered with extensive open downs,
                    called Burntsfield Links, which are also open to the public, and form a place of
                    agreeable recreation for youth.</p>
                <p>Edinburgh has for some time been distinguished as a mart of literature, and as a
                    place the inhabitants of which are noted for cultivated tastes and habits. This
                    character, however, is not of much older date than the latter part of the
                    eighteenth century. Previously to that time it seldom produced works of merit.
                    The early editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica were the first large works
                    which issued from the Edinburgh press. But the era of a new system of publishing
                    commenced with the establishment of the Edinburgh Review in the year 1802. The
                    person to whom Edinburgh has latterly been most indebted for an increase of its
                    literary reputation was Sir Walter Scott, whose poetical productions appeared at
                    intervals from 1802 till 1812, and whose novels and tales began to be published
                    in 1814. The principal periodical works now published in Edinburgh are, the
                    Edinburgh Review, the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, the Journal of
                    Agriculture, and the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, quarterly; the
                    Presbyterian Review every two months; Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine, Tait’s
                    Edinburgh Magazine, the Christian Instructor, the United Secession Magazine, and
                    the Christian Herald, monthly; and the Edinburgh Almanack annually. There are
                    ten newspapers published in Edinburgh, namely, the Caledonian Mercury, and
                    Edinburgh Evening Courant, on Monday, Thursday, and Saturday; the Gazette, the
                    Observer, and the Advertiser, on Tuesday and Friday; the Scotsman on Wednesday
                    and Saturday; the Weckly Journal on Wednesday; and the Weckly Chronicle, the
                    Saturday Evening Post, and the Edinburgl⅛ Leith, and Glasgow Advertiser, a paper
                    solely devoted to advertisements, and distributed gratis, on Saturday.</p>
                <p>The public market-day is Wednesday, when there is a large open market held for
                    the sale of cattle, sheep, corn, and other agricultural produce. The spacious
                    street called the Grassmarket is the chief place to which stock is brought for
                    sale. At its western extremity there is a large granary, the lower part of which
                    is open for the exposure of grain in sacks. This edifice was reared in 1819, and
                    is ornamented with a small spire and clock. Once a year, at the beginning of
                    November, there is a large sheep, cattle, and horse market held in the vicinity
                    of the city, called <hi rend="italic">All Jiallow Fair,</hi> being the feast of
                    <hi rend="italic">All Sainis.</hi></p>
                <p>Edinburgh possesses excellent butcher-meat, fish, and vegetable markets. They are
                    situated in the centre of the town, and consist of a series of descending open
                    areas or terraces, connected by flights of steps from the back of the High
                    Street to the bottom of the valley of the North Loch, below the North Bridge.
                    These markets, all the property of the burgh, are exceedingly well supplied with
                    the various articles of consumption for which they are respectively
                    appropriated. There is another market of a similar nature, though on a more
                    limited scale, in Nicoson Street; and a very spacious one, the property of a
                    private individual, near Stockbridge, at the north-west extremity of the New
                    Town.</p>
                <p>The metropolis is abundantly supplied with coal, chiefly by means of the Union
                    Canal, from pits in the west of Scotland, and by a railway leading from the pits
                    near Ualkeith to its termination at St Leonards. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Edinburghshire.)</hi></p>
                <p>Edinburgh possesses an abundant supply of water from the Crawley Spring in the
                    Pentland Hills. This was effected by a joint-stock company, incorporated by act
                    of parliament in 1819. The cost of laying new pipes, and other matters connected
                    with the introduction of the new springs, amounted to nearly L.200,000. Families
                    are supplied with small service-pipes, by paying to the company a certain duty
                    on their rental.</p>
                <p>Edinburgh is lighted with coal gas, manufactured by a joint-stock company
                    associated in 1817, and incorporated in 1818, with a capital of L.1OÜ,UÜ(),
                    raised by shares ol L.25 each. The streets and shops were first illuminated with
                    this brilliant light in 1818. An oil-gas company, instituted in 1826, not having
                    succeeded in its objects, was, after a short trial, incorporated with the
                    coal-gas company.</p>
                <p>The ancient civic establishment of Edinburgh was remodelled in 1833 by the act of
                    parliament for reforming the royal burghs of Scotland. It possesses a town
                    council, consisting of thirty-one members chosen by the qualified voters for
                    members of parliament in their respective wards or districts; of a
                    deacon-convener elected by the incorporated trades; and of a dean of guild,
                    chosen by the incorporation of guildry. The council so composed elects a lord
                    provost and four bailies, who compose the magistracy. The magistrates, in virtue
                    of former privileges, hold certain civil and criminal courts, with the
                    assistance of assessors or legal advisers. In 1833 the funds of the civic
                    incorporation were placed under the control of a body of trustees appointed by
                    act of parliament, for the behoof of creditors. In virtue of the act for
                    reforming the system of parliamentary representation, passed in 1832, Edinburgh
                    and its immediate suburbs return two members to parliament.</p>

                <p>The merchants of Edinburgh form a body, called the Merchant Company, incorporated
                    by a charter of Charles II. in 1681. It possesses the management of several
                    charitable institutions, and is active in superintending measures connected with
                    the commercial character of the city. Its business is conducted by a master,
                    treasurer, and twelve assistants, and their hall of meeting is a spacious
                    apartment in Hunter Square.</p>
                <p>The High Constables are a body of individuals appointed to support the authority
                    of the magistracy, and to assist in maintaining the public peace of the city.
                    They are generally respectable shopkeepers, and are qualified by being
                    burgesses, and having been in business for three years.</p>
                <p>Till the year 1805 the city was protected only by a feeble body of old men in the
                    garb of soldiers, entitled the City Guard, the remains of a civic defensive
                    force originally raised in 1514, after the fatal battle of Flodden. In 1805 a
                    regular police establishment was formed, and the city guard was finally
                    dissolved in 1817. The police establishment was remodelled in 1812, and latterly
                    in 1822 and 1832, by acts of parliament each time. The establishment consists of
                    thirty-two general commissioners elected by the inhabitants of the same number
                    of wards, qualified to vote by paying a certain rent. The body of general
                    commissioners is increased by sixteen <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> members,
                    as the provost and magistrates, the sherifΓs, and certain other functionaries.
                    Under this body there is an executive police, with a superintendent; and a
                    criminal court is held daily on the plan of that at Bow Street in London, and in
                    which a town bailie officiates as magistrate or judge, in all cases which occur
                    within the ancient and extended royalty; whilst cases originating in that
                    portion of the city included between the exterior limits of the royalty and the
                    general police boundary fall under the cognisance of the sheriff-substitute.
                    Edinburgh is now in all its parts well watched, lighted, and cleaned; and the
                    expenditure for these and other public purposes amounted in the year ending at
                    Whitsunday 1833, to L.31,038. 6s. 6d. An assessment on the inhabitants, of about
                    Is. 2d. per ∣tound on the rental, supplies the ordinary revenue of the
                    establishment. The head police-office is a large building within a small court
                    near the Cross.</p>
                <p>Since the destruction of the old tolbooth, an extensive building, situated on the
                    Calton Hill, fronting the road which sweeps around that eminence, has been
                    provided as the common town and county jail. It was erected in 1817, and is
                    built in a castellated form, in the Saxon style of architecture, after a plan by
                    Mr Archibald Elliot. It is 196 feet in length by forty feet in breadth, and is
                    four stories in height. The interior exhibits a series of corridors opening upon
                    small cells eight feet by six, and forty-eight in number; there is also a chapel
                    on the second floor. This jail at present affords accommodation for debtors, as
                    well as offenders of every description, who are to a certain extent classified,
                    and furnished with airing grounds. A lock-up house, or jail for the confinement
                    of criminals during short periods, adjoins the County Hall in the High
                    Street.</p>
                <p>The Bridewell stands adjacent to the jail on the east. It is an edifice of a
                    semicircular form, within an open court, and was constructed in 1791, upon the
                    panoptico principle, after a plan by Mr Robert Adam. The expenses of the
                    establishment are defrayed partly by assessments, and partly by the work of the
                    inmates.</p>
                <p>The Canongate Jail is an old-fashioned plain edifice of the time of James VI. It
                    is appropriated exclusively for the incarceration of debtors, and is under the
                    jurisdiction of the magistracy of Canongate.</p>
                <p>The public business connected with the civic establishment or corporation is
                    conducted in the Royal Exchange Buildings. The public business of the county,
                    and the sittings of the sheriff and justices, take place in the County Hall,
                    adjacent to the Parliament House. It was erected in 1819, at an expense of
                    L.15,000, but is shortly to be removed in order to make way for the approach by
                    the bridge leading from the Lawnmarket towards the south.</p>
                <p>The superiority of the Canongate jurisdiction, which formerly belonged to the
                    abbot of Holyrood, was purchased by the town of Edinburgh from the Earl of
                    Roxburgh, into whose hands it had fallen, in the year 1636. Since that period
                    the burgh of Canongate has been governed by baron bailies appointed by the town
                    council out of their own body, and by two resident bailies, also appointed by
                    the same authority on the recommendation of the baron bailies. In a similar
                    manner bailies are appointed to the subordinate districts of Easter and Wester
                    Portsburgh. Edinburgh has likewise possessed for a long period a superiority
                    over the port of Leith. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Leith.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1755, shortly before the commencement of the New Town, Edinburgh had a
                    population amounting to 57,195; in 1775 it was computed at 70,430; and in 1791
                    it had risen to about 80,000. In 1801, by parliamentary census, the amount was
                    82,560; in 1811 it was 102,987; in 1821 it was 138,235; but in these latter
                    enumerations the population of Leith was included. In 1831 the population was as
                    follows:</p>
