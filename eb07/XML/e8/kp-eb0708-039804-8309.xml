                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">ECLOGUE</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Poetry,</hi> a kind of
                    pastoral composition, in which shepherds are introduced conversing together. The
                    word is formed from the Greek ιxaoyn <hi rend="italic">choice</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> so that, according to the etymology, eclogue should be a
                    select or choice piece; but custom has assigned to it a further signification,
                    namely, a little elegant composition in a simple, natural style and manner.</p>
                <p>Idyllion and eclogue, in their primary sense, are the same. Thus the <hi
                    rend="italic">idyllia,</hi> ι∕3vλλ∕α, of Theocritus, are pieces written
                    perfectly in the same vein with the <hi rend="italic">ecloga:</hi> of Virgil.
                    But custom has made a difference between them, and appropriated the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">eclogue</hi> to pieces in which shepherds are introduced speaking;
                    and <hi rend="italic">idyllion</hi> to those written,like the eclogue, in a
                    simple, natural style, but without any pastoral interlocutors.</p>
                <p>Of the Idyl, as the word is generally written, Germany in particular, amongst
                    modern nations, has produced some highly finished specimens. England can boast
                    of comparatively few eclogues so called. Those of Collins are esteemed the
                    best.</p>
                <p>economists.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> is not generally known how much the science of
                    politics, that master science, the late offspring of the improved reason of
                    modern times, is indebted to the philosophers who are known to the world by the
                    title of economists. They were, it is true, preceded in this country by Hobbes
                    and by Locke, and in France by Montesquieu; but in analysing the frame of civil
                    society, they added considerable lights to those which had been communicated by
                    their predecessors; and they attempted to point out the mode of combining the
                    various springs of social action in a more liberal and beneficent system than
                    had yet been recommended to the world.</p>
                <p>It is worthy of remark, that the merits of this sect, in the secondary department
                    of <hi rend="italic">political economy,</hi> have so much obscured their
                    important speculations on the great questions respecting the best possible order
                    capable of being given to society, that they are, in this country at least,
                    wholly unknown, except in the character of political economists; though their
                    political economy formed only a small and subordinate branch of their entire
                    system; and, what is indeed extraordinary, we know not a book in the English
                    language in which an account of that system is to be found.</p>
                <p>This article is intended to contain, 1<hi rend="italic">st,</hi> the history of
                    the sect; ’ <hi rend="italic">idly,</hi> an account of their system; and, <hi
                    rend="italic">idly,</hi> some observations, pointing out the principal errors
                    into which they have fallen.</p>
                <p>I. Μ. de Gournay appears to have been the first man in France who had formed any
                    systematic notions on the real principles of trade. It is true, indeed, that
                    Fenelon had recommended, on the direct suggestion of good sense, detached from
                    theory, the practice of freedom of trade. The Marquis d’Argenson was celebrated
                    for the sound and important maxim, <hi rend="italic">Pas trop gouverner;</hi>
                    and the memorable advice of the merchants to the meddling Colbert was well
                    known, <hi rend="italic">Laissez-nous</hi><hi rend="italic">faire.</hi> Another
                    of the more peculiar doctrines of the economists was expressed in the famous
                    maxim of the great Due de Sully, <hi rend="italic">Que le labourage et le
                    pâturage sont les manunelles de</hi><hi rend="italic">ľétat</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and Montesquieu had brightly but superficially run over
                    several of the questions relative to trade.</p>
                <p>For such lights as Μ. de Gournay did not derive from his own reflections, he
                    seems to have been chiefly indebted to the writers of England; but there appears
                    some reason to conclude that the best of these had not fallen in his way. We do
                    not perceive, for example, any sign of acquaintance with the writings of
                    Locke.</p>
                <p>Jean-Claude-Maria Vincent, Seigneur de Gournay, was an extraordinary man for the
                    age and country in which he was produced. He was born at St Malo, in the month
                    of May 1712, the son of Claude Vincent, one of the most considerable merchants
                    of the place. Destined to commerce by his parents, he was sent to Cadiz when
                    scarcely seventeen years of age. His vigilant attention to business did not
                    hinder him from finding time, well husbanded and diligently applied, not only
                    for storing his mind with general knowledge, but for unravelling the
                    combinations of commerce, and ascertaining its elementary principles. After he
                    had raised himself to great eminence as a merchant, and to a high reputation for
                    knowledge of the principles of commerce, the ministers of France conceived the
                    design of turning his knowledge to advantage in the office of intendant of
                    commerce, as they call it, to which he was raised in 1751.</p>
                <p>No sooner was Μ. de Gournay invested with his office, than he began to wage war
                    with the established system of regulations and restrictions, which the
                    experience of twenty years of mercantile practice the most varied and the most
                    extensive, discussions with the most intelligent merchants of Holland and of
                    England, the perusal of the best writers on the subject, and the impartial
                    application of his own philosophical thoughts, had all conspired to make him
                    regard as a source, not of national advantage, but of continual vexation and
                    hardship to individuals, and of poverty to the state. “He was astonished,” says
                    Μ. Turgot, “to find that a citizen could neither make nor sell a commodity,
                    without having purchased a privilege, by getting himself made, at a great
                    expense, a member of some corporation; that if he made a piece of cloth, for
                    example, of any quantity and quality different from those commanded in certain
                    regulations, instead of being allowed to sell it to those purchasers whom such
                    quantity and quality suited the best, he should be condemned to see it cut in
                    pieces, and to pay a fine heavy enough to reduce a whole family to beggary. He
                    could not conceive <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328322"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-8322-0399"/>how, in a country where the succession to titles,
                    to estates, and even to the crown itself, rested upon custom, and ' where the
                    application of even the punishment of death was rarely guided by any written
                    definitions, the government should have thought proper to fix by written laws
                    the length and breadth of each piece of cloth, and the number of threads which
                    it ought to contain. Ĳe was not less astonished to see the government take in
                    hand to regulate the supply of commodities; proscribe one sort of industry in
                    order to make another flourish; shackle with peculiar restrictions the sale of
                    the most necessary articles of subsistence; prohibit the storing of commodities,
                    of which the quantity produced varies greatly from year to year, while the
                    quantity required for consumption is pretty nearly the same; restrain the export
                    and import of a commodity subject to the greatest fluctuation of price; and
                    dream of insuring the plentiful supply of corn by rendering the condition of the
                    labourer more uncertain and more wretched than that of any other part of the
                    community.” <hi rend="italic">(Oeuvres</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi> Μ. Turgot,
                    iii. 333.)</p>
                <p>It may easily be imagined that Μ. de Gournay would find himself encountered by
                    opposition the moment he endeavoured to introduce his beneficial views into
                    practice. The grand instruments of this opposition were certain words and
                    phrases, which have been used to screen misrule in every country in which the
                    voice of reform has begun to be raised. “Μ. de Gournay," says Turgot, “was
                    opposed, under the names of an * innovator’ and a ‘ theorist,’ for endeavouring
                    to develop the principles which experience had taught him, and which he found
                    universally recognised by the most enlightened merchants of every part of the
                    world among whom he had lived. The principles marked out for reprobation, under
                    the title of the ‘ new system,’ appeared to him to be exactly the principles of
                    plain good sense. The whole of this system was founded upon the certain maxim,
                    that, in general, each man is a better judge of his own interest, than another
                    man to whom it is a matter of indifference. From this Μ. de Gournay concluded,
                    that, when the interest of individuals is precisely the same with the general
                    interest, the best thing to be done is, to leave every man at liberty to do what
                    he likes. Now he held it as impossible, that in commerce, fairly left to itself,
                    the interest of the individual should not coincide with the interest of the
                    community.” The proof which Μ. Turgot gives of the fundamental proposition, that
                    the interest of the individual and of the community in a free commerce are the
                    same, we need not repeat; because it can neither be rendered more clear nor more
                    cogent than it is already in works with which every person is familiar, who is
                    at all conversant with political science.</p>
                <p>“From this principle Μ. de Gournay concluded, that the sole duties of government
                    with regard to commerce are: 1. To render to all the branches of industry that
                    precious liberty, of which the prejudices of barbarous times, the proneness of
                    governments to lend themselves to the gratification of individual interests, and
                    the pursuit of a mistaken good, have conspired to deprive them: 2. To facilitate
                    the exercise of industry and ingenuity to every member of the community,
                    exciting thereby the greatest competition among sellers, and ensuring the
                    greatest perfection and cheapness of the commodities sold: 3. To admit the
                    greatest competition among buyers, by opening to the seller every possible
                    market; the sole means of encouraging reproduction, which hence derives its only
                    reward: 4. To remove every obstacle by which the progress of industry is
                    retarded, by depriving it of its natural reward.”</p>
                <p>It is to Μ. de Gournay, therefore, that Turgot ascribes the origin of political
                    economy in France. “It is to the ardour,” says he, “with which Μ. de Gournay
                    endeavoured to direct to the study of commerce and of political economy, all the
                    talent which he was able to discover, and to the facility with which he
                    communicated the lights which he himself had acquired, that we ought to ascribe
                    the happy fermentation which for some years has been excited on these important
                    subjects; a fermentation which arose two or three years after Μ. de Gournay was
                    intendant of commerce, and has since that time procured us several works
                    calculated to wipe off from our nation that reproach of frivolity, which, by its
                    indifference for the more useful studies, it had but too justly incurred.”</p>
                <p>Francis Quesnay was born in the village of Ecquevi)le in the year 1694. According
                    to Μ. Dupont de Nemours, the editor and commentator of the works of Turgot, and
                    a zealous economist, he was the son of a small proprietor, who cultivated his
                    own little property; and he was eminently indebted to his mother for the fashion
                    of his mind. Though he was educated as a physician, and rose to such eminence in
                    his profession as to be first physician to the king, the early occupation of his
                    mind on the business of agriculture had given the current of his thoughts a
                    permanent direction; and when he was summoned to reflect on the sources of
                    wealth, by the discussions probably to which the speculations of Μ. de Gournay
                    had given birth, agriculture was the object on which his attention was more
                    particularly fixed. He produced several works, on different points of the
                    science and practice of medicine; and it was only at a late period of life that
                    his works on political economy appeared. His chief production on this subject,
                    <hi rend="italic">Physiocratic,</hi><hi rend="italic">ou du Gouvernement
                    le</hi><hi rend="italic">plus</hi><hi rend="italic">avantageux au</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">genre</hi><hi rend="italic">humain,</hi> was first published in
                    1768. Not only had the speculations which he broached, and which he propagated
                    with much fervour and diligence, considerable success in the world, but he had
                    the fortune to gain a considerable number of proselytes, who exerted themselves
                    with an ardour for the diffusion of his doctrine, and with a devotion to the
                    opinions of their master, which more resembled the enthusiasm of the votaries of
                    a new religion, or that of the followers of some of the ancient philosophers,
                    than the indifference with which new speculations in philosophy have on all
                    other occasions been received in modern Europe; and which gave to the economists
                    more of the character of a sect or a school, than has appeared to belong to
                    those who have in recent times concurred in any other system of philosophical
                    opinion.</p>
                <p>There was, in truth, in the system of Μ. Quesnay and the other economists, many
                    things well calculated to attract attention and excite enthusiasm. From a few
                    simple principles, they deduced, as they imagined, by a chain of very close and
                    imposing arguments, a system of changes which would easily be introduced,
                    without the smallest interruption to the tranquillity and happiness of the
                    existing generation, calculated to remove from society all the deformities by
                    which it was overspread, and to communicate to the mass of human beings a
                    fulness of happiness hitherto altogether unknown. At this point, therefore, we
                    may close the historical part of this article; for the success of the great work
                    of Dr Adam Smith, in a short time, superseded the <hi rend="italic">political
                    economy</hi> of the sect; and after the political economy was discredited, the
                    rest of their doctrines met with little regard. The memory of them, however, is
                    well worthy of being preserved; and this task we shall now, in as few words as
                    possible, endeavour to perform.</p>
                <p>II. The economists proceeded upon no Utopian plan, which supposes society to be
                    composed of beings different from those with whom we are already acquainted.
                    They took man as he is, a being having wants, and governed by the desire of
                    avoiding pain and obtaining pleasure.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328335" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8335-0400"/>
                <p>Man must have subsistence. Upon this ground they first took their stand. This
                    being allowed, it followed, of course, that whatever was the best means of
                    obtaining subsistence, would command the operations of men as soon as ever it
                    was sufficiently known.</p>
                <p>Of these means, the first and fundamental is the establishment of property. This
                    they proved by convincing arguments. We cannot exist without consuming. The
                    nature of man leads to a rapid multiplication of human beings, and the earth
                    yields a spontaneous nourishment for only a few. To make food keep pace with
                    population, labour must be employed upon the ground. Men would be born for no
                    other purpose than that of destroying one another, if there were not means of
                    increasing the quantity of food in proportion to those that were born. Labour,
                    then, is one of the physical necessities of nature. But if labour be necessary,
                    so is property, because, without property, there can be no labour.</p>
                <p>The proof of this proposition is short and irresistible. Nobody would labour
                    under an assurance that he would derive no advantage from his labour. Nobody
                    would labour without a certain probability that he should enjoy the fruits of
                    his labour. Now, this is property. The only question, then, which remains is,
                    what is the degree of assurance with respect to the fruits of a man’s labour; in
                    other words, what are the laws of property which tend most to secure the
                    benefits which human beings derive from their labour? This, said the economists,
                    is the object and the end of our researches.</p>
                <p>They proceeded in their inquiry by the following steps. As a means to this
                    labour, on which every thing depends, a man must be free to use his natural
                    faculties of labour —his muscular powers. This freedom they called <hi
                    rend="italic">the property of his person.</hi> As another means to the same end,
                    he must be free to use exclusively, and to preserve, what he acquires by his
                    labour. This they call his <hi rend="italic">more-able property.</hi></p>
                <p>Here we see the origin of that to which men have assigned the names of <hi
                    rend="italic">rights</hi> and <hi rend="italic">duties.</hi> The exclusive
                    powers assigned to the man over his person, and over the fruits of his labour,
                    are called his <hi rend="italic">rights.</hi> To allow these exclusive powers,
                    by abstaining from every act which would impair them, is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">duties</hi> of all other men. Here we see, also, that <hi
                    rend="italic">rights</hi> and <hi rend="italic">duties</hi> are reciprocal; that
                    they imply one another, that they are created together, and that the one cannot
                    exist without the other. Destroy the <hi rend="italic">rights</hi> of property
                    in the man, you destroy, by the βame act, the <hi rend="italic">duties</hi> of
                    other men to exclude themselves from what was called his property. Destroy, in
                    the same manner, the <hi rend="italic">duties</hi> of other men to exclude
                    them-βelves from what was called his property, and you destroy, at the same
                    time, his <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to that exclusion. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hights</hi> and <hi rend="italic">duties</hi> are, in fact, but different names
                    given to the same thing, according as it is regarded under one or another of two
                    points of view.</p>
                <p>Another important concatenation is here also to be seen. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rights</hi> are advantages; things to be enjoyed. <hi rend="italic">Duties</hi>
                    are burthens, abstracted from things tobeenjoyed. Why should men accept these
                    burthens, submit to these duties? Why, but because they find their advantage in
                    doing so. It is plain how they find their advantage in doing so, and there is,
                    there can be, no other reason. Men submit to the <hi rend="italic">duties</hi>
                    of respecting other men’s <hi rend="italic">rights,</hi> that they may have <hi
                    rend="italic">rights</hi> themselves. It is good for them to have <hi
                    rend="italic">rights</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> there can be no rights without
                    <hi rend="italic">duties.</hi> It is better to have the <hi rend="italic"
                    >rights</hi> submitting to the <hi rend="italic">duties,</hi> than, by
                    renouncing the <hi rend="italic">duties,</hi> to have no <hi rend="italic"
                    >rights.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">duties</hi> are then the price which is paid
                    for the <hi rend="italic">rights.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">duties</hi> which
                    one man yields to other men, are the price which he pays for having <hi
                    rend="italic">rights</hi> of his own. <hi rend="italic">Deities,</hi> then, are
                    in themselves <hi rend="italic">evils</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and they
                    never ought to exist, except when they are compensated by a greater good. Nobody
                    ought to be subjected to a burthen, which is not, either to himself, or to the
                    community in which he has clubbed his private interests, attended with a good
                    sufficiently great to overbalance the evil which he is made to endure. <hi
                    rend="italic">Utility,</hi> then, is the exclusive foundation of <hi
                    rend="italic">duty.</hi></p>
                <p>Having laid this foundation, the economists proceed.</p>
                <p>On the necessity of subsistence rests the necessity of property, and on the
                    necessity of property rests the necessity of a certain inequality in the
                    conditions of men. This inequality exists, because a good is obtained ’through
                    it, which can in no other way be obtained; and that good the parent of every
                    thing else to which the name of good is applied. “Those who complain of it,”
                    says Mercier de la Riviere, one of the chief expositors of the doctrines of the
                    sect, “see not that it is a link in the chain by which the human species must
                    drag from the abyss of non-production every thing which they enjoy. As soon as I
                    have acquired the <hi rend="italic">exclusive</hi> property of a thing, another
                    man cannot have the property of it at the same time. The law of property is the
                    same for all men; each man, however, acquires in proportion to his faculties of
                    acquiring: but the measure of these is different in different men. And besides
                    this fundamental law, there is, in the whirlpool of accidents, a continual
                    succession of combinations, some more, some less fortunate, which increase the
                    causes of that inequality of acquisition, without which the motives to
                    acquisition cannot exist I admit, however,” he in conclusion adds, “that in any
                    given community, these differences in the possessions of different men may
                    become the source of great disorders, and which augment again these same
                    differences beyond their natural and necessary degree. But what follows from
                    this? That men ought to establish an equality of conditions? Certainly not; for
                    to that end, it would be necessary to destroy all property, and, by consequence,
                    all society: it only follows that they should correct those disorders which make
                    that which is an instrument of good become an instrument of evil: which alters
                    in such a manner the distribution of things, that <hi rend="italic">force</hi>
                    places all the rights on one side and all the duties on the other.”</p>
                <p>We have seen that the necessity of labour to procure the means of life and the
                    means of enjoyment, produced a necessity of <hi rend="italic">property
                    personal</hi> and <hi rend="italic">property moveable,</hi> as the two sorts
                    were named by the economists. The necessity of raising food, as well as the
                    first material of most of the other articles of human enjoyment, by labour upon
                    the <hi rend="italic">land,</hi> produces a like necessity of creating a <hi
                    rend="italic">property in the soil.</hi> The proof of this proposition is not
                    less short and convincing than that which regards the other species of property.
                    To make the land yield a produce useful to man, it must be cleared of many
                    incumbrances, and prepared with much labour and expense. No adequate return can
                    be obtained for this labour to the man who would bestow it, without a perpetuity
                    of possession. It is essential for the well-being of the species that the labour
                    should be yielded, and in the greatest degree of perfection. It cannot be
                    yielded perhaps at all, certainly in no tolerable degree of perfection, without
                    that exclusive possession which constitutes property. Property in land is,
                    therefore, essential to the well-being of the human species.</p>
                <p>We see in this manner what are the <hi rend="italic">rights</hi> and what are the
                    <hi rend="italic">duties</hi> which the supply of the first wants of human
                    nature renders it necessary to constitute; but as all mankind are not disposed
                    to respect <hi rend="italic">rights</hi> and <hi rend="italic">duties,</hi> it
                    is necessary, in order to obtain the advantages which they are destined to
                    produce, that measures should be taken to protect them.</p>
                <p>The measures taken to protect them are generally comprehended<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193328348" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8348-0401"/> under one name, that is, <hi
                    rend="italic">government.</hi> The protection of the rights, or, which means the
                    same thing, the insuring of the duties, is the <hi rend="italic">end,</hi> the
                    government is the <hi rend="italic">means</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the
                    question is, what combination of means is best adapted to the purpose?</p>
                <p>This assuredly· is the most important question to which the human faculties can
                    be directed; and the economists have never yet. received the credit which is
                    their due, for the ability and success with which they laboured to resolve it.
                    No speculations can be conceived of more importance than those in which they
                    engaged, nor has it yet become easy to throw upon them a greater portion of
                    light.</p>
                <p>The grand classes of means by the skilful combination of which they conceived
                    that the end might be obtained, were either more direct or more indirect. The
                    more indirect were liberty and evidence; the more direct were laws exactly
                    adapted to the end, magistrates exactly adapted to the execution of these laws,
                    and a supreme, or, as they called it, “<hi rend="italic">tutelary power'.'</hi>
                    We shall endeavour to communicate their leading ideas on each of these
                    particulars.</p>
                <p>1. ∙ <hi rend="italic">Liberty.</hi> We have seen that the end which is aimed at
                    through property, as a means, is the greatest possible abundance of the things
                    adapted for human enjoyment, and that property is a means altogether
                    indispensable for that end. It is now to be proved that liberty is absolutely
                    necessary to enable property to answer the purpose of a means to that end, and
                    that, without liberty, the existence of property is deprived of almost all its
                    advantages. In fact, the right which a man has not the liberty to enjoy is not a
                    right. The right of property in a man’s person, in his moveables, in his land,
                    is the right of enjoying; but the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> of enjoying and
                    the <hi rend="italic">liberty</hi> of enjoying are the same thing. Liberty,
                    therefore, cannot be hurt without damaging the right of property, and the right
                    of property cannot be hurt without damaging liberty. “It is, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ’ says Mercier de la Riviere, “so inseparably
                    connected with the right of property, that it is confounded with it, and that
                    the one cannot exist without the other. Deprive a man,” he cries, “of all the
                    rights of property, and I defy you to find in him a vestige of liberty. On the
                    other hand, suppose him deprived of every portion of liberty, and I defy you to
                    show that he truly retains every right of property.”</p>
                <p>It is now pretty clear that liberty is necessary to produce that abundance of
                    production which is the end aimed at by the constitution of all <hi
                    rend="italic">rights</hi> and <hi rend="italic">duties.</hi> Man is excited to
                    labour only in proportion as he is stimulated by the desire of enjoying; but the
                    desire of enjoying can only be a motive of action in so far as it is not
                    disjoined from the liberty of enjoying. You cannot have productions in
                    abundance, without the greatest possible inducement to labour; you cannot have
                    the greatest possible inducement to labour, without the greatest possible
                    liberty of enjoyment. The chain of evidence is therefore complete.</p>
                <p>“Let us not," say the economists, “seek in men beings which are not men. Nature
                    has destined them to know only two springs of action, or moving powers; the
                    appetite of pleasure and the aversion to pain. It is in the purpose of nature,
                    therefore, that they should not be deprived of the liberty of enjoying, since,
                    without that liberty, the first of those two powers would lose the whole of its
                    force. <hi rend="italic">Desire of enjoying, liberty of enjoying</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> these are the soul of the social movements, these are the
                    fruitful seed of abundance, because that precious combination is the principle
                    of all the efforts made by human beings to procure it.”</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Evidence.</hi> Property, and by consequence liberty and
                    security of enjoying, being proved to constitute the essence of what they called
                    the natural and essential order of society, it was seen to be in reality a chain
                    <hi rend="italic">of physical</hi> consequences, involving nothing arbitrary,
                    nothing changeable; evident, on the other hand, simple, and resting on no other
                    ground than that of being the most advantageous possible to the whole body of
                    the community, and to every one of its members.</p>
                <p>“The best possible order of society, however,” they observed, “cannot be
                    established where it is not sufficiently known; but for that very reason, that
                    it is the best order, the establishment of it, as soon as it is known, must
                    become the common ambition of men; it must then introduce itself by <hi
                    rend="italic">necessity,</hi> and, once established, it must by <hi
                    rend="italic">necessity</hi> continue for ever.” These were bold promises, but
                    the proof was correspondent. “The best possible order of society must introduce
                    itself as soon as known, and preserve itself for ever as soon as introduced,
                    because the appetite of pleasure, and the aversion to pain, the only moving
                    powers within us, lead naturally and constantly toward the greatest possible
                    augmentation of enjoyments; and the desire of enjoying implies by necessity that
                    of the means by which enjoyment is procured. It is, then," said the economists,
                    “impossible that men should know their best possible condition without a
                    consequent union of all wills and all power to procure and to preserve it.
                    Imagine not,” they cried, “that for the establishment of this essential order it
                    is necessary to change the nature of men, and divest them of their passions;
                    their passions, on the other hand, become auxiliaries in this establishment,
                    and, for the most complete success, it is only necessary to place them in a
                    condition to see with <hi rend="italic">evidence</hi> that it is in this order
                    alone they can find the greatest possible sum of enjoyments and of
                    happiness.”</p>
                <p>These philosophers made some admirable observations upon the nature of evidence,
                    and the important purposes to which it is subservient. They made a distinction
                    between those propositions which a man receives without evidence, and those
                    which he only receives upon the strength of evidence. The first they denoted by
                    the word <hi rend="italic">opinion,</hi> the second they marked by the names of
                    <hi rend="italic">knowledge</hi> and <hi rend="italic">certainty.</hi> “As
                    error,” they said, “is every thing which is not truth, in like manner, what is
                    not <hi rend="italic">evidence</hi> is only <hi rend="italic">opinion</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and whatsoever is only opinion is arbitrary, and liable to
                    change. It is evident, therefore, that these opinions are not a sufficient
                    foundation for the natural and essential order of societies. A solid edifice
                    cannot be erected on a basis of sand; and that into which nothing arbitrary can
                    enter, which is and must be unchangeable as the ends to which it is directed,
                    can never be founded on a principle so arbitrary and various as opinion; opinion
                    which, however just and true it may accidentally be, so long as it is not
                    founded on evidence, is but opinion still, and liable every moment to be
                    subverted and expelled by any other opinion, however extravagant and
                    absurd.”</p>
                <p>Evidence is the knowledge, clearly attained and possessed by ourselves, of all
                    that is necessary to see the truth or falsehood of an object of belief. This
                    excludes all doubt, all uncertainty, every thing arbitrary, all exercise of
                    will. A man can no more help believing that which he actually holds in his mind
                    evidence sufficient to prove, than he can help seeing the object which is
                    painted on his retina.</p>
                <p>From thisjrresistible power of evidence the economists deduced the most important
                    consequences. “Not only is it,” they said, “the essential characteristic of
                    evidence to stand the test of the most severe examination, but the most severe
                    examination can have no other effeot than that of displaying it to more
                    advantage; that of giving to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328361"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-8361-0402"/>it a power more predominating and supreme; while,
                    on the other hand, sufficient examination destroys prepossession and prejudice,
                    and establishes in their place, either evidence, or at least suspension of
                    judgment, where evidence on which to found a judgment is out of our reach.”</p>
                <p>On the first of these propositions, that “evidence can stand the test of the most
                    severe examination,” they said, “that all attempt at proof was surely
                    unnecessary,—it was self-evident; and hence,” they said, “was evidently deduced
                    this most important consequence, ‘ that the liberty of examining, of
                    criticising, and of contradicting evidence, is always and necessarily without
                    inconvenience.'”</p>
                <p>“That a sufficient examination destroys prepossession and prejudice,” they
                    regarded as a proposition equally indisputable; and from this it followed, as an
                    irresistible consequence, “that the most unbounded liberty of examination and
                    contradiction is of primary and essential importance; for no examination can be
                    <hi rend="italic">sufficient</hi> till all the reasons of doubt are
                    exhausted.”</p>
                <p>“That a sufficient examination establishes evidence in the place of error in the
                    case of all questions where evidence is within our reach,” was a truth, they
                    said, resting on the same immoveable basis; and from this it followed, as an
                    evident consequence, “that liberty of inquiry will lead by necessity to the
                    clear and public knowledge of what is the best possible order of human society;
                    for on this subject evidence is undeniably within our reach.”</p>
                <p>“We may thus regard evidence as a sort of beneficent divinity, whose pleasure
                    consists in spreading peace on earth. Never do you behold mathematicians at war
                    with mathematicians on account of the truths which they have established on
                    evidence; if they enter into a momentary dispute, it is only while they are yet
                    in the avenue of inquiry, and have investigation solely in view; butas soon as
                    evidence has pronounced either on the one side or the other, every man lays down
                    his arms, and only thinks of enjoying in peace the good which is thus acquired
                    in common.”</p>
                <p>“Pass now,” say the economists, “from the evidence of <hi rend="italic"
                    >mathematical</hi> to that of <hi rend="italic">social</hi> truths; to the
                    evidence of that order of human affairs in society which would produce to men
                    the greatest possible amount of happiness. From the known effects of evidence in
                    the first of these cases, try to conceive what would be the effects of it in the
                    second; what would of <hi rend="italic">necessity</hi> be the internal condition
                    of a society governed by that evidence; what would of <hi rend="italic"
                    >necessity</hi> be the political and respective situation of all nations if they
                    were illuminated by its divine effulgence; consider if men, rallied under the
                    standard of that evidence, would have any division among them; if any motive for
                    war would be sufficiently powerful to make them sacrifice to it their best, and
                    to themselves <hi rend="italic">evidently</hi> best possible condition:
                    penetrate still deeper, and see if the pictures which that medium presents to
                    you do not excite in you sensations, or rather transports, which elevate you
                    above yourself, and appear to indicate that, by means of evidence, we
                    communicate with the divinity.</p>
                <p>“But to increase your sensibility to the impressions which those pictures will
                    make upon your understanding and your heart, place in opposition all the
                    inconveniences which, in a state of ignorance, arise from the force of <hi

                    have against an opinion which tends to despise them? None; we have too many
                    examples to prove it.</p>

                    and fatigue to repose, poverty and privation to riches, and death to life, on
                    which it finds the secret of shedding a lustre.</p>

                    the colours of reality, in order to deceive. Source inexhaustible of good and of
                    evil, it is through it alone that we see, by it alone that we will and we act.
                    According as it borders upon truth or falsehood, it produces virtues or vices,

                    intense; at one time it founds empires, at another destroys them.</p>
                <p>“Every man is therefore a little kingdom upon the earth, governed despotically by

                    that he ought to brave them. Our physical powers themselves are so completely
                    subordinate to the power of opinion, that, to have the command of our physical
                    powers, it is necessary to begin by having the command of our opinion; but how
                    is it possible to have the command of opinion, while it is the sport of
                    ignorance, and its nature arbitrary? How is it possible to fix and to unite the
                    opinions of men, but by the agency of evidence? Is it not visible that the

                <p>“But as all the physical forces in the world cannot render that evident which is

                    possible <hi rend="italic">publicity.''</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">publicity of evidence</hi> was a subject on which the
                    economists dwelt with peculiar emphasis, and which they branched out into a
                    number of the most important consequences. “The necessity of it,” they said,
                    “was apparent from this, that the proper order of society cannot be solidly
                    established, but in proportion as it is sufficiently known. In any society, if
                    some men only had knowledge and evidence of this order, while the multitude
                    rested in other opinions, it would be impossible for this order to govern; it
                    would in vain command; it would not be obeyed. This state would be that of a
                    perpetual intestine war of one part of the nation with another. By <hi
                    rend="italic">intestine war</hi> they did not, however, mean,” they said, “only
                    that which is performed with arms in the hands, and by open force; they more
                    peculiarly referred to those disguised and clandestine ravages and oppressions,
                    exercised under forms of law; to those dark and predatory practices, which
                    sacrifice all the victims which artifice is able <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193328374" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8374-0403"/>to bring within their power;
                    to all those disorders, in a word, which tend to make all particular interests
                    enemies of one another, and thus to uphold, among the members of the same
                    political body, an habitual war of clashing interests, the contending effects of
                    which tear in sunder all the bonds of society. This situation is so much the
                    more dreadful, in as much as, excepting the superior and governing force of
                    evidence, there is no power in nature equal to that of opinion; as in its
                    aberrations opinion is tremendous, and as no means exist by which we can make
                    sure of retaining it always within proper limits, when it is once given up to
                    its own inconstancy, and to seduction.</p>
                <p>“From the <hi rend="italic">publicity,</hi> which is an indispensable condition
                    to possession of evidence respecting what is best in the social order, we are
                    conducted to the necessity of <hi rend="italic">public instruction.</hi> Though
                    faith,” said the economists, “be the gift of God, a peculiar grace, which cannot
                    be the work of men alone; nevertheless it is held that the preaching of the
                    gospel is peculiarly necessary to the propagation of the faith. Why, then,
                    should not every one have the same opinion with regard to the publication of the
                    social order, more especially as that publication has no need of being aided by
                    grace and supernatural light? This order is instituted for men, and all men are
                    born to live under it; it is then required by this order that men should know
                    it, and accordingly they have all a sufficient portion of natural faculties, to
                    be able to elevate themselves to that knowledge. For the same reasons that
                    knowledge is required, instruction is required, by which alone certain kinds of
                    knowledge can be attained.”</p>
                <p>The economists did not enter into details respecting establishments necessary for
                    instruction. They, however, affirmed, that such establishments “constituted a
                    part of the essential form of a society, and that they could hardly be too
                    numerous, because instruction can never be too common.” They affirmed, also,
                    that “verbal instructions did not suffice; that it was necessary to have
                    doctrinal books, suited to the purpose, and in every body’s hand. This help,”
                    they said, “was so much the more important, as it was clear of all
                    inconvenience, for error cannot stand in the presence of evidence; and
                    contradiction is not less advantageous to evidence than it is fatal to error,
                    which has nothing to fear so much as examination.”</p>
                <p>What they affirmed with respect to the necessity of those which they called
                    doctrinal books, and of the liberty which ought to reign with regard to them,
                    “was founded,” they said, “upon the very nature of that order which is due to
                    society, and of the evidence which belongs to it. That order,” they observed,
                    “is either perfectly and evidently known, or it is not. In the first case, its
                    evidence and simplicity render the formation of heresies on the subject of it
                    altogether impossible. In the second ca9e, men cannot arrive at knowledge or
                    evidence, but through the conflict of opinions. It is certain that an opinion
                    can be established only upon the ruins of those which are opposed to it; it is
                    further certain, that every opinion which is not founded upon evidence will be
                    contradicted, until it is either destroyed, or recognized on evidence for a
                    truth, in which case it ceases to be a bare opinion, and becomes an evident
                    principle. And thus, in the pursuit of truths, capable of being established on
                    evidence, the conflict of opinions leads, of necessity, to evidence, because it
                    is by evidence alone it is capable of being terminated.”</p>
                <p>This doctrine is of such infinite importance, that we are willing to prolong it,
                    by adding the illustration which the economists were accustomed to adduce. “If a
                    man should be actuated by any motives to write a book endeavouring to persuade
                    his countrymen that they might live without subsistence, that they ought to make
                    commodities without the materials, that they multiply themselves by change of
                    place, or any other extravagant opinion, it would be highly useless for the
                    public authority to give itself any concern or labour to prevent such a book
                    from making an impression upon the public mind; and, far from feeling any alarm,
                    e√cry body would rest securely upon the evidence of the contrary truths, assured
                    that this evidence would always be sufficient for itself, and would quietly
                    triumph over all the ridiculous efforts which would be made to oppose it.</p>
                <p>“So absolutely necessary is it to leave to the whole body of society the greatest
                    possible freedom of examination and contradiction; so absolutely necessary is it
                    to abandon evidence to its own strength, that there is no other power which can
                    supply its place; physical power, of what magnitude soever, can command actions
                    alone, never opinions. The experience of every day affords to this truth the
                    evidence of the senses. So little have our physical powers any influence over
                    our opinions, that our opinions, on the contrary, exercise an uncontrollable
                    dominion over our physical powers. Our physical powers are put in motion, and
                    guided by our opinions alone. The common or social, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >public force,</hi> is formed by the union of the physical powers of many
                    individuals. This supposes, necessarily and invariably, a correspondent union of
                    evils; and this can never exist but in consequence of an union of opinions, good
                    or bad. It is, therefore, to reverse the order of things, and take the effect
                    for the cause, to desire to give the public force a power over opinion, while it
                    is from the union of opinions that public force holds its own existence, and
                    while, by consequence, it can have no stability but in proportion to that which
                    reigns in the opinion on which it is founded, that is to say, in proportion as
                    bare opinions, stripped of evidence, are replaced by opinions fixed and
                    invariable, because founded upon evidence which cannot deceive.”</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Laus.</hi> Having established as incontrovertible truths,
                    that property is necessary to the production of the means of human life and
                    enjoyment, that the system of human rights and duties spring from it as natural
                    consequences, and that the natural and essential order of societies is nothing
                    in reality but the chain or connected order of these same rights and duties, the
                    economists laid down the following definition: “That the essential form of a
                    society is the continuation of all those social institutions which are necessary
                    to consolidate the right of property, and secure to it all the liberty which
                    essentially belongs to it.”</p>
                <p>Among these instrumental establishments, an important place is held by laws, of
                    which they communicated the following very striking and original idea.</p>
                <p>“A multitude of men assembled without acknowledging any respective rights, any
                    reciprocal duties, would not form a society. That does not consist in the
                    meeting of a number of men in a particular place. It may subsist among men very
                    remote in respect of place, and not subsist among men very near in respect of
                    place. <hi rend="italic">That which really constitutes the union, are the
                    conditions of the union.</hi> These conditions are the systems of rights and
                    duties, in other words, the conventions entered into for their common interest
                    by the members of the associated body. The laws, then, are precisely those
                    conventions, by operation of which, the reciprocal rights and duties are
                    established in such a manner that the members of the society are no longer
                    permitted arbitrarily to depart from them.</p>
                <p>“Of these conventions, some are of such a nature as cannot be defined very
                    exactly, or at least cannot be enforced by artificial sanction, but must be left
                    to the natural coercion of the approbation and disapprobation of mankind. Such
                    are the common duties of morality; gratitude, veracity, charity, and the like.
                    But the next clast <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328387"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-8387-0404"/>of these conventions are those which are capable
                    of being defined exactly, and enforced by artificial sanctions; as, that murder
                    shall not be committed, property shall not be stolen. This last class of
                    conventions are those which are properly called <hi rend="italic">laws.</hi></p>
                <p>“The first property necessary to give those laws their best possible <hi

                    supposed that they are strictly conformed to that utility from which the whole
                    system of rights and duties takes its origin) is, that they be definitive; to
                    distinguish, by an incontrovertible line, what each of them does, from what it
                    does not, comprehend. This is implied in the very notion of a law, which is to
                    render something <hi rend="italic">positive,</hi> which would otherwise be <hi

                <p>“The second property necessary to give laws their best possible form is, that
                    they be written. This is indeed implied in the first property; because no
                    combination of ideas can be rendered <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">unvarying,</hi> of which the <hi rend="italic">expression</hi> is
                    not <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> and <hi rend="italic">unvarying.</hi> But
                    nothing can render an expression positive and unvarying but a permanent sign;
                    and, of permanent signs, none is equal to writing.</p>
                <p>“The third property necessary to give to laws their best possible form is, that
                    the reason of each be annexed to it. The distinction is very important between
                    the <hi rend="italic">letter</hi> of the law, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >reason</hi> of the law. The <hi rend="italic">letter</hi> of the law is its
                    textical composition; the <hi rend="italic">reason</hi> of the law is the motive
                    by which it was dictated. <hi rend="italic">The man who is guilty of murder
                    shall receive a certain punishment.</hi> This is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >letter</hi> of the law. The <hi rend="italic">reason</hi> is, that <hi
                    rend="italic">if murder were common, and not restrained by adequate motives, the
                    happiness of human beings, if not the species, would soon be destroyed.</hi>
                    Having thus acquired a knowledge of the reason of the law, 1 possess the <hi
                    rend="italic">evidence</hi> of its <hi rend="italic">utility.</hi> And of this I
                    should not have been possessed, had I seen in the law nothing more than the <hi
                    rend="italic">letter.</hi> Let us suppose two laws, which equally assign the
                    punishment of death; the one for homicide, the other for walking at certain
                    hours in the day. Is it not clear that they would be viewed with different eyes;
                    that the one would appear to be just, the other tyrannical; that we should feel
                    within ourselves a natural disposition to submit to the one, a disposition to
                    avail ourselves of every thing which might serve as a means to deliver us from
                    the hateful yoke of the other? This difference arises from the different
                    judgment we form of the <hi rend="italic">reason</hi> of these bad laws. The
                    first carries with it the <hi rend="italic">evidence</hi> of its <hi
                    rend="italic">utility</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and that <hi rend="italic"
                    >evidence</hi> overcomes and binds without resistance the understanding and the
                    will. The other carries with it, instead of the evidence of utility, the
                    evidence of nothing but a dis-proportional rigour, of a manifest evil, to which
                    our understanding, and consequently our will, can never submit.</p>
                <p>“It is not, therefore, in the <hi rend="italic">letter,</hi> but in the <hi
                    rend="italic">reason</hi> of the laws, that we must seek for the first principle
                    of a constant submission and obedience to the laws; for that principle can be
                    nothing but the dominion exercised over our minds by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >evidence</hi> of the justice of necessity, that is, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >utility</hi> of the laws; now this evidence is not in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >letter</hi> of the laws; to establish that submission, therefore, generally and
                    invariably, two conditions are requisite; one is, that the reason of the laws
                    contain conclusive <hi rend="italic">evidence</hi> of their <hi rend="italic"
                    >utility,</hi> commonly called their justice and necessity; the other is, that
                    the publication of this evidence be so complete, in respect both of clearness
                    and diffusion, as to lodge it in the mind of a majority of all classes of the
                    people. Men, persuaded that their laws were bad laws, might indeed for a time be
                    constrained to observe them; but such a submission, contrary as it is to nature,
                    could not be durable, nor escape daily breaches on the part of those who
                    regarded themselves as suffering by the injustice of the laws. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Submission to the laws is always, and necessarily, proportional to the idea
                    which we hold of their justice and necessity</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that
                    is, their indispensable use in procuring good and eschewing evil.</p>
                <p>“If laws,” said the economists, “are any thing but the results of the natural
                    order of society, or of that system of duties and rights which are rightly
                    founded upon the interest of all; if the legislature of any country sets up
                    rights and duties of another sort, these new rights and duties are contrary to
                    the first; and hence, of necessity, the laws which prescribe them are in a state
                    of perpetual opposition with our understandings and wills.” This contrariety
                    they proved in the following manner: “AD the rights which a reasonable being can
                    desire are summed up in that of property; because from the right of property
                    results the liberty of enjoying; a liberty which ought to have no bounds but
                    those which are assigned to it by the similar rights of property belonging to
                    other men. As the essential order of society thus determines the measure of
                    liberty belonging to each of its members, and as that measure is the greatest
                    which can be, without disturbing that essential order itself, it is impossible
                    that any thing should be added to the liberty, that is, to the rights of one set
                    of men, without taking from the liberty, and by consequence from the property,
                    of other men; and this is an injustice and disorder, the tendency of which is
                    destructive to the society.”</p>
                <p>It is destructive to the society, because it throws it into a state of violence.
                    “My neighbour,” says Mercier de la Rivière, “will be content that he is not
                    allowed to reap or to injure my crop; but for the same reason he will not be
                    content that I should be allowed to reap or to injure his. On the view of such
                    an injury permitted in regard to any other man, he will take the alarm, his
                    fears will be excited for himself, and this anxiety will be a state of torment,
                    from which his reason will perpetually urge him to seek relief. A law which
                    violates the principle of utility, is a law therefore resisted by that evidence
                    which governs beyond control the human will. To make such a law, is to put the
                    society into a state of violence, because it is to put the minds of men into a
                    state hostile to one another, and more or less hostile to the laws.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Magistrates.</hi> By this term the economists understood
                    judges, and, in a word, all the leading functionaries employed in giving
                    execution to the laws. Agreeably to the doctrines already exhibited, they
                    conceived that the first service of the magistrates is that of shedding the
                    light of <hi rend="italic">evidence</hi> upon the particular cases which have
                    been too obscure for the parties. But as there are some minds with which you
                    cannot be sure of being able in every case to bring evidence, as it were, in
                    contact, the magistrate needs to be armed with a coercive power; and all that is
                    necessary is, that he affords to the rest of the community <hi rend="italic"
                    >evidence</hi> that in such cases the power has been used agreeably to the
                    principle of general good.</p>
                <p>From these premises, the chief consequence which they deduced was, that the
                    legislative and judicial powers are never to be united in the same hand, without
                    destroying among the people all certainty of the justice and necessity of their
                    laws, that is, the very essence of the laws themselves.</p>
                <p>“The essential form of positive laws,” they said, “in that which makes them to be
                    what they ought to be, is, that they consist of certain visible signs, which
                    show, that in the institution of them, that order has been followed which is
                    necessary, 1st, to ensure their justice and necessity, that is, their adaptation
                    to the ends of obtaining good and avoiding evil; 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> to
                    render their adaptation to those ends evident or certain to the individuals whom
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328400" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8400-0405"/> they concern.
                    Now it is clear that these conditions could not be fulfilled if the legislative
                    power was to engross the judicial functions. The legislator and judge being the
                    same person, neither could the legislator find any resource against his own
                    mistakes in the close review and experience of the judge; nor, on the other
                    side, could the arbitrary will of the judge find any bridle or chain in the
                    authority of the legislator; but the laws, however good in themselves, would be
                    rendered evil by a variable and corrupt administration.</p>
                <p>“If the legislator were judge also, his business would be to consummate and to
                    crown all the mistakes which he incurred, or the abuses which he committed, in
                    the formation of the laws. If the judge were legislator also, the laws existing
                    only in conformity to his will, he would be under no necessity to consult the
                    laws in passing his judgment, and would always ordain as law-maker, what he
                    should have to determine as law-interpreter. Thus the <hi rend="italic"
                    >reason</hi> of the positive laws would be found to consist in nothing but the
                    will of the legislator, as he would be guided in making them by nothing but its
                    arbitrary impulses; and, in the same manner, the <hi rend="italic">reason</hi>
                    of the judicial decisions would be found to consist in nothing but the mere will
                    of the judge, whose independence would enable him to make them whatever he
                    pleased. This double malady abundantly proves that those laws would be stript of
                    the essential characteristics of law, the evidence of their justice and
                    necessity, and an absolute exemption from every thing arbitrary.”</p>
                <p>The duties of the judge they deduced in the following order: As the laws are in
                    themselves mute, and the magistrate is the organ through which they speak, he is
                    particularly charged with the <hi rend="italic">guardianship</hi> of the laws.
                    It is ,of importance to know what is implied in the term guardianship of the
                    laws. It relates either to the laws which <hi rend="italic">are</hi> made, or to
                    those which are to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> made. The natural strength of the
                    Jaws consists in the evidence of their goodness. Their weakness consists in the
                    strength of the hands which dispose of the physical power. As the laws arc mute
                    in themselves, they cannot wield that evidence in which their strength consists.
                    The magistrates, who are the mouth of the laws, ought therefore to wield it for
                    them, and to resist the hands in -which the physical power is deposited, when
                    they attempt the infringement of the laws, with all the force which evidence can
                    be made to exercise over the minds of the community.</p>
                <p>The same principles demonstrate what are the duties incumbent on the depositaries
                    of the judicial power with regard to laws to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> made. As
                    laws ought all to be founded on that concatenation of the causes of human good
                    which the economists denominated “the primary and essential reason of all laws,
                    the <hi rend="italic">evidence</hi> of that primary and essential reason was,”
                    they said, “a deposit, so to speak, in the hands of the judicial instruments, of
                    which they owed an account to the legislature, to the nation, and to God
                    himself, of whose supreme will that evidence is the decisive token. It was their
                    first duty, therefore, to have a perfect <hi rend="italic">knowledge</hi> of
                    that primary and essential reason.” Their next duty was, on all occasions, as
                    far as their utmost efforts could extend, to impart that evidence to the
                    governing power, and to make it as clear as it can be made, what laws, not yet
                    proposed, that evidence shows that the society requires.</p>
                <p>The economists further affirmed, “that no man can, without rendering himself
                    criminal towards earth and heaven, undertake to perform the office of judge,
                    according to laws that are <hi rend="italic">evidently</hi> unjust. He would in
                    that case cease to be a minister of justice, in order to become a minister of
                    iniquity. If any law, for example, ordained that a man should be condemned to
                    the ultimate punishment, on the mere denunciation of another man, and without
                    any inquiry into the truth of the allegation, is it not evident that such a law
                    would be a law of murder? And is it not equally evident, that the barbarian who
                    should pronounce a judgment agreeably to that law, would be the voluntary
                    instrument of murder? It is necessary, however, either to go the full length of
                    saying that a man can, without guilt, become the instrument of such a law, or
                    allow that no minister of the law ought to lend his ministry to the execution of
                    a law evidently unjust; for if he may for one such law, so he may for all,
                    however atrocious; no outrage to humanity, no excess of evil, presents any
                    limiting point."</p>
                <p>5. The <hi rend="italic">tutelary authority.</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> The
                    union of wills to form that of individual powers; the union of individual powers
                    to form a common or public force; the deposit of that force in the hands of a
                    chief, by whose ministry it may command, and make itself obeyed,—these,” said
                    the economists, “are the component parts of the tutelary authority. The tutelary
                    authority is nothing more than a physical force resulting from an unio,n of
                    wills; and, by necessary consequence, it is impossible for it to be either
                    powerful or secure, unless the intuitive and determining force of evidence be
                    the principle of that union.</p>
                <p>“In one sense, it may be affirmed that the right of commanding belongs to
                    evidence alone; for, in the order of nature, evidence is the only rule of
                    conduct bestowed upon us by the Author of nature. But all men are not equally
                    capable of seizing evidence; and even, if they were, the interest of the moment
                    often operates upon them with such vehemence, that the appetite of enjoyment
                    will not, in a state of disorder, be restrained by the evidence of duty. Among
                    human beings, therefore, it is necessary that the natural authority of evidence
                    be armed with a physical force; and that the legislative power, though it
                    commands in the name of evidence, have the disposal of the public force to
                    ensure obedience to its injunctions.”</p>
                <p>From the analysis of what is necessary to constitute the tutelary authority, the
                    key-stone, as it were, of the arch of human society, that which gives to the
                    whole its binding force, and retains the parts in their order, the economists
                    deduced a variety of most important conclusions, of which we can only present
                    the more striking as a sample.</p>
                <p>The first is, that the legislative and executive powers are essentially
                    inseparable, and that all the fine-looking theories, which have solicited and
                    obtained so much of the admiration of a superficial world about the virtues of
                    their separation, are phantoms in the air, the mere visions of imagination. “To
                    dictate laws is to command; and as our passions render it impossible that
                    commands should be more than useless sounds without the physical power of making
                    them obeyed, the right of prescribing laws can have no existence without the
                    physical power of enforcing them. The depositary of the power is, therefore, and
                    necessarily, the master of the right; and the executive power is always and
                    certainly the legislative power. Let the enemies of this conclusion turn and
                    torture the subject which way they please, they never can escape from it.
                    Suppose, in order to form two powers, that the legislative right is confided to
                    one organ, the public force to another, when opposition arises, which of the two
                    is to be obeyed? As it is impossible that two contradictory commands can be
                    obeyed at the same time, it must be absolutely decided which of the two is in
                    preference to be obeyed. Now, this decision is, by the very fact, the
                    destruction of the other power, and the establishment of that one. These two
                    powers, therefore, unavoidably run into one; the legislative power necessarily
                    becomes the Executive power, or the executive becomes the legislative.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328413" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8413-0406"/>
                <p>The second is, that the legislative never has, never can have, a right to make
                    <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> laws. A right to make bad laws, they said, is a
                    contradiction in terms. A right supposes a <hi rend="italic">compact</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> it is the offspring of an agreement, tacit or express; the
                    idea of it can no more exist without that of a mutual convention, than a debt
                    without the contract of debtor or creditor. The compact upon which all rights
                    are founded is that of mutual advantage; it is the union of all wills, freely
                    determined by a great interest, of which the <hi rend="italic">evidence</hi> is
                    visible to all. How can that union which only exists for the sake of a good
                    continue to exist if it is seen to produce evil? The hope cannot be framed of
                    maintaining it by force, because force is its effect; force can exist only
                    subsequent to union, and in consequence of union. The horrid prerogative of
                    being able to make bad laws supposes necessarily a state of ignorance, a state
                    in which the vices of the laws are not illuminated by evidence; for it is
                    impossible that a community should consent to uphold that which visibly hurts
                    them. The power exists in this hateful situation, but the right as little there
                    as anywhere else.</p>
                <p>The economists come next to the important question, What is <hi rend="italic">the
                    security for the right use of the legislative power</hi><hi rend="italic">?</hi>
                    On this subject their anxiety to secure to their opinions the benefit of
                    publicity, and the favour of those in whose hands the governing powers were
                    actually deposited, led them to use the veil of expressions too general, and
                    into some positive mistakes. “The security,” they said, “for the right use of
                    the legislative power, is the interest of that same power, which can, in the
                    general order alone, find its own best possible state. The irresistible force
                    which evidence acquires by publicity is also that security. This evidence exists
                    in its greatest force in the body of the magistrates, who cannot, without
                    ceasing to be ministers of justice, lend their ministry to the execution of laws
                    evidently unjust; or forbear, without being criminal, their utmost endeavours to
                    make the <hi rend="italic">evidence</hi> of that injustice as clear as possible
                    both to the legislature and to the nation.”</p>
                <p>The grand question followed, <hi rend="italic">What are the hands in which the
                    legislative power ought to be deposited</hi><hi rend="italic">?</hi> Having
                    demonstrated that the legislative and executive powers cannot by possibility
                    exist in any but the same hands, and that they form together what they
                    denominated the <hi rend="italic">tutelary authority,</hi> they proceeded to
                    inquire what was implied in the idea of authority. “Unite,” said they, “upon one
                    object a multitude of opinions and of wills; from that union will arise
                    naturally and necessarily an union of physical forces for the accomplishment of
                    those wills; and from the whole together will result an authority, or, in other
                    words, <hi rend="italic">a right of commanding, founded upon a physical power of
                    procuring obedience to what is thus commanded.</hi> If these opinions and wills
                    should disunite, and form, for example, two parties, the forces will for that
                    reason be divided; there will be two forces, two authorities, and, by
                    consequence, two societies. That two authorities cannot exist in the same
                    society, they maintained by the following proof. Such authorities must be either
                    equal or not equal. If equal, each of them taken separately is null. If unequal,
                    the superior is the real and only authority. That, in the first case, each taken
                    separately would be strictly and literally null, arose, they said, from the very
                    nature of equality, which rendered it absolutely impossible that the one could
                    do any thing without the other. Neither of them, therefore, could procure a
                    single act of obedience, except by their union; but, at the very moment of their
                    union, they cease to be two authorities, and form both together only one
                    authority made out of the union of both. Unity is, then, a part of the very
                    essence of authority; to divide it is to reduce it to an incapacity of acting,
                    that is, to extinguish it; for authority is not authority but in so far as it
                    can act to procure the execution of its will.”</p>
                <p>From the necessary unity of the tutelary authority it followed, they said, by
                    necessary consequence, that the organ of that authority must be one man. That
                    the physical force which is one of its component parts can be directed only by
                    one will, is above the need of proof. But it is said that one will may be formed
                    out of the union of several wills, and that the public force is not subject to
                    the separate wills till the union takes place.</p>
                <p>To this the economists made answer, that if the opposition of one will can
                    suspend the effect of all the others, it reduces authority to inaction, and for
                    that reason destroys it. The reason why physical force is necessary is, that you
                    cannot count upon the union of all wills. If, to avoid this objection, you have
                    recourse, they said, to plurality of suffrage, you build no longer on the basis
                    of evidence. That which divides opinions is not yet evident. As nothing in
                    government ought to be arbitrary, and every thing that is not arbitrary is
                    founded on reasons, that is, <hi rend="italic">evidence,</hi> there cannot be
                    diversity of opinions on matters of government, except from the effect of
                    ignorance, or of bad design on the part of the délibérants. But it cannot be
                    determined by a few voices less or more, on which side the ground of evil lies.
                    Experience shows that an accredited error may long unite partizans in much
                    greater number than the truth by which it is opposed. The number of those who
                    concur in an opinion cannot render that evident which is not evident; their
                    opinion is only opinion still, which is of course subject to change; for nothing
                    but evidence is unalterable. And with respect to bad design, as that results
                    from particular interests, it can never be determined whether the number of
                    those whom such interests command is the greatest or the least. On both
                    accounts, then, plurality of suffrage is not security.</p>
                <p>But the greatest evil, they said, of the mode of determining, by majority of
                    votes, the question respecting the social order, was, that it set individual
                    interest in opposition to public; in which case the public interests are sure to
                    be sacrificed. “How great soever the differences among men, they have within
                    them, nevertheless, two grand moving powers common to all, and which are the
                    source of all their actions—the appetite of pleasure and the aversion to pain.
                    To suppose that men can move in opposition to those powers, is to suppose that
                    the cause can depend upon the effect. But the desire of enjoyment, and opinion
                    by which it is modified, cannot act naturally and constantly in the direction of
                    the public interest, when authority is divided among several persons who are
                    liable to have interests opposite to one another. For it may be laid down as a
                    truth which will not admit of contestation, that the public interest cannot be
                    considered as generally safe when it is in opposition to the private interests
                    of those who are entrusted with it. If one or more of the public administrators
                    behold any great advantage to themselves in a sacrifice which has been made, or
                    which may be made, of the public interest, we ask, said the economists, What can
                    prevent the sacrifice from being made? Not the two springs of action which
                    nature has placed within us to be the cause of all we do; for they are in this
                    case put in opposition to the public interest. Not any other authority in
                    opposition to that of the public administrator, since by the supposition they
                    themselves engross the whole of the governing power.”</p>
                <p>The remaining evil which the economists ascribe to this expedient was, that it
                    attached to the number of votes a despotical authority, which can safely and
                    usefully belong to <hi rend="italic">evidence</hi> alone. “Under this system it
                    is not evidence,” they said, “which governs; it is opinion, or the will of a
                    certain number of men actuated by the same opinion.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328426" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8426-0407"/>
                <p>The mischief apt to result cannot be estimated; it is without bounds. Suppose, in
                    fact, that the vote of the majo- ' rity is dictated by private interests, and
                    that <hi rend="italic">evidence</hi> is on the side of the minority, is it not
                    monstrous that the former should command, and that the form of the government
                    should lend to bad design a title to triumph over evidence itself? This excess
                    of disorder is nevertheless inevitable under so defective a plan of government;
                    and the nation remains absolutely without protection against the scourges with
                    which, under private interest set in opposition to public, it may be lacerated,
                    especially if these private interests are the interests of men who, by their
                    riches or otherwise, are in possession of power.</p>
                <p>“We forget not,” they said, “that the mischievous tendency of private interest
                    would find a counterpoise in the <hi rend="italic">knowledge of the nation.</hi>
                    It is very true, that in a nation really enlightened, a nation that had from <hi
                    rend="italic">evidence</hi> the knowledge of its own true interests, the body of
                    rulers could not abuse their authority. But why? because the evidence of the
                    abuse would in that case annihilate the authority. But the idea of a nation
                    governed by plurality of suffrage, and by evidence at the same time, involves an
                    absurdity. Again, a nation sufficiently instructed to know all the links in the
                    chain of social good and evil, would never sanction a form of government which
                    places the common interest in opposition to the private interests of those to
                    whom it is entrusted. Besides, it would be ridiculous to suppose a nation
                    sufficiently instructed to have the wills of all united under the evidence of
                    what is best in the social order, and to suppose its rulers at the very same
                    time so ignorant as to be divided on those subjects, and reduced for a ground of
                    decision to plurality of suffrage.</p>
                <p>“So long, on the other hand, as a nation is not thus instructed, the people
                    properly so called, sunk in ignorance and prejudices, see no farther than the
                    nearest objects by which they are surrounded; each canton thinks the interest of
                    the state is all summed up in the interest of that canton; each profession in
                    the interest of that profession; the knowledge of relations and dependencies is
                    absolutely wanting. Such men cannot ascend from effects to causes, much less
                    enumerate the links in the chain of causes and effects. It becomes, therefore,
                    morally impossible for them to act by principle and by rule. Ever credulous, and
                    prone to prepossession, they must be gained in order to be persuaded; the same
                    artifices must be practised upon them which are used to seduce them. The
                    resolutions of men, the sport of momentary impressions, must have all the
                    inconstancy of these impressions. Divided into rich and poor, the rich look upon
                    the poor as made for them, and upon every power which they wish to possess as
                    naturally their due. The poor, justly discontented with the treatment they
                    receive, and mistaking the cause, are tempted to envy the condition of the rich,
                    and to regard as injustice the inequality of the partition which is made between
                    them. It is evidently, therefore, unsafe to choose the body of administration
                    exclusively from either of these two classes. Nor would much be gained if one
                    half were chosen from the one and the other from the other. If the separate
                    portions continued to be governed by the prejudices and views of the classes to
                    which they belonged, they would do nothing but contend; and there is only one
                    way in which they could receive a motive to cease,— <hi rend="italic">if
                    collusion would enable them to serve their men private interests by sacrificing
                    the interests with which they were entrusted."</hi></p>
                <p>The economists come then to their grand conclusion with respect to the artificial
                    or physical security of the social order. To the question, what is the best form
                    of government, they answered, the government of a single individual, uniting in
                    his own person the whole of the legislative and executive powers; in other
                    words, absolute. “All men,” they said, “would confess that the best form of
                    government was that which was so perfectly conformable to the natural and
                    essential order of societies, that no abuse could result from it; that form, in
                    short, which renders it impossible to make gain out of misrule—which subjects
                    him who governs to the absolute necessity of having no greater interest than
                    that of governing well.” This advantage would be found, they affirmed, in the
                    government of an hereditary sovereign, and it would be found in no other.</p>
                <p>The reason was, that in no other could the interests of governor and governed be
                    rendered absolutely the same. As the hereditary sovereign is the hereditary
                    proprietor of the sovereignty, the interest of the sovereignty is his interest.
                    The interest of the sovereignty means the most perfect possible state of the
                    governing authority; that is, the most perfect possible assurance of obedience
                    to its command. But obedience to command can only arise out of the union of
                    wills. And there can be no perfect assurance of the union of wills to obey but
                    from one cause; the evidence that what is commanded is for the benefit of those
                    who are to obey. The interest of the hereditary sovereign, therefore, and the
                    interest of the community, is one and the same.</p>
                <p>With regard to the famous idea of the <hi rend="italic">balance</hi> of a
                    constitution, that fancied arrangement of things in which the power and will of
                    one part of the instruments of government finds a counterpoise in the power and
                    will of another; this pretended counterpoise the economists treated as a perfect
                    chimera, a mere imposition of the imagination, a sort of day-dream.</p>
                <p>The nation, they said, is either instructed or not instructed. Let us examine the
                    supposition of the balance in both cases. If it is instructed, or, in other
                    words, possesses the evidence of the causes of good and evil in society, there
                    is no balance of forces; there is only one force, because force follows will,
                    and here wills are united. They carry the development of this idea to a great
                    length, to which our limits will not permit us to follow them.</p>
                <p>If the nation is not instructed, or, in other words, does not possess the
                    evidence of the causes of good and evil in society, the establishment of
                    counter-forces is impracticable. To ignorance there can be only one salutary
                    counteracting force, and that is evidence. The effect of ignorance in the
                    sovereign is dreaded; and to remove the dread, another man’s ignorance is
                    provided. This is what people call making counter-forces. It must be confessed
                    that they are not of the very best sort of materials. How could it ever be
                    imagined that confidence for any thing stable could be laid on any thing so
                    unaccountable as the results of ignorance?</p>
                <p>Let us adopt this chimera for a moment, and ask if it be possible to assure
                    ourselves that each force will be the same to-morrow which it appears to be
                    to-day. It is evidently impossible; nay, what each appears to-day may be <hi
                    rend="italic">a false</hi> appearance; for, resting only on opinion, detached
                    from evidence, it rests on what can never be exactly known.</p>
                <p>The idea of a balance is the idea of two powers, one tending by its own force in
                    one direction, another urging it by an equal force in an opposite direction. The
                    effect is rest. To balance the power of the sovereign acting in one direction,
                    you provide another power acting in an opposite direction. If the powers are
                    equal, they destroy one another, and there is no action. If they are unequal,
                    there are not two powers, but only one power; for the greater swallows up the
                    less.</p>
                <p>The theory of a constitutional balance is founded on a metaphor, a contrivance of
                    language; and moral forces are supposed to be subject to the laws of material
                    forces. Material forces acting on a body in different directions, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193328439" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8439-0408"/>make it assume a certain
                    determinable duration between the two. But it has not been considered, that in
                    physics the direction given does not depend upon the opinion of the things which
                    act. In morals, on the other hand, the things which are depended upon for
                    counteraction change their duration according to their opinion. A theory which
                    supposes that to be uniform and constant which is known to be the reverse, is
                    evidently absurd.</p>
                <p>Suppose every thing which the theory needs to be supposed. Conceive an assembly,
                    or assemblies, provided to counteract the sovereign, and so constituted, as to
                    form the most perfect counteraction possible; that the sovereign can ordain
                    nothing but with the consent of the assemblies, and the assemblies nothing but
                    with the consent of the sovereign. In this case, it is not a government of one,
                    but a government of many; each member of the assemblies shares in the
                    sovereignty; they are so many partners, therefore, with a particular partner at
                    their head. The question is, what are the interests of the partnership? Those of
                    the nation or not? The interests of the partnership doubtless are, to make it as
                    profitable to the members as possible; for it would be absurd to suppose them
                    not governed by their private interests. Suppose, then, that there is originally
                    a tendency to counteraction between the sovereign and the assemblies. It is
                    v,cry obvious that they will put an end to this counteraction, as far as they
                    discover that the suspension of it is conducive to their private interests. This
                    is a law of nature, and may be taken for granted. As far, then, as the serving
                    of the private interests of the members is concerned, there is no balance of
                    opposite forces; the forces combine instead of opposing, and so far the balance
                    is lost. The loss of the balance to this extent may be a loss engrossing the
                    whole of the protection to the common interest which it was expected to yield,
                    or it may be a loss not extending so far. If it goes to the whole extent of that
                    protection, there is to the purpose in question no balance at all. If it does
                    not go to the whole extent, there will still be some balance, more or less. What
                    then is the case? The case is, that the loss goes to the whole, and that the
                    balance does not exist. The balance does not exist, as far as the private
                    interests of those who share among them the governing powers are concerned. But
                    it is only from the private interests of those who govern that the nation has
                    any thing to fear; it is only against these interests that the balance is
                    provided. As far, however, as these private interests are concerned, the balance
                    does not exist. As far, therefore, as the balance is even <hi rend="italic"
                    >supposed</hi> to be of any service, the balance is excluded by the law of
                    nature. It follows as a corollary, that in a country where the people depend
                    upon what is called <hi rend="italic">a balance</hi> as the whole of their
                    security for good government, they have no security at all.</p>
                <p>Such is the analysis which the economists present of the causes of good and evil
                    in human society, and of that order of things which best insures the presence of
                    the one and the absence of the other. That part of their doctrine which alone is
                    yet known to the mere English reader, their <hi rend="italic">Political
                    Economy,</hi> is introduced as only an auxiliary exposition. It is part of the
                    development by which they endeavoured to prove the identity which they supposed
                    between the interests of the sovereign and the interests of the people. But, as
                    a very distinct account of this part of their system has been given by Dr Adam
                    Smith and other writers, and as our object rather was the exhibition of those
                    doctrines of the sect which nobody has yet presented to our countrymen in their
                    own language, we shall content ourselves with only marking the place which their
                    political economy held in their general system.</p>
                <p>As the society has public expenses, it is necessary that it also have a public
                    revenue. To reconcile the formation of a public revenue with <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> the idea of social order, it ought to be formed, if
                    possible, without infringing the property of individuals, for the sake of which
                    the order of society itself is established. It ought, therefore, if possible, to
                    be formed without diminishing the revenue of individuals. When the real origin
                    of revenue, the source from which it all is drawn, is sufficiently understood,
                    the mode of forming a revenue for the sovereign, without diminishing that of
                    individuals, would be immediately apparent. <hi rend="italic">The source of all
                    riches is the land</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">because the
                    land alone, of all the sources of production, yields a produce greater than the
                    cost of the production.</hi> The surplus produce of the land, therefore,
                    constitutes a fund, which is over and above the remuneration to the agents of
                    production, and out of which the revenue of the sovereign may be taken, without
                    diminishing the motive to production; that is, without retarding the natural
                    progress of the state in wealth, population, and felicity.</p>
                <p>To lay the foundation for this plan of a public revenue, it was necessary to
                    prove that the land is the only source of production; and that manufactures and
                    commerce, though they alter the form of things, never add any thing to the
                    amount or value of production. In the development of these views, one of the
                    most remarkable results at which the economists arrived, was the necessity of
                    perfect freedom to all the proceedings which lead to production; as giving to
                    produce that form which is most agreeable to those who are to make use of it.
                    Till the time of the economists, the necessity of holding those proceedings in
                    chains, and binding them to the will of governments, was the universal doctrine
                    of governments, and, to a great degree, of speculators themselves. The general
                    principles of the economists respecting the <hi rend="italic">freedom</hi> of
                    property necessary to constitute the foundation of social order, led them to
                    infer the evil of those abridgments of freedom; but they examined the inference
                    in detail, and showed that the meddling officiousness of governments to compel
                    industry to one thing, and exclude it from another, not only failed to effect
                    any good purposes, but of necessity created obstructions of the greatest
                    magnitude to production in general, and tended powerfully to keep down the
                    wealth, population, and prosperity of the state. The light which they diffused
                    on this subject, and which soon produced a grand effect on the minds of men, was
                    a good, the magnitude of which is beyond calculation.</p>
                <p>Another of their conclusions is, that the revenue of the sovereign, taken, as
                    they said it ought to be, wholly from the net produce of the land, ought to be a
                    fixed and unalterable proportion of that produce. The reason appeared to them
                    conclusive. If the proportion was variable, and depended upon the will of the
                    owners of the land, they might be induced to break upon the public revenue, and
                    deprive the state of those benefits which the public revenue is necessary to
                    produce. If it depended upon the sovereign, the property of the land might be
                    detached from that of its produce; nobody would have a motive to become a
                    proprietor in land, and all the advantages which depend on the existence of that
                    property would be lost the production of subsistence would fail, and the
                    community could not exist.</p>
                <p>This proportion being once fixed, there is no longer any contrariety between the
                    interest of the sovereign and the interest of any portion of his people; and the
                    proprietor· of land are as completely and securely exempt from contributing to
                    the expense of the state, as any other class of the community. The sovereign
                    derives no part of his revenue from the subject; and this deplorable source of
                    the conflict of interests is wholly cut off. The proportion being settled for
                    ever between the sovereign and the landowners, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193328452" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8452-0409"/>that alone is the property of
                    the landowner which is the proportion remaining to him. The rest is, with regard
                    to him, as if it did not exist. The sovereign they denominated, therefore, <hi
                    rend="italic">co-proprietor</hi> of the land; and between him and the landowner,
                    commonly so called, a perfect community of interests is fixed. It is the
                    interest of the sovereign that the produce of the land should increase, because,
                    with every increase in the produce of the land, his revenue increases. It is
                    also the interest of the landowner that the produce of the land should increase,
                    because it is from the same cause that his revenue increases. See the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Political Economy.</hi></p>
                <p>III. In the remarks which we have to offer on the doctrines of this sect, we must
                    content ourselves with a few general strictures on one or two leading
                    points.</p>
                <p>The most important slips which the economists made in tracing the laws of the
                    social order, are found in their deductions respecting the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tutelary autJu&gt;rity.</hi> Many steps, nevertheless, in that doctrine they
                    have established. That the legislative and executive power are essentially the
                    same, and cannot be separated except in <hi rend="italic">appearance,</hi> they
                    seem to us to have placed beyond the reach of dispute. That no security for good
                    government can be found in an organization of counter-forces, or a <hi
                    rend="italic">balance</hi> in the constitution, they have proved in a manner
                    equally satisfactory. But we think they have not proved that a security for good
                    government can ever be found in the personal interests of a sovereign who unites
                    in himself the whole of the legislative and executive power. And we think they
                    have not proved that this security, if it cannot be found in the interests of
                    such a sovereign, can be found in nothing else.</p>
                <p>1. That the economists do not reason correctly from their own principles, when
                    they regard the interests of the sovereign as an adequate security for good
                    government, may be made apparent, we should hope, by an argument of a very few
                    steps.</p>
                <p>In a perfect state of the social order, they say that the interest of the
                    sovereign w ould be the same with that of the community; and the evidence of
                    this identity would be so clear to the sovereign, that the effect of it would be
                    irresistible on his mind. But in a perfect state of the social order, they say
                    also, that the interest of <hi rend="italic">every</hi> man would consist in the
                    most exact conformity to all the rules of that order, and that the evidence of
                    this truth would be so apparent as to be sure of its effect. In the only state,
                    therefore, in which the interest of the individual entrusted with the tutelary
                    authority could be relied on as a security, the tutelary authority itself would
                    not be required; for in a state in which every man would, of his own accord, do
                    what is best, an authority to compel him to do so would be worse than
                    useless.</p>
                <p>The moment when you suppose a tutelary authority to be necessary, the moment at
                    which you suppose there is any man in the community who can regard his private
                    interest as consisting in any degree in what is hurtful to the community, how
                    can you be sure that the depositary of the legislative and executive powers will
                    not be that man? It can be easily shown that no man is acted upon by stronger
                    forces to impel him in that direction.</p>
                <p>In order to prove that the legislative power cannot be exercised by the community
                    at large, the economists declare expressly, “that if we study the nature of each
                    man in particular, we shall find in general that he would if possible have
                    nothing but rights on his own side, nothing but obligations on the side of other
                    men. The legislative power can be exercised with safety only by those who
                    possess in perfection the evidence of the justice and necessity of the original
                    and pervading laws of social order. It cannot, therefore, be exercised in safety
                    by a body of men, among whom unequal rights exist, and must exist; and who at
                    the same time are all separately desirous that the inequality should be in their
                    favour.”</p>
                <p>Admit this—admit that all men in general desire to have nothing but rights on
                    their own side, obligations on the side of other men; to have the inequality all
                    in their own favour; to possess advantages, in short, over their fellows in the
                    community; and it is surely absurd to talk of security in the interest of the
                    sovereign.</p>
                <p>It is a part of their doctrine, that he who is entrusted with the legislative
                    power cannot be entrusted with the judicial power; because in that case the same
                    party, both legislators and judges, would destroy law, by the exercise of
                    arbitrary will. This is a direct admission, or rather an unlimited affirmation,
                    that the interest of the sovereign is not a security such as good government
                    requires. Again, it is said by the economists, “that under a government
                    conformable to the principles of order, the positive laws would be of a justice
                    and necessity <hi rend="italic">publicly evident</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and that in order to apply these laws, the judges would unite two sorts of
                    knowledge, both of its meaning and of its reason; and, secondly, a knowledge of
                    the facts which constitute the case in which they are required to decide.” No
                    men, according to them, are more urgently called upon, none can be more
                    reasonably expected to be in full possession of the evidence of that interest
                    which every man has in the preservation of the social order. Yet so far are the
                    economists from saying that the interest of these men, and the evidence they
                    could possess of that interest, would be a sufficient security for the right
                    administration of their trust, that they declare them liable to the greatest
                    malversations, and that the ultimate security would lie in the sovereign, who
                    would check them. It is surely matter of wonder how the economists could fail to
                    perceive, that the very same motives which they rejected as security for the
                    right use of authority in the judges, they trusted to as complete security in
                    the sovereign; though likely to operate on the judges with greater force than
                    upon him.</p>
                <p>2. We think it may also be made apparent, that the economists do not reason
                    correctly from their own principles, when they conclude, that if security for
                    good government cannot be found in the interests of one man entrusted with the
                    whole of the legislative and executive powers, it can be found in nothing
                    else.</p>
                <p>They expressly state, that “the first, the real depositary and general guardian
                    of the laws, is the nation itself, at the head of which is the sovereign.
                    Accurately speaking, the deposit and guardianship of the laws <hi rend="italic"
                    >can</hi> belong to those alone who are armed with the superiority of the
                    physical force, to procure to that deposit its necessary superiority. This being
                    evident, it is the nation as a body which naturally and necessarily is the
                    depositary and guardian of its own laws; because there is in the nation no power
                    comparable to that which results from the combination of its powers.” Again,</p>
                <p>In contending that the legislative and executive powers must always be exercised
                    by the same hands, they affirm that those powers could only be exercised by
                    those who had in their hands the superiority of the physical force. Observe,
                    now, the legitimate conclusion:</p>
                <p>The people alone have the physical force necessary to constitute them guardians
                    of the laws. The same force is necessary for tłie makers and the executors of
                    the laws. No body, therefore, but the people ever can, accurately speaking, have
                    either the legislative or the executive powers. In a state of ignorance they may
                    be led by fraud to lend their powers to their own destruction. But it is a part
                    also of the doctrine of the economists, that in a state of knowledge, in which
                    they may be easily placed, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328465"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-8465-0410"/>it is not possible they should make any but a good
                    use of their power.</p>
                <p>“A nation,” they said, “governed according to the natural and essential order of
                    society, has <hi rend="italic">necessarily</hi> the perfect evidence and
                    knowledge of it, and therefore sees with certainty that it enjoys its best
                    possible situation. This perception, of necessity, unites all the wills and all
                    the forces in the nation for the support of that order, and, by consequence, for
                    the creation and preservation of all the institutions which are best adapted to
                    that support.” The people, therefore, may be safely trusted.</p>
                <p>In a nation governed badly, governed not according to “the natural and essential
                    order,” but according to what the economists call the “<hi rend="italic"
                    >political</hi> order,” “it is always,” they said, “one part of the nation which
                    governs the rest; the weaker which governs the stronger. In this case, too, the
                    power of him who commands consists in nothing but the powers united of those who
                    obey him. And this union of their forces supposes, of necessity, the union of
                    their wills; which can be founded only upon the persuasion that this obedience
                    procures them their best possible condition. The powers of the nation in this
                    vicious order are less at the disposal of the sovereign than at the disposal of
                    those who hire to him their agency, and, by consequence, sell to him the means
                    of procuring obedience from the nation; his situation is therefore at bottom a
                    real dependence; his situation is precarious, uncertain, changeable; he is put
                    in chains, which he dares not attempt to break." In every situation, therefore,
                    it is the will of the people, either of the whole of the people united, or of a
                    part of the people united against the rest, which is in reality both the
                    legislative and the executive power. Estimate, therefore, as high as you please,
                    exaggerate to any excess, the inconvenience of being governed by the people, you
                    have that inconvenience still; you are bound to it by the inexorable law of
                    nature; it is not within the range of possibility that you should escape from
                    it.</p>
                <p>We have already seen that the economists declare that “every man wishes to have
                    all the rights on his own side, all the duties on the side of other men; that
                    every man likes inequality, in short, when the inequality is in his own power.”
                    From this they infer, that the community cannot safely govern; but from this it
                    may with much more justness be retorted upon them, that nothing else can safely
                    govern. The interest of the community, say the economists, is easily known; the
                    evidence of it is within the reach of all descriptions of the people, and so
                    cogent as to be irresistible. The union of wills, according to their doctrine,
                    follows as a matter of course. Here, therefore, it should seem we have a much
                    better security than can be found in the interest of any <hi rend="italic"

                <p>It is remarkable enough that the economistá have wholly overlooked, in their
                    criticism on the plans opposed to their own, <hi rend="italic">the
                    representative system</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and yet it is pretty evident
                    that it is by means of the representative system that the grand problem of
                    government must finally be resolved. The speculations connected with this
                    subject will, however, find a more fitting place under the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Government. (a. a. a.)</hi></p>
