                <p><label type="entry">ELGIN MARBLES</label> is the name applied to that noble
                    collection of sculptured figures which was acquired by the British Museum from
                    Lord Elgin. They are mostly basso relievos and fragments of statuary which had
                    adorned the Parthenon at Athens. The history of this collection may be thus
                    shortly stated. It was in 1799 that the idea of such a collection first occurred
                    to Lord Elgin, when he was appointed ambassador at Constantinople. Mr Harrison,
                    an architect, suggested to him, in course of conversation, that though the
                    public possessed every thing requisite to give them a general knowledge of the
                    remains of Athens, yet to artists nothing but the actual representation by cast
                    could be of essential service. Lord Elgin, struck with the truth of this
                    observation, entered into communication with government on the subject; but the
                    important transactions in which the nation was then engaged prevented ministers
                    from undertaking an expense of so indefinite a nature. When Lord Elgin met Sir
                    William Hamilton in Sicily, he entered with him into a more minute examination
                    of the feasibility of the scheme, and they considered the best plan to be
                    pursued in order to ensure success. It appeared to them most advisable that his
                    lordship should be accompanied by artists from Italy. He accordingly obtained
                    permission from the king of the Two Sicilies to take with him Signor Lusieri, a
                    painter of great reputation, who was then in the service of that monarch; whilst
                    he dispatched Mr Hamilton to Rome, in order to engage two architects, two
                    modellers, and a figure painter. In the summer of 1800 these persons reached
                    Athens in safety. At this period the French were in possession of Egypt, and the
                    Turks felt little inclined to afford any facilities towards furthering the
                    object which Lord Elgin had in view. They in fact did every thing to thwart him,
                    and his artists could only obtain admission to the Acropolis, for the purpose of
                    taking drawings, on the payment of a large daily fee. No sooner, however, did
                    our arms prove victorious in Egypt, than a sudden and favourable change took
                    place. The Sublime Porte showed an inclination to grant whatever our nation
                    might think proper to ask; and Lord Elgin, availing himself of this opportunity,
                    obtained, in the summer of 1801, firmans or warrants to the chief authorities of
                    Athens, in which it was stated “that he might view, draw, and model the ancient
                    temples of the idols, and the sculptures upon them, and make excavations, and
                    <hi rend="italic">take away any stones</hi> that might appear interesting to
                    him.” There was little difficulty after this permission had been granted; and as
                    the Turks showed a perfect apathy in respect to the preservation of these
                    remains, and indeed often wantonly destroyed them, Lord Elgin determined to
                    remove as many as his means and the opportunity would allow. In this way did
                    these noble remains of antiquity come into the possession of a British
                    subject.</p>
                <p>In 1811 an offer was made by Mr Percival to purchase the whole collection for the
                    public, and the sum of L.30,000 was named as the price which the government was
                    willing to give; but Lord Elgin thought this an inadequate compensation for the
                    outlay occasioned in procuring the collection, and refused to listen to the
                    proposal. In 1812 eighty more cases of architecture and sculpture were added,
                    and also a collection of medals.</p>
                <p>In 1815, however, Lord Elgin presented a petition to the House of Commons, in
                    which he offered to make over the collection to the nation, on such conditions
                    as it might seem just and reasonable to that assembly to recommend. Accordingly
                    a select committee was appointed to examine into the affair, and after due
                    consideration, and the examination of many witnesses, the committee came to the
                    resolution of recommending the house to offer L.35,000 as a reasonable and
                    sufficient price for this collection.</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that the House of Commons acted wisely in acceding to this
                    proposition, and securing for the nation these noblest models which the genius
                    of man has ever produced, knowing, as we do, how highly the cultivation of the
                    fine arts has contributed to the reputation, character, and dignity of every
                    government by which they have been encouraged, and how intimately they are
                    connected with the advancement of every thing valuable in science,’literature,
                    and philosophy. No country is certainly better adapted than our own to afford an
                    honourable asylum to these monuments of the school of Phidias, and of the wise
                    administration of Pericles.</p>
