                <p><label type="entry">ELIZABETH</label>, queen of England, daughter of Henry VIII.
                    and Anne Boleyn, was born at Greenwich, on the 7th of September 1533. According
                    to the custom of the times, she was early instructed in the learned languages,
                    first by Grindal, who died when she was about seventeen, and afterwards by the
                    celebrated Roger Aschara. She likewise acquired considerable knowledge of the
                    Italian, Spanish, and French languages. Dr Grindal was also her preceptor in
                    divinity, which she is said to have studied with uncommon application and
                    industry. That Elizabeth became a Protestant and her sister Mary a Catholic, was
                    the effect of that cause which determines the religion of the greater part of
                    mankind, namely, the opinion of those by whom they were educated; and this
                    difference of opinion in their tutors is not at all surprising, when we
                    recollect that their father Harry was of both religions, or of neither.</p>
                <p>But the studies of Elizabeth were not confined merely to languages and theology;
                    she was also instructed in the political history of the ancients; and was so
                    well skilled in music as to sing and play “artfully and sweetly.”</p>
                <p>After the short reign of her brother Edward, her sister Mary succeeding to the
                    crown, Elizabeth experienced a considerable degree of persecution, so as to be
                    not a little apprehensive of a violent death. She was accused, imprisoned, and,
                    we are told, inhumanly treated. At last, by the intercession of King Philip of
                    Spain, she was set at liberty; which she continued to enjoy, till, on the death
                    of her sister, she, on the 17th of November 1558, ascended the throne of
                    England. Her history as a queen is detailed in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >England.</hi> The cares of government did not wholly suspend her pursuit of
                    learning. Ascham, in his <hi rend="italic">Schoolmaster,</hi> tell us that about
                    the year 1563, five years after her accession, she read more Greek in θ <hi

                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-1858-0671"/>day than some prebendaries of that church did read
                    Latin in a whole week. That the Latin language was familiar to her, is evident
                    from her speech to the university of Oxford, when she was nearly sixty, and also
                    from her spirited answer to the Popish ambassador in the year 1598. And that she
                    was also skilled in the art of poetry, appears not only from the several scraps
                    which have been preserved, but likewise from the testimony of a contemporary
                    writer, Puttenham, in his <hi rend="italic">Art of English Poetry.</hi> These
                    are his words: “But last in recital and first indegree is the queen, whose
                    learned, delicate, noble muse, easily sur-mountcth all the rest, for sense,
                    sweetness, or subtility, be it in ode, elegy, epigram, or any other kind of
                    poem.” In this author are to be found only a specimen of sixteen verses of her
                    English poetry. “But,” says Mr Walpole, “a greater instance of her genius, and
                    that too in Latin; was her extempore reply to an insolent prohibition delivered
                    to her from Philip II. by his ambassador, in this te-trastic.</p>
                <p>Te veto ne pergas bello defendere Belgas:</p>
                <p>Quae Dracus cripuit, nunc restituantur oportet;</p>
                <p>Quas pater evertit, jubeo to condere cellas: Religio papae fac restituatur ad
                    unguem.</p>
                <p>She instantly answered him, with as much spirit as she used to return his
                    invasions,</p>
                <p>Ad Graecas, bone rex, fient mandata kalendas.”</p>
                <p>She died in her palace at Richmond, the 24th of March 1603, aged seventy, having
                    reigned forty-four years; and was interred in the chapel of Henry VII. in
                    Westminster Abbey. She was the author of the following works: 1. The Mirror, or
                    Glass of the Sinful Soul, which she translated from French verse into English
                    prose when she was eleven years old. The translation was dedicated to Queen
                    Catharine Parr. Probably it was never printed; but the dedication and preface
                    are preserved in the <hi rend="italic">Sylloge</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    was first printed from a manuscript in her majesty’s own handwriting, in the
                    Gentleman’s Magazine for 1743. 4. Two Orations of Isocrates, translated into
                    Latin. 5. Latin Oration at Cambridge, preserved in the king’s library; also in
