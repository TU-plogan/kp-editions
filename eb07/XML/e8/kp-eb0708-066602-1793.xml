                <p><label type="entry">ELEUTHERIA</label>, a festival celebrated at Plataea, in
                    honour of Jupiter <hi rend="italic">Eleutherizzs,</hi> or “the assertor of
                    liberty,” by delegates from almost all the cities of Greece. Its institution
                    originated thus: After the victory which the Grecians under Pausanias obtained
                    over Mardonius the Persian general, in the country of Plataea, an altar and
                    statue were erected to Jupiter Eleutherius, who had freed the Greeks from the
                    tyranny of the barbarians. It was further agreed upon, ih a general assembly, by
                    the advice of Aristides the Athenian, that deputies should be sent every fifth
                    year from the different cities of Greece, to celebrate Eleutheria, or festivals
                    of liberty. The Plataeans celebrated also an annual festival in memory of those
                    who had lost their lives in that famous battle. It was celebrated thus: At break
                    of day a procession moved forward, headed by a trumpeter, who sounded a signal
                    for battle; and after him followed chariots loaded with myrrh, garlands, a black
                    bull, and certain free young men, no signs of servility being permitted to
                    appear during the solemnity, because they in whose honour the festival was
                    instituted had died in the defence of their country. They carried libations of
                    wine and milk in large-cared vessels, with jars of oil and precious ointments;
                    and the rear was brought up by the chief magistrate, who, although not permitted
                    at other times to touch iron, or wear garments of any colour but white, yet on
                    this occasion appeared clad in purple, and taking a water-pot out of the city
                    chamber, proceeded through the middle of the town towards the sepulchres, with a
                    sword in his hand. There he drew water from a neighbouring spring, and washed
                    and anointed the monuments; after which he sacrificed a bull upon a pile of
                    wood, invoking Jupiter and Mercury, and inviting to the entertainment the souls
                    of those happy heroes who had perished on the plains of Plataea. After this he
                    filled a bowl with wine, saying, I drink to those who lost their lives in the
                    defence of the liberties of Greece. There was also a festival of the same name
                    observed by the Samians in honour of the god of love. Slaves, also, when they
                    obtained their liberty, kept a holiday, which they called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eleutheria.</hi></p>
                <p>L’LEUTHEROLACONES, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Independent Laconians,</hi> a name
                    given to the twenty-four confederate towns of Laconia, the independence of which
                    was confirmed by a decree of Augustus. At a much earlier date, when the power of
                    Sparta had been broken and her freedom annihilated by the tyrant Nabis, Titus
                    Quintius had detached the hamlets from all connection with Sparta, and placed
                    them under the protection of the Achaean league. Augustus allowed these towns to
                    be governed by their own laws, and to form a small distinct confederation. Of
                    these twenty-four towns only eighteen are mentioned by Pausanias (iii. p. 21),
                    probably because the others had gradually become depopulated.</p>
