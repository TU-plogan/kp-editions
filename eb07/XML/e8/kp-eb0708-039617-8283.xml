                <p><label type="entry">ECHO</label>, a sound reflected or reverberated from a solid
                    concave body, and so repeated to the ear. The word is formed from the Greek
                    ηχoς, <hi rend="italic">sound,</hi> which comes from the verb ηχsω, <hi
                    rend="italic">sono.</hi></p>
                <p>The ancients being wholly unacquainted with the true cause of the echo, ascribed
                    it to several which are sufficiently whimsical. But the moderns, who know sound
                    to consist in a certain tremor or vibration in the sonorous body, communicated
                    to the contiguous air, and by that means to the ear, give a more consistent
                    account of echo. For a tremulous body, striking on another solid body, may
                    evidently be repelled without destroying or diminishing its tremor; and
                    consequently a sound may be redoubled by the resilition of the tremulous body,
                    or air. But a simple reflection of the sonorous air is not enough to explain the
                    echo; for then every plain surface of a solid hard body, as being fit to reflect
                    a voice or sound, would redouble it, which we find does not hold. In order to
                    produce an echo, therefore, it should seem that a kind of concameration or
                    vaulting is necessary, in order to collect, and by collecting to heighten and
                    increase, and afterwards reflect, the sound, as we fihd is the case in
                    reflecting the rays of light, where a concave mirror is required. In effect, as
                    often as a sound strikes perpendicularly on a wall, behind which is any thing of
                    a vault or arch, or even another parallel wall, so often will it be reverberated
                    in the same line, or other adjacent ones. For an echo to be heard, therefore, it
                    is necessary that the ear should be in the line of reflection; for the person
                    who made the sound to hear its echo, it is necessary that he should be
                    perpendicular to the place which reflects it; and for a manifold or tautological
                    echo, it is necessary that there should be a number of walls, and vaults or
                    cavities, either placed behind or fronting each other. A single arch or
                    concavity can scarcely ev∙er stop and reflect all the sound; but if there be a
                    convenient disposition behind it, part of the sound propagated thither, being
                    collected and reflected as before, will return another echo; or if there be
                    another concavity, opposed at a due distance to the former, the sound reflected
                    from the one upon the other will be tossed back again by the latter.</p>
                <p>Echoes may be produced in circumstances wholly different. For, first, a <hi
                    rend="italic">plane</hi> obstacle reflects back the sound in its due tone and
                    loudness, allowance being made for the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328296"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-8296-0397"/>proportionable decrease of the sound, according to
                    its distance; secondly, a <hi rend="italic">convex</hi> obstacle reflects the
                    sound somewhat smaller and somewhat quicker, though weaker, than otherwise it
                    would be; and, thirdly, a <hi rend="italic">concave</hi> obstacle echoes back
                    the sound larger, slower, and also inverted, but never according to the order of
                    words. Nor does it seem possible to contrive any single echo that shall invert
                    the sound, and repeat backwards; because, in such a case, the word last spoken,
                    that is, which last occurs to the obstacle, must be repelled first, which cannot
                    be. For where in the mean time should the first words hang and be concealed; or
                    how, after such a pause, could they be revived and animated again into motion?
                    From the determinate concavity or arching of the reflecting bodies, it may
                    happen that some of them shall only echo back one determinate note, and only
                    from one place. Fourthly, the echoing body being removed farther off, it
                    reflects more of the sound than when nearer, which is the reason why some echoes
                    repeat but one syllable, some one word, and some many. Fifthly, echoing bodies
                    may be so contrived and placed, that by reflecting the sound from one to the
                    other, either directly and mutually, or obliquely and by succession, out of one
                    sound, a multiple echo or many echoes shall arise. Add to this, that a multiple
                    echo may be made, by so placing the echoing bodies at unequal distances, that
                    they may reflect all one way, and not one on the other. By this means a manifold
                    successive sound will be heard, one clap of the hands like many, one <hi
                    rend="italic">ha</hi> continued like laughter, one single word like many of the
                    same tone and accent, and one viol like many of the same kind imitating each
                    other. Lastly, echoing bodies may be so arranged that from any one given sound
                    they shall produce many echoes different both as to tone and intention. By this
                    means a musical room may be so contrived that one instrument playing therein
                    shall not only seem as many of the same sort and size, but even as a concert of
                    different ones; which is effected by placing certain echoing bodies so that any
                    note placed shall be returned by them in thirds, fifths, and eighths.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Echo</hi> is also used for the place where the repetition of
                    the sound is produced or heard.</p>
                <p>Echoes are distinguished into different kinds. <hi rend="italic">Single
                    echoes</hi> are those which return the voice but once. Of these some are <hi
                    rend="italic">tonical,</hi> which only return a voice when modulated into some
                    particular musical tone; and others, <hi rend="italic">polysyllabical,</hi>
                    which return many syllables, words, and sentences. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Multiple</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tautological</hi> echoes are those which
                    return syllables and words the same oftentimes repeated.</p>
                <p>In echoes, the place where the speaker stands is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >centrum phonicum,</hi> and the object or place that returns the voice the <hi
                    rend="italic">centrum phonocampticum.</hi></p>
                <p>At the sepulchre of Metella, wife of Crassus, there was an echo, which repeated
                    what was said five times. Authors mention a tower at Cyzicus, where the echo
                    repeated seven times. One of the finest echoes we read of is that mentioned by
                    Barthius, in his notes on the <hi rend="italic">Thebais</hi> of Statius (lib.
                    vi. 30), which repeated the words uttered seventeen times; it was situated on
                    the banks of the Naha, between Coblentz and Bingen. Barthius assures us that he
                    bad proved what he writes, and had counted seventeen repetitions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Echo,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Architecture,</hi> a term
                    applied to certain kinds of vaults and arches, most commonly of the elliptic and
                    parabolic figures, used to redouble sounds, and produce artificial echoes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Echo,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Poetry,</hi> a kind of
                    composition in which the last words or syllables of each verse contain some
                    meaning, which, being repeated apart, answers to some question or other matter
                    contained in the verse. Thus, in the line of Virgil:</p>
                <p>Crudelis mater magis, an puer improbus ille? Improbus ille puer, crudelis tu
                    quoque mater.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Echo,</hi> in fabulous history, a daughter of the Air and
                    Tellus, who chiefly resided in the vicinity of the Cephisus. She was once an
                    attendant of Juno's, and became the confidant of Jupiter’s amours. Her
                    loquacity, however, displeased Jupiter, and she was deprived of the power of
                    speech by Juno, and only permitted to answer to the questions which were put to
                    her. Pan had formerly been one of her admirers, but he never enjoyed her
                    favours. Echo, after she had been punished by Juno, fell in love with Narcissus;
                    but being despised by him, pined away, having nothing left but her disembodied
                    voice.</p>
