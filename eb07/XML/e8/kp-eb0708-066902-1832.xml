                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">ELIJAH</label>, who is sometimes denominated Elias, was one
                    of the most distinguished of the Jewish prophets, and surnamed the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tishbite,</hi> probably from the district in which he was born. He
                    entered upon his prophetic office about 920 years before Christ, in the reign of
                    wicked Ahab, by whom the Sidonian idolatry was introduced amongst the
                    Israelites. The prophet was commissioned to appear before this impious prince,
                    and to threaten the country with a long drought as a punishment for his crimes.
                    The indignation of Ahab was so great against the prophet for this prediction,
                    that he resolved to punish him in a signal manner; but Elijah eluded his
                    vengeance by withdrawing at the divine command, to a secret place, where he was
                    supplied with provisions by a raven commissioned by heaven. He was afterwards
                    ordered to go to Sarepta, in the territory of Sidon, where, in the house of an
                    indigent widow, whose son he restored to life, the prophet was again supported
                    in a miraculous manner.</p>
                <p>When the three years of famine, occasioned by the continued drought, had expired,
                    Elijah was commanded to appear before the king, and exhort him to that genuine
                    repentance which an interposition of the deity so very remarkable unquestionably
                    called for. He had an interview with Obadiah, the governor of the king’s house,
                    who was a religious man, and had frequently, at the hazard of his own life,
                    screened many from the vengeance of Jezebel the queen. Inspired with dauntless
                    fortitude, the prophet said to Obadiah, “Go, tell thy lord, behold Elijah is
                    here.” The good man’s regard for the prophet was so great that he was afraid to
                    deliver this message, alleging that Ahab had used every effort to discover the
                    prophet’s retreat. The king was however informed of his coming; and the first
                    interview was distinguished by invectives on the part of the intrepid prophet
                    and the proud sovereign, the formcr giving a promise of rain on the following
                    terms: The priests of the Sidonian gods, and an assembly of the people of
                    Israel, were to meet on Mount Carmel, where the prophet Elijah intended to give
                    an incontestible proof of the almighty power of the God of Israel, and the total
                    insignificance of the Sidonian divinities. For a detailed account of this
                    memorable experiment, we must refer our readers to the book of Kings, as an
                    abridgment of such a beautiful narration would do it manifest injury. It
                    produced the fullest conviction in the minds of the Israelites that Jehovah
                    alone was entitled to adoration; and the priests of Baal were instantaneously
                    put to death, as the most abominable perverters of the divine law.</p>
                <p>This was followed by abundance of rain, in answer to the devout prayers of the
                    prophet; but his glorious triumph over idolatry so exasperated Jezebel, that she
                    resolved to murder the prophet, who, in order to avoid her rage, fled into the
                    wilderness, till the deity again employed him in the honourable but often
                    hazardous duties of a prophet. He afterwards foretold that Hazael should be king
                    of Syria, and Jehu king over Israel; and he appointed Elisha the son of Shaphat
                    to be his own successor. He denounced dreadful judgments against Ahab and his
                    wicked queen Jezebel; but those which respected the king were not executed
                    during his life, on account of the genuine repentance which he discovered. The
                    successor of Ahab having been confined to bed in consequence of an accident, the
                    god of Ekron was consulted relative to his recovery, a circumstance which
                    induced the prophet to declare that he should assuredly die. The king being
                    informed that it was Elijah who dared to send such a message, dispatched a
                    captain and fifty men to bring him by force into the royal presence; but they
                    were destroyed by fire from heaven, and a second company shared the same fate. A
                    third company confessed the visible interference of heaven in the prophet’s
                    behalf, the captain throwing himself on the mercy of Elijah, who went with him
                    to the king. In the royal presence he undauntedly repeated the same denunciation
                    against the idolatrous monarch, which was very soon accomplished; and not long
                    after this the holy prophet, having, by the divine command, divided asunder the
                    waves of Jordan, dropped his prophetic mantle to the astonished Elisha, took the
                    flaming chariot commissioned for his reception, and ascended in majesty to
                    heaven.</p>
