                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">ELIS, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Elea</hi></label>, a province
                    in the north-west of the Peloponnesus, which was comprehended in its greatest
                    extent between the promontory Araxus, where it touched on Achaia, and the river
                    Neda, which separated it from Messenia. In the interior it was separated from
                    Arcadia by the ridges of Mount Phołoë, and farther south by a continuation of
                    the mountains from Arcadia.</p>
                <p>In earlier times this tract of country was divided into three distinct
                    principalities independent of each other. The most northern was surrounded by
                    the lofty mountain Pholoë, which, sending out two ridges towards the coast, the
                    one towards the promontory Araxus, the other towards the promontory Chelnatas,
                    inclosed a large extent of champaign country, called from this circumstance the
                    Hollow Elis (⅛ xo∕λ&gt;; Hλ∕ς). The second principality was named Pisatis, and
                    through its territories flowed the river Alpheus; whilst the district to the
                    south was called Triphylia.</p>
                <p>Elis was by far the most fertile and populous district of the Peloponnesus,
                    chiefly because its extensive plains enjoyed an almost uninterrupted state of
                    peace. Towards the coast the soil becomes sandy; a broad belt of sand stretches
                    along the sea nearly as tar as the Triphylian Pylos, so often called by Homer
                    “the sandy.” This tract of country is but little raised above the level of the
                    sea, and from that reason a number of small lakes or lagoons have been formed,
                    which extend along the greater part of the coast. It was the only district in
                    Greece which produced flax; but this, though equal in fineness, was far inferior
                    in colour, to that of Palestine. Another extraordinary circumstance<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193331845" xml:id="kp-eb0708-1845-0670"/> was, that no
                    mules could be here engendered, though they abounded in the adjacent
                    district.</p>
                <p>At a very early period we find it under the government of Endymion, and called
                    the kingdom of the Epci. Homer was acquainted with the divine Elis, where the
                    Epei ruled. His son Aetolus having accidentally committed a murder, was obliged
                    to fly, and proceeded to found a kingdom on the opposite coast, called from him
                    Aetolia. He was succeeded by Eleus, the grandson of Endymion, who gave name to
                    the country, and after him came Augeas, who was put to death by Hercules because
                    he refused him the reward he had promised for clearing out his stables. We now
                    lose sight of Elis till the irruption of the Heraclidae into Greece, eighty
                    years after the destruction of Troy, when Oxylus, a descendant of Aetolus,
                    offered to become their guide, on condition of receiving the province of Elis,
                    which he considered as the inheritance of bis family. A numerous body of
                    Aetolians attended him, and uniting cordially with the native inhabitants of
                    Elis, they conquered a great part of Pisatis, and took possession of Olympia
                    about 1190 before Christ. Then it was that the Olympic games were first
                    established on the banks of the river Alpheus, though they were not regularly
                    celebrated till the year 776 before Christ, when Coroebus obtained the prize of
                    victory. In the wars between Messenia and Sparta, they were faithful allies of
                    the latter; and with their assistance they took possession of the whole country
                    belonging to the Caucones and Minyae, to which the name of Triphylia was then
                    given. During the Peloponnesian war, we still find them staunch supporters of
                    Spartan politics; and they continued so till the conclusion of the treaty after
                    the battle of Amphipolis, when the countenance afforded by the Spartans to the
                    independent movements of the people of Lepreum produced a rupture between the
                    two nations. Elis endeavoured to take vengeance on the Spartans, by excluding
                    them from all participation in the Olympic games; but the marauding invasions of
                    the Spartans were soon so severely felt, that the inhabitants of Elis were glad
                    to sue for peace, and to renew their ancient alliance with Sparta. In the year
                    365 before Christ, a few years after the battle of Leuctra, they were engaged in
                    war with the Arcadians, and were so unsuccessful that they were compelled to
                    cede the greater portion of their southern possessions. During the Social War,
                    the Eleans were staunch allies of the Aetolians, and no reverses could detach
                    them from the cause which they had joined, or induce them to unite with the
                    Achaean League. These seem to have been the last events in which the Eleans took
                    part as an independent people; and we find them finally included in the general
                    decree which annexed the whole of Greece to the Roman empire.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Elis,</hi> the chief city of the district of Elis, in the
                    Peloponnesus, situated on the banks of the river Peneus, 120 stadia from the
                    sea, and first formed into a district corporation by the union of several
                    detached villages after the Persian war, about 490 years before Christ. The
                    people of this portion of Greece had for ages been devoted to the pleasures of a
                    country life, and they had been able to indulge this natural desire by the
                    sacred character which had been long attached to their territory. At the time
                    when Oxylus got possession of this fertile province, and became master of the
                    temple of Olympia, he had such influence with the Heraclidae as to obtain from
                    them the sanction of an oath that this district should be considered as under
                    the immediate protection of the god whose festival was there solemnized. This
                    seems to have been so strictly attended to that those who founded the city did
                    not think it necessary to surround it with walls, or to take any steps to ward
                    off the attack of an enemy. In the unsettled times which followed the death of
                    Alexander, Elis was occupied, and probably fortified, by Telesphorus, who
                    commanded the fleet of Antigonus. (Diodor. xix. 87; Strab. viii. 357; Xen. Hall.
                    iii. 2, 20.) It appears, in the time of Pausanias, to have still retained much
                    of its former beauty and magnificence, if we may be allowed to judge from the
                    account he has left us of the public buildings. “Its ruins,” says he, “are found
                    now at a spot called <hi rend="italic">Paleopoli,</hi> consisting of several
                    masses of Roman tile and mortar, with many wrought blocks of stone and fragments
                    of sculpture scattered over a space of two or three miles in circumference. The
                    most remarkable of the ruins is that of a square building of about twenty feet
                    on the outside, which is in the form of an octagon with niches. Like most of the
                    other remains, it is built of alternate strata of Roman tile and stone rubble.”
