                <p><label type="entry">YORK</label>, an English county, by far the largest in the
                    kingdom. In extent it more than equals the two next largest counties, viz.
                    Devonshire and Lincoln. According to the parliamentary returns of 1831, the
                    whole surface is 5836 square statute miles, or 3,730,040 acres, or nearly
                    one-ninth part of the southern division of the united kingdom. This county is
                    bounded on the cast by the German Ocean; on the north by the counties of Durham
                    and Westmoreland; on the west by the latter county and Lancashire; and on the
                    south by Cheshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, and Lincolnshire. The river Tees
                    on the north, and the Humber on the south, are boundaries marked by the hand of
                    nature, and so, in some degree, are the ranges of hills on the western sides;
                    but these last are indefinite, and, like most other divisions of counties, those
                    of Yorkshire <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=1002"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-1002-0962"/>are mostly imaginary lines, whose position is
                    chiefly ascertained by local tradition.</p>
                <p>This county is divided into three portions called Ridings, designated from their
                    positions as the East, the North, and the West, and one smaller division called
                    the Ainsty of York, comprehending the city of that name and a district
                    surrounding it. As the statistical account of the population may be more
                    appropriately shewn under the heads of the respective divisions, we need here
                    only state the collective results of the several decennial enumerations that
                    have been made in the present century. They are as follows. In 1801, 858,892; in
                    1811, 986,174, in 1821, 1,173,187; and in 1831, 1,371,359.</p>
                <p>The members of the upper house of parliament taking their titles from places in
                    the county are the following, viz. dukes of Richmond, Leeds, and Cleveland;
                    marquis of Normanby; earls of Doncaster (duke of Buccleuch in Scotland), of
                    Scarborough, of Pomfret, of Beverley, of Harewood, and of Ripon; Barons Hawke,
                    Bolton, Ribbles-dale, Prudhoe, and Wharncliffe. The representatives of Yorkshire
                    in the House of Commons have been much altered by the reform act of 1832. The
                    three ridings return two members each; the boroughs of Aldborough,
                    Boroughbridge, and Hedon, which returned two members each, have been
                    disfranchised; and Thirsk and Northallerton, which returned two, now elect but
                    one each. The large towns of Leeds, Sheffield, Bradford, and Halifax, have been
                    created boroughs, electing two members each, as well as Wakefield, Whitby, and
                    Huddersfield, which have one each. The whole county thus returns five more
                    members than it did before the passing of the act in question.</p>
                <p>The wealth and fertility of Yorkshire are much promoted by the rivers which in
                    various directions pass through it, and by the several navigable canals, which
                    either unite the different branches of those rivers, or draw from them a supply
                    of water for their immediate use. The Tees forms a boundary to Yorkshire on the
                    side of Durham, but a very small portion of its waters is collected from the
                    former county. In the west riding, the rivers Ribble and Wenning’ flow towards
                    the Irish Sea; but they are inconsiderable streams till they enter Lancashire.
                    All the others that have their sources in Yorkshire empty themselves into the
                    German Ocean, in a river then denominated the Ouse, through the great estuary
                    the Humber. The Ouse is composed of two small rivers, the Swale and the Ure,
                    which unite below Boroughbridge, and, soon after receiving the waters of the
                    Nidd, passes by the city of York, to which place it is navigable. It is soon
                    afterwards increased by the reception of the Wharfe on its right bank, and of
                    the Derwent on its left. It then receives the river Aine, whose waters near
                    Snaith have been increased by those of the Calder and its numerous tributary
                    rivulets; and soon after, on the same bank, the river Don, when its breadth is
                    nearly equal to that of the Thames. The most important canal is the Leeds and
                    Liverpool, which connects together, by internal navigation, the two important
                    ports of Hull and Liverpool, and affords to the manufacturers facilities of
                    exporting their productions from either of those places, as may be most suitable
                    for the various markets to which they are destined. There are several shorter
                    canals, which connect the towns with the navigable rivers, or convey from the
                    coal-mines their important produce. Many projects for the construction of
                    railroads through this county have been formed, and some of the works have been
                    begun; others are yet waiting for parliamentary or legal decisions; but a few
                    years will produce great changes in the modes and facilities of
                    communication.</p>
                <p>The north riding of Yorkshire is divided into ten wapentakes, two liberties, and
                    the towns of Richmond, Scarborough, and Whitby. The area of the riding is
                    1,315,200 acres, as measured on the best maps; while that resulting from the
                    returns of each parish is only 1,275,820, a discrepancy that cannot be accounted
                    for. Mr Tuke forty years ago estimated the area at 1,311,187 acres, of which
                    442,565 acres were then uncultivated. It is now supposed, though not
                    ascertained, that more than one half of what was then classed as uncultivated
                    has, within the last forty years, been rendered more or less productive.</p>
                <p>The population at the four decennial enumerations has been found to be, in 1801,
                    158,225; in 1811, 169,391; in 1821, 187,452; and in 1831, 190,756. At the last
                    of these periods, the males were 93,203, and the females 97,553. The families
                    were 40,760, of whom 17,964 were chiefly employed in agriculture, 11,298 in
                    trade or handicraft, and 11,498 were not comprised in either of the preceding
                    classes. The number of males at that time under twenty years of age was 47,396;
                    the occupiers of land employing labourers was 4950, of those not employing
                    labourers 4334; the labourers employed in agriculture were 14,646; the persons
                    employed in manufactures, or in making manufacturing machinery, were 1009; those
                    employed in retail trade or handicraft, as masters or workmen, 12,749; the
                    capitalists, bankers, professional or other educated men, 1870; the labourers
                    employed in labour not agricultural, 4391; other males twenty years of age,
                    excepting servants, 2836; male servants twenty years of age, 615; and under
                    twenty years, 229. The female servants were 9261.</p>
                <p>The land on the sea-shore is generally lofty, and the cliffs precipitous, varying
                    in height from one hundred and fifty to nine hundred feet. Within this narrow
                    sea-boundary is a tract called the Eastern Moorlands, about thirty miles from
                    east to west, and fifteen from north to south. It is apparently a barren
                    country, penetrated with some beautiful and fertile valleys, which are indeed
                    narrow; but the hills that rise on both sides of them are cultivated nearly to
                    the top. Rosebury-Topping, a mountain whose summit is 1480 feet above the level
                    of the sea, overlooks the beautiful vale of Cleveland, and the other parts of
                    the western division of this riding, especially the rich and picturesque
                    districts in the vicinity of Boroughbridge and Richmond. The western moorlands
                    are superior in fertility to the eastern. Some of the dales in this district are
                    celebrated for their beauty and fertility, particularly Wens-ley Dale, Swale
                    Dale, and some of the smaller sheltered spots.</p>
                <p>The cultivation varies so much that it is difficult to give even an outline of
                    the different practices. The greater portion of the land is in pasture. In
                    Cleveland and Rye Dale the best wheats are grown; and the average produce is
                    somewhat more than twenty-three bushels to an acre. Barley is not much grown,
                    nor rye, except on poor and sandy soils. Oats are extensively cultivated, and
                    great crops are produced in Rye Dale and some other of the vales. They are
                    chiefly consumed in the manufacturing districts, where they form the food of the
                    greater part of the labourers. In many parts of this riding, a mixture of wheat
                    and rye is sown: this corn is commonly known by the name of meslin, and is made
                    into flour, of which the bread of almost the whole district is composed. The
                    breeding and fattening of cattle, and the operations of the dairy, are of more
                    importance to this riding than the growth of corn. The cows are generally of the
                    short-homed kind, and they are of small size, but clean made, and fine in the
                    bone. The average weight of the oxen, when fat, is about forty stone. The sheep
                    are still mostly of the old large coarse-boned race, but improvements are
                    proceeding by the gradual mixture of the Dishley and Northumberland breeds. The
                    fine wool clipped in this district is mostly consumed in the domestic
                    manufactures of hosiery, in the knitting of which the females are very generally
                    occupied.</p>
                <p>The whole of Yorkshire has been long celebrated for its <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=1003" xml:id="kp-eb0721-1003-0963"
                    />attention to the breeds of horses, but the chief seat for rearing them is in
                    the north riding. The horses of Cleveland being clean made, strong, and active,
                    are well calculated for draft; those of the vale of York, by the introduction of
                    the racing bl∞d, are fitter for the saddle. The vales of the eastern moorlands
                    rear many horses of a smaller but useful breed.</p>
                <p>The mineral productions of this division of Yorkshire are not of great account.
                    To the west of Richmond some lead mines are advantageously worked. Iron and
                    copper have been formerly raised. The former metal is still produced near Whitby
                    and Scarborough, but the mines of the latter are abandoned. Coal is found in
                    various parts of the riding, but the quantity is small and the quality bad; and
                    hence the chief supply of fuel is obtained from Durham. The most valuable
                    mineral production is alum, which is collected and prepared in large quantities
                    at different works on the northern shore of the riding.</p>
                <p>This division of Yorkshire can scarcely be viewed as a manufacturing district.
                    The greatest portion of those employed in making goods are weavers of linen,
                    which is a kind of domestic industry, in no one place employing more than 120
                    persons, and the whole of them not exceeding 400. Ship-building, and the
                    attendant operations of making ropes, sail-cloth, and iron-work, employ many
                    hands in and near Whitby; and on that part of the coast, at the proper season,
                    the herring-fishery affords some occupation.</p>
                <p>The most striking remains of antiquity in the riding are Scarborough Castle, and
                    the abbeys of Rievaulx, Byland, and Whitby.</p>
                <p>Among a vast number of seats of noblemen and gentlemen, some of the most
                    conspicuous and celebrated are, Bishopsthorpe, archbishop of York; Castle
                    Howard, earl of Carlisle; Duncombe Park, Lord Feversham; Hornby Castle, duke of
                    Leeds; Kirkleatham Hall, Sir Charles Turner, Bart.; Marske Hall, Honourable L.
                    Dundas; Mulgrave Castle, the marquis of Normanby; Newby Park, Earl de Grey;
                    Brompton, Sir George Cayley, Bart.; Rokeby, J. B. S. Morritt, Esq.; Gersham,
                    duke of Cleveland; and Aske, earl of Zetland.</p>
                <p>The largest towns in the riding, and the population of them in 1831, were these:
                    Scarborough, 8369; Whitby, 7763; Malton, 4173; Richmond, 3900; Northallerton,
                    3004; Thirsk, 2838; Pickering, 2555. The elections for the riding are held at
                    the city of York; and the other polling places are Malton, Scarborough, Whitby,
                    Stokes-ley, Gaisborough, Romaldkirk, Richmond, Askrigg, Thirsk, Northallerton,
                    and Kirby Moorside.</p>
                <p>The east riding of the county of York is divided into six wapentakes, the borough
                    of Beverley, and the town and borough of Kingston-upon-Hull. The area of this
                    the smallest of the three ridings, as measured on the map, is 716,160 acres, but
                    the returns from parishes is only711,360 acres, the difference probably arising
                    from roads and rivers not being included in the computation.</p>
                <p>The population at the four decennial enumerations has been found to be, in 1801,
                    110,992; in 1811, 133,975; in 1821, 153,854; and in 1831, 168,891. At the last
                    of these periods, the males were 82,142, and the females 86,749. The number of
                    families was 36,960, of whom 13,025 were chiefly employed in agriculture, 10,825
                    in trade, manufactures, and handicraft, and 13,110 were not comprised in either
                    of these classes. The number of males at that time twenty years of age was
                    41,184. The occupiers of land employing labourers were 3331, and those not
                    employing labourers were 1661; the labourers employed in agriculture were
                    12,727; the persons employed in manufactures, or in making machinery, were 175;
                    those employed in retail trade or handicraft, as masters or workmen, were
                    12,017; the capitalists, bankers, professional or other educated men.</p>
                <p>were 2398; the labourers employed in other than agricultural work were 4663;
                    other males twenty years of age (except servants) were 2627; the male servants
                    twenty years of age were 625, and those under that age 234; the female servants
                    were 6285.</p>
                <p>This division of Yorkshire is not marked by any strong or peculiarly striking
                    features, though in some few parts the scenery is good, and, including the
                    sea-views, the prospects near the coast are rather pleasing. The riding may be
                    divided into three parts, as far as regards its productive powers. The first is
                    a tract of level land, extending from the river Humber to nearly the northern
                    boundary of the district. This is in part a rich soil, and, including
                    Holderness, contains some of the best feeding land in this island. The next
                    division is the Wolds, running from north to south, parallel to the former. They
                    are a range of chalky hills, elevated above the level country about 600 feet.
                    The soil is rather a light and chalky loam, in some places mixed with gravel, in
                    others with clay. The extent is from 300,000 to 400,000 acres. Thirty years ago,
                    a very small portion of these Wolds was cultivated; but of late years much of it
                    has been enclosed, and converted into corn-land. The want of good roads is still
                    felt in this part of the country, though the materials for making such roads are
                    abundant and near at hand. The third natural division of the east riding extends
                    from the western foot of the Wolds to the boundaries of the north and west
                    ridings. This tract, commonly called the Levels, is everywhere flat and
                    unpic-turesque. The soil is various, but in general of a clayey nature. From
                    Gilberdike to Howden it is very heavy; and though the country is well covered
                    with villages and hamlets, it is extremely dirty, disagreeable, and difficult to
                    travel over.</p>
                <p>No part of England shews more proofs of recent agricultural improvements than
                    this riding of Yorkshire. The Wolds have been, by paring and burning, changed
                    from sheep pasture into corn-bearing land. In the low lands great improvements
                    have also been made; extensive tracts, formerly flooded a great part of the
                    year, and scarcely producing any thing but rushes, have been drained, and are
                    covered with such crops of grain that the value of the land has been increased
                    in a most extraordinary degree. The Wolds, in their former state, were very well
                    adapted for breeding horses; but in their present improved state are more
                    profitable as affording pasture for sheep and as growing com. The warrens for
                    rabbits were formerly very numerous and extensive, but, for the most part, are
                    now more productive by being covered with herbage of a better quality. The
                    farms, especially on the Wolds, and in the southern parts of Holdemess, are
                    generally large, renting from L.200 to L.2000 per annum. The climate of the east
                    riding varies considerably. Near the coast, the air is cold, and frequently
                    charged with dense fogs. On the Wolds the cold is more severe, and the snow lies
                    longer; but to the westward of the hills, the air is warm and moist, and tends
                    to produce agues. There are no mines in this riding, and no manufactures, except
                    the spinning of flax, which is performed by the ancient method, and is carried
                    on by all the females in the farm houses at their leisure hours. The foreign and
                    internal commerce of the riding is wholly carried on through the port of Hull, a
                    place which has thriven during the last forty years as much as any portion of
                    the kingdom. During that period, its population has been more than doubled, and
                    its mercantile shipping and other property have been increased far beyond that
                    ratio.</p>
                <p>Extensive docks have been constructed for the reception of vessels, and for
                    affording facilities in the landing and storing of their cargoes. Around these
                    docks a new tow n has arisen, on what was formerly a swamp, and it surpasses the
                    ancient part in cheerfulness and beauty. The foreign <pb break="no"

                    />trade of Hull consists in the importation from Russia, Sweden, and Denmark, of
                    naval stores, and the other productions of those countries, and in the
                    exportation to them of the manufactured goods produced in the counties of York,
                    Lancaster, Derby, Chester, and Nottingham, with which the town is connected by
                    means of canal and river-navigation. The same description of trade is carried on
                    between Hull and the ports of Holland and Germany as exists betwixt it and the
                    towns on the Baltic Sea. Although these are the most ancient and the most
                    natural sources of the commerce of Hull, yet to them it is by no means confined.
                    Considerable trade is carried on with the United States of America, with the
                    West Indies, with the ports of the Mediterranean, with Spain and Portugal, and
                    recently with South America. The building and equipping of ships is a source of
                    great employment, and some ships as large as those with 74 guns were built here
                    during the war. Many vessels belonging to Hull shipowners are to be hired for
                    freight, and may be found in almost every part of the globe. The whale-fishery
                    has, from the first years of the discovery of Greenland, been pursued by the
                    inhabitants of Hull, but with pre-eminent success ever since the year 1766, when
                    an individual merchant of that town gave an impulse to that branch of industry,
                    by which its prosperity has been much promoted. In order to promote the internal
                    trade of this division of the county, the town of Goole, on the river Ouse, has,
                    by a recent act of parliament, been made a customhouse and bonding port. Many
                    ships now repair to it to load and discharge cargoes, from its being near to the
                    chief seat of the manufacturing districts, where the population is the most
                    dense, and where is the greatest production as well as consumption of various
                    articles of merchandize. The trade with the interior, by the different rivers
                    that empty their waters into the Humber, and by the canals that connect these
                    rivers with each other, is of an extent which has no parallel in any other part
                    of Europe, where their rivers have a course of navigation of much greater
                    length.</p>
                <p>The most interesting objects in this division of Yorkshire are the natural eaves
                    at Flamborough Head, York Minster. Howden Church, Kirkham Priory, Bridlington
                    Priory, and Trinity Church in Hull.</p>
                <p>The most distinguished seats of noblemen and gentlemen are Wressle Castle,
                    Colonel Wyndham; Birdsal, Lord Middleton; Boynton, Sir William Strickland; Cave
                    Castle, H. B. Barnard, Esq.; Burton Constable, Francis Constable, Esq.; Hotham,
                    R. C. Burton, Esq.; Ragwell, D. Sykes, Esq.; Sledmere, Sir Μ. Μ. Sykes, Bart.;
                    Woodhouse, Robert Denison, Esq.; Melburn, Sir Henry Vavasour, Barb; and
                    Scampson, Sir William St Quintin, Bart.</p>
                <p>The election for members of parliament for the east riding is held at Beverley;
                    and the other polling places are Hull, Driffield, Pocklington, Bridlington,
                    Howden, Hedon, and Settrington.</p>
                <p>The principal towns and their inhabitants in 1831 were, Hull town, 32,958, but
                    including its very large suburb Sculcoates with 13,468, and Sutton with 4383
                    inhabitants, the population of the port was 50,809; Beverley, 8302; Bridlington,
                    4792; Howden, 4531; and Driffield, 2990.</p>
                <p>The west riding of the county very far exceeds the other two in extent,
                    population, wealth, and activity. It is divided into nine wapentakes; and beside
                    these, a small district is, for election purposes, comprehended in this riding,
                    although some parts of it are situated in the other two ridings. The division of
                    this part, called the Ainsty of the city of York, comprehends the city itself
                    and eighteen other parishes, whose extent is 54,400 acres. Leaving out this
                    Ainsty, the west riding contains 2576 square statute miles, or 1,648,640 acres.
                    The population at the four decennial enumerations was found to be, in 1801,
                    565,282; in 1811,</p>
                <p>655,350; in 1821,801,274; and in 1831, 976,350. At the last of these periods, the
                    males were 485,812, and the females 490,538; the families were 198,646, of whom
                    31,188 were chiefly employed in agriculture, 118,733 were engaged in trade and
                    manufactures, and 48,725 not comprised in either of the other two classes. The
                    number of males at that time under twenty years of age was 231,666; the
                    occupiers of land employing labourers were 7096; the occupiers of land not
                    employing labourers were 10,636; the labourers employed in agriculture were
                    24,502; those persons employed in manufactures, or in making manufacturing
                    machinery, were 74,699; those employed in retail trade or handicraft, as masters
                    or workmen, were 60,109; the capitalists, bankers, professional and other
                    educated men, were 8354; the labourers employed in labour not agricultural,
                    33,685; other males twenty years of age (excepting servants) 10,366; male
                    servants twenty years of age, 2249, and under twenty years of age, 1025; the
                    female servants were 22,107.</p>
                <p>The face of the country furnishes scenes strikingly contrasted. The eastern
                    portion, stretched along the banks of the Ouse, is generally a flat, moist, and
                    marshy district, in some parts fruitful, but in all uninteresting to the
                    tourist. The middle part, as far as Sheffield, Bradford, and Otley, is an
                    undulating country, finely varied, and rising gradually till it reaches the most
                    western portion, which is very rugged and mountainous. Beyond Sheffield, black
                    moors are the only objects, till Blackstone Ledge is reached, on the confines of
                    Lancashire. The western part of Craven presents heaps of rocks and mountains in
                    the most picturesque forms and situations. Pennygant, Wharnside, and
                    Ingleborough, the most conspicuous of these, may be classed among the loftiest
                    mountains in England. According to the Trigonometrical Survey of Colonel Mudge,
                    the height of Wharnside is 2263 feet, of Pennygant, 2270, and of Ingleborough,
                    2361. Amidst the hilly and mountainous tracts of this riding are many romantic
                    and some sequestered valleys, presenting the most beautiful scenery. The roost
                    extensive of these are Netherdale, watered by the Nid, Wharfdale, and the vale
                    of Aire; but many of the smaller vales vie with them in picturesque beauty, and,
                    being generally enclosed, well wooded, and thickly studded with villages and
                    houses, present, from the surrounding eminences, the most enchanting prospects,
                    combining often in the same view the most sublime and the most lively of rural
                    scenery. The roads from Knaresborough or Ripon to Pateley Bridge, from Tadcaster
                    to Otley and Skipton, from Leeds by Bradford and Keighley to Skipton, from
                    Bradford to Halifax, and from Halifax by Dewsbury to Wakefield, unfold some of
                    the finest scenery that can be seen in this island. The climate of this riding
                    is very much varied; in the eastern part, near the Ouse, it is warm and moist;
                    in the middle district the air is sharp, clear, and generally considered
                    healthy; in the western parts the climate is cold, tempestuous, and rainy. The
                    mountains of Craven and the moors near Blackstone Ledge are the most foggy,
                    rainy, and stormy districts in England, though the climate is considered to be
                    salubrious to those of sound constitutions, and the inhabitants have a robust
                    and healthy appearance.</p>
                <p>A very great portion of the land of this riding is possessed by small
                    proprietors, although some few noblemen have extensive tracts of land. Most of
                    the occupancies are rather small; none is large; the greater part are less than
                    fifty acres. A great part is kept exclusively in grass, and used for the dairy
                    or for fattening cattle. On the arable lands a greater quantity of wheat is
                    raised than of any other grain. It is mostly of the red kind, and is sown after
                    fallow or turnips, but sometimes on a clover ley. Rye is not cultivated to any
                    great extent. Barley is raised in much less quantities than wheat, Oats are
                    cultivated to a great extent, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=1005" xml:id="kp-eb0721-1005-0965"/>
                    but little attention is paid to procuring the best seed, though oatmeal forms
                    the chief part of the food of the inhabitants, especially in the more western
                    parts of the riding. Pease are not much raised, nor beans, except on the moorish
                    soils near the Ouse. The turnip husbandry is not so extensively practised as
                    good farming requires; and where it is pursued, it is generally executed in a
                    slovenly and imperfect manner. Great crops of potatoes are raised in the part of
                    the riding below the junction of the river Aire with the Ouse. In the same part
                    of the country much flax is grown, the preparation of the land for which employs
                    the labour of many hands, as does the dressing and preparing the article for
                    market. Rape for making oil, and woad for the dyers, are both cultivated in this
                    riding, but not to any great extent. The waste lands in the west riding were
                    estimated about twenty-five years ago at 400,000 acres, of which 250,000 were
                    considered capable of profitable improvement, and the rest fit for no other
                    purpose but that of planting. Since that period much marsh land has been
                    drained, many commons enclosed, and some bleak hills planted with Scotish firs
                    and larches. Vast improvement has been made on some large tracts of land by the
                    operation locally called <hi rend="italic">warping,</hi> which is performed by
                    permitting the river, at the highest of the tide, to overflow the land. The rich
                    mud with which the turbid rivers abound is deposited on the surface, and each
                    return of tide increases the earth thus deposited, so that a depth of alluvial
                    soil of fourteen inches has been raised by this means on a field which
                    previously was of very little value. The lands thus improved are so enriched
                    that they will yield abundant crops for several successive years without any
                    manure. The horned cattle, sheep, and horses of the west riding have no
                    distinguishing characteristics, but vary in kind, as in the other two ridings.
                    The same care is not here exercised in improving the breed of horses as in the
                    other two divisions of Yorkshire. The agriculture of this division, if it has
                    not been so rapidly progressive as in some other parts of England, has much
                    improved within the last twenty years; and hence, though in that period the
                    population has increased fifty per cent, yet the quantity of corn required from
                    other districts for its subsistence is scarcely greater than at the first
                    period.</p>
                <p>In this division of Yorkshire the mines produce great quantities of coal,
                    ironstone, and lead, and vast quarries of limestone. The coal and limestone
                    indeed appear to be almost inexhaustible. The limestone district commences on
                    the tract between Doncaster and Tadcaster, and extends to the western limits of
                    the county. The coal-mines are most numerous between Leeds and Wakefield, and in
                    the neighbourhood of Bradford, Barnsley, and Sheffield, although there are many
                    in other parts of the riding. Iron is found in the greatest quantities near
                    Bradford, and often in the same mine with coal. The best strata of coals are
                    those found under the seams of iron, at a depth from 220 to 240 feet below the
                    surface. The chief mines of lead are at Grassington, a manor belonging to the
                    duke of Devonshire, about ten miles to the westward of Pateley Bridge. It is
                    more owing to the abundant supply of fuel than to any other single cause, that
                    so much manufacturing industry has been developed in this part of Yorkshire, as
                    well as in the neighbouring county of Lancaster.</p>
                <p>The great branches of industry which have so rapidly peopled and so vastly
                    enriched the west riding of Yorkshire, are the several manufactures that have
                    been established in every part of it Scarcely a hamlet, or even a house, is to
                    be found wherein some part of one or other of the occupations of manufacture, or
                    of those subservient to it, are not seen in different stages of progress. The
                    iron and other hardware goods are produced at Sheffield, Rotherham, and all the
                    villages in the vicinity of those towns. A little to the northward, the large
                    towns of Leeds, Halifax, Bradford, Huddersfield, Wakefield, and the overflowing
                    villages of Almondbury, Kirk-Heaton, Birstall, Dewsbury, with many other places,
                    are devoted to the production of woollen, worsted, cotton, and some linen goods.
                    The progress of the two last fabrics, especially that of linen goods, has been
                    most remarkable since the introduction of power-looms for weaving, and the
                    improvements in machinery for spinning flax. To enumerate the various articles
                    produced by the manufacturers of this most industrious of our districts, would
                    be to copy a catalogue of almost every thing adapted to the use of civilized
                    life.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable remains of antiquity in this riding are Selby Abbey,
                    Knaresborough Castle, Fountain’s Abbey, Skipton Castle, Bolton Priory, Kirkstall

                <p>In proportion to the great extent of the west riding of Yorkshire, it contains
                    more seats of noblemen and gentlemen of distinguished beauty than any other part
                    of Great Britain. Our limits do not allow of our even noticing one-tenth part of
                    them, but the most remarkable are the following: Wentworth House, Earl
                    Fitzwilliam; Harewood, earl of Harewood; Farnley Hall, Walter Fawkes, Esq.;
                    Ripley Castle, Sir William Ingilby; Metheley Park, Lord Mexborough; Gisborne
                    Park, Lord Ribblesdale; Sandbeck, earl of Scarborough; Studley Royal, Miss
                    Lawrence; Ribstone Hall, Sir Henry Goodricke, Bart.; Copgrove, Henry Duncombe,

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">York,</hi> a very ancient city, the capital of the county of
                    the same name. It is 198 miles from London, and 201 from Edinburgh. This city
                    ranks as the second in the kingdom, and is said to have been founded by
                    Ebrancus, 983 years before the Christian era. In form it is very similar to
                    Rome, the river <hi rend="italic">Ebor</hi> (now called the Ouse) running
                    directly through it. Little is known of its history till the year of our Lord
                    150, when it was one of the greatest Roman stations in the province, having an
                    imperial palace, a tribunal, and a regular government within its walls, the same
                    as at Rome. In 207 the emperor Severus undertook an expedition to Britain, and
                    lost 50,000 men in defeating the Britons at York. He lived in the palace three
                    years, and died there. His body was burnt on an elevated ground near the city,
                    now called Severus’s Hill, and his ashes were sent to Rome. He was succeeded by
                    his sons, Caracalla and Geta, the former of whom murdered the latter in York,
                    and returned to Rome. About a century after, Carausius landed in Britain, and
                    was proclaimed<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=1006"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-1006-0966"/> emperor at York. He was slain by his friend
                    Alectus, who in his turn was slain by the emperor Constantius, father of
                    Constantine the Great, the latter of whom was born in York in 272, and left it
                    in the fourth century. Constantius died in the palace at York in 307. In the
                    twentieth year of the reign of Constantine, Octavius, king of the Britons,
                    rebelled, but was subdued. Being afterwards joined by the Scots, he defeated the
                    Romans. Britain was then connected with Gaul, and Constantine divided it into
                    three parts, York remaining the metropolis. Constantine soon after this left
                    Britain, and removed the seat of government to Byzantium. The Picts and Scots
                    now rushed upon the Britons, and the latter engaged the assistance of the
                    Saxons. York was consequently the scene of many a deadly conflict, Britons,
                    Saxons, and Danes struggling for dominion, till William the Conqueror came and
                    took possession of the English crown. In all the subsequent national troubles
                    York has had her share, and was particularly conspicuous during the civil wars
                    of Charles the First. The walls, gates, and posterns are to a considerable
                    degree still remaining, and possess high and gratifying interest to the passing
                    stranger. The walls, which are three miles in circumference, have a delightful
                    promenade on the top of them, which commands a beautiful prospect of the
                    surrounding country.</p>
                <p>The civil government of the city, under the municipal corporation act, which
                    divides it into six wards, is vested in a mayor (who still retains the title of
                    lord mayor), twelve aldermen, and thirty-five councillors. There are also a
                    recorder, town clerk, and prothonotary. The city gives the title of duke of York
                    to the second son of the sovereign, and returns two members to parliament. The
                    aldermen were formerly justices of the peace, but the magistrates are now
                    appointed by the crown. The situation of York is on a pleasant and healthy
                    plain, through which flow two rivers, the Ouse and the Foss. They are both
                    navigable; but the former is the more important river, and, joining the Humber
                    at no great distance, has a direct communication with the main ocean. There are
                    two markets every week, one on Thursday, the other on Saturday. The latter is
                    the principal, and is always plentifully supplied. There formerly was a division
                    in connection with York, entitled the Ainsty, or County of the City. It was
                    formed by King Richard in 1392. This division included thirty-five towns and
                    villages. In 1837, however, this county of the city being joined to the west
                    riding of Yorkshire, was parcelled into the eastern or York division, and into
                    the western or Tadcaster division; the townships of the former to attend special
                    and petty sessions at the castle of York, those of the latter at Tadcaster.
                    There is another distinct and important division of the city, connected with the
                    cathedral or church of St Peter, and called the Liberty of St Peter. In this
                    division district courts arc held, and magistrates preside, in connection with
                    both ecclesiastical and common law.</p>
                <p>The minster or cathedral stands the foremost among the public buildings of the
                    city, and is worthy of the attention of every stranger. It is unquestionably the
                    finest Gothic building of the kind in Europe; and in every respect may be
                    pronounced, both as regards the interior and the exterior, truly imposing and
                    magnificent. It was first founded in 626, by Edwin the Saxon king of
                    Northumberland, and through succeeding ages has been enlarged, repaired, and
                    improved, with great taste, and with a uniformity which is highly creditable to
                    all concerned. Our limits will not allow of a minute description, but we may
                    venture to give a brief outline. The nave, from the west end to the door of the
                    choir, is 261 feet long, 109 feet wide, and ninety-nine feet high. The windows
                    of the nave are long, narrow, and pointed, containing representations of some of
                    the apostles, archbishops, &amp;c. Near the south entrance 273 winding steps
                    lead to the summit of the principal tower, from which there is a splendid view
                    of the city and neighbourhood. The body of the nave comprises eight equal
                    arches, the principal part of the western towers being supported by columns.
                    Over the arches runs a curious gallery. On each side, and beyond the choir, are
                    the monuments, many of which are highly interesting. In 741, the minster
                    suffered much by fire. It was repaired, and in 1069, during the siege by the
                    Northumbrians and Danes, was again the victim of that unsparing element. Being
                    rebuilt, it remained the admiration of every beholder, till June 1137, when a
                    tremendous fire in the city consumed it, St Mary’s Abbey, and thirty-nine parish
                    churches. It was partly rebuilt in 1171, and was subsequently enlarged. In 1829
                    the choir was set on fire by Jonathan Martin, a maniac, who hid himself behind a
                    tomb after the evening service, and effected his purpose when all the vergers
                    had departed. He was apprehended, tried, found guilty, and sent for confinement
                    during life to the Criminal Lunatic Asylum, St George’s Fields, London, where he
                    died in 1838. The choir was repaired by subscription; and in May 1840, a fire
                    broke out in the south tower of the western front. The flames quickly spread,
                    and the fire continued all night, leaving that tower and the roof of the nave a
                    complete wreck, the very excellent peal of bells having also been destroyed. On
                    inquiry, it was discovered that a person from Leeds, who had been engaged to
                    repair the clock, had been careless with his candle, and that it had
                    communicated with a quantity of combustible matter on the floor, but that no
                    intention to do mischief had ever been entertained. A subscription was again
                    commenced, and the work of restoration is now rapidly advancing. We have already
                    stated that the minster was founded in 626. We may here observe, that Paulinus
                    was the first archbishop, having been instituted the previous year, and that
                    from that time to the present there have been no fewer than eighty-three
                    archbishops; the present being the Hon. Edward Vernon Harcourt, who was
                    translated to the see in 1808. The archbishop of York is primate and
                    metropolitan of England, and has the honour of crowning the queen, and of
                    preaching the sermon at the coronation of the king. There are twenty-three
                    churches in York, in addition to the cathedral; four Methodist chapels; three
                    Independent chapels; two Quakers’ meeting-houses; one Catholic chapel, and a
                    nunnery, with extensive premises occupied as a Catholic ladies’ school; a
                    Unitarian chapel; and a Primitive Methodist chapel.</p>
                <p>Among the charitable institutions of the city, we may mention the County Lunatic
                    Asylum; the Retreat, for the same purpose, established by the Society of
                    Friends; fourteen hospitals or alms-houses for poor widows, &amp;c.; the County
                    Hospital for the sick; the Eye Institution; the School for the Blind; the
                    Blue-Coat Boys’ and Grey-Coat Girls’ Schools, &amp;c. &amp;c. The other objects
                    of public interest are, the city-walls, the castle, the ruins of Clifford’s
                    Tower, the ruins of St Mary’s Abbey, the Yorkshire Museum and Gardens, the
                    Assembly Rooms, the public cemetery, &amp;c. York has also its railway stations,
                    very splendidly built, under the direction of George Hudson, Esq., the spirited
                    chairman of the York and North Midland Company. They are connected both with the
                    north, the west, and the south; and the city is altogether improving beyond what
                    has been known in former years. The population of York and its suburbs,
                    according to the census of 1831, amounted to 35,362, viz. 16,510 males, and
                    18,852 females; the population of the city, exclusively of the suburbs, was
                    26,260, viz. 11,989 males, and 14,271 females. According to the census of 1841,
                    the population of the city alone is nearly 30,000.</p>
