                <p>SECT. I. HISTORY OF THE SUBJECT.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> nature and properties of the agent on which vision
                    depends have been objects of philosophical disquisition from ancient times. The
                    earliest speculations which have reached us on this subject are those of
                    Pythagoras, who considered vision as produced by particles continually emanating
                    from the surfaces of bodies, and entering the pupil of the eye. The Platonists,
                    on the other hand, conceived that vision was the consequence of the emission of
                    something from the eye meeting with certain emanations from the surfaces of
                    things; yet, with this very gratuitous hypothesis, the Platonists appear to have
                    detected several properties of <hi rend="smallcaps">Light,</hi> especially its
                    propagation in right lines, and the equality of the angles of incidence and
                    reflection when it falls on bright and polished surfaces. The effects of the
                    concentration of the sun’s rays by concave specula were certainly known to the
                    ancients; and antiquaries have supposed, that, in this manner, the Romans
                    kindled their <hi rend="italic">sacred fire</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    thus also it has been alleged that Archimedes destroyed the Roman fleet at the
                    siege of Syracuse.</p>
                <p>Aristotle regarded light but as a mere quality of matter; he has some ingenious
                    speculations on the rainbow, and on other luminous meteors. Ptolemy the
                    geographer wrote a treatise on optics, which has perished; but, from some
                    fragments preserved by other authors, he appears to have had distinct ideas on
                    the subject of atmospherical refraction.</p>
                <p>A long interval of scientific darkness succeeded his era, until the Arabians
                    began to cultivate the learning of the Greeks, and several of their philosophers
                    treated of optics; but the earliest Arabian work which has reached our times, is
                    the celebrated treatise of Alhazen. In it we find a description of the eye, and
                    the uses of its different parts. The author details many experiments on
                    refraction, both as exhibited in the atmosphere, and as light is modified in
                    passing from one medium to another of different density. He also notices the
                    magnifying power of segments of spheres of glass; a hint from which it has been
                    supposed that the important invention of <hi rend="italic">spectacles</hi>
                    originated. We also owe to him the idea that single vision, with two eyes, is
                    produced by images painted on corresponding points in each retina; and that
                    stars may be seen by refraction, when they are actually below the horizon:
                    remarkable speculations for the twelfth century.</p>
                <p>The work of Alhazen was in 1270 commented on by Vitellio, a native of Poland, who
                    added a considerable number of observations on the refractive power of air,
                    water, and glass, which he reduced into a tabular form. He made some ingenious
                    attempts to explain the phenomena of refraction; and he seems to have conceived
                    the true idea of burning lenses.</p>
                <p>Roger Bacon, the contemporary of Vitellio, was undoubtedly acquainted with the
                    magnifying property of segments of spheres, and recommended that small segments
                    should be preferred for such purpose; adding, <hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">idea hoc</hi><hi rend="italic">instrumentum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >est</hi><hi rend="italic">utile</hi><hi rend="italic">senibus et habentibus
                    oculos debiles.</hi> This so plainly indicates the invention of spectacles, that
                    we cannot doubt that it had then been made. We know that they became common in
                    the thirteenth century, and are described by Spina of Pisa in 1313, although we
                    have no absolute certainty of their first constructor.</p>
                <p>After the revival of letters, one of the earliest cultivators of mathematics was
                    Maurolycus of Messina, who made optics his study. He proved that the crystalline
                    lens of the eyes of animals converges the rays of light which enter that organ,
                    and transmits them to the retina, in or near which the foci of the lenses are
                    situated. Hence also he inferred, that in persons who are <hi rend="italic"
                    >short sighted,</hi> the defect is owing to the too sudden convergence of the
                    pencil of rays before the retina; and that in those who are <hi rend="italic"
                    >long sighted,</hi> the foci are placed behind that expansion of the optic
                    nerve. Maurolycus, however, did not discover that the images of objects are
                    painted on the retina.</p>
                <p>Baptista Porta, the author of <hi rend="italic">Magia Naturalis,</hi> a
                    Neapolitan of rank, was much addicted to philosophic research; to him we owe the
                    first description of the camera obscura, and its application to the delineation
                    of objects. His work contains many observations on light, some of which are
                    accurate; and though some are now found to be erroneous, his remarks are always
                    ingenious. This subject also engaged the attention of Lord Bacon, who complained
                    that the/òzvnand <hi rend="italic">origin</hi> of light had been too much
                    neglected; but his labours in other branches of philosophy diverted his powerful
                    mind to different objects.</p>
                <p>The true theory of the rainbow was first given by Antonio, bishop of Spalatro,
                    although he could not satisfactorily explain the cause of the colours.</p>
                <p>The next optical discovery of importance was the <hi rend="italic"
                    >telescope,</hi> for which we are indebted to Zacchias Jansen, a spectacle-maker
                    of Middleburg, in Walcheren, in 1590; and this important invention was quickly
                    applied by Galileo to physical astronomy, with brilliant success, crowned by the
                    discovery of the satellites of Jupiter, the structure of the Via Lactea, the
                    phases of Venus, the ring of Saturn, the spots on the sun’s disk, and a
                    knowledge of numerous stars unknown to former observers.</p>
                <p>The study of light was improved under the auspices of Kepler, who gave an
                    explication of the effect of lenses on the rays, and suggested the form of the
                    telescope now called <hi rend="italic">astronomical.</hi> He treated of
                    refraction, and discovered, that when light falls within glass at an angle a
                    little above 42°, it is wholly reflected; but his theory of vision is much more
                    important; and he showed that images of external objects are painted on the
                    retina, and appear there inverted, a fact also ably illustrated by Schemer. The
                    invention of the compound microscope seems also due to Jansen, and dates from
                    the same period.</p>
                <p>Perspective was first scientifically treated by Pietro del Borgo, Baldassare
                    Perussi, and Guido Ubaldi. To the second of these is due the detection of the
                    <hi rend="italic">distance points,</hi> to which all lines making an angle of
                    45° with the <hi rend="italic">ground line</hi> are drawn; to the third, the
                    convergence of all parallel lines inclined to the ground line, in a point in the
                    <hi rend="italic">horizontal line</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and also that a
                    line drawn from the eye, parallel to them, will pass through this point. These
                    principles are the foundation of perspective, which afterwards received
                    improvements from ’ sG&gt;avesande, and were completed by Brooke Taylor. The
                    true law of refraction is undoubtedly due to Willebrod Snell, or Snellius,
                    professor of mathematics at Leyden. He experimentally showed that the co-secants
                    of the angles of incidence and refraction are always in the same ratio. This
                    discovery, we are assured, on the authority of Huygens, was appropriated by
                    Descartes, who had consulted the papers of Snell, but gave it as his own, under
                    a somewhat different form. The successive labours of Descartes, Kircher,
                    Grimaldi, De la Hire, Hooke, and Huygens, gave to the study of optics a profound
                    scientific character; and the interesting discoveries of that century were
                    crowned by the important researches of our immortal <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193205713" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5713-0330"/>Newton into the optical
                    properties of light. During the last century, our knowledge of this subject has
                    been steadily progressive, by the labours of a multitude of philosophers, so
                    numerous, that we can afford space for little more than to record the names of
                    some of the most successful inquirers into the mysteries of this subtile agent.
                    Among these, Mairan, Dufay, Mariotte, Boscovich, Euler, Mitchell, Melville,
                    Canton, Bennet, and Lagrange, stand conspicuous; nor must we omit the important
                    fact, illustrated by the labours of Bradley and Roemer, that the velocity of
                    light, from whatever source derived, whether from the sun, the fixed stars, the
                    planets or their satellites, is equal, or that its velocity before and after
                    reflection is the same: a formidable objection to the theory of emission. During
                    the present century, the progress of discovery in this field has been no less
                    brilliant. Very early in it, Dr Thomas Young illustrated the principle of <hi
                    rend="italic">the interference of the rays of light,</hi> founded on some facts
                    observed by Grimaldi, but first distinctly stated in Dr Young’s Memoir in the
                    Philosophical Transactions for 1803, entitled <hi rend="italic">Experiments and
                    Calculations Relative to Physical Optics</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and his
                    conclusions have been demonstrated beyond all doubt by the researches of Fresnel
                    and of Sir John Herschel. The splendid talents of Laplace, of Poisson, Biot,
                    Arago, Pouillet, Cauchy, Ampère, and Fresnel, among continental philosophers,
                    have especially illustrated the phenomena and theory of light: and in our own
                    country, Sir William Herschel, Young, Brewster, the younger Herschel, Airy,
                    Whewell, have pursued these delicate investigations with singular ability and
                    success. Above all, we must record, as among the most signal triumphs of modern
                    science, the detection and explanation of the <hi rend="italic">polarization of
                    light,</hi> and the singular confirmation thereby afforded of the theory of its
                    propagation by <hi rend="italic">undulations.</hi></p>
                <p>SECT. II. NATURE OF LIGHT.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding this long list of splendid discoveries, the nature of light is
                    still in some degree enigmatical. It is admitted, that the phenomena of vision
                    depend upon the agency of a subtile, extremely attenuated matter, set in motion
                    by the sun and other luminous bodies. Its materiality is inferred from its
                    deflection from its rectilinear course, in passing near various bodies; by its
                    being arrested by certain substances, though it passes freely through others; by
                    its reflection from polished surfaces; by its capability of condensation and
                    dispersion, in passing through certain media; by its producing chemical changes
                    in some compounds; and by its apparently entering into the composition of some
                    bodies, from which it may be again extricated.</p>
                <p>Thus far the majority of philosophers are agreed; but two opposite theories have
                    been advanced respecting its propagation, and the mode in which it manifests
                    itself to our senses.</p>
                <p>Some maintain that light is a peculiar matter, which is projected in all
                    directions from luminous bodies in a rapid succession of material particles.
                    This theory is sustained by the illustrious name of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Newton,</hi> and has been very generally received; but of late, certain
                    difficulties in the explanation of the recently-discovered properties of light,
                    especially its polarization, have tended to revive the doctrine maintained by
                    Descartes, Huygens, and Euler, viz. that all the phenomena of light depend on
                    the <hi rend="italic">undulations</hi> of a highly attenuated fluid or ether,
                    universally diffused throughout space, which, while at rest, is inappreciable by
                    our senses, but, when acted on by luminous bodies, is thrown into a succession
                    of waves. Luminous bodies are thus supposed to act on the universally diffused
                    fluid somewhat in the manner that sonorous bodies do on air in the production of
                    <hi rend="italic">sound.</hi></p>
                <p>It is true, that all the known facts regarding light may be explained upon either
                    hypothesis. It must be owned, however, that the remarkable coincidence of fact
                    with theory, and the facility of explanation, favour the theory of undulations,
                    while it scarcely can be said to involve any greater assumption than the
                    doctrine of direct transmission. Both assume the existence of a subtile fluid;
                    both admit the influence of luminous bodies; and it does not seem more difficult
                    to conceive them acting, by causing an undulation in <hi rend="italic">the
                    matter of light,</hi> than by projecting it in a rapid succession of particles,
                    the minuteness and velocity of which almost elude the grasp of our
                    imagination.</p>
                <p>Whichever hypothesis we adopt, the propagation of light is a process of
                    astonishing rapidity. Astronomers have found, from observations on the eclipses
                    of Jupiter’s satellites, that planetary light requires about fourteen minutes to
                    cross the earth’s orbit; or, if we adopt the more recent and probably more
                    accurate determination of Bradley, that the light of the sun requires about
                    eight minutes to reach our earth; and, if we reckon the mean distance of the sun
                    to be 94,879,956 English miles, it follows, whether we regard it as an emanation
                    or an undulation, that light must travel with a velocity of about 200,000 miles
                    per second.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to form any adequate idea of such enormous velocity; but we may
                    approximate it, by comparing this with the ascertained velocity of a cannon
                    ball. A twenty-four pounder, with the common charge of powder, according to
                    Robins, discharges its ball with an initial velocity equal to 1600 feet per
                    second; yet, if such a ball were to continue this velocity un diminished, it
                    would require about ten years to traverse a space which the light of the
                    heavenly bodies pervades in eight minutes.</p>
                <p>This prodigious rate, and the ease with which light can penetrate many solid
                    bodies, have been adduced as arguments against the doctrine of the successive
                    emanation of particles from luminous surfaces; but did not the undulatory theory
                    afford an easier solution of certain recently-discovered properties of light, we
                    should not regard such arguments as conclusive. Now, however, the undulatory
                    theory has been shown to correspond so exactly with known facts, and has even
                    enabled us to predict so exactly what experiment has since confirmed, that it
                    has received the sanction of the greatest names in modern science.</p>
                <p>SECT. Ill PROPERTIES OF LIGHT.</p>
                <p>Whichever hypothesis be adopted, light must be considered as a material
                    substance, possessed of certain properties, detected by observation and
                    experiment.</p>
                <p>1. Light is given out by luminous bodies in all directions, and from every point
                    of the luminous surface. This is proved by its being equally seen from every
                    point of observation.</p>
                <p>2. It is divisible into homogeneous, independent portions, like air or water; the
                    smallest portion we can separate is termed a <hi rend="italic">ray</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and several rays form a <hi rend="italic">pencil of
                    light.</hi></p>
                <p>3. Light appears to be absorbed by certain bodies, and is again given out by them
                    spontaneously. This property is well seen in the diamond, which, after being
                    exposed to the sun’s rays, continues for a short time to shine in the dark.
                    Various artificial <hi rend="italic">phosphori</hi> do the same, as the
                    Bolognian stone, calcined oyster shells, and the like.</p>
                <p>4. All solids give out light when heated between 700° and 800° of Fahrenheit’s
                    thermometer, and are then said to be <hi rend="italic">incandescent.</hi> All
                    liquids that can be heated to that point are luminous, as melted metals; and, if
                    the elasticity of their vapours be repressed, other liquids appear capable of
                    this emission. Gases do not, however, seem to be capable of incandescence, yet
                    the phenomena attending their sudden condensation, when they enter into chemical
                    union, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205726" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5726-0331"/>shows
                    that they contain light. Thus, when a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen is suddenly
                    and strongly compressed, the gases unite to form water, and both light and heat
                    are extricated.</p>
                <p>5. Some bodies have the property of arresting the progress of light, and are
                    termed <hi rend="italic">opake</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> others transmit it,
                    and are said to be <hi rend="italic">transparent.</hi> Yet probably no substance
                    is either perfectly opake or perfectly transparent. Thus, gold is one of the
                    most condensed and opake bodies in nature; yet if we enclose gold leaf between
                    two plates of glass, and examine it by transmitted light, it appears of a
                    decidedly greenish hue; showing the transmission of some light through the
                    metal. On the other hand, the most transparent glass, when viewed in a thick
                    plate, and the most limpid water, when in a deep column, appear greenish.</p>
                <p>6. When the rays of light fall obliquely on the surface of •all bodies, whether
                    transparent or opake, solid or fluid, they are more or less reflected. Smooth
                    and shining surfaces reflect most light, but the degree also depends on the
                    nature of the reflecting substance: the reflected rays are returned from the
                    surface at an angle equal to the angle of incidence: if the reflecting surface
                    be a plane, the parallel rays that fall on it are reflected parallel to each
                    other.</p>
                <p>When the rays are reflected from a concave surface, the reflected rays are more
                    inclined to each other than the incident rays; and if that concave surface be
                    the segment of a sphere, the parallel incident rays will converge to a point in
                    the axis of the mirror half way between its surface and the centre of the sphere
                    of which it is a segment; and this point is termed its <hi rend="italic"
                    >principal focus,</hi> or focus of the parallel rays: if the incident rays be
                    <hi rend="italic">converging,</hi> they will meet the axis between the principal
                    focus and that centre; if the incident rays be diverging, they will meet the
                    axis in a point between the principal focus and the surface of the mirror. From
                    the immense distance of the sun, all the incident rays may be considered as
                    parallel; and therefore his rays will be condensed into the principal focus of
                    such a mirror, which will in this instance also be that of greatest heat. This
                    is the principle of burning mirrors. When the incident rays fall on a convex
                    mirror, they are all reflected more divergingly, or are dispersed.</p>
                <p>The properties of reflected light form the object of the science of <hi
                    rend="italic">Catoptrics.</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics.</hi></p>
                <p>We are not, however, to imagine that all the light incident on bright surfaces is
                    reflected. Many curious experiments were made on this subject by Bouguer. The
                    quantity of light returned differs with the inclination of the rays to the
                    reflecting surface. It is generally strongest at small angles of incidence; and
                    the difference becomes excessive when the rays impinge on the surface of
                    transparent fluids with different degrees of obliquity. Metals, from their
                    opacity and splendour, form the best reflecting surfaces; but even pure mercury,
                    perhaps the most perfect of reflectors, does not reflect more than three fourths
                    of the whole incident light.</p>
                <p>7. When the rays of light fall on transparent bodies, they* are differently
                    affected, according to the angle of incidence. When a ray passes from one
                    transparent medium to another, in a direction perpendicular to their touching
                    surfaces, that ray will pass through them in a straight line; but when the ray
                    passes in a direction oblique to their touching surfaces, that ray will be bent,
                    or will form an angle at their junction.</p>
                <p>When the density of a medium is uniform, the rays of light traverse it in
                    straight lines; but in a medium varying in density, like columns of liquids, or
                    the atmosphere, in which density increases with the superincumbent pressure, the
                    passage of the rays will form curves.</p>
                <p>When a ray passes obliquely from a dense to a rarer medium, it is bent or
                    deflected <hi rend="italic">from</hi> a line perpendicular to their touching
                    surfaces. When passing obliquely from a rare to a denser medium, they are bent
                    <hi rend="italic">toward</hi> the perpendicular. In such instances the light is
                    said to be <hi rend="italic">refracted.</hi> In the first instance, the angle of
                    refraction is always greater than the angle of incidence; in the latter it is
                    always less. The study of the properties of refracted light constitutes the
                    science of <hi rend="italic">Dioptrics.</hi> (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Optics).</hi></p>
                <p>8. The refractive power of different media is unequal; and when the rays of light
                    pass from one medium to another, it may be measured by the ratio between the <hi
                    rend="italic">sines of the angles of incidence and refraction</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and the number expressing the ratio between the first and
                    the last is the <hi rend="italic">exponent</hi> or <hi rend="italic">index</hi>
                    of the refractive power of that substance.</p>
                <p>The refractive power of different substances appears to be nearly in the ratio of
                    their density; but with inflammable bodies, or those containing an inflammable
                    principle, the refractive power is in a ratio greater than their density. It was
                    this law which led Newton to his happy conjecture that <hi rend="italic"
                    >water</hi> and the diamond might contain an inflammable principle; speculations
                    which have been verified by modern chemistry. The same opinion as regards the
                    diamond was long before maintained by Boetius de Boodt. He says that, unctuous
                    and fiery bodies are easily united, but will not mix with watery substances; and
                    because the diamond readily adheres to resins, which are of <hi rend="italic">a.
                    fiery</hi> nature, and because, like amber, another fiery body, the diamond,
                    when rubbed, attracts light bodies, the diamond itself must be of an inflammable
                    or sulphureous nature: an argument which he considers as confirmed by that gem
                    being “produced in a hot, sulphureous climate.” It is obvious that the deduction
                    of Newton differs widely in its principles from the hypothesis of De Boodt; but
                    the latter must be regarded as a curious instance of a true conclusion derived
                    from unsound premises.</p>
                <p>9. If a pencil of light be admitted by a small hole in the window-shutter of a
                    darkened room, through a triangular prism of any transparent substance, the
                    white light will be found to undergo a remarkable change. The rays will be
                    separated in the prism, their image will be enlarged; and, if received on a
                    white screen, will be seen variously coloured. The colours will assume a certain
                    determinate order of juxtaposition; and this appearance is termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">prismatic spectrum.</hi> This coloured spectrum will then be seen
                    divided into colours, of which Newton enumerates seven; red, orange, yellow,
                    green, blue, indigo, violet. These, it is evident, may be resolved into red,
                    yellow, and blue; for the boundaries of the colours are not well defined, and
                    the compound colours which lie between these may be considered as made up of the
                    intermixture of contiguous rays. These rays are not in equal proportions in the
                    spectrum. If we consider it. divided into 360°, the red occupies 45°, the orange
                    27°, the yellow 48°, the green 60°, the blue 60°, the indigo 40°, the violet
                    80°; and it is worthy of remark, that this division of the scale of colour is a
                    striking approximation to the divisions of a chord that would give the musical
                    intervals of the octave. But as these colours are not bounded by defined lines,
                    but graduate into each other, it is very difficult to determine their relative
                    extent with tolerable precision. The cause of their separation is the difference
                    of their refrangibility by the prism; the red being the least, the violet the
                    most refrangible; that is, turned from the line of the incident pencil of light.
                    The green ray will be found in the centre of the prismatic spectrum; and hence
                    its index of refraction is considered as the mean refraction of the substance of
                    which the prism consists. Newton employed in his experiments prisms of different
                    substances; but he seems to have taken it for granted, that when the mean
                    refraction was the same, the length of the spectrum was also equal, or that the
                    <hi rend="italic">dispersive power</hi> of the bodies in that case was equal. He
                    considered that prisms and lenses of all kinds of glass, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193205739" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5739-0332"/>and of all bodies, whether
                    solid or fluid, with the same <hi rend="italic">mean refraction,</hi> possessed
                    also the same <hi rend="italic">dispersive power,</hi> or formed spectra
                    proportional to their mean refraction. Hence he was led to conclude that “the
                    improvement of the refracting telescope was desperate.” This error has, since
                    his day, been detected; and this principle forms the basis of Dollond’s
                    admirable invention of the <hi rend="italic">achromatic telescope,</hi> in which
                    the error of refraction in one species of glass is ingeniously remedied by a
                    correction derived from the different dispersive power of another kind of glass,
                    so adapted to the first as to form with it one object-glass. The difference in
                    dispersive power has now been ascertained in a considerable number of diaphanous
                    bodies; and tables of this difference have been formed from the observations of
                    many philosophers, particularly of Sir David Brewster.</p>
                <p>The illuminating power of the different rays of the spectrum is different. Sir
                    William Herschel found, that with a prism of flint-glass, the greatest
                    illumination is towards the middle of the spectrum; the yellow rays affording
                    most light, while the illuminating power, diminishing towards each end of the
                    spectrum, is least in the violet ray. A series of experiments on this subject by
                    Frauenhofer, a late celebrated instrument-maker of Munich, showed, that with the
                    best made prisms, when ether light is carefully excluded, the most luminous
                    point is nearer the red than the Holet end of the spectrum, in the proportion of
                    one to four; and he states the mean refrangibility to be between the blue and
                    indigo rays. But one of the most curious discoveries of this ingenious inquirer
                    is, that the solar spectrum is traversed by numerous dark lines of unequal
                    thickness, perpendicular to the length of the spectrum, and parallel to one
                    another. These lines require a fine, prism for their exhibition, a microscope
                    for their detection, and the exclusion of light, except that of the coloured ray
                    under examination. He counted 590 of these lines in the spectrum; the greatest
                    number of them being towards the most refrangible end of the spectrum.</p>
                <p>It is well known that the rays of the sun communicate heat as well as light; but
                    the heating power of the coloured rays is very different. Herschel discovered
                    that the red ray raises the thermometer most; and that the effect diminishes as
                    we approach the other end of the solar spectrum. This is sufficiently striking;
                    but in pursuing his investigations he made another singular discovery, that the
                    point of greatest heat is fully half an inch beyond the red end of the prismatic
                    spectrum. Delicate thermometers were placed in the different rays, and gave the
                    following results :—</p>

                <p>Ihese curious experiments were confirmed by Sir Henry Englefield and Sir H. Davy.
                    The inference from them is, that light and heat are unequally refracted.</p>
                <p>The prisms used by these philosophers appear to have been of flint-glass; but Dr
                    Seebeck has since found that the position of the point of greatest heat varies
                    with the nature of the refracting prism. Seebeck found, as Herschel did, that
                    with flint-glass the greatest heat was beyond the red; with plate-glass, in the
                    middle of the red; with sulphuric acid in a hollow thin glass prism, in the
                    orange; with water, in the yellow. The sun’s rays would appear to be still more
                    complex. Early in this century, Ritter of Jena found that the rays of the solar
                    spectrum possessed different chemical powers. He found that the salts of silver
                    became soonest black a little beyond the violet end of the spectrum, a little
                    less so in the violet, and still less so in the blue; and Seebeck, in repeating
                    the experiments, found that beyond the violet ray muriate of silver became
                    reddish brown; in the blue, bluish gray; and in the yellow it retained its white
                    colour, or at most had a yellowish tint; it became reddish in the red ray, and
                    even when placed beyond it. These changes might have been attributed to the
                    influence of heating or illuminating power, had not the greatest deoxidating
                    effect been observed where the heat and illumination are the least. Dr
                    Wollaston, who observed these facts about the same time with Ritter, considers
                    the sunbeams as compounded of calorific and deoxidating as well as luminous
                    rays, all with different degrees of refrangibility. But if the experiments of
                    Morichini are confirmed, the sunbeams have also the property of magnetizing
                    steel. About twenty-five years ago he announced this discovery; it was repeated
                    by several persons without success, but Mrs Somervile appears to have succeeded.
                    She covered one half of small sewing needles with paper, in Morichini’s method,
                    and expused the naked half to the violet rays for two hours, when she found that
                    the <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> needle had thus acquired a north pole. The
                    indigo ray produced nearly the same effect, but the effect was feeble in the
                    blue and the green; while, though exposed in the orange, yellow, and red, for
                    two successive days, no magnetism was induced. Similar effects followed when one
                    half of the needle was enveloped in white paper, and the other half, exposed to
                    the rays, was covered with blue or green glass, or with silk of those
                    colours.</p>
                <p>10. The facts already noticed respecting the bendingof the rays toward the
                    perpendicular, when they pass from a rare to a denser medium, lead to the
                    inference that the disposition of the surfaces of the refracting medium must
                    materially influence the direction of the rays of light which enter and pass
                    through. Accordingly, it is found that if one or both surfaces be convex, the
                    rays are bent toward the axis of the medium. If the medium be spherical, or a
                    segment of a sphere, the ray, falling perpendicularly on its centre, will pass
                    straight through; but all those that fall obliquely on the spherical surface
                    will emerge from the medium in a direction inclined <hi rend="italic">to</hi>
                    the central ray (which may be considered as the <hi rend="italic">axis</hi> of
                    the medium), and will cut this axis in some point, which is termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">refracted focus</hi> of those rays. When the medium has its
                    sunaces forming segments of spheres, it is called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >lens</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and lenses are divided into convex and
                    concave, plano-convex and plano-concave, double convex and double concave,
                    according to the form of their surfaces.</p>
                <p>When a lens is nearly or really spherical, optical principles will show, that all
                    the emergent rays will not meet in the same point; those farthest from the axis
                    will meet first. But if the lens be a thin segment of a sphere, with one or both
                    of its surfaces convex, this error will not be very conspicuous, and the
                    emergent rays will meet nearly in one <hi rend="italic">focus.</hi></p>
                <p>When both surfaces of a lens are <hi rend="italic">concave,</hi> or when one is
                    concave and the other plane, the emergent rays will be bentj⅛w the axis. The
                    mathematical demonstration of these facts, their application to practical
                    purposes, and to the explanation of natural appearances, belong to <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Optics</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">;</hi> to which article
                    attention is directed.</p>
                <p>11. Some crystallized boches have the property of dividing the rays of light
                    which permeate them into two distinct portions, one of which passes in the
                    ordinary direction, while the other pencil undergoes an extraordinary
                    refraction, passing at some distance from the other. Hence, when any body is
                    viewed through such a crystal in a certain direction, both sets of rays become
                    apparent by giving a double image of the object. This curious property was first
                    detected by Erasmus Bartholin, in calcareous spar brought from Iceland. But this
                    subject was fiι⅛t philosophically investigated with his usual sagacity by
                    Huygens, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205752" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5752-0333"/>who
                    proved that the property of double refraction was not confined to calcareous
                    spar; and it has, since his time, been shown, that all crystals, the primitive
                    form of which is neither a cube nor a regular octahedron, possess this property.
                    Newton attempted to explain this double refraction; but his explanation was not
                    happy. He ascribed it to an original difference in the rays of light, by which
                    some are refracted in the usual manner, while others undergo unusual refraction.
                    Huygens discovered, that when the ray of light was received through the Iceland
                    crystal in any direction but one, it was always divided into two rays of equal
                    intensity; but he remarked with surprise, that when he received the divided rays
                    through a second crystal of Iceland spar, the two portions into which each of
                    them was now subdivided were no longer equally intense; that their relative
                    brightness depended on the position of the second rhomb with regard to the
                    first; and that there were two positions of the second, in which one of the rays
                    vanished altogether. This Newton supposed to depend on the rays having different
                    sides, possessed of different properties, each of which “answers to or
                    sympathizes with that virtue or disposition of the crystal, as the poles of two
                    magnets answer to one another.”</p>
                <p>This idea was followed up by Malus. He conceived that the molecules of this <hi
                    rend="italic">polarized light</hi> have all their homologous sides in the same
                    direction; and he expressed this modification of light by the term <hi
                    rend="italic">polarization,</hi> as he compared the effect produced to the
                    influence of a magnet, which directs the poles of a series of needles all to the
                    same side—an hypothesis which Biot modified by supposing that each molecule of
                    light had one <hi rend="italic">axis,</hi> similarly placed in each, and all
                    turned in one direction, in a polarized ray; while the molecules were conceived
                    to have a free motion round such axes, by which they could assume different
                    positions according to the attractions and repulsions they experience at the
                    surface of each new medium they traverse. The term <hi rend="italic"
                    >polarization</hi> is not certainly very happy, and it is to be regretted that
                    one more appropriate and less hypothetical had not been employed.</p>
                <p>If the rays, thus divided into two pencils by calc spar, be received by a rhomb
                    of the same substance, while the axes of both crystals are in the same
                    direction, no new division of the rays takes place; but if, while the first
                    crystal remains at rest, the second be turned round, by the time it has made one
                    eighth of a revolution the rays will be again subdivided, and four images will
                    be produced. By continuing the motion until the crystal has described one fourth
                    of a revolution, the subdivision will again disappear.</p>
                <p>Malus discovered that an analogous effect was produced by <hi rend="italic"
                    >reflection.</hi> If a pencil of rays fall on a polished surface of glass at an
                    angle of 35° 25', it is reflected at any angle equal to the angle of incidence.
                    If we now place another plate of glass in such a position that the rays
                    reflected from the first shall fall on the second also at an angle of 35° 25',
                    or when the plane of both reflections coincide, the rays will also be reflected
                    from the second plate: but if the second plate be turned round one quarter of a
                    revolution, so as to make the plane of the second reflection perpendicular to
                    the plane of the first, the whole of the rays will now be transmitted through
                    the second plate: when this plate has described half a revolution, the rays will
                    be reflected as at first; and when it has made three quarters of a revolution,
                    they will again be transmitted, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> when the planes of
                    reflection are parallel, light is reflected, but when they are perpendicular, it
                    is transmitted—or light in such circumstances can permeate glass in one
                    direction, but not in another. Sir David Brewster, soon after Malus, began a
                    vast series of experiments to determine the angles of polarization of different
                    media, and to investigate the general law which regulates polarization by
                    reflection from transparent bodies, which was crowned with the beautiful
                    discovery that “<hi rend="italic">the tangent of the angle of polarization is
                    equal to the refractive index,”</hi> or that when a ray is entirely polarized by
                    reflection, “<hi rend="italic">the angles of incidence and refraction arc
                    complimentary</hi><hi rend="italic">”</hi> In this sketch it would be impossible
                    to do justice to the investigations and beautiful theoretic deductions of
                    Fresnel, which have combined the whole into an inductive science. We must direct
                    the reader to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Polarization</hi> for his
                    important labours, as well as for the profound researches of Airy, Poisson,
                    Biot, Arago, and Cauchy.</p>
                <p>Newton rejected the explanation of double refraction offered by Huygens, because
                    he considered the apparent polarization of the rays of light inconsistent with
                    motions “propagated through a fluid medium ;” but this arose from his limiting
                    his ideas of luminous vibrations, as entirely analogous to those of producing
                    sound in air, in which they are propagated in the direction of the advance of
                    the undulations. We owe to the late Dr Thomas Young the first idea of the
                    vibrations being <hi rend="italic">transverse</hi> to the direction of the
                    luminous wave; an hypothesis which he illustrated by the propagation of the
                    vibrations of a stretched cord put in motion at one of its ends. This happy idea
                    has been shown to be a necessary consequence of the phenomena of the
                    interference of polarized light, if we admit the theory of luminous waves. The
                    subsequent investigations of Arago and of Fresnel have confirmed the
                    speculations of the English philosopher, which have connected and elucidated
                    those brilliant discoveries that have conferred lustre on the names of Malus,
                    Fresnel, and Brewster. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics</hi> and <hi

                <p>, SECT. IV.— <hi rend="smallcaps">colour of objects.</hi></p>
                <p>The discovery by Newton of the colours produced by the decomposition of the sun’s
                    rays, naturally turned the attention of that profound philosopher to the cause
                    of colour in different objects; and he has delivered a theory of colours, of
                    which we shall now exhibit an outline.</p>
                <p>1. Newton regards the colour of natural objects, not as produced by any
                    modification which light undergoes from refraction or reflection at their
                    surfaces, but as something inherent in the rays according to their different
                    degrees of refrangibility. The same degree of refrangibility invariably gives
                    the same colour; and when the rays are fully separated from each other by the
                    prism, he found it impossible to change the colour. Thus he refracted the red
                    ray with prisms, but found its tint unaltered; he reflected it from bodies which
                    in day light had other colours, but still it remained <hi rend="italic"
                    >red</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> he transmitted it through coloured media of
                    different tints, he passed it through the coloured rings produced by pressing
                    together plates of glass, but he was unable to convert it into another colour.
                    By condensation or dispersion he could render it stronger or fainter, but still
                    it remained red. Similar experiments on the other rays were attended with
                    similar results.</p>
                <p>2. He found, however, that by mingling the different rays of the coloured
                    spectrum, he could produce <hi rend="italic">a</hi> sort of intermediate tint:
                    thus the intermixture of the yellow and red rays formed an orange, and that of
                    the yellow and blue, a green. But this effect was only distinctly produced by
                    the intermixture of contiguous rays; if they were far removed from each other in
                    the spectrum, no such effect was produced: thus the orange and indigo rays do
                    not produce an intermediate green.</p>
                <p>3. The intermixture of all the rays reproduced white light. Newton reflected a
                    pencil of rays through a prism into a dark room, and then interposing a lens of
                    three íëet radius, about four or five feet distance from the aperture admitting
                    the light, he collected the convergent rays upon a paper screen, and obtained an
                    intense spot of white light. By <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205765"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-5765-0334"/>moving the paper he could easily find the point of
                    perfect whiteness; and, by drawing it farther from the lens, he could reproduce
                    the coloured spectrum in an inverted order, as the crossing rays diverged
                    farther from each other.</p>
                <p>If any of the coloured rays were cut off before their convergence by the lens,
                    the image on the paper exhibited colour; and if either of them were made to
                    predominate, that tint was rendered perceptible. Newton endeavoured to show the
                    same with mixtures of coloured powders; and though this method presents
                    mechanical difficulties not easily overcome, and the mixtures only afford a gray
                    shade, yet when these were strongly illuminated by concentrated solar light,
                    they became of a dazzling white: and all coloured objects appeared most splendid
                    in the prismatic rays of their own colour. From these facts he considered the
                    colour of objects to depend on the predominance of the coloured rays they
                    reflect. Thus minium, or red lead, appears red, because it reflects principally
                    the least refrangible rays; a violet appears of the colour so denominated,
                    because it chiefly reflects the most refrangible rays; and what we denominate
                    the colour of an object is merely the hue of the rays which it most copiously
                    returns to the eye.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, transparent bodies which have colour, when held between the
                    eye and the light, appear soby transmitting most copiously that ray. Thus, too,
                    we see why a body not quite transparent may sometimes appear of different
                    colours by transmitted and reflected light. Such a body may transmit most
                    copiously the blue rays, and reflect the green ones; as we often find in
                    coloured liquids, and sometimes observe in the crystals of fluor spar, and other
                    mineral substances. This fact is a confirmation of the Newtonian theory of
                    colour; for, were the <hi rend="italic">colour</hi> inherent in the substance
                    itself, it ought to appear equally by either mode of viewing it.</p>
                <p>In transparent coloured liquids the shade often varies with the thickness of the
                    column through which the light is transmitted. Thus a clear red liquid in a
                    conical wine glass appears below of a pale yellowish hue; higher up it seems
                    orange, and only has its full red hue when the column is of considerable
                    thickness. This is owing to the most refrangible rays never being able to
                    penetrate the liquid at all. The remaining part of these rays gives the
                    yellowish colour to the thin film at the bottom of the glass; the separation of
                    part of the yellow rays gives an orange tint to the next film of liquid; and,
                    when the yellow rays are wholly stopped by the thicker column, the red, or least
                    refrangible, come undilâted to the eye of the observer, and give their colour to
                    the body of the liquid in the glass.</p>
                <p>SECT. V. RELATION OF LIGHT AND HEAT.</p>
                <p>It is well known that light and heat are intimately mixed in the beams of the
                    sun—that some bodies give out both light and heat during combustion—and that a
                    high temperature causes the extrication of light in all bodies, the gases
                    excepted. This intimate relation between light and heat has induced some
                    philosophers to consider them as mere modifications of each other. Certain it is
                    that they have many properties in common. They are capable of reflection, of
                    refraction, of concentration, of dispersion, and of polarization—they radiate
                    between distant objects with great celerity, they penetrate solid bodies very
                    readily, they are absorbed by dark and rough surfaces, are generally reflected
                    by smooth surfaces, and they are capable of subverting some chemical
                    combinations.</p>
                <p>These properties show very striking analogies; and the phenomena of the
                    polarization of heat, so well illustrated by Professor Forbes of Edinburgh, have
                    undoubtedly rendered this analogy still more apparent: yet in the present state
                    of our knowledge, it would be rash to pronounce their absolute identity. Their
                    total separation, at least as far as our means of detection extend, in some
                    instances,—the very different substances which permit or retard their progress,—
                    the different manner in which they affect our sensations,— have led some
                    inquirers to the opposite conclusion; and though it may still be true that they
                    are modifications of the same kind of matter, it is safest to content ourselves
                    with pointing out those circumstances in which they differ, as well as their
                    general agreements.</p>
                <p>1. Light and caloric are not intercepted by the same substances. If we interpose
                    a plate of thin transparent glass between the face and a bright blazing fire,
                    the intensity of the light has no apparent diminution, but the calorific rays
                    seem immediately arrested; and if we make the experiment with a thin diaphanous
                    plate of ice, they seem absolutely intercepted. Some recent experiments of
                    Professor Forbes, with thin plates of ice, afforded an almost microscopic effect
                    on the galvanometer of Melloni’s apparatus; but supposing there was no minute
                    hole in the ice, the difference of the transmission of light and heat through
                    diaphanous ice is sufficiently striking. The same takes place with all other
                    species of terrestrial light, though, as we shall presently see, the calorific
                    rays of the sun instantaneously pervade ice.</p>
                <p>2. The rays of caloric are more powerfully reflected from a metallic mirror, even
                    of an imperfect shape, than from the best glass mirror; whereas the latter very
                    powerfully reflects light. Dark and dense solids are very readily penetrated by
                    caloric, though they are totally impervious to light.</p>
                <p>3. Light affects the organs of vision in a peculiar manner, without producing
                    inconvenience to that most delicate organ, the eye; but a radiation of heat
                    without light, as from a vessel of boiling fluid, though the rays entering the
                    eye may be so powerful as painfully to affect the eye, does not produce any
                    thing analogous to vision.</p>
                <p>In the sun’s rays, however, heat and light are so intimately 'blended, that we
                    cannot entirely separate them. The difference in their refractive power causes a
                    partial separation in the coloured spectrum; but both the heat and light of the
                    sun’s rays seem to pervade glass or ice with equal facility. Leslie’s
                    photometer, placed behind a sheet of diaphanous ice, is immediately affected by
                    the direct rays of the sun, and a lens of transparent ice will concentrate them,
                    so as to fire combustibles; as was long ago observed by Jan Metius and
                    Descartes, and has more recently been proved by Scoresby. This difference
                    between the calorific influence of the sun and of artificial fires has been
                    attributed to the different initial velocity imparted to the calorific
                    emanations in both cases. This is not improbable; but some have considered the
                    calorific influence of the sun’s rays as an effect of the condensation or
                    fixation of light. This was the idea of the late celebrated Leslie, and is the
                    principle of his elegant <hi rend="italic">photometer.</hi></p>
                <p>SECT. VI. MEASURES OF LIGHT.</p>
                <p>Various methods have been proposed for affording comparative measures of light.
                    The principles of these depend either on the illumination, as ascertained by the
                    distance at which we can distinctly perceive small objects, such as printed
                    letters of a certain size; the comparative depths of the shadows of an opake
                    object; or the heat excited by the luminous emanations of the bodies
                    compared.</p>
                <p>1. The distance at which the same eye can read a particular printed paper forms
                    certainly a good criterion of the comparative degree of light given out by two
                    or more luminous bodies, at the moment of comparison; but as it must greatly
                    vary with the goodness of eye, it obviously cannot afford the basis of a general
                    scale of illumination, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205778"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-5778-0335"/>by which the same individual can compare his
                    observations at distant periods, or render the experiments of one person
                    comparable with those of another. Still it is a convenient method, and requires
                    but a very simple apparatus; a tube to admit the light in an uniform manner to
                    the paper, and a graduated sliding rule to ascertain with ease the distance of
                    the paper from the eye.</p>
                <p>2. The comparison of shadows, which appears first to have been employed by
                    Bouguer among several other ingenious contrivances, was the mode recommended by
                    Count Rumford, who, in 1794, read a paper on this subject to the Royal Society
                    of London. It is reprinted in a volume of his Philosophical Papers, published in
                    1802. This instrument, though well suited to the object in view, is cumbrous,
                    and somewhat complicated. The photometric part <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is a box
                    eight inches wide; its back a plate of glass, covered by tissue paper, on which
                    the shadows are projected. It is supported at a convenient height by a
                    tripodstand. The table consists of two narrow arms <hi rend="italic">c d,</hi>
                    resting on <hi rend="italic">b</hi> at one end, and kept horizontal by feet at
                    the other, intended to support the moveable brackets <hi rend="italic">e e,</hi>
                    on which are placed the lights to be compared. The arms are divided into
                    decimals of an inch; and are here represented on a smaller scale than the rest
                    of the instrument.</p>
                <p>Similar results may be obtained by the following contrivance, proposed, we
                    believe, by Dr W. Ritchie. It consists of a rectangular box of brass, <hi
                    rend="italic">α, b, c, el,</hi> three inches long, and 2∙2 inches wide. In its
                    centre are two plane glass mirrors, <hi rend="italic">g g,</hi> two inches
                    square, cut from the same plate, and placed accurately at angles of 45° to the
                    base of the box, as in the diagram. Each end <hi rend="italic">e f</hi> of the
                    box is open, and has, at equal distances from the mirrors, two . cylindrical
                    wires of brass, <hi rend="italic">h, h,</hi> 0∙2 inch in diameter, fixed
                    vertically in the centre of the box. The top of the box consists of two thin
                    plates of glass, <hi rend="italic">i i,</hi> on which is pasted tissue paper.
                    The inside of the box and the wires are blackened. When the two lights to be
                    compared are placed before the ends of the box, and in its axis, the shadows of
                    the wires will be reflected from the inclined mirrors on the tissue paper. The
                    adjustments of the lights to the machine may be conveniently made by sliding
                    brackets, placed on a long and steady table. If one of the lights be fixed, the
                    other is to be moved backwards or forwards, in the line of the axis of the
                    machine, until both shadows of the wires shall be of equal intensity. Thus, as
                    the intensity of the light, in such cases, is inversely as the square of the
                    distance of the luminous body, the difference between the position of each
                    light, ascertained either by a graduated fillet on the table, or by a common
                    Gunter’s scale, will afford a numerical value of the comparative intensity of
                    each light. The method appears sufficiently accurate for such experiments, but,
                    like the former mode, is not susceptible of a fixed scale, unless we could find
                    some uniform unvarying light to be considered as a standard.</p>
                <p>3. The calorific influence of luminous matter was proposed as the measure of the
                    light by Lambert, and was adopted by Sir John Leslie as the principle on which
                    he constructed his photometer. It is the author’s differential thermometer, with
                    one of its balls made of black enamel, while the other is of clear glass. An
                    instrument so prepared, when exposed to a heating cause, has its balls unequally
                    heated. To prevent the influence of currents of air, the whole is covered with
                    an air-tight case of transparent glass. The <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, black
                    ball absorbs the calorific rays which impinge on it, the air within it expands,
                    and raises <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205791" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5791-0336"/>the
                    coloured liquor in the opposite stem of the instrument, to which a scale of
                    equal parts being attached, each equivalent to ⅛th of a degree of the centigrade
                    thermometer, affords a numerical result; and if we were sure that the intensity
                    of the light is always in proportion to the calorific effect, the instrument
                    would be a perfect photometer. But, unfortunately, we now know that this is not
                    the fact, especially when we compare different kinds of light by means of this
                    instrument. Thus the influence of a fire, so dull that it is impossible to
                    distinguish a letter of a printed page, will affect this photometer at the
                    distance of several feet, more than the diffused light of day sufficient to
                    enable one to read the same book with facility; and it is more affected by
                    radiation from a piece of iron scarcely incandescent in the dark, than by the
                    intense light of phosphorus burning in oxygen gas. Even with the light of the
                    sun refracted by the prism, the photometer does not indicate the point of the
                    maximum of light. The greatest illumination is in the yellow rays; but this
                    photometer rises highest when in or just beyond the confines of the red.</p>
                <p>But if we employ the instrument for the purpose chiefly in the view of its
                    ingenious inventor, the measure of the intensity of solar light, this beautiful
                    instrument appears to us the most elegant and useful photometer hitherto
                    proposed. Its delicacy is such, that when freely exposed, in our climate, to the
                    light of the sky, without being acted on by the direct solar rays, it generally
                    ranges in summer from 30° to 40°, and in winter from 10° to 15°. Exposed freely
                    to the sun-beams at noon in summer, it usually mounts to between 80° and 90°;
                    and in the depth of winter is generally about 25°. In the glowing language of
                    its inventor, “the photometer exhibits distinctly the progress of illumination
                    from the morning’s dawn to the full vigour of noon, till evening spreads her
                    sober mantle. It marks the growth of light, from the winter solstice to the
                    height of summer, and its subsequent decay through the dusky shades of autumn;
                    and it enables us to compare, with numerical accuracy, the brightness of distant
                    countries—the brilliant sky of Italy, for instance, with the murky air of
                    Holland.”</p>
                <p>SECT. VII.—EVOLUTION OF LIGHT WITHOUT APPRECIABLE ' HEAT.</p>
                <p>The most familiar instance of this phenomenon is in the rays of the moon,
                    planets, and fixed stars, in the beams of which the most delicate instruments,
                    even the thermo-magnetic combinations of Melloni, have been unable to detect any
                    calorific effect. In the beams of the moon and planets, the greatest portion of
                    the incident light would probably be absorbed by the dark nucleus of those
                    celestial bodies; and if any heating rays were emanated from them towards us,
                    they probably are far too attenuated to produce sensible effects at our planet.
                    The light of the fixed stars, though probably like that of the sun, radiates
                    through too enormous a distance to become sensible to any instrument for
                    measuring heat hitherto contrived. The luminous meteors, too, that belong to our
                    atmosphere, have in general no sensible heat; if we except meteoric stones and
                    condensed electricity or lightning, which has occasionally fired combustibles.
                    We must not confound the effect of the aurora borealis on the magnetic needle
                    with heat; it appears to be altogether magnetic, not calorific. We find, also,
                    that certain terrestrial bodies have the power of emitting light, in some
                    instances largely, without a corresponding degree of heat; and such are usually
                    termed <hi rend="italic">phosphorescent.</hi> Some of these have the property of
                    absorbing light when exposed to it, and again visibly emitting it. Some become
                    phosphorescent when slightly heated; others give out light during their
                    spontaneous decomposition. Phosphorescence has been examined by Bartholini,
                    Fabricius ab Aquapendente, Bayle, Algarotti, Reaumur, Father Beccari, Father
                    Bourges, Abbé Haller, Seroi, and Canton.</p>
                <p>1. Many bodies, when exposed to light, particularly that of the sun, absorb it,
                    and emit it immediately on being removed into a dark place. When a diamond of
                    some size is thus exposed, it has been observed to give out flashes of light in
                    the dark for a short period, and it recovers this property on a fresh exposure.
                    Several other precious stones, some calcareous minerals, almost all animal and
                    vegetable substances, when very dry, or after solution in ni∙ trous acid,
                    and∙even snow, are stated by Beccari to possess the same property in a greater
                    or less degree. Several artificial compounds, when carefully calcined, have the
                    same effect. This is particularly the case with the <hi rend="italic">Bolognian
                    stone,</hi> and with Canton’s phosphorus. The former is a calcined sulphate of
                    baryta, found at the foot of Monte Paterno, near Bologna. Its properties were
                    first discovered by Vincenzo Cascariolo, a shoemaker of that city, who, from its
                    weight, mistaking it for a metal, attempted its reduction. The inventor kept the
                    process secret, but it seems to have at length transpired: according to Kircher,
                    the stone was reduced to a fine powder, beaten up with whites of eggs or linseed
                    oil, and formed into a paste, which was repeatedly baked in a furnace. The
                    Bolognian stone, as the preparation was called, has a very powerful
                    phosphorescence, of a reddish colour; and the Italian preparation generally has
                    this quality in a higher degree than the imitations prepared elsewhere; but it
                    has been quite eclipsed by the phosphorus of Canton. Canton recommends oyster
                    shells which have been long worn on a sea-beach, as the materials to be
                    employed. They are to be calcined in a good coal-fire for half an hour. The
                    purest parts are then to be collected, and reduced to a fine powder. Three parts
                    of this, with one of sulphur, are to be rammed into a crucible about Iģ inch
                    deep, till nearly full. Place it in the midst of the fire, where it must be kept
                    red hot for at least one hour, and then allowed to cool, when it is to be
                    removed from the crucible. The fine portions of this, which will be quite white,
                    are to be scraped oft’, and immediately enclosed in a bottle with a well-ground
                    stopple.</p>
                <p>When this bottle is exposed for a short time to the light of day, to any
                    artificial light, or, better, to the direct rays of the sun, it will be luminous
                    for some minutes in the dark; and its light will be renewed by a fresh exposure
                    to the sun. At one time it was a subject of controversy, whether or not these
                    substances emitted only the light they had imbibed by exposure, as it was
                    conceived to be a ready mode of deciding the dispute between the followers of
                    Newton and Descartes respecting the nature of light. Galeazzo, Zanotti, and
                    Algarotti of Bologna, tried whether, when exposed to the different rays of the
                    prism, the Bolognian phosphorus would only show the colour of that ray to which
                    it had been exposed; and they thought that its light was reddish, to whichever
                    ray it had been previously exposed. But in these experiments its light was very
                    feeble, and therefore not satisfactory. Afterwards, however, Father Beccari of
                    Turin, by exposing pieces of more powerful phosphori in tubes of different
                    coloured glass, found that, in the dark, they only emitted the colour of the
                    light to which they had been exposed.</p>
                <p>Van Helmont appears to have discovered another powerful phosphorus; and Baldwin
                    of Misnia, in 1677, found that the residuum of a solution of chalk in
                    aquafortis, after distillation, formed a phosphorus of considerable power, but
                    inferior to the Bolognian. Du Fay, in 1734, found that similar properties
                    resided in gypsum, marble, and topaz. The emerald, diamond, and many other
                    precious <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205804" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5804-0337"
                    />stones, he found to have the same property, without calcination, and by mere
                    exposure to light. From the experiments of Margraaf, all the earthy sulphates
                    have this property when calcined; but he thought that neither metals, metallic
                    ores, nor agates, possess it. The analysis of topaz shows that it contains
                    fluoric acid; and we may now generalize the observation, and state, that all
                    substances capable of becoming phosphorescent by calcination contain some fixed
                    acid, and probably all minerals containing such acids are capable of becoming,
                    in like manner, phosphorescent.</p>
                <p>The experiments of Canton are the most complete on this subject <hi rend="italic"
                    >[Phil. Trans,</hi> lviii.). When his phosphorus was, for a short time, exposed
                    to the light of a candle, the moon, or the diffused light of day, it shone for a
                    considerable time in the dark. When exposed to the direct rays of the sun, it
                    gave out light for two hours, at the common temperature of the air. When it had
                    ceased to shine in the dark, the application of heat renewed its luminousness
                    for a short time. If the glass containing the phosphorus be placed in boiling
                    water, its luminousness will be stronger than in the cold, but will last a
                    shorter time. When it has ceased to give light in hot water, it will again give
                    out light on being placed on a hot iron between 400° and 700° Fahrenheit.</p>
                <p>2. Some natural bodies become phosphorescent by a gentle heat. Thus, some kinds
                    of fluor spar, particularly the coloured varieties, give out a pure greenish or
                    a bluish light by being heated; and this is finely exhibited by the green
                    varieties. The mineral called <hi rend="italic">phosphorite,</hi> which is a
                    fibrous phosphate of lime, found principally in Spanish Estremadura, gives out
                    much light when heated. Some marbles, some ores of metals, coal, wax, butter,
                    oil, and several other mineral and vegetable substances, so treated, become more
                    or less luminous. In some the light is momentary, in others it lasts several
                    minutes. It soon attains its maximum brightness, and then fades away. A stream
                    of cooler air extinguishes the light for a moment, but it re-appears on the
                    ceasing of the cool current. Analogous to this class of bodies in some degree
                    are those substances which give out light on percussion; such as siliceous
                    minerals, either with one another or with steel, hard porcelain, or the like;
                    but they also, in such collisions, emit heat as well as light.</p>
                <p>3. Mineral and vegetable bodies, during their decomposition, often give out
                    light. Fish, mutton, and rotten wood, are the best known instances of
                    phosphorescent bodies of this class.</p>
                <p>The luminousness of fish is well known; and Dr Hulme has shown that the light of
                    herrings and mackerels begins to appear while the fish is still eatable, and
                    soon arrives at its maximum, but begins to decrease when they pass to putridity.
                    To produce this change, the fish should be kept in a dark and cool place. It is
                    not confined to the skin of the animal, for if cut into pieces, the surface of
                    each piece becomes luminous; and it is often seen within the mouth of the fish.
                    The luminous matter easily rubs off, and may be transferred to the hands of him
                    who touches the fish. This light is not attended by any perceptible heat. When
                    scraped off, it forms a gelatinous liquid, that will shine for several days, if
                    preserved in a phial. The addition of fresh water, lime water, water impregnated
                    with carbonic acid, of vegetable acids and alkalies, extinguishes it, as do
                    neutral salts, infusions of pepper, and camphor, when strong; yet the same
                    substances, in a weak solution, seem to promote it, and even render it more
                    durable; but sea-water increases its splendour. This luminous property is also
                    found in lobsters and in shell-fish, especially in the <hi rend="italic">Pholas
                    Dactylus,</hi> and its congeners. This shell-fish is luminous when quite fresh,
                    and is mentioned by Pliny as rendering the mouths of those who eat it luminous.
                    The light is readily imparted to milk and sea-water, but it is extinguished by
                    spirit, wine, or vinegar. Sea-water, thus rendered luminous, increases in
                    brightness by a gentle heat; but when heated to 133° Fahrenheit, it is suddenly
                    extinguished, and cannot again become luminous. This luminous matter, when
                    narrowly examined, sometimes appears to give out a sort of lambent flame, which
                    closely resembles that of a solution of common phosphorus in oil; and it smells
                    of phosphorus or of phosphuretted hydrogen. The flesh of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mammalia</hi> undergoes similar changes during its decomposition. This has
                    often been seen in mutton, beef, and veal. This light has sometimes been
                    observed on corpses, much to the terror of the vulgar; and in vaults where dead
                    bodies have been deposited, it has sometimes been observed in a glairy matter
                    adhering to the vault. This last matter, however, probably is the produce of
                    some cryptogamian plant; and it is well known that rotten wood is sometimes
                    highly luminous. A light of this kind is stated to have been observed round the
                    body of a woman at Milan, but it flitted from the bed on the approach of the
                    reporter. This appearance has been more frequently seen around graves, and has
                    obtained in Scotland the name of <hi rend="italic">elf-candles.</hi></p>
                <p>The light from corrupting animal and vegetable matter requires oxygen in some
                    form for its continuance. It is soon extinguished in the exhausted receiver of
                    the air-pump, as Mr Boyle long ago observed; but it would seem that the small
                    quantity of air which is contained in water is sufficient to sustain its
                    luminousness. No perceptible heat is extricated in any of these kinds of
                    phosphorescence.</p>
                <p>Analogous to the light from decaying organized bodies, is the curious meteor
                    termed <hi rend="italic">ignis</hi><hi rend="italic">fatuus,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">will-o'-the-wisp.</hi> Its ordinary appearance is like the faint
                    flame of a taper; sometimes it resembles the light of a torch, or a faggot; but
                    it usually recedes as it is approached, and can rarely be observed near at hand.
                    The colour of the light is usually pale bluish, and seems brightest when most
                    distant. It is most frequent in marshy grounds, in churchyards, or where a
                    considerable mass of animal and vegetable putrefaction is going on. Dr Derham
                    once observed an ignis fatuus playing round the head of a dead thistle; and, by
                    cautiously approaching, he got within two or three yards of it, when a slight
                    movement of the air made it flit; and when he pursued it, he was unable to
                    overtake it.</p>
                <p>A remarkable appearance of ignis fatuus was, about a century and a half ago,
                    common in the vicinity of Bologna, which has been well described by Beccari <hi
                    rend="italic">[Phil. Trans.</hi> vii.). He estimated that two, which at that
                    time appeared almost every dark night, one to the east, the other to the north,
                    of the city, gave light equal to an ordinary faggot. One of them accompanied a
                    friend of Beccari for a mile along the road to Bologna, giving as much light as
                    that of the torch carried before him. Sometimes these meteors divided into
                    several parts, or floated like waves of flame, dropping small
                    scintillations.</p>
                <p>Dr Shaw, the author of Travels in the Holy Land, describes a remarkable one which
                    accompanied him, for upwards of an hour, in one of the valleys of Mount Ephraim.
                    Its shape was at first globular, but it afterwards spread so as to involve the
                    party of the traveller in a pale inoffensive blaze, then disappeared; again it
                    re-assumed the globular form, and again expanded itself, at certain intervals,
                    over more than two or three acres of the adjacent mountains. The atmosphere that
                    evening had been very hazy, and the dew, as it fell on their bridles, felt
                    unusually unctuous and clammy; a [kind of weather, says Shaw, in which sailors
                    observe the balls of fire that flit about the masts and yards of ships.</p>
                <p>The cause of ignis fatuus has been disputed. It can scarcely be accounted for by
                    the phosphorescence of the glow-worm, or any species of fire-fly. It differs
                    also from electric flame, but has the greatest resemblance to the flame <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193205817" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5817-0338"/> of phosphuretted
                    hydrogen; a gas which spontaneously inflames, on coming into contact with air,
                    and which is given out during the corruption of organic matter. This gas is
                    absorbable by water and by fatty oils, to which last it imparts its
                    phosphorescent qualities; and perhaps the luminousness of fish may depend on the
                    union of this substance with oily or mucous matter. There is some difficulty in
                    accounting for the appearance so constant and considerable as that described
                    near Bologna. The ground on which the largest meteor appeared is a hard clay,
                    very retentive of water; while in the hilly district, where the Bolognian ignis
                    fatuus was smaller, the soil was a loose sand. Beccari however states, that they
                    chiefly frequented the banks of streams. All accounts confirm the absence of
                    sensible heat from these meteors.</p>
                <p>SECT. VIII LIGHT EMANATING FROM LIVING ANIMALS.</p>
                <p>A luminous appearance somewhat similar to that given out by decaying organic
                    matter is occasionally observed to play round some classes of living animals;
                    and regularly emanates from the bodies of others, at particular seasons; or as a
                    constant concomitant of motion, by another class.</p>
                <p>Of the first kind, probably, is that light sometimes observed playing around the
                    ears and manes of horses, which, though by some attributed to electricity, is
                    probably an emanation from the animal itself; and may perhaps consist of a
                    phosphuretted gas, disengaged by some unknown process of the animal economy. A
                    lambent flame, of a similar nature, has in a few instances been remarked around
                    the heads of children; a circumstance which is happily seized by Virgil in his
                    fine description of the glory that appeared on the temples of the young
                    Ascanius.</p>
                <p>Ecce levis summo de vertice visus Iuli Fundere lumen apex, tractuque innoxia
                    molli Lambere flamma comas, et circa tempora pasci.</p>
                <p>Aen. ii. G83.</p>
                <p>Living vegetables, in like manner, also occasionally give out light. This has
                    been particularly noticed in the marigold, the orange, the Indian pink or lilium
                    bulbosum, aconitum napellus, tropoeolum majus, &amp;c. But there are animals in
                    whom luminousness forms a necessary part of their economy.</p>
                <p>The most familiar instance of this is the common glowworm, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lympyris</hi><hi rend="italic">noctiluca,</hi> and its congeners. The male of
                    this species is a <hi rend="italic">coleopterous</hi> insect, and sports in the
                    air; while the female is <hi rend="italic">apterous,</hi> doomed for ever to
                    crawl among herbaceous plants, or to nestle on the leaves of shrubs: but when
                    the shades of evening are drawn around, during the summer months, a spot of
                    lucid yellow light, generally tinted with a shade of green, emanates from the
                    extreme rings of her abdomen, and sprinkles the hedges, in some parts of our
                    island, and the warmer parts of Europe, with brilliant stars. The final object
                    of this light is probably to attract the notice of the male insect, who
                    otherwise could with difficulty distinguish his wingless mate. The male of the
                    English glow-worm is generally believed to be destitute of the apparatus for
                    light; though Mr Waller <hi rend="italic">{Phil. Trans,</hi> for 1684&lt;)
                    asserts, that the male of one species of English glow-worm has the luminous
                    appendage. The winged species of glow-worm are common in Italy, Spain, the south
                    of France, and still more so in equinoctial America, in which the flickering
                    light of the numerous fireflies affords a pleasing and interesting spectacle.
                    This light is found to belong to both sexes, though it is most str <hi
                    rend="underline">iki</hi> ng in the females.</p>
                <p>But the luminous property of the <hi rend="italic">Eulgora Lanternaria</hi> of
                    South America surpasses that of all animals, in the splendour of its light. It
                    is a large insect, of the order <hi rend="italic">Hemip-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tera,</hi> three and a half inches long. It has a sort of thick proboscis,
                    about one inch in length, which is the luminous organ. The light emitted by this
                    species is so splendid that two or three of them will illuminate a chamber.</p>
                <p>In all these animals the light has so much the appearance of phosphorus dissolved
                    in oil, that probably it may be a secretion of an analogous nature.</p>
                <p>Many animals inhabiting the sea are highly luminous; and it is almost established
                    that the luminousness so often exhibited by the ocean depends entirely upon
                    myriads of minute phosphorescent animals.</p>
                <p>This appearance is not constant, but is very frequent in most latitudes, and
                    generally, whenever the night is dark, may be seen exceedingly brilliant around
                    our own coasts. When the water is still, it is seen as numerous bright points of
                    a bluish white phosphorescent light of considerable intensity; but when the
                    water is agitated, as by the waves, the motion of a ship, or the dashing of
                    oars, the light appears often in flashes so intense as to show the hours on a
                    watch, or to render legible the pages of a large printed book. The number of the
                    luminous points varies greatly at different times and in different places; and
                    often in the course of a short sail this fluctuation is very conspicuous. We
                    have observed the coruscations, during a gentle breeze, like a line of fire
                    several hundred yards in length from the bows, or in the wake of the vessel.
                    This appearance is found in every sea, but with some difference in intensity and
                    colour, as it seems to proceed from various genera of animals.</p>
                <p>The lurainousness of the sea was long ascribed to electricity; but about the
                    beginning of this century it was proved, in many instances, to depend on the
                    presence of animalcules in the ocean, particularly of a minute species of
                    medusa, which abounds in our seas, and seems to be the same as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Μ. Hemisphoerica</hi> of Müller. Several years before, Sir Joseph Bankes
                    discovered other two animals which rendered the sea luminous, viz. a sort of
                    shrimp, <hi rend="italic">Cancer Eulgens,</hi> and a large medusa, <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ. Pellucens,</hi> both of which abound on the coasts of
                    Brazil.</p>
                <p>About twenty-two years ago, the writer of this article made many observations on
                    this subject, both on the coasts of Britain and in the Bay of Biscay. When the
                    water was very luminous in that sea, on several evenings he drew water and
                    carried it for examination into the cabin. Of course it ceased to appear
                    luminous when viewed by candle light, but he could distinguish, floating in a
                    glass of seawater, a number of pellucid animalcules, which, when magnified by
                    the globular form of the containing vessel, evidently belonged to ' several
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Medusaria,</hi> among which he could observe the
                    genera <hi rend="italic">Noctiluca</hi> of Lamarck, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cayanea,</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">JBeroe.</hi> The general size of these
                    animals was from one twentieth to one thirtieth of an inch in diameter. That the
                    luminousness of the sea was derived from these minute animals, appears to be
                    proved by the following simple experiments. Portions of this sea-water were put
                    into separate beer glasses, and the number of animalcules in each was carefully
                    ascertained: they were carried successively to the deck, and when the water was
                    dashed on it, the number of lucid points was ascertained. In most instances the
                    number of these points coincided with the number of animals previously observed
                    in the glass; in no instance were the lucid points <hi rend="italic"
                    >more</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> though occasionally they were not so
                    numerous, probably owing to some of them adhering to the glass, or having
                    escaped the shock that stimulated their light-making organs. The same animals he
                    has often observed, even more numerous, in the luminous sea-water of the <hi
                    rend="subscript"> t</hi> British coasts; and has obtained similar results by a
                    repetition of the experiments. The luminous points often adhere to the fingers;
                    and on introducing such a luminous speck into a glass of non-luminous sea-water,
                    careful inspection will show a medusary animal <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193205830" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5830-0339"/>floating in the water. The
                    sea-water, on such occasions, if left at rest in glass vessels on deck, or even
                    if suspended in gimbals, would occasionally exhibit luminous points; and the
                    author conceives that the light either attends the voluntary movements of those
                    minute creatures, or is emitted at their will. When sulphuric or other strong
                    acid is poured into luminous water, it will produce a considerable flash of
                    light, either by the effort of the animals to escape, or the unexpected stimulus
                    it produces. In some climates the sea exhibits a fiery-red hue. This has often
                    been observed in the Chinese seas, and in some parts of the Indian Ocean. It is
                    produced, according to the best authorities, by myriads of minute animals that
                    emit a reddish light. Captain Horsburgh and Mr Langstaff have described other
                    kinds of light occasionally observed in the Indian Ocean. The latter mentions,
                    that during a passage from China to New Holland, the sea’at night had a faint
                    milky appearance, as if snow had just fallen on the water. The sailors thought
                    it was produced by a coral shoal, but seventy fathoms of line did not find
                    bottom; and when the water drawn up was examined,ξ it was observed to swarm with
                    minute globular bodies, about the size of a pin’s head, linked together, and of
                    a milky hue, probably some minute species of medusa. It is well known that the
                    larger fish are sometimes luminous. This has been remarked in the bonito and the
                    shark; but whether they are naturally luminous, or only in consequence of the
                    adhesion of luminous animalcules to them, is not determined.</p>
                <p>Some have ascribed the luminousness of the sea to electricity, others to
                    putrescent particles in the water. The former opinion is not probable, from the
                    appearances observed; the latter is supported by the luminous matter of dead
                    fish being diffusible through water, and imparting to it luminous qualities; but
                    the known phosphorescence of many small sea animals, and the coincidence of the
                    number of scintillations, in the experiments above detailed, with that of the
                    animals observed, incline us to believe that the luminous appearance of the
                    ocean depends on the presence of minute animals.</p>
                <p>SECT. IX. CHEMICAL EFFECTS OF LIGHT.</p>
                <p>Light appears to be possessed of chemical properties and energies distinct from
                    those of heat, which may be considered as further proofs of its materiality.</p>
                <p>It is capable of decomposing various metallic salts. Thus, if a colourless
                    solution of nitrate of silver be exposed to light, it gradually blackens; a
                    powder is deposited which has the same colour, and the salt is found to have
                    lost a portion of its oxygen. This change is more rapidly effected by the direct
                    rays of the sun than by the diffused light of day. The neutral solutions of
                    gold, also, when exposed to light, in contact with charcoal, with vegetable or
                    animal matter, as cotton and silk, are decomposed. This is the principle of the
                    beautiful process invented by Mrs Fulhame, for ornamenting muslin and silk
                    stuffs with flowers and sprigs of gold. The salt of gold parts with its acid and
                    its oxygen to the vegetable or animal matter through the agency of light. The
                    dry salt formed by dissolving gold in nitro-muriatic acid is also slowly
                    decomposed by light under similar circumstances.</p>
                <p>Scheele examined the effects of light on metallic solutions, and discovered that
                    the chemical effects of the different coloured rays of the prismatic spectrum
                    were different. By enclosing solutions of silver in glasses of different
                    colours, he found, that in red glass there was very little effect produced,
                    whilst in violet-coloured glass the blackening was speedily produced. These
                    interesting facts were confirmed by Senebier and by Thomas Wedgwood.</p>
                <p>The latter showed, that in the full sunshine, the blackening of muriate of silver
                    was produced in two minutes, and in the shade that several hours were required
                    to produce this effect. The sunbeams transmitted through red glass have very
                    little blackening effect; yellow and green glass are somewhat more effectual;
                    but blue and violet glass produce the most decisive effects. The discovery of
                    Herschel, respecting the different refrangibility of light and heat, induced
                    Ritter and Wollaston to try the effect upon the salts of silver beyond the
                    violet ray; and they found that the blackening was most decided beyond the
                    visible boundary of the spectrum at the violet end. In some experiments of
                    Senebier, muriate of silver was darkened by the violet ray in 15", by the blue
                    in 29", by the green in 37", by the yellow in 5' 30", by the orange in 12', and
                    by the red in 20'. These effects are wholly due to light; for no effect is
                    produced in the hottest point just beyond the red rays.</p>
                <p>Berthollet proved, that during the action of light on many metallic oxides, as
                    those of gold, silver, lead, and mercury, a portion of their oxygen was
                    extricated; and this is supposed to be the change produced in the blackening of
                    the salts of silver,—a partial reduction of the metal. Sir H. Davy found that
                    tritoxide of lead, when moistened, and exposed to the red rays, became red, that
                    is, it lost oxygen, and became a deutoxide. Oxide of mercury, obtained by mixing
                    potash and calomel, was not changed by the most refrangible rays, but became red
                    in the least refrangible rays, which must have resulted from the <hi
                    rend="italic">absorption</hi> of oxygen. The violet rays produced on the
                    moistened red oxide of mercury the same effect as a stream of hydrogen gas, that
                    is, a deoxidation. Wollaston found that these rays produced an <hi rend="italic"
                    >oxidizing</hi> effect on one vegetable substance, resin of guaiacum. This resin
                    becomes green by absorbing oxygen; and he found that it underwent this change in
                    the violet rays, but again obtained its yellow hue on being exposed to the red
                    rays.</p>
                <p>Some of the acids suffer decomposition by light; thus, if we expose colourless
                    nitric acid to the sun’s rays, in a flask provided with a bent tube, and
                    terminating in a pneumatic apparatus, the acid becomes coloured, from the
                    formation of nitrous gas, and oxygen may be collected in the trough in the usual
                    way, as Berthollet ascertained. Light also decomposes some vegetable acids, such
                    as the hydrocyanic; and to preserve-such compounds pure, it is necessary
                    carefully to exclude light.</p>
                <p>Light also in some cases favours chemical combination. If chlorine which has been
                    collected over water, and therefore contains water, be exposed to light, the
                    water is slowly decomposed; its hydrogen enters into combination with the
                    chlorine to form hydro-chloric or muriatic acid, and its oxygen is liberated.
                    The influence of light is still more striking on chlorine and on hydrogen. If we
                    mix equal proportions of these gases, and the access of light be carefully
                    excluded, no action takes place, or their union is very slowly produced; but if
                    we expose them to the diffused light of day, combination will take place in a
                    quarter of an hour. If exposed to the direct beams of the sun, the union is
                    instantaneous, and with a violent explosion. Davy found that when such a mixture
                    was exposed to the red rays only, the gases united without explosion, yet more
                    rapidly than when exposed to the violet rays; but that the conversion of a
                    solution of chlorine into muriatic acid took place most readily at the most
                    refrangible end of the solar spectrum.</p>
                <p>SECT. X EFFECTS OF LIGHT ON PLANTS.</p>
                <p>The change produced on vegetable colouring matter by light is familiar in the
                    process of bleaching by exposure to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205843"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-5843-0340"/>the sun. But the influence of light on living
                    vegetables is much more remarkable.</p>
                <p>If a plant grow in total darkness, its natural green hue is not acquired; but it
                    will be white, though in other re-spe'ets vigorous. This is familiar in the <hi
                    rend="italic">etiolation</hi> or blanching of certain garden-stuff's, as celery,
                    sea-kale, endive, &amp;c. The late Professor Robison, many years ago, remarked
                    that plants growing in darkness were not only white, but that they did not
                    attain the natural form of their leaves, nor their natural odour. In descending
                    into a coal mine, he accidentally met with a plant growing luxuriantly, the form
                    and qualities of which were entirely new to him. The sod on which it grew was
                    removed, potted, and carefully attended to in his garden. The etiolated plant
                    languished and died; but the roots speedily threw out vigorous shoots, which,
                    from the form of the leaves, and peculiar odour, he readily recognised as common
                    <hi rend="italic">tansy.</hi> He repeated similar experiments upon plants of
                    lovage, carvi, and mint, with analogous results.</p>
                <p>The green colour of vegetables, and even the form of their leaves, are materially
                    influenced by light.</p>
                <p>Some experiments of Senebier would lead to the conclusion that it is the violet
                    end of the spectrum which has the greatest influence in counteracting the
                    effects of <hi rend="italic">etiolation.</hi> This production of the dark colour
                    of plants would appear to depend upon the decomposition of carbonic acid by the
                    living vegetable, when acted on by light, and the fixation of its carbon. That
                    light is necessary to this process, is proved by the experiments of Priestley,
                    Senebier, Ingenhouz, De Saussure, Davy, and many vegetable physiologists.
                    Growing plants in sunshine give out oxygen by the decomposition of earbonic
                    acid; but in darkness carbonic acid is evolved; and Ellis has demonstrated, in
                    his interesting essays, that oxygen, under such circumstances, always disappears
                    from the air in which vegetation is going on. Light, then, acts an important
                    part in the vegetable economy, by fixing the most dense and abundant of the
                    three general elements of vegetable matter. The influence of light in maturing
                    fruits, is well known. The fruits which when ripe are saccharine, are previously
                    <hi rend="italic">acid</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that is, their hydrogen and
                    earbon are combined with an excess of oxygen. Light, by favouring the evolution
                    of oxygen, and the fixation of carbon, converts the vegetable acid into sugar,
                    and thus provides a suitable food for the embryon in the seed. On the other
                    hand, the influence of light is not less conspicuous in another class of
                    vegetables. In an early stage of the germination of seeds yielding farina when
                    ripe, the tender rudiment of the seed is enveloped in a slightly saceharine
                    juice, as may be seen in young wheat and maize. Now, what is wanted to convert
                    them into farina is the evolution of oxygen, and the fixation of a larger
                    quantity of earbon. These two indications are fulfilled by the influence of
                    light on the growing vegetables; and thus we can explain why the sun’s influence
                    is so essential in the one ease to the formation of sugar from an acid; and in
                    the other, of farina from a saceharine juice. The same principles will explain
                    why a farinaceous seed, when planted in the ground, becomes again saccharine.
                    Light is now wanting; oxygen is absorbed, and partly aids in the evolution of
                    the redundant carbon, partly is added to the two other general elements. This
                    view affords an instance of the important agency of light in vegetation, and a
                    beautiful example of the simplicity of the means employed to produce diversified
                    effects in the works of creation.</p>
                <p>SECT. XI. EFFECTS OF LIGHT ON ANIMALS.</p>
                <p>The facts noticed in the last section show the powerful influence of light on
                    vegetable forms. But its effects on the exterior of animals, though less
                    striking, are not unimportant.</p>
                <p>1. The influence of the sun’s rays in deepening the colour, or in giving a brown
                    tint to the skin, seems to be more due to the light than to the heat of the
                    sunbeams; for the parts of the skin covered by the clothes, though kept thus
                    hotter than the parts exposed, do not undergo this change. The pale visage and
                    enfeebled vitality of those who live much in obscure apartments, in prisons, and
                    in mines, are well known; and though probably the most violent symptoms that
                    characterize the <hi rend="italic">anhoemia</hi> of miners, in which the skin
                    assumes a yellowish, waxy hue, and the lips become bloodless, be chiefly due to
                    breathing a vitiated atmosphere, yet some influence is certainly attributable to
                    want of light. The anhaemia of persons long confined in dungeons has often been
                    remarked, and was lately described as strikingly exemplified in the person of
                    Caspar Hausser, the young man whose mysterious birth, confinement, and
                    assassination, have hitherto baffled conjecture.</p>
                <p>In climates where the heat renders a state almost approaching to nudity
                    desirable, all travellers agree that the development of the human frame is
                    early, and the form has fewer deviations from the symmetry natural to the race
                    than among northern nations. Deformity is said to be comparatively rare in hot
                    climates, where the surface is much exposed; and this has been attributed by Dr
                    Edwards in some measure to the influence of light. Perhaps, after making due
                    allowance for the less chance of rearing sickly or deformed children among
                    barbarous nations, and for the prevalence of infanticide among them in such
                    cases, there is considerable justice in his remarks on this subject; without
                    which it would be difficult to account for the fine muscular and rounded forms
                    so often observed among nations agreeing in nothing except in the prevalence of
                    a very free exposure of their persons to the full influence of light; as among
                    the Mexicans and Peruvians, the Chaymas and Muyseas of South America, the
                    Caribbs of the Antilles, the inhabitants of the numerous groups of the South
                    Seas, or the free inhabitants of Africa. Probably, too, a part of the effects
                    attributed to country air, in restoring to health the sickly child of the city
                    artizan, is due to <hi rend="italic">insolation,</hi> or the exposure to light,
                    which 'appears to have the .property of invigorating the vital functions, and of
                    elevating the spirits of those who have suffered a long deprivation of its
                    cheering influence.</p>
                <p>2. The effect of light on the lower animals is more marked, and is strikingly
                    illustrated in the curious experiments of Dr W. F. Edwards upon the spawn of
                    frogs. He enclosed portions of the spawn of the frog in different vessels
                    permeable to water, some of which were perfectly opake, while others freely
                    admitted light; the temperature was the same, yet the eggs exposed to light came
                    to maturity; but those deprived of light were not hatched.</p>
                <p>He even found that the development of the perfect form of such animals depended
                    on light. By enclosing tadpoles of both frogs and toads in different boxes, some
                    of which freely admitted light, while others totally excluded it, and placing
                    them in running water, he found that the tadpoles exposed to light underwent the
                    change to the perfect form of the animal, as usual; while the tadpoles excluded
                    from the light, though they seemed perfectly vigorous, did not undergo the
                    transformation, even though they had increased to double or triple their
                    primitive weight. He also conjectures that the Anguine Syren, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proteus</hi><hi rend="italic">anguinus,</hi> may only be the larva of some
                    reptde retained in its imperfect form by the profound obscurity of the
                    subterranean lakes of Carniola, in which it is found. In this conjecture,
                    however, he is mistaken; for that singular animal has been kept alive without
                    change a considerable time, under circumstances favourable to its
                    transformation, if really an imperfect<pb break="no" facs="nls:193205856"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-5856-0341"/> species, by various naturalists; particularly, as
                    we have been informed, by the Austrian archduke John; and also by Mr Melly, a
                    zealous naturalist now resident in Liverpool.</p>
                <p>The facts, however, already detailed, show that the influence of light on the
                    animal economy is by no means inconsiderable. But the most interesting property
                    of light, in relation to animals, is its effect in producing vision.</p>
                <p>3. The rays of light emanating from bodies, or reflected from their surfaces, are
                    destined to impress the sensorium through the <hi rend="smallcaps">eye</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">;</hi> an admirable and complex optical apparatus, in which the
                    rays, after passing through the transparent <hi rend="italic">cornea, a,</hi>
                    sustain various refractions, until they reach the sentient expansion of the
                    optic nerve, <hi rend="italic">f</hi> called <hi rend="italic">retina.</hi> The
                    cornea constitutes the front of the eyeball, the rest of its surface is formed
                    of a dense white tunic, called the <hi rend="italic">sclerotic coat, bb,</hi>
                    which joins the cornea by its edges, forming with the latter an almost globular
                    body, which contains the more delicate structures of the eye. Just within the
                    cornea is observed a coloured ring, apparently formed of diverging fibres,
                    termed the <hi rend="italic">iris, hh.</hi> This ring is perforated by the <hi
                    rend="italic">pupil,</hi> a circular aperture in its centre, which is capable of
                    contraction and expansion, by the action of the fibres of the iris, according to
                    the increase or diminution of the light. This movement of the pupil is not under
                    the will of the animal, but is regulated by the stimulus of light, so as to
                    exclude a quantity that would be hurtful to the organ. The iris is attached to
                    the outer coat of the eye, the sclerotic, by the <hi rend="italic">ciliary
                    processes, ηη,</hi> Within the sclerotic lies a delicately thin vascular
                    membrane named the <hi rend="italic">choroid coat,</hi> having its interior
                    surface lined with a black secretion termed the <hi rend="italic">pigmentum
                    nigrum,</hi> the probable' use of which is to aid clear vision, by preventing a
                    multiplicity of reflections in the bottom of the eye.</p>
                <p>Still nearer to the centre of the eye lies the <hi rend="italic">retina,</hi>
                    which is continuous with the optic nerve,/, and is the part of the eye sentient
                    to the impressions of light. Entering the bottom of the eye, but not just in its
                    axis, is seen a thick cord, the <hi rend="italic">optic nerve,</hi> by which the
                    impressions upon the retina are conveyed to the brain.</p>
                <p>The bulk of the eyeball is made up of three substances, which have been
                    improperly termed <hi rend="italic">humours.</hi> The first lies just within the
                    cornea, and fills the space between it and the iris, as well as the smaller
                    space immediately behind the latter. From its fluidity, it is termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">aqueous humour, g.</hi> The iris divides the chamber of the
                    aqueous humour into an <hi rend="italic">anterior</hi> and a <hi rend="italic"
                    >posterior portion.</hi> The posterior wall of this chamber is formed by a
                    delicate, transparent, capsular membrane, enclosing a lenticular body, convex on
                    both sides, though more so posteriorly, which is named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >crystalline lens, l.</hi> This body consists of concentric layers, formed of
                    fibres externally less consistent, but increasing in density towards its centre;
                    a structure intended for the purpose of correcting its <hi rend="italic"
                    >spherical aberration.</hi> The capsule of the crystalline lens is retained in
                    its situation by the <hi rend="italic">ciliary circle ox ciliary
                    processes</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and it lies imbedded in the most
                    considerable of all the humours of the eye, the <hi rend="italic">vitreous,
                    m,</hi> which consists of a clear gelatinous substance, that recent anatomical
                    investigations prove to be lodged in very delicate membranous cells. In the
                    healthy state, especially in young persons, these humours are perfectly
                    colourless and transparent, but they become coloured by age; and the crystalline
                    lens has been seen in very old persons of a bright amber colour, though still
                    transparent. Opacity of the lens forms the disease termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >cataract.</hi> The obvious use of the humours of the eye is to refract the rays
                    of light entering the eye by the transparent <hi rend="italic">cornea,</hi> and
                    to concentrate them on the <hi rend="italic">retina.</hi> The difference in
                    their consistence seems intended to make that organ a true and nicely adjusted
                    achromatic optical instrument.</p>
                <p>The ray from any object falling directly in the centre of the eye, perpendicular
                    to its surface, will not undergo any refraction, but pass straight through to
                    the retina; and its direction may be termed the <hi rend="italic">axis of the
                    eye.</hi> All the rays which fall obliquely on the eye will, by the refraction
                    of the humours, be bent from their course, and cut the axis somewhere between
                    the lens and the retina; and the refractive power of the humours is such as to
                    converge on the retina all rays proceeding from any one point of a visible
                    object, whether these rays fall on the cornea in a parallel or a diverging
                    condition. But as these rays have all crossed the axis of the eye by the
                    refractive power of the humours, it is obvious that the rays from the upper part
                    of the object will impinge on the lower part of the retina, and those from the
                    lowest point, on the upper part of that membrane. Hence the image of the object
                    will be <hi rend="italic">inverted</hi> on the retina. That this actually takes
                    place we can easily satisfy ourselves, by removing from the posterior part of
                    the eye of a sheep a portion of the sclerotic coat with a sharp knife, until it
                    becomes translucent, when the image of a candle placed before the cornea will be
                    seen inverted on the back part of the eye thus prepared.</p>
                <p>In the usual state of the eye, its refractive apparatus is so contrived that all
                    the rays from the same points of objects at some distance from the eye will <hi
                    rend="italic">converge in the retina,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">principal
                    focus of the eye will lie in that membrane</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but
                    divergent rays from very near objects would converge in a point <hi
                    rend="italic">behind the retina,</hi> were there not some power of adjustment in
                    the eye for correcting the confused image which would thus be formed. This may
                    be effected in two ways; either by increasing the convexity of the cornea, or by
                    bringing the lens to a greater distance from the retina. Some have attributed
                    this adjustment to an alteration in the form of the eyeball, and consequently of
                    the cornea, by the action of the motor muscles of the organ; but there is much
                    more probability in the opinion that this adjustment is produced by the
                    contractions and expansions of the <hi rend="italic">iris.</hi> This part <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193205869" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5869-0342"/> of the eye is
                    attached to the ciliary ligament, which is also connected with the capsule of
                    the crystalline lens. Hence contraction of the pupil would tend to draw forward
                    the lens, or remove it farther from the retina; and thus the rays which have
                    their point of convergence <hi rend="italic">behind</hi> the retina, would meet
                    in that membrane, and a distinct image would be produced. That some such
                    adjustment is necessary is obvious; for if, after contemplating a distant
                    object, our attention be suddenly turned to a very near one, it is some time ere
                    the second object is distinctly perceived; and the movement of the iris will be
                    seen to take place before the second image is well defined. The retina is
                    capable of affording the perception of external objects in its whole extent,
                    except at the insertion of the optic nerve, a spot about ⅛th of an inch in
                    diameter in man. Any image falling on this spot is invisible, as multiplied
                    experiments have shown. This insensible point in either eye may be indicated by
                    the familiar optical experiment of placing three coloured wafers horizontally on
                    a wall, on a white ground, about two feet from each other. Let the operator
                    place himself about two feet from the wall, opposite the middle wafer; shut one
                    eye, and then gradually retire backwards, while he fixes his open eye on the
                    wafer nearest the closed eye. When an ordinary eye is distant from the wall
                    about <hi rend="italic">five times</hi> the distance of the wafers from each
                    other, the image of the middle wafer will have fallen on the insertion of the
                    optic nerve, and will no longer be visible.</p>
                <p>Two very interesting speculations connected with vision have long exercised the
                    ingenuity of physiologists and metaphysicians, viz. how it happens that animals
                    with two eyes see objects <hi rend="italic">single,</hi> by means of double
                    images on the retinae; and how they appear <hi rend="italic">erect</hi> by means
                    of inverted images?</p>
                <p>The first has been explained on the supposition of there being corresponding
                    points in each eye that convey similar perceptions to the mind, and that such
                    afford only the idea of <hi rend="italic">unity.</hi> In the natural movements
                    of the eyes, the images of external objects are supposed always to fall on such
                    points; but should any cause throw the images on dissimilar points, then we have
                    double vision. Hence, if with the finger we push one eyeball slightly out of its
                    parallel position with regard to the other, two objects are perceived. In
                    persons who squint, the parallel movement of the eyes is lost; and it has been
                    supposed that in cases where the squinting has come on in adults from
                    imperfection in one eye, that habit enables the individual to correct the
                    illusion of double vision, and that the person ceases to notice the impressions
                    made on the least perfect of the two eyes.</p>
                <p>The second fact alluded to is that of <hi rend="italic">erect</hi> vision by <hi
                    rend="italic">inverted</hi> images. That images of external objects are depicted
                    inverted on the retina is perfectly well ascertained; and philosophers have been
                    much puzzled to explain how the indications of vision and touch are reconciled.
                    Some have imagined that at first we really see objects inverted, but learn by
                    experience and by the sense of touch to correct the illusion. Other attempts
                    have been made to explain it by what has been termed the <hi rend="italic">law
                    of visible direction</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> by which it is supposed that
                    when any point of an object is viewed, the rays proceeding from that point must
                    fall on the eye with different degrees of obliquity, yet that point will be only
                    seen in the direction of the central ray of the cone of light proceeding from
                    that point: And as the lines of <hi rend="italic">visible direction</hi> must
                    necessarily cross each other at the centre of visible direction, those of the
                    lower part of the image on the retina must go to the upper part of the object,
                    and those of the upper part of the image to the lower part of the object; and
                    hence an erect object is considered as the necessary result of an inverted
                    image.</p>
                <p>This is very ingenious, but it is obviously hypothetical and obscure. The
                    physiological explication of single vision by double images suggested by Newton,
                    and since supported by Wollaston, is based on what has been termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">semi-decussation</hi> of the optic nerves at their commissure,
                    whereby the right half of the retina of each eye is placed in direct nervous
                    communication with the right optic lobe, or right half of that part of the brain
                    termed <hi rend="italic">corpora</hi><hi rend="italic">quadrigemina,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Hence impressions made on corresponding
                    points in each retina may, in fact, be impressions on the <hi rend="italic">same
                    points of the common</hi><hi rend="italic">sensorium,</hi> and therefore
                    co-operate in producing the same perception. The anatomical proof of this is
                    still defective, but many facts give it probability. The subject has engaged the
                    attention of Professor Alison of Edinburgh, who considers that this arrangement
                    of the optic nerves is but a part of the provision by which nature has secured
                    harmony between perceptions afforded by sight and touch. His explanation of one
                    of the most perplexing questions in animal physiology is so ingenious, that we
                    gladly avail ourselves of his permission to lay it before our readers.</p>
                <p>According to him, the peculiar contorted or involuted course of the optic nerves
                    (in all vertebrate animals) around the crura cerebri, until they are lost in the
                    optic lobes, seems designed to secure that the position of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >impression on the</hi><hi rend="italic">sensorium</hi> should be conformable to
                    the true position of the object.</p>
                <p>It is only in those animals intended by nature to contemplate objects with both
                    eyes at once, as in mammalia and birds, that the semi-decussation of the optic
                    nerve is found. The contrivance in fact implies that both eyes are to be at the
                    same time directed to the same object, or that both optic lobes are to be
                    constantly employed in vision at the same time; the right half of each retina
                    being in connection with each optic lobe, and the left half of each retina in
                    like manner connected with the left optic lobe. Now, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >right</hi> half of each retina contains the image of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >left</hi> half of the field of vision; and therefore the impressions made by
                    the left half of the field of vision fall on the right optic lobe, and have, on
                    their left, the impression resulting from the right side of the field of vision;
                    on which, as both optic lobes are necessarily exercised together, the attention
                    of the mindjs equally directed.</p>
                <p>Dr Alison considers that the grand contrivance adopted by nature to secure
                    harmony between the indications of sight and touch is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >decussation at the pyramids</hi> of the nervous fibres concerned in common
                    sensation and in voluntary (movements; the effect of which must be, that while
                    the right side of the brain is that to which impressions from the left half of
                    the field of vision are brought, it is also <hi rend="italic">that</hi> on which
                    all the other sensations of the left side of the body depend; or, in other
                    words, <hi rend="italic">we both see andfeel τvhat is on our left by the right
                    side of the brain.</hi> Accordingly, it is in those animals only in which the
                    semi-decussation of the optic nerves exists (namely, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mammalia</hi> and birds) that the decussation at the pyramids exists, or that
                    the sensations and voluntary motions of each side of the body appear to be in
                    connection with the opposite side of the brain.</p>
                <p>As the admirable mechanism of the eye, and its beautiful adaptation to the
                    necessities and comfort of the animal creation, afford a striking instance of
                    that wisdom and beneficence so conspicuous in the handy work of the Deity; so
                    the extinction of this exquisite and important organ must be considered as one
                    of the severest of human calamities; a misfortune that perhaps cannot be fully
                    appreciated by those who have not experienced the loss of sight, so feelingly
                    deplored by our mighty bard in poetry that can only perish with the language in
                    which it is expressed.</p>
