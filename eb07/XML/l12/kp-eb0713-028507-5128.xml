                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Library,</hi> in common language, means either an apartment
                    or edifice destined to contain books placed regularly upon shelves, or the books
                    themselves which are therein disposed and arranged. It is in the latter sense
                    only that the term is employed in the present article. The necessity of
                    preserving, in distinct forms, writings relating to particular subjects, first
                    led to the formation of books; and the convenience of being able to compare
                    different writings on the same subject, or to consult various writings on
                    different subjects, naturally suggested the assemblage of books, any
                    considerable collection of which constitutes a library.</p>
                <p>Hence in almost all parts of the world where civilization has made any
                    considerable progress, traces may be discovered of the existence of libraries.
                    At the period of the Spanish invasion of South America, for instance, emblems or
                    pictural representations were employed instead of writing, letters being wholly
                    unknown; in Yucatan and Honduras there were books composed of the leaves of
                    trees; and in the kingdom of Mexicothe natives had a <hi rend="italic"
                    >library,</hi> histories, and calendars, in which they painted such things as
                    had proper figures by their natural representations, and such as had none, by
                    means of various other <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205141"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-5141-0286"/>characters, so that they expressed in this way
                    whatever they pleased.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Herrera, decade ii. book ix. c. 4.</p></note> This may be considered as a
                    library in its earliest stage; for all those which are described as having
                    belonged to the ancients were composed of rolls, which, though different in form
                    from our books, supplied the place of them, and, when collected, constituted a
                    library, even in the modern acceptation of that term.</p>
                <p>The origin of libraries is involved in obscurity. According to some, the
                    distinction of having first made collections of writings belongs to the Hebrews;
                    but others ascribe this honour to the Egyptians. Those who support the former
                    opinion contend that the care which the Hebrews bestowed in preserving their
                    sacred books, in which the history and fortunes of their ancestors, as well as
                    their laws, were recorded, became an example to other nations; whilst those who
                    hold the latter opinion maintain that, as the civilization and learning of Egypt
                    were of much higher antiquity than in almost any other country with the history
                    of which we are acquainted, and as the art of writing was known and practised
                    therein from the earliest times, indeed long before knowledge had dawned amongst
                    any other people, so it maybe presumed that collections of books first began to
                    be made in that region where the art of writing seems to have been originally
                    invented. This question, however, is not one which it is of importance to
                    discuss. It is sufficient to observe, that, in ancient Egypt, the priests
                    appear, from the earliest times, to have kept records or archives, in a
                    character expressly appropriated for the purpose, and hence called hieratic or
                    sacerdotal; that consequently every sacred college contained a library, composed
                    in part at least of such archives; and that, besides, they had written books, in
                    which were inscribed all the knowledge, whether of science or of art, which had
                    either descended to them from their predecessors, or had been the fruit of their
                    own labour and research.</p>
                <p>I. ANCIENT LIBRARIES.</p>
                <p>As the earliest form of the graphic art appears to have consisted in inscribing
                    or engraving characters on stone, metal, wood, or other durable substance, so
                    the first public libraries were composed exclusively of archives deposited in
                    the temples, that the acts relating to history and public law might there be
                    preserved. This will be found to hold true almost universally. Men invariably
                    begin with what is absolutely necessary to their well-being; and it is only
                    after the lapse of a long interval that time and the progress of improvement add
                    the useful to the necessary, and the ornamental to the useful.</p>
                <p>Osymandyas, one of the ancient kings of Egypt,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>He is supposed to have lived 600 years after
                    the Deluge, or about the year of the world 2250.</p></note> is said to have been
                    the first who founded a library, and established it in a division or compartment
                    of the edifice which has sometimes been called his palace and sometimes his
                    tomb. On the entrance was inscribed the words, <hi rend="italic">Aυχ</hi><hi

                    represented a judge, with the image of truth suspended from his neck, and many
                    books or rolls lying before him. Such is the account given by Diodorus,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Diodorus Siculus, lib. i. c.
                    2.</p></note> who had himself visited Egypt, but who merely mentions the fact,
                    without giving us any information as to its contents. It probably contained
                    works of very remote antiquity, and also the books accounted sacred by the
                    Egyptians, all of which perished amidst the destructive ravages which
                    accompanied and followed the Persian invasion under Cam byses. There was also,
                    according to Eustathius and other ancient writers, a fine library at Memphis,
                    deposited in the temple of Phtha, from which Homer has been accused of having
                    stolen both the Iliad and the Odyssey, and afterwards published them as his own.
                    (See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Homer.)</hi> From this charge, however,
                    the bard has been vindicated by various writers, and by different arguments.</p>
                <p>But the most superb library of Egypt, perhaps of the ancient world, was the one
                    founded by Ptolemy Soter, at Alexandria, and enriched by successive sovereigns
                    of that country. About the year 290 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> Ptolemy
                    Soter, a learned prince, founded an academy at Alexandria, called the Museum,
                    where there assembled a society of learned men, who were devoted to the study of
                    philosophy and the sciences; and for their use he formed a collection of books,
                    the number of which has been variously computed, by Epiphanius at 54,000, and by
                    Josephus at 200,000.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    prince, collected great numbers of books in the temple of Serapis, in addition
                    to those accumulated by his father, and at his death left in it about 100,000
                    volumes. He had agents in every part of Asia and of Greece, commissioned to
                    search out and purchase the rarest and most valuable writings; and amongst those
                    he procured were the works of Aristotle, purchased of Neleus,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Athenaeus, lib. i. c. 4, ed.
                    Schweighaeuser.</p></note> and the Greek version of the Jewish Scriptures,
                    designated the Septuagint, which was undertaken at the suggestion of Demetrius
                    Phalereus,, who first executed the office of librarian to this monarch. The
                    measures adopted by Ptolemy Philadelphus, for augmenting the Alexandrian
                    Library, were pursued by his successor Ptolemy Euergetes, with unscrupulous
                    vigour. He caused all books imported into Egypt by Greeks or other foreigners to
                    be seized and sent to the academy or museum, where they were transcribed by
                    persons employed for the purpose; upon which the copies were delivered to the
                    proprietors, and the originals deposited in the library. He borrowed of the
                    Athenians the works of Sophocles, Euripides, and Aeschylus; caused them to be
                    transcribed in the most elegant manner possible; retained the originals for his
                    own library; and returned to the Athenians the copies which had been made of
                    them, with fifteen talents<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Upwards of L.3000 sterling.</p></note> for the exchange. As the museum,
                    where die library was originally founded, stood near the royal palace, in the
                    quarter of the city called Bruchion, the books were at first deposited there;
                    but when this building had been completely occupied with books to the number of
                    400,000 volumes, a supplemental library was erected within the Serapeion, or
                    temple of Serapis; and the books there placed gradually increased to the amount
                    of 300,000 volumes; thus making, in both libraries, a grand total of 700,000
                    volumes.</p>
                <p>The Alexandrian Library continued in all its splendour until the first
                    Alexandrian war, when, during the plunder of the city, the Bruchion portion of
                    the collection was accidentally destroyed by fire, owing to the recklessness of
                    the auxiliary troops. But the library in the Serapeion still remained, and was
                    augmented by subsequent donations, particularly by that of the Pergamean
                    Library, amounting to 200,000 volumes, presented by Mark Antony to Cleopatra; so
                    that it soon surpassed the former both in the number and in the value of its
                    contents. At length, after various revolutions under the Roman emperors, during
                    which the collection was sometimes plundered and sometimes re-established, it
                    was utterly destroyed by the Saracens, under the orders of the Caliph Omar, when
                    they acquired possession <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205154"

                    642. Amrou, the victorious general, was himself inclined to spare this
                    inestimable treasury of ancient science and learning; but the ignorant and
                    fanatical caliph, to whom he applied for instructions, ordered it to be
                    destroyed. “If,” said he, “these writings of the Greeks agree with the Koran, or
                    book Allah, they are useless, and need not be preserved; if they disagree, they
                    are pernicious, and ought to be destroyed.” The sentence of destruction was
                    executed with blind obedience. The volumes of parchment or papyrus were
                    distributed to the four thousand baths of the city; and such was their
                    incredible number, that six months were scarcely sufficient for their
                    combustion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hartwell

                    that the direct and positive statement of an historian of such unquestionable
                    credit as Abulfaragius, cannot be set side by arguments of a negative and
                    hypothetical character. Besides, Gibbon’s references to Aulus Gellius, Ammianus
                    Marcelli-tus, and Orosius, are foreign to the purpose; inasmuch as the
                    destruction referred to by these writers is that which took place in he time of
                    Julius Caesar, after which the library was restored, and continued to flourish,
                    until it was annihilated by the Saracens, in onsequence of the decree of
                    Omar.</p></note></p>
                <p>The ancient Greeks, whose poetry has been to us the primary source of all our
                    profane literature, had as yet no other theology than the system which resulted
                    from observations made on the theory of the different parts of nature, when the
                    Hebrews, in the books of Moses, cited by one of those ancient historians who
                    copied the chronicles,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    with it, a summary of the traditions of fifteen centuries of continuous history.
                    These books composed the first collection of the Hebrews; but subsequently this
                    people, like most others, had their archives. Those which Herod caused to be
                    burned, with the intention of destroying the monuments of the ancient families,
                    appear to have reached as far back as the very origin of the nation.<note

                    he consigned the public records to the flames, those of individuals were beyond
                    his power, and afterwards served to re-establish the history of this subjugated
                    people. There also existed libraries, properly so called, in Judaea. One in
                    particular is supposed to have been attached to, if not kept in, the temple of
                    Jerusalem, and the Hebrew authors speak of “the multitude of books an expression
                    which seems to imply that the collection was not confined to the sacred books
                    alone, but included others, relating probably to the laws and institutions of
                    Moses, and the history of the Jewish nation. The books, particularly those of
                    history, had indeed become so numerous, that Judas Maccabeus caused extracts to

                    prophets, the compositions of David, the letters of the Hebrew kings, and the
                    records of offerings. As the Jews dwelt alone, and were not reckoned amongst the
                    nations, we know nothing of their early literature, beyond the books which are
                    contained in the Old Testament. It has been supposed, however, that they had
                    some cities celebrated on account of the sciences which were there cultivated.

                    other academies of the same description were furnished with libraries.<note

                <p>Scripture also mentions a library of the kings of Persia, which some suppose to
                    have consisted of the historians of that nation, and of memoirs on the affairs
                    of state, but which appears rather to have been a depository of the laws,
                    charters, and ordinances of the Persian kings. In the Hebrew text it is stated
                    that a search was made “in the house of the <hi rend="italic">rolls,</hi> where
                    the <hi rend="italic">treasures</hi> were laid up in Babylon,” for a decree
                    issued by Cyrus ordaining <hi rend="italic">a</hi> temple to be built at
                    Jerusalem; the ordinance sought for, however, was found, not in Babylon, but at
                    Acmetha, in Media.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ezra,
                    chap. v. verse 17; and vi. 1, 2∙</p></note> It appears that “the house of the
                    rolls” was not a library belonging to the Persians, but a collection of the
                    records or archives of the kingdom. There was formerly a considerable library at
                    Susa, the residence of the Persian sovereigns, where Metasthenes consulted the
                    annals of the Persian monarchy, in search of materials for his history. This
                    library is mentioned by Diodorus Siculus; but, like that referred to by Ezra, it
                    seems rather to have been a collection of laws and records, than an assemblage
                    of books on science or learning.</p>
                <p>Amongst the Greeks, as amongst other nations, the first libraries consisted
                    merely of archives, deposited, for the sake of preservation, in the temples of
                    the gods. The sacred books, of which mention is made by Dionysius of
                    Halicarnassus, under the denomination of Deltoids, were of this description.
                    Amongst the most ancient people of Greece these archives comprehended also the
                    genealogies of the royal families; the successions of the priesthood, which
                    served to fix historical epochs; and the titles of public property, engraved,
                    according to their importance, on marble and on brass. Tacitus attests the
                    existence of one of these titles, which was dated twelve hundred years before
                    his time, and the authenticity of which was recognised by the senate in the time
                    of Tiberius.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Auditae

                    even the circumstances invented in the fictions of mythology, which criticism
                    soon learned to discriminate and to separate from the actual facts.<note

                    that nation before those events. The Lacedaemonians had no books; amongst them
                    writing was considered as a superfluous accomplishment. At Athens, on the
                    contrary, the sciences and literature were diligently cultivated.</p>
                <p>Pisistratus the tyrant was the first who established a public library in that
                    city, though Strabo ascribes to Aristotle the honour of having rendered this
                    important service<pb break="no" facs="nls:193205167"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-5167-0288"/> to his countrymen. In this library he deposited
                    the works of Homer, which he had collected with great difficulty, and at a very
                    considerable expense; and the Athenians themselves were at great pains to
                    increase the collection. The fortunes of this library were various and singular.
                    It was transported to Persia by Xerxes; brought back by Seleucus Nicator;
                    plundered by Sylla; and at last restored by the Emperor Hadrian. On the invasion
                    of the Roman empire by the Goths <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 260), Greece
                    was ravaged; and in the sack of Athens they had collected all the libraries, and
                    were upon the point of setting fire to this funeral pile of ancient learning,
                    when one of their chiefs interposing, dissuaded them from the design, observing
                    at the same time, that as long as the Greeks were addicted to the study of
                    books, they would never apply themselves to that of arms.</p>
                <p>Next to the Alexandrian Library, that of Pergamus was the most conspicuous, and,
                    according to Plutarch, contained 200,000 volumes. It was founded and
                    successively enriched by the kings of Pergamus called Eumenes, all of whom were
                    zealous promoters of the arts, and to one of whom we are indebted for the
                    invention of parchment <hi rend="italic">(charta Pergamena).</hi> Attalus
                    surpassed all his predecessors in magnificence, and after their example devoted
                    part of his treasures to the purchase of the principal works or writings of his
                    age. As already noticed, the Pergamean library was presented by Antony to
                    Cleopatra, in order to form the foundation of a new library at Alexandria.
                    Vitruvius makes honourable mention of both these libraries.<note anchored="true"

                    other collections of less magnitude, amongst which has been mentioned that of
                    Tyran-nion, a grammarian contemporary with Pompey, which is said to have
                    contained about 30,000 volumes.</p>
                <p>These particulars, scanty as they may no doubt seem, are nevertheless sufficient
                    to show that the libraries of Greece, in ancient times, were both numerous and
                    extensive. But a question of much more immediate interest here presents itself,
                    viz. as to whether any of the treasures with which they were enriched still
                    remain undiscovered, and where these may be supposed most likely to be found. On
                    this subject various conjectures have been formed, particularly in regard to the
                    remains of the ancient Greek historians. It is well known that many manuscripts
                    had been collected at a vast expense in Greece for the library of Buda, which
                    was destroyed by the Turks in the year 1526. In this library Alexander
                    Brassicanus had seen the whole of the <hi rend="italic">Hyperides</hi> with <hi
                    rend="italic">scholia,</hi> the works of many of the Greek fathers, and also
                    those of the classical writers. From it issued parts of Polybius and of Diodorus
                    Siculus. A manuscript of Heliodorus, from which was afterwards printed the first
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Aethiopica,</hi> likewise belonged to it,
                    having been found by a soldier, who carried it to Vincentius Obsopaeus. Neander,
                    speaking of this collection, says, “Ex media Graecia inaestimandis sumptibus
                    emerat Matthias Corvinus rex.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Constantinople and Athos have contributed the greater number of the manuscripts
                    which are still extant in different parts of Europe. Until a comparatively
                    recent period there were monasteries full of learned men at Byzantium, and every
                    monastery had its library. The Turks, on their conquest of Constantinople, did
                    not indulge m that indiscriminate destruction which has sometimes been imputed
                    to them. Mahommed II. secured the library of the Greek emperors, which his
                    successors preserved until it was destroyed by Amurath IV. At Byzantium,
                    Constantine Lascaris transcribed many of the works which were afterwards
                    conveyed to the Royal Library at Madrid; and in this city were procured those
                    manuscripts which, having been presented to Hurtado de Mendoza by Solyman II.,
                    were left by the former to the library of the Escorial. Possevin has given
                    partial catalogues of some of the libraries at Constantinople; and an early
                    traveller, who visited that city in the year 1597, mentions a valuable
                    collection which he had seen there, though without specifying its contents. With
                    respect to Athos, it appears that there were deposited in one library alone, two
                    hundred manuscripts originally obtained from the monasteries upon the mountain;
                    and a great part of those formerly at Moscow had been collected by the monk
                    Arsenius, in Athos, at the suggestion of the patriarch Nico. Thessaly, Chios,
                    Corfu, Crete, Cyprus, Chalce,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Rhodes, and Epidauria, may also be mentioned as places which, at different
                    times, have supplied manuscripts.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    days at Triccala for the express purpose of copying a Greek manuscript belonging
                    to a monastery. But having been attacked by fever at the foot of Mount Olympus,
                    he remained ten days without medical assistance, after which he was taken to
                    Salonica, where he died in July 177θ∙ Since his death, no one appears to have
                    resumed the search which he had so diligently pursued.</p></note></p>
                <p>Mr Walpole is of opinion, that notwithstanding the acquisitions which have
                    already been made, researches in the Levant should not be intermitted. By these
                    many manuscripts may still, according to him, be rescued from destruction. No
                    care whatever appears to have been taken to preserve them. Dr Covell mentions
                    having seen, in the monasteries of Mount Athos and elsewhere, vast heaps of
                    manuscripts of the Fathers, and other learned authors, all covered over with
                    dust and dirt, many of them rotten and spoiled, and never in any instance placed
                    upon shelves or arranged in good order. Mr Walpole also thinks that an inquiry
                    should be made into the truth of what was stated to Hemsterhusius by some
                    Greeks, viz. that part of the comedies of Menander was still extant.
                    “Application,” says he, “might be made to the Greek nobles of the Phanar, many
                    of whom are versed in ancient Greek, and probably the possessors of some
                    valuable manuscripts. Parts of the first book of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Demonstratio</hi><hi rend="italic">Evangeliea</hi> of Eusebius were printed by
                    Fabricius, from a manuscript belonging to Prince Mavrocordato; and a copy of the
                    Greek Orators, now in England, was once the property of a Greek noble.” This,
                    however, is, we fear, much too sanguine. It is probable that many Greek
                    manuscripts have experienced the treatment which works of the same sort have met
                    with in other countries. Poggius, whilst at the council of Constance, found a
                    manuscript of Quintilian upon the table of a pickling shop. Masson met with one
                    of Ago-bardus in the hands of a bookbinder, who was preparing to use it for the
                    back of a book; and one of Asconius was about to be employed for the same
                    purpose. In the roof of a Benedictin monastery, Musculus discovered some of the
                    works of Cicero, and the whole of Ovid. Numbersŉf manuscripts in Greece are
                    irrecoverably. lost, either by design or accident,“by the casualties of war or
                    the havoc of revolution; and of those which may hereafter be met with, it can
                    scarcely be supposed that almost any will prove to be of much value, or of any
                    great antiquity.</p>

                <p>A list of the theological manuscripts in the library of Patmos has been given by
                    Possevin; and another, copied by the Marquis of Sligo, has been published by Mr
                    Walpole. The actual catalogue contains the titles of ninety-two manuscripts, and
                    about 400 printed volumes; but the Greek compiler has not stated any
                    circumstance relating to the manuscripts by which an estimate of their value may
                    be formed. He gives no information concerning the form of the letters or that of
                    the spirits, or upon any of those subjects by which a knowledge of their
                    respective dates might be obtained. But there is one manuscript mentioned in the
                    catalogue, in regard to which it is impossible not to feel more than ordinary
                    curiosity. We allude to a manuscript of Diodorus Siculus, an accurate inspection
                    of which would probably determine whether the hopes which were oftener than once
                    entertained, of recovering the lost books of that historian, were in this
                    instance also to be disappointed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    destruction have, in general, been either of comparatively modern date or of but
                    little consequence. Neither the inquiries which have been extended to the
                    African states, nor the excavations and researches made at Herculanum and
                    Pompeii, have recovered the lost historians, or indeed brought to light ιny

                    February 1832, by Professor Ehiersch of Munich, gives some interesting
                    information respecting the library of that celebrated island. “We left Geronta
                    on .he 23d February,” says he, “and reached this island, after experiencing the
                    fury of a violent storm. The town is situated upon he summit of a mountain in
                    the rear of the harbour, and, rising above it like a citadel, stands the
                    monastery of John the Baptist.” ÍLfter the travellers had dried themselves in a
                    storehouse at the harbour, they proceeded to pay their respects to the Hegumenos
                    of he monastery, and the patriarch of Alexandria, who was upon a visit to his
                    birth-place, Patmos; and Thiersch and his companions met hearty welcome under
                    the prelate’s roof, and were received in the far-famed library of the fraternity
                    of monks, which was their rincipal inducement to visit the island; but, as far
                    as manuscripts connected with ancient literature were concerned, they found one
                    of striking importance. A codex of Diodorus Siculus, extending from the eleventh
                    to the eighteenth book, contained nothing ut what has appeared in print; and the
                    readings, so far as Thiersch had an opportunity of investigating them, were not
                    of much iterest. lie attached greater value to a manuscript of Paulus Aegineta,
                    which is of the ninth or tenth century, and upon a care-ιιl examination of which
                    he expresses a confident opinion, that valuable emendations may in consequence
                    be made on the text of ⅛ineta’s work. The library contains enough in grammatical
                    treatises, glossaries, lexicos, and scholia, to afford employment to a oung
                    philologist for six months at least; and it is particularly rich in ancient
                    manuscripts of the Bible, amongst which are a Greek þanuscript of the book of
                    Job, another of two of the Gospels with commentaries, a third exhibiting the
                    musical characters of the h ’ eek church, and others containing the works of
                    some of its fathers. As these are considered in the light of sacred relics, none
                    of ,hem have been injured, and they are in a respectable state of preservation.
                    But the heathen manuscripts, on the contrary, he altered about and cut to
                    pieces; whilst those on cotton paper, having been severely treated by the moths,
                    were, in the course of I he last century, thrown by the monks into the oven
                    which they used for baking their bread; an act of literary sacrilege for which

                    >Herculaneum.)</hi> Rome was still in its infancy when the archives of the
                    Etruscans contained a continuous collection of public acts, and particularly an
                    uninterrupted series of births and deaths, that enabled that people to fix the
                    unequal duration of the eight centuries of their previous history, which hey
                    reckoned up to about the middle of the sixth century before Christ. The details
                    given by Censorinus in Varro, prove that the Etruscans kept regular registers of
                    births and deaths, from the epoch of their first establishment in Italy, which
                    Larcher refers to the year 1344 before Christ; that, the eighth century
                    thereafter, to which lie Etruscan histories were written, must have been the
                    sixth before the Christian era, in which other histories appeared that arc no
                    longer extant; and that, during these eight hundred years, the most extended
                    term of human life was nearly the same as at the present day. In the works of
                    Dionysius of Halicarnassus, of Plutarch, and other ancient authors, we also
                    discover scattered glimpses of the history of Italy in the most remote times,
                    and learn that the tribes or races by whom the Etruscans were surrounded had
                    also their historical archives. It may even be supposed that the Romans, in
                    causing their Capitoline marbles to be engraved, followed, amongst others, the
                    example of Praeneste; a city much more ancient than Rome, and which had long
                    continued the practice of classifying as well as engraving its municipal
                    records. Such were the sources consulted by several historians who treated of
                    the antiquities of different Italian nations, particularly Zenodotus of
                    Troezene, who composed a history of the Ombrians.</p>
                <p>If the ancient Greeks had but few books, the ancient Romans possessed still
                    fewer. Incessantly occupied in military expeditions, defensive wars, and the
                    aggrandisement of their empire, that warlike people had no leisure, and,
                    probably, as little inclination, to cultivate letters. It was not until they had
                    subdued Magna Graecia that they began to emerge out of barbarism, nor until they
                    had accomplished the conquest of Greece itself, that a taste for the arts,
                    sciences, and books was diffused amongst them. They became civilized by frequent
                    contact and familiarity with civilization. The immediate consequence of the
                    conquest of Greece was a more frequent intercourse with the Greeks, at once
                    their subjects and their masters; and in proportion as they became acquainted
                    with the literature and arts of that refined people, the asperity of character
                    and manners which had distinguished this nation of conquerors began to
                    disappear.</p>
                <p>The first library established at Rome was that founded by Paulus Aemilius, <hi

                    enriched the city of Rome with the library of this conquered monarch, which was
                    subsequently augmented by Sylla.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    terminated the first war against Mithridates, Sylla visited Athens, whence he
                    took with him the library of Apellicon the Teian, in which were the works of
                    Aristotle and Theophrastus. Lucullus, another conqueror of Mithridates, was not
                    less distinguished by his taste for books. The number of volumes in his library
                    was immense; and they were written in the most distinct and elegant manner
                    possible. But the use which he made of his collection was still more honourable
                    to that princely Roman than the acquisition or possession of it. His library was
                    open to all; and the Greeks, who visited Rome, resorted to the galleries and
                    portico of Lucullus as to the retreat of the Muses, where they spent <pb

                    conversation on literary subjects. But although both Sylla and Lucullus
                    liberally gave public access to their literary treasures, still their libraries
                    can, in strictness, be considered as only <hi rend="italic">private</hi>
                    collections. Amongst the various projects which Julius Caesar had formed for the
                    embellishment of Rome was that of a <hi rend="italic">public</hi> library, which
                    should contain the largest possible collection of Greek and Latin works; and he
                    had assigned to Varro the duty of selecting and arranging them; but this design
                    was frustrated by the assassination of the dictator, and the establishment of
                    public libraries did not take place until the reign of Augustus.</p>
                <p>The honour of suggesting these valuable institutions is ascribed by the elder
                    Pliny<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Qui primus <hi

                    (Plin. <hi rend="italic">Hist. Nat.</hi> lib. xxxv. c∙ 2.) Ovid also ascribes
                    this honour to Pollio. <hi rend="italic">{Tristia,</hi> lib. iii. el.

                    Liberty on the Aventine Hill. Augustus, amongst other embellishments which he
                    bestowed upon Rome, erected two public libraries, viz. the Octavian and the
                    Palatine. The Octavian Library, which was thus denominated in honour of the
                    emperor’s sister, stood in the porticoof Octavia; and the charge of it was
                    committed to Melissus, who had been manumitted by Augustus. The Palatine Library
                    was added by Augustus to the temple of Apollo, which he had erected on the site
                    of that part of the Palatine House which had been struck by lightning. There
                    were deposited the corrected books of the Sybils; and, from two ancient
                    inscriptions quoted by Lipsius and Pitiscus, it would seem that it consisted of
                    two distinct collections, one Greek and the other Latin. This library having
                    survived the various revolutions of the Roman empire, existed until the time of
                    Gregory the Great, whose mistaken zeal led him to order all the writings of the
                    ancients to be destroyed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    The successors of Augustus, though they did not equally encourage learning, were
                    not altogether neglectful of its interests. Suetonius informs us that Tiberius
                    founded a library in the new temple of Apollo; and we learn from some incidental
                    notices, that he instituted another in his own house, called the Tiberian
                    Library. Vespasian, following the example of his predecessors, established a
                    library in the Temple of Peace, which he erected after the burning of the city
                    by order of Nero; and even Domitian, in the commencement of his reign, restored
                    at great expense the libraries which had been destroyed by the conflagration,
                    collecting copies of books from every quarter, and sending persons to Alexandria
                    to transcribe volumes in that celebrated collection, or to correct copies which
                    had been made elsewhere. Various writers have asserted that there was a library
                    attached to the Temple of the Capitol; but they have not informed us by whom it
                    was founded. Lipsius ascribes it to Domitian, whilst Donatus refers it to the
                    Emperor Hadrian, by whom it was at least enlarged, if not founded, and who
                    probably erected the Tiburtine Library, at Tibur, in the vicinity of Rome.<note

                    sovereigns of imperial Rome was that of the Emperor Ulpius Trajanus, from whom
                    it was denominated the Ulpian Library. It was erected in Trajan’s Forum, but
                    afterwards removed to the Viminal Hill, to ornament the baths of Diocletian. In
                    this library were deposited the elephantine books, written upon tablets of
                    ivory, wherein were recorded the transactions of the emperors, the proceedings
                    of the senate and Roman magistrates, and the affairs of the provinces. It has
                    been conjectured that the Ulpian Library consisted of both Greek and Latin
                    works; and some authors affirm that Trajan commanded all the books which could
                    be found in the cities he had conquered to be immediately conveyed to Rome, in
                    order to increase his collection. The library of Domitian having been consumed
                    by lightning, in the reign of Commodus, was not restored until the time of
                    Gordian who rebuilt the edifice, and founded a new library, adding thereto the
                    collection of books bequeathed to him by Quintus Serenus Samonicus, the
                    physician, amounting, it is said, to no less than 72,000 volumes. Donatus
                    conjectures that this library was deposited in the palace of Pompey.<note

                <p>In addition to the imperial libraries, there were others to which the public had
                    access in the principal cities and colonies of the empire. Pliny mentions a
                    public library which he had founded for the use of his countrymen; and Vopiscus
                    informs us that the Emperor Tacitus caused the historical writings of his
                    illustrious namesake to be deposited in the libraries. The number of calcined
                    volumes, which have been excavated from the ruins of Herculanum and Pompeii
                    would also seem to indicate that collections of hooks were common in those
                    cities. (See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Herculaneum).</hi> But the
                    irruptions of the barbarians who overran and desolated the western empire proved
                    more destructive to the interests of literature than either volcanoes or
                    earthquakes, and soon caused the disappearance of those libraries which, during
                    several centuries, had been multiplied in Italy. The libraries of the East,
                    however, escaped this devastating torrent; and both Alexandria and
                    Constantinople preserved their literary treasures, until the capture of those
                    cities by the Saracens and the Turks, who finally subverted the Roman empire in
                    the East.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hartwell.

                <p>When Constantine the Great <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. d.</hi> 336) made Byzantium
                    the seat of his empire, he decorated that city with splendid edifices, and
                    called it after his own name. Desirous to make reparation to the Christians for
                    the injuries they had suffered during the reign of his predecessor, he commanded
                    the most diligent search to be made after those books which Diocletian had
                    doomed to destruction; he caused transcripts to be made of such as had escaped
                    the fury of the Pagan persecutor; and, having collected others from various
                    quarters, he formed the whole into a library at Constantinople. On the death of
                    Constantine, however, the number of books in the imperial library was only 6900;
                    but it was successively enlarged by the Emperors Julian and Theodosius the
                    younger, who augmented it to 120,000 volumes. Of these, more than half were
                    burned, in the seventh century, by the command of the Emperor Leo III. who thus
                    sought to destroy all the monuments that might be quoted in proof respecting his
                    opposition to the worship of images. In this library was deposited the only
                    authentic copy of the Council of Nice; and it is also said to have contained the
                    poems of Homer, written in gold letters, together with a magnificent copy of the
                    Four Gospels, bound in plates of gold, enriched with precious stones; all of
                    which were consumed in the conflagration. The convulsions which distracted the
                    lower empire were by no. means favourable to the interests of literature. In the
                    eleventh century learning flourished for a short time during the reign of
                    Constantine Porphyrogennetus; and this emperor is said to have employed many <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193205206" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5206-0291"/> learned Greeks in
                    collecting books, and forming a library, the arrangement of which he himself
                    superintended. But the final subversion of the eastern empire, and the capture
                    of Constantinople in 1453, dispersed the literati of Greece over western Europe,
                    and placed the literary remains of that capital at the mercy of the conqueror.
                    The imperial library, however, was preserved by the express command of Mohammed,
                    and continued, it is said, to be kept in some apartments of the Seraglio; but
                    whether it was sacrificed in a fit of devotion by Amurath IV. as is commonly
                    supposed, or whether it was suffered to fall into decay from ignorance and
                    neglect, it is now certain that the library of the Sultan contains only Turkish
                    and Arabic writings, and not one Greek or Latin manuscript of any
                    importance.</p>
                <p>Upon the whole, it appears that books were abundant, both at Rome and at
                    Constantinople, and that learned men in Those cities had at their command
                    greater resources than might at first be supposed. Some idea of the quantity of
                    books accessible to persons of study and research may be formed from the great
                    number of references and citations to be found in the works of some authors,
                    particularly in those of Strabo, Pliny, and some others.</p>
                <p>II.—LIBRARIES OF THE MIDDLE AGES.</p>
                <p>General epithets and figurative expressions frequently convey a meaning which is
                    calculated to mislead. Hearing constantly of “the dark ages,” “the period of
                    intellectual night,” and “the season of winter in the history of man,” we are
                    apt to imagine that, during the time thus designated, the human mind was utterly
                    palsied, and all learning extinct. But in fact, throughout that period, reason,
                    though misdirected, was not asleep; philosophy was rather bewildered than inert;
                    and learning was immured, but not lost. In no part of that long period which
                    extends from the reign of the Emperor Justinian, when Greek and Roman literature

                    revival of learning in the fifteenth century, do we entirely lose the traces
                    even of the classic authors, much less of sacred literature; for in each
                    intervening age, and in every quarter of Europe, there were writers whose works,
                    being still extant, afford abundant evidence of their acquaintance with most of
                    the principal authors of more remote times.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the west sunk under the overwhelming pressure of barbarian invasion, those
                    institutions which hadbeen founded and nurtured in the midst of civilization,
                    were, no doubt, swept away by the torrent which desolated Italy, and spread its
                    ravages over all parts of the empire. But learning, though expelled from her
                    ancient establishments, and forced from her favourite haunts, found a safe
                    asylum in the monasteries, which, amidst all the violence and anarchy that
                    reigned without, remained in undisturbed tranquillity, respected even by the
                    barbarians who had overthrown an empire.</p>
                <p>It is doubtless true that little comparatively is recorded of the libraries of
                    those ages which intervened between the fall of the Roman empire and the revival
                    of letters in Europe about the middle of the fifteenth century. But, as we shall
                    immediately have occasion to show, every age produced learned and inquisitive
                    men, by whom books were highly prized, and industriously collected. Cassiodorus,
                    minister of Theodore, king of the Goths, retired to a monastery which he had
                    built, and there founded a library for the use of the monks, about the middle of
                    the sixth century. At a later period, Charlemagne, distinguished as a patron of
                    learning, instituted, near Lyons, a library, which, according to the statements
                    of historians, contained books bound in a magnificent manner. After this the
                    monasteries almost exclusively possessed libraries, which were increased by the
                    accessions of centuries; and had the zeal of religious reformation been as
                    little destructive to learning as the invasions of the northern barbarians,
                    numberless monuments of ancient learning which are now irrecoverably lost might
                    have been in the hands of every scholar.</p>
                <p>The monastic institutions seemed as if framed for the special purpose of
                    transmitting the remains of ancient literature, sacred and profane, through a
                    period in which, except for so extraordinary a provision, they must inevitably
                    have perished. Though there were considerable diversities in the rules and
                    practices of the different orders of monks, the elements of the monastic life
                    were in all orders and in every country the same; and, generally speaking,
                    wherever there was a monastery there was also a manufacture of books. The
                    transcription of ancient works, the only mode in which, anterior to the
                    invention of printing, they could be multiplied and preserved, was a favourite
                    employment among the inmates of these peaceful retreats; and an opinion of
                    meritoriousness attached to the labour, served to animate the diligence, and to
                    encourage the perseverance, of the labourer.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    finished in the year 948; may the Lord think upon him !” Such is the
                    subscription of many of the manuscripts of the middle ages; and to us, we
                    confess, there is something almost affecting in iţs pious simplicity.</p></note>
                    If in some monasteries the monks employed themselves in transcribing nothing but
                    missals, legends, and romances, others enriched their libraries with splendid
                    copies of the works of the fathers of the church, and of the Holy Scriptures;
                    and not a few laboured to reproduce such of the classical authors as they were
                    acquainted with or could obtain access to. This system of transcription, to
                    which alone we arc indebted for all that remains of ancient learning, was
                    carried on to an extent of which those who are unacquainted with the history of
                    the middle ages can form no conception. We have already had occasion to advert
                    to the occupation of the inmates of the monastic establishments on Mount Athos,
                    the lofty promontory which stretches from the Macedonian coast far into the
                    Aegean Sea; and we have also noticed the immense number of manuscripts which
                    have at different times issued from these establishments. Many manuscripts still
                    extant prove that the copying of books was likewise practised to a great extent
                    during the middle ages, in the monasteries of the Morea, and in those of Euboea
                    (Negropont), and of Crete (Candia). The latter island seems indeed to have been
                    a place of refuge for learned men during the disastrous period which preceded
                    the fall of the eastern empire; in its monasteries they found an asylum and the
                    means of subsistence. In Calabria and the kingdom of Naples, fifty religious
                    establishments have been mentioned, from which proceeded a large number of the
                    books afterwards collected in the libraries of Rome, Florence, Venice, and
                    Milan.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Taylor, <hi

                    of the British islands, the same system of transcription was carried on. Books
                    were multiplied, and, by their multiplication, preserved, whilst the knowledge
                    of their contents was extended. In a word, it is mainly to the labours of these
                    establishments, that we are indebted for the remains of the classic authors, and
                    the preservation of the sacred books, which they so carefully transcribed.</p>

                <p>Under the impression produced by certain loose modes of speaking in relation to
                    the deep and universal ignorance which is said to have prevailed in Europe
                    during seven centuries, the existence of a large number of manuscripts of the
                    classical authors, executed during those very ages, presents a great apparent
                    difficulty. From what motive, it may be asked, or for whose use, were these
                    works transcribed so frequently as to be found in all parts of Europe on the
                    revival of learning? Was this an employment which ignorance would have selected,
                    or which ignorance could have encouraged and promoted? A rapid survey of those
                    ages of darkness, as they are called, will to some extent furnish a solution of
                    the difficulty, by proving that, during these times of general intellectual
                    lethargy, there were not a few individuals who cultivated letters with ardour,
                    and to whom the preservation of books was a matter of the most lively interest.
                    The names which we are about to mention bear but a small proportion to the total
                    number which might be produced, it being sufficient for our purpose to refer to
                    one or two writers in each century; but brief as our exposition must necessarily
                    be, it will nevertheless serve to show that learning was not then comp'ete-ly
                    abandoned to neglect and oblivion.</p>
                <p>The sixth century abounds with writers in all departments of literature, many of
                    whose works, having descended to modern timcs, afford evidence of the
                    undiminished diffusion of general learning. Amongst these may be mentioned
                    Procopius, the historian; Agathias, his continuator; Boethius, author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Consolation of Philosophy;</hi> FIcsychius, the lexicorapher;
                    Proclus, a Platonic philosopher; Fulgentius and Cassiodorus, ecclesiastical
                    writers; Priscian, the grammarian; Gildas, an Anglo-Saxon historian; Evagrius
                    Scholasticus, an ecclesiastical historian; Simplicius, the commentator of
                    Aristotle and Epictetus; Ammianus Marcellinus, a critic and historian whose
                    works contain very copious references to ancient literature; and Stephen of
                    Byzantium, a grammarian and geographer. The seventh century produced fewer
                    writers than perhaps any other period of equal extent within the compass of
                    history. The only names deserving to be mentioned are those of Theopbylact of
                    Simocatta, who wrote a history of the Emperor Mauritius; and Isidore, an
                    ecclesiastical writer.</p>
                <p>In the latter part of the seventh and beginning of the eighth century flourished
                    the Venerable Bede, whose writings afford a proof of the general diffusion of
                    books of all classes in that age. Bede displays extensive if not profound
                    learning, the whole of which he had acquired from the sources ordinarily
                    accessible to monastic students. He was a poet, a rhetorician, an arithmetician,
                    a chronologist, a geographer, a philosopher, and an historian;<note

                    fountains, that is, from the principal Greek and Latin authors. Even during his
                    life, and whilst he still continued to write, his works were, by the ordinance

                <p>Haban Maurus, a disciple of Alcuin, taught theology, philosophy, poetry, and
                    rhetoric, at Paris, in the school established there by the Anglo-Saxon monks.
                    According to Trithemius, he was well versed in the Holy Scriptures, and
                    thoroughly learned in profane literature. He enriched the monastery of Fulda, on
                    the Rhine, with a large collection of books; founded a school there; and trained
                    in every branch of learning two hundred and seventy monks belonging to the
                    establishment. He was created archbishop of Mayence in 847, and died in 856. One
                    of the first professors in the university of Oxford was John Scot, a man of
                    considerable acquirements. He afterwards went to France, where he translated
                    some Greek authors into Latin, but so literally that his versions were almost
                    unintelligible. His writings display various learning; but they were condemned
                    as heretical by the church, on account of his opinions relative to the
                    eucharist. Being forced to leave France, he took refuge in an English monastery,
                    which, however, afforded him no asylum. At the instigation of the monks, he was,
                    like Cassianus, killed by his scholars, with their iron styles. Contemporary
                    with Scot was Photius, with whom no author of that, or of several succeeding
                    ages, can be compared. Educated for secular employments, and for some time
                    engaged in the service of Michael III., he was by that emperor forcibly invested
                    with the dignity of patriarch of Constantinople (856), in the room of Ignatius;
                    and, that he might pass regularly to this office, he was made monk, reader,
                    sub-deacon, deacon, priest, and patriarch, all in the course of six days. From
                    the office thus violently thrust upon him he was expelled by Basilius, the
                    successor of Michael; but, at the head of a band of soldiers, he repossessed
                    himself of the patriarchate, of which, however, he was at length finally <hi

                    a monastery, where he ended his days. Before his elevation he had composed the

                    and extracts, contains accounts of more than two hundred and seventy works,

                <p>Though of the existing manuscripts so large a number were executed in the tenth
                    century, as to prove that, in the reproduction of books, great activity
                    prevailed in that age, yet it presents the names of but few authors whose works
                    have descended to modern times. Eutychius, patriarch of Alexandria, wrote an
                    universal history which is still∙cxtant, and, though crowded with fabulous
                    narratives, displays considerable learning.</p>
                <p>The eleventh century is much richer in distinguished names. Avicenna, an Arabian
                    physician, reduced the science of medicine to a systematic form, including
                    almost every thing that had been written on the subject by his predecessors, and
                    was, besides, well versed in Greek literature. Michael Psellus, a Greek
                    physician, wrote upon subjects of all kinds, and was celebrated for the extent
                    of his acquirements both in sacred and in profane <pb break="no"

                    Italian, created archbishop of Canterbury by William the Norman, promoted
                    learning amongst the clergy, and was esteemed accomplished in the literature of
                    his age. Anselm, the disciple and successor of Lanfranco, was also in repute for
                    general learning. The works of Suidas, like those of Photius, contain a treasure
                    of various learning upon points of criticism and literary history; whilst his
                    lexico, besides the definitions of words, includes accounts of ancient authors,
                    and quotations from works which have since perished. Sigibert, a monk of
                    Brabant, has left a chronicle of events from the year 381 to his own time, and a
                    work containing lives of illustrious men; he was, besides, profoundly versed in
                    the Scriptures, and inferior .to none of his countrymen in general learning.</p>
                <p>The name of Anna Comnena distinguishes the early portion of the twelfth century.
                    She wrote a history of the reign of her father, the Emperor Alexius Conmenus; a
                    work which displays a masculine understanding, and an extensive acquaintance
                    with literature and the sciences. During this century England produced several
                    eminent writers, particularly William of Malmesbury, Geoffrey of Monmouth,

                    Eustathius, archbishop of Thessalonica, flourished towards the close of the
                    twelfth century. His commentaries on Homer, besides serving to elucidate the
                    Greek language by important criticisms, contain innumerable references to the
                    Greek classics, and thus furnish the means of ascertaining the integrity and
                    genuineness of the text of those authors, as it has descended to our times. John
                    and Isaac Tzetzes, critics and grammarians of Constantinople, are still

                    works an acquaintance with ancient learning,anda familiar knowledge of the
                    antiquities of his native country. He vigorously opposed the papal usurpations
                    in England; and his reputation for learning <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> and
                    virtue enabled him to effect a considerable reformation in many of the English
                    monasteries. He died in the year 1259. The works of Albert, surnamed the Great,
                    a Dominican friar, and afterwards (in 1260) bishop of Ratisbon, fill twenty-one
                    volumes, forming a sort of encyclopaedia of the learning and science of the age.
                    Like Roger Baeon, Albert of Ratisbon incurred amongst his contemporaries the
                    suspicion of dealing in magic. Learning, in the more restricted sense of the
                    term,, that is, the knowledge of books, was too common to excite wonder or envy;
                    but science, or a knowledge of nature, acquired by experimental investigation,
                    was so rare, that it seldom failed to engender both, and to occasion perilous
                    accusations of a correspondence with infernal agents.</p>
                <p>The revival of learning is usually reckoned to have commenced in the fifteenth
                    century; but even in the fourteenth a decided advancement in almost every
                    department of literature is discernible. Gross and degrading <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> gnorance was wearing away from the bulk of the
                    community in several parts of Europe; the educated classes were acquiring a
                    better taste and more expanded views; and a general awakening of the energies of
                    the human mind was perceptible. This needs no other evidence than is afforded by
                    the works of Dante, Petrarch, Boccacio, Chaucer, and Gower, which were not
                    merely produced in that period, but extensively read and admired. During no part
                    of that long tract of time which extends from the decline of learning in the
                    sixth century till its revival in the fifteenth, had there been a total
                    extinction of the knowledge of ancient literature; and those inestimable
                    treasures which the religious houses had saved from the ravages of revolution,
                    anarchy, and barbarism, now began to be drawn forth and studied. The continuance
                    of the eastern empire till the middle of the fifteenth century, afforded an
                    uninterrupted protection to Greek learning during those periods when western
                    Europe was laid waste by the Gothic nations; and hence, on the revival of
                    letters, the study of the Greek authors first engaged the attention of those
                    individuals whom an awakening impulse now directed to the cultivation of
                    learning. But that <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the kindred authors of Rome soon
                    followed; and the monuments of ancient wisdom and genius which had been
                    preserved in the monasteries, furnished ample materials for laying the
                    foundations of a new and more extensive, if not more perfect, edifice of
                    civilization.</p>
                <p>More than half a century before the taking of Constantinople by the Turks, the
                    learned men of the imperial city, apprehending the approaching ruin of the
                    empire, began to emigrate into Italy, where they opened schools, and became the
                    preceptors of princes, as well as the guides of the public taste, which they
                    directed towards the study of the classical writers of Greece and Rome. The fall
                    of Constantinople, in 1453, filled the Italian cities with these learned
                    strangers. At this period the Italians required only to receive some kind of
                    direction, and to be provided with the means of study. They had for some time
                    been placed in those peculiar circumstances which have almost always proved
                    favourable to the advancement of the human mind. A number of independent states
                    were crowded upon a narrow space, throughout which the same language,
                    diversified by dialects, prevailed, exhibiting, in a sort of reflected or
                    secondary form, that of ancient Italy'. The energy’, rivalry, and munificence
                    which accompany commerce, kept the whole mass of society in movement; whilst the
                    influence of a religion, which seeks to recommend itself by every embellishment
                    that the genius of man can devise or execute, overruled the debasing tendency of
                    successful trade, and directed the ambition of princely merchants towards
                    objects more refined and intellectual than those which wealth usually selects as
                    the means of distinction.</p>
                <p>The formation of libraries, suggested or favoured by the mportation of
                    manuscripts from Constantinople, proved the means not only of making more widely
                    known the works of the Greek authors (which had never fallen into oblivion), but
                    of prompting those researches which issued in the recovery of the Latin writers,
                    many of whom had long been forgotten. The appetite for books being thus revived
                    and quickened, neither labour nor expense was spared in accumulating them;
                    learned men were despatched in all directions throughout Europe, Western Asia,
                    and Africa, to collect manuscripts; and, in the course of a few years, most of
                    the authors now known were brought together in the libraries of Rome, Naples,
                    Venice, Florence, Vienna, and Paris. Aided by the munificence of princes and
                    popes, the scholars of the fifteenth century applied themselves to the
                    discovery, restoration, and publication of the remains of Greek and Roman
                    literature; and, in the course of sixty or eighty years, most of the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193205245" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5245-0294"/> works now known
                    were committed to the press. Since that time additional discoveries have been
                    made; but the principal improvements of a subsequent date have consisted in the
                    emendation of the text of ancient authors, partly by a more extensive collation
                    of manuscripts than the first editors possessed the means of instituting, and
                    partly also by the lights and aids of a cautious and judicious criticism.<note

                <p>The invention of printing, by virtually exempting books from the operation of the
                    law which subjects all human things to decay, has also greatly promoted the
                    process of their renovation. By giving to the issue of an edition of a standard
                    work a degree of importance several hundred times greater than that which
                    belonged to the transcription of a single copy, it has called for a
                    proportionally larger amount of learning, diligence, and caution, in the work of
                    revision; and, by enabling each successive editor to avail himself of the
                    labours of his predecessors, all the advantages resulting from the concentration
                    of many minds upon the same subject have further been secured. Since the
                    fifteenth century, therefore, the lapse of time, instead of gradually impairing
                    and corrupting the literary remains of antiquity, has incessantly contributed to
                    their renovation; what was then unknown or doubtful, imperfect or corrupted, has
                    been ascertained, restored, and completed; and the learning and industry of the
                    four centuries which have since elapsed, being constantly directed towards the
                    same object, have left but few questions of literary antiquity open to
                    controversy. Books are no longer liable to the hazard of extinction from
                    political changes or the decline of learning in this or that country. Unless an
                    universal devastation should overtake every region of the civilized world, the
                    body of learning and science now extant can neither perish nor suffer
                    corruption. And thus it is that the written records of distant ages, as well as
                    the products of modern genius, industry, and research, are secured from
                    extinction by a mode of conservation less liable to extensive hazard than any
                    other that can be imagined.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Louis Jacob, a Carmelite who wrote on the subject of libraries about the middle
                    of the seventeenth century, enumerates above eleven hundred collections of

                    no doubt contained in monasteries, which have since been suppressed, and others
                    did not perhaps possess sufficient consequence to merit specification; but still
                    the numerical amount of them must satisfy the reader as to the impracticability
                    of attempting to comprise, in an article like the present, a complete list, much
                    less a detailed description, of such collections. All that we propose,
                    therefore, under this head, is to extract from the materials before us such
                    particulars as, when thrown together in a condensed form, may serve to convey an
                    accurate idea of the general character, contents, and classification of the
                    principal modern libraries of Europe; and, with this view, as well as for
                    convenient reference, we shall arrange them under their respective heads of <hi

                    Libraries.</hi><hi rend="italic">Oritish Libraries.</hi></p>
                <p>The principal libraries in Great Britain are those of the British Museum and
                    other institutions in London, Lambeth, Oxford, Cambridge, and Althorp, in
                    England; the Advocates’, Writers’, and College Libraries, Edinburgh, and those
                    of the universities of St Andrews, Glasgow, and Aberdeen, in Scotland; and,
                    lastly, that of Trinity College, in the capital of Ireland.</p>
                <p>The library of the British Museum, which is now considered as the great national
                    depository of science, literature, art, and antiquities, has been composed of
                    various collections successively obtained, and is chiefly remarkable for its
                    numerous and valuable manuscript acquisitions.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">department of printed boohs</hi> consisted originally of
                    the libraries of Sir Hans Sloane and Major Edwards, which were acquired about
                    the middle of last century. In 1757, George II., by an instrument under the
                    great seal, added the library of the kings of England, the printed books of
                    which had been collected from the time of Henry VIL, and the manuscripts from a
                    much earlier date. This collection was very rich in the prevailing literature of
                    different periods; and it included, amongst others, the libraries of Archbishop
                    Cranmer, of Henry prince of Wales, and of Isaac Casaubon. His majesty annexed to
                    his gift the privilege which the royal library had acquired in the reign of
                    Queen Anne, of being supplied with a copy of every publication entered at
                    Stationers’ Hall. The same department was further enriched, in 1763, by a
                    donation from George III. of a collection of pamphlets and periodical papers
                    published in England between 1640 and 1660, and chiefly illustrative of the
                    civil wars in the time of Charles I., by whom the collection was commenced.</p>
                <p>It would be vain to attempt a detailed enumeration of all the additions which
                    have since been made, whether by gift or by purchase. Amongst the smaller
                    acquisitions may be mentioned Dr Thomas Birch’s library; two collections of
                    books on musical science from Sir John Hawkins, and one from Dr Charles Burney;
                    Garrick’s collection of old English plays; numerous classics from the library of
                    Mr Thomas Tyrwhitt, with his manuscript notes; Sir William Musgrave’s collection
                    of biography; a collection of classics, enriched with Dr Bentley’s manuscript
                    notes; a library of ceremonials, processions, and heraldry, from Mrs Sophia
                    Sarah Banks; and a collection of Italian history and topography, from Sir
                    Richard Colt Hoare. Amongst the larger and more important are, the general
                    library collected by the Rev. Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode; the law library of Mr
                    Francis Hargrave; the library of science which belonged to the Baron de Moll of
                    Munich; the libraries of Μ. Guin-guené, author of the <hi rend="italic">Histoire
                    Littéraire d’Italie,</hi> and of the Rev. Dr Charles Burney; and Sir Joseph
                    Banks’s library of natural history. Four separate collections of tracts,
                    illustrative of the revolutionary history of France, have been purchased at
                    different times by the trustees, in the exercise of the powers with which they
                    are invested. One of these was the collection formed by the last president of
                    the parliament of Bretagne, at the commencement of the revolution; two others
                    extended generally throughout the whole revolutionary period; and the fourth
                    consisted of a collection of tracts published during the reign of the hundred
                    days in 1815; forming altogether a body of materials for the history of the
                    revolution as complete in regard to France as the collection of pamphlets and
                    tracts already mentioned is with respect to that of the civil wars of England in
                    the time of Charles I. Another feature of the Museum Library is its progressive
                    collection of newspapers from the appearance of the first of these publications
                    in 1588. Sir Hans Sloane had formed a great collection for his day. But to this
                    was <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205258" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5258-0295"/>ιdded, in
                    1818, the Burney collection, purchased at the estimated value of L.1000; and
                    since that period the commissioners of stamps have continued periodically to
                    forward to the Museum, copies of all newspapers deposited by the publishers in
                    their office.</p>
                <p>In 1823, the Royal Library collected by George III. was presented to the British
                    nation by his successor, George IV., ιnd ordered by parliament to be added to
                    the library of the British Museum, but to be kept for ever separate from the
                    &gt;ther books in that institution. The general plan of its formation appears to
                    have been determined on by George III. soon after his accession to the throne;
                    and the first extensive purchase made for it was that of the library of Mr
                    Joseph Smith, British consul at Venice, in 1762, for vhich his majesty paid
                    about L.10,000. In 1768, Mr (afterwards Sir Frederick) Barnard, the librarian,
                    was despatched o the Continent by his majesty; and, as the Jesuits’ houses vere
                    then being suppressed, and their libraries sold, through-nit Europe, he was
                    enabled to purchase, upon the most <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> dvantageous
                    terms, a great number of valuable books, including some very remarkable

                    may be mentioned the Florence Homer of 1488, which formerly brought L.120, but

                    ιnd in Germany. Under the judicious directions of Mr Bar-ιard, the entire
                    collection was formed and arranged; it was cd, during a period of sixty years,
                    by an annual expenditure &gt;f about L.2000; and it is in itself perhaps one of
                    the most :omplete libraries of its extent that was ever formed. It ontains
                    selections of the rarest kind, particularly of scarce looks which appeared in
                    the first ages of the art of print-ng; it is rich in early editions of the
                    classics, in books rom the press of Caxton, in English history, and in Ita-ιan,
                    French, and Spanish literature; and there is likewise ∣ι very extensive
                    collection of geography and topography, ιnd of the transactions of learned
                    academies. The num-ιer of books in this library is 65,250,<note anchored="true"

                    now placed the department of printed books in the British Museum upon a
                    respectable footing; though, in peint of extent at least, it is still far
                    inferior to the principal libraries of the Continent, particularly those of

                    however, “the Museum Library is not decidedly poor in any class.”</p>
                <p>The nucleus of the <hi rend="italic">department of manuscripts,</hi> at the
                    establishment of the British Museum, was formed by the Harleian, the Sloane, and
                    the Cottonian collections. The next addition made to this department was that of
                    the manuscripts of the ancient royal library of England, conferred by George II.
                    in 1757. In this last collection, which contains the acquisitions of our kings
                    from the time of Richard II. to the date of the grant by George II., there are a
                    number of valuable manuscripts. Of these, one of the most remarkable is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi rend="italic">Alexandrinus,</hi> a present from
                    Cyril, patriarch of Constantinople, to King Charles I. It is in four quarto
                    volumes, written upon fine vellum, probably between the fourth and sixth
                    centuries, and is believed to be the most ancient manuscript of the Greek Bible
                    now extant, in uncial characters. Many of the other manuscripts came into the
                    royal collection at the time when the monastic institutions of Britain were
                    destroyed; and some of them still retain upon their spare leaves the honest and
                    hearty anathemas which the donors denounced against those who should alienate or
                    remove the respective volumes from the places in which they had been originally
                    deposited. This collection abounds in old scholastic divinity, and possesses
                    many volumes, embellished by the most expert illuminators of different
                    countries, in a succession of periods down to the sixteenth century. In it are
                    also preserved an assemblage of the domestic music-books of Henry VIII., and the
                    Basilicon Doron of James I. in his own handwriting. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cottonian</hi> collection, which was purchased for the use of the public in
                    1701, and annexed by statute to the British Museum in 1753, is especially rich
                    in historical documents <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205271"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-5271-0296"/>from the time of the Saxons to that of James I. It
                    likewise contains the numerous registers of English monasteries; the charters of
                    Edgar and of Henry I. to Hyde Abbey, near Winchester, written in gold letters;
                    and the manuscript called the <hi rend="italic">Durham Book,</hi> being a copy
                    of the Latin Gospels, with an interlinear Saxon gloss, written about the year
                    800, illuminated in the most elaborate style of the Anglo-Saxons, and believed
                    to have once belonged to the Venerable Bede. This collection is also rich in
                    royal and other original letters, and comprises the correspondence of most of
                    the great personages, not only of this country,‘but throughout Europe, from the
                    earliest periods at which letters were written until the commencement of the
                    seventeenth century. The <hi rend="italic">Harleian</hi> collection is still
                    more miscellaneous, though historical literature in all its branches forms one
                    of its principal features. It is particularly rich in heraldic and genealogical
                    manuscripts, in the visitations of counties, and in English topographical
                    collections; in parliamentary and legal proceedings; in originals, copies, and
                    calendars of ancientrecords; in abbey registers; in manuscripts of the classics,
                    amongst which is one of the earliest known of the Odyssey of Homer; in missals,
                    antiphonars, and other service-books of the Catholic church; and in ancient
                    English poetry. It possesses two very early copies of the Latin Gospels, written
                    in gold letters; and also contains a large number of splendidly illuminated
                    manuscripts, besides an extensive mass of correspondence. It further includes
                    about three hundred manuscript bibles or biblical books, in Hebrew, Chaldaic,
                    Greek, Arabic, and Latin; nearly two hundred volumes of writings of the fathers
                    of the church; and works on the arts and sciences, amongst which is a tract on
                    the steam-engine, with plans, diagrams, and calculations by Sir Samuel Morland.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Sloane</hi> collection consists principally of manuscripts
                    on natural history, voyages and travels, on the arts, and especially on
                    medicine. It comprises the chief of Kaempfer’s manuscripts, with the voluminous
                    medical collections of Mayerne, including the annals of his practice at the
                    court of England from 1611 to 1649; and it also contains a collection of medical
                    and other scientific correspondence, with numerous manuscripts on history,
                    poetry, and miscellaneous subjects. Some of the drawings of animals in this
                    collection are exceedingly rich and accurate; two volumes upon vellum are from
                    the pencil of Madame Merian; and one relates entirely to the insects of
                    Surinam.</p>
                <p>In 1807, the collection of manuscripts formed by the first Marquis of Lansdowne
                    was added to these libraries, having been purchased by parliament for L.4925. It
                    consists in part of the Burghley and Caesar papers, supplementary to the
                    Cottonian collection, but principally of a large assemblage of Bishop Kennett’s
                    manuscripts, and numerous collections of an historical kind.<note

                    Virgil, executed by Bartoli in 1G42. To these may be added, a Chinese map, and
                    nearly two hundred drawings, in the first style of eastern art, representing the
                    dresses, customs, and natural history of the interior of China.</p></note>
                    Another large collection <hi rend="italic">of</hi> manuscripts, almost
                    exclusively belonging to the faculty of the law, was purchased in 1813, of the
                    representatives of Mr Francis Hargrave. Amongst these, besides numerous copies
                    of early reports, is an abridgment of equity in forty-three volumes, by Sir
                    Thomas Sewell, master of the rolls. A collection of manuscripts, chiefly of the
                    Greek and Latin classics, which had been formed at a vast expense by the Rev. Dr
                    Charles Burney, was purchased in 1818. Amongst these is the Townley Homer, a
                    manuscript of the Iliad, similar to that of the Odyssey in the Harleian
                    collection;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This
                    manuscript was purchased by Dr Burney, at the price of six hundred

                    the mathematical tracts of Pappus; and a Greek manuscript of Ptolemy’s
                    Geography, adorned with maps of the fifteenth century. Two oriental
                    collectionshave also been added. One of these, made by Mr C. J. Rich whilst
                    British consul at Bagdad, and purchased by parliament in 1825 contains, amongst
                    other rare manuscripts, several copies of the Syriac version of the Scriptures,
                    which are believed to be of great antiquity. The other, a collection made in
                    different countries of the East, and consisting chiefly of Arabic and Persian
                    manuscripts, was bequeathed to the Museum in the year 1827, by the collector, Mr
                    J. F, Hull. In 1829, a small but valuable collection of manuscripts, partly
                    relating to French history, and partly of a literary character, was bequeathed
                    to the Museum by the Earl of Bridgewater, accompanied by a small real estate,
                    and a sum of L∙7000 to be invested, and the interests, as they became available,
                    applied in the purchase of manuscripts. The last distinct collection is that of
                    the Howard-Arundel manuscripts, acquired from the Royal Society in 1831, partly
                    by exchange, and partly by purchase at an estimated value of L.3560. It consists
                    of more than five hundred volumes, contains many manuscripts of interest in
                    almost every branch of learning, and is rich in materials for the history of our

                    thousands in number, form another division of the department of manuscripts,
                    with a distinct catalogue. These records and deeds partly belong to the
                    Cottonian, Harleian, and Sloane collections, and partly are accumulated
                    additions, being chiefly illustrative of English history, and of monastic and
                    other property.</p>
                <p>These are the larger and separate collections. The Donation Manuscripts, as they

                <p>The catalogues of the <hi rend="italic">printed boohs</hi> are chiefly in two
                    series; first, the printed catalogue of 1812, with manuscript enlargements, now
                    far exceeding in bulk the original, in twenty-two volumes folio; and, secondly,
                    the catalogue of the library of George III. in five volumes imperial folio, with
                    an addendum. There is likewise a catalogue of the geographical and topographical
                    collection attached to the library of George III. printed in one volume folio to
                    match the general catalogue of this library, and also in two volumes 8vo, 1834.
                    All the catalogues are alphabetical; and there is yet no general classed
                    catalogue,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> Of the
                    library of George III. there is a classed catalogue in manuscript, made by Sir

                    the reading-room.”</p></note> although a sum considerably exceeding L.5000 has
                    been paid by parliamentary grants as “expenditure on account of a classed
                    catalogue,” and an admirable example of such a work has been furnished in the
                    catalogue of the library belonging to the London Institution.<note

                    the books; fourthly, an index of authors’ names and works; and, fifthly, an
                    index of anonymous works, and of many different subjects of which some account
                    is to be found in the library.” As to foreign classed catalogues, it is only
                    necessary to mention two examples; first, that of the library of Göttingen,
                    prepared by the celebrated Heyne; and, secondly, that of St Petersburg, an
                    account of which is given in the appendix to the Report on the British Museum,
                    p. 464, et seq. But that of the London Institution is allowed to be in several

                    privately by George IV.</p>
                <p>The library of the <hi rend="italic">Royal Society</hi> is a repository
                    consisting chiefly of books of science and general literature, Inch may be
                    consulted by all the fellows, and from which books may also be borrowed by them
                    under the regulations prescribed by the statutes; nor have the Society, at any
                    time that is remembered, ever refused to lend books or manuscripts to learned
                    men not belonging to their corporation, who bad occasion to consult them. The
                    titles of the books presented to the Society have been inserted at the end of
                    the later volumes of their Transactions; they possess no further catalogue. The
                    library of the <hi rend="italic">Royal Institution</hi> was founded by a few
                    gentlemen, for the immediate use of the subscribers to that establishment; but
                    any person may, upon the recommendation of a patron, always have access to it.
                    This collection contains the best and most useful edition of almost every Greek
                    and Roman classic, with the best translations in English, and some in other
                    modern languages; the class of mathematical science in all its branches is very
                    full, including the best scientific journals, and transactions of learned
                    societies; and the historical department, founded on the collection of Mr Astle,
                    which was purchased by the managers at the formation of the library, is, in its
                    various divisions and subdivisions, exceedingly interesting. A catalogue,
                    methodically arranged, with an alphabetical index of authors, by William Harris,
                    was printed in 1809, in 8vo. The library of the <hi rend="italic">London
                    Institution</hi> was commenced under the direction of Professor Porson, and has
                    been admirably selected. Next to that of topography, the departments of
                    classical literature, mathematics, and history, are the most amply stocked. It
                    is also rich in bibliography, there being few works absolutely necessary to be
                    consulted by the bibliographical student, which may not be found in this
                    valuable collection. In the “introductory preface” to the methodical catalogue
                    of the library, recently published, there are some judicious remarks as to the
                    importance of classed catalogues. The library of the <hi rend="italic">Surrey
                    Institution,</hi> though less numerous than either of the two preceding ones,
                    presents a choice collection of the most useful books in the different
                    departments of literature, together with some rare and curious works. The
                    catalogue is systematically arranged, with an alphabetical index of
                    authors.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hartwell Horne,

                <p>The library of printed hooks founded by Archbishop Bancroft in the reign of King
                    James I. occupies the four galleries over the cloisters of Lambeth Palace. The
                    number of volumes contained in this library is estimated at upwards of 25,000,
                    many of which are of extreme rarity. In ecclesiastical history and in biblical
                    literature, few collections contain so large a number of scarce and curious
                    editions. The class of English topography is also extensive and valuable. The
                    first catalogue of printed books was drawn up by Bishop Gibson; it was
                    afterwards transcribed in a fair hand by Dr Wilkins, and has been continued by
                    his successors to the present time. The manuscripts, many of which are extremely
                    valuable, are arranged in seven sets or divisions, distinguished as <hi

                    >Suttoniani.</hi> This department, besides being rich in copies of the sacred
                    writings, contains Expositions of the Fathers of the Church; Missals, and Hours
                    of the Holy Virgin; a number of papal bulls; various treatises of Wickliffe;
                    manuscripts relating to the history of France, and other European nations,
                    particularly Spain, Italy, Poland, Germany, and Holland; seventeen volumes in
                    folio <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205297" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5297-0298"/>of the
                    Shrewsbury correspondence, besides several letters to and from Charles II.; and
                    certain manuscripts on heraldry and genealogy, written or corrected by Lord
                    Burghley. But perhaps the two greatest curiosities in this collection are the
                    ancient French version and exposition of the Apocalypse, ornamented with
                    miniature paintings; and the Latin copy of the Apocalypse, also beautifully
                    illuminated, which is supposed to have been written in the thirteenth century. A
                    catalogue of these manuscript treasures, compiled by the Rev. H. J. Todd, the
                    keeper, was printed in 1812, in one volume folio, at the expense of the
                    Archbishop <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Canterbury.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The different colleges of Oxford and Cambridge have all libraries of various
                    extent attached to them; but in each university there is at least one great or
                    principal library, as the Bodleian Library at Oxford, and that of Trinity
                    College, besides the Public or University Library, at Cambridge.</p>
                <p>The Bodleian Library, so called from the name of its illustrious founder, was
                    instituted towards the close of the reign of Elizabeth, by Sir Thomas Bodley,
                    who, having become disgusted with some court intrigues, resigned all his
                    employments about the year 1597, and immediately afterwards undertook the
                    generous task of restoring the public library at Oxford, which had been
                    despoiled of its contents in the reign of Edward VI. With this view, he
                    despatched from London a letter to the vice-chancellor, offering not only to
                    restore the building, but to provide a fund for the purchase of books, and the
                    maintenance of proper officers. This offer being thankfully accepted, he
                    commenced his undertaking by presenting to the library a large collection of
                    books purchased on the Continent, and valued at L.10,000. He also collected 1294
                    rare manuscripts, which were afterwards increased to G818, independently of 1898
                    in the Ashmolean Museum. Other collections and contributions were also, by his
                    example and persuasion, presented to the new library. The most important of
                    these, perhaps, was a considerable portion of the very valuable library which
                    had belonged to Jerom Ossorius, the Cicero of Portugal, successively bishop of
                    Sylvas and of Algarve, in which last see he died in 1580. This library having
                    fallen to the share of the Earl of Essex, amongst the booty which had been
                    takeif in the expedition against Cadiz in 1598, part of it was by him presented
                    to Bodley, in order to enrich the collection he was then forming. The additions
                    thus made soon swelled to such an amount that the old building was no longer
                    sufficient to contain them. The edifice was accordingly enlarged; and when
                    Bodley had succeeded in enriching his collection beyond his most sanguine
                    expectation, he drew up for its government a body of statutes, which have since
                    been incorporated with those of the university. The Bodleian Library was first
                    opened to the public on the 8th of November 1602; and, since 1780, a fund of
                    more than L.4C0 a year, arising from a small addition to the matriculation fees,
                    and a moderate annual contribution by such members of the university as are
                    admitted to the use of the library, have been established for the purchase of
                    books. It would require a volume to contain an enumeration of the many important
                    additions which have been made to this library by its numerous benefactors, or
                    to admit even a sketch of its ample contents in almost every branch of
                    literature and science.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    collection is materially abridged. The first catalogue of the printed books was
                    published by Dr Hyde in 1674, and another of the manuscripts was printed in
                    1697. A fuller catalogue of the books, compiled by Bowles, Fisher, and Langford,
                    was printed in 1738, in two volumes folio; but, from the'immense increase of the
                    collection since that period, this, as well as the others, has become of little
                    use. A catalogue of the manuscripts relating to oriental history, drawn up by
                    Professor Urie, was printed in 1787, in one volume folio. In 1795, there was
                    also printed a <hi rend="italic">Notitia</hi> of first, early, or Aldine
                    editions of certain Hebrew, Greek, and Latin works contained in the library, the
                    articles indicated being all of the greatest rarity; and, in 1812, appeared the
                    first part of a catalogue by Professor Gaisford, of the manuscript collection
                    purchased by Dr Edward Daniel Clarke, in his travels through various parts of
                    Europe and Asia. But no complete or general catalogue, either of the printed
                    books or the manuscripts, has yet been published; and for this reason it is
                    impossible to give any specific or satisfactory account of this magnificent
                    collection.</p>
                <p>The riches of the Bodleian Library are very imperfectly known to the world, and
                    its stores are increasing faster than they can be catalogued; yet the library is
                    not generally accessible, even to the students of the university; and the
                    arrangements are such, that the very persons engaged in teaching have but a
                    limited use of it. The average number of daily readers is stated to be about
                    half a dozen; whilst, in the British Museum, it is at least one hundred and
                    fifty. The books of the Bodleian Library are not allowed to go out, and, by this
                    restriction, its utility is greatly abridged. The use, to a reasonable extent,
                    of a collection which is certainly one of the best in the world, would of itself
                    form a strong inducement to study at Oxford; and it is inconceivable how this
                    advantage should have been withheld, considering that the terms in which Sir
                    Thomas Bodley made his donation to the university present no obstacle whatever
                    to the lending out of books.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The libraries of the different colleges are many of them considerable, some of
                    them extensive, and not a few of them enriched with much that is both curious
                    and rare. Bishop Rede contributed the first part of the collection of books in
                    Merton College, which has since been augmented, both in manuscripts and in
                    printed books, by the liberality of succeeding benefactors. University College
                    Library possesses a considerable collection of printed books and manuscripts,
                    together with some works of art. Baliol College Library suffered by the
                    depredations of the visitors appointed by’ Edward VI.; but the damage was
                    afterwards repaired by a supply of books from Durham College, and by successive
                    donations. The library of Queens College contains some curious manuscripts,
                    chiefly heraldic and political, a valuable series of coins, a collection of
                    numismatical works, and a fine orrery. The books of New College occupy two
                    spacious apartments, and there is also a collection of manuscripts. The library
                    of Lincoln College is chiefly remarkable for a collection of Greek and <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193205310" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5310-0299"/> Latin manuscripts
                    made by Sir George Wheler in his travels. That of All-Souls’ College is an
                    excellent collection; it was admirably arranged, under the superintendence of
                    Sir William Blackstone; and the greatest facility is consequently afforded in
                    consulting any class. In the library of Brazen-nose College, the ancient custom
                    of chaining the books to the shelves was strictly observed until the year 1780,
                    when this conservative practice was abandoned. This collection is of
                    considerable extent and value. The library of Corpus Christi College is enriched
                    with a valuable set of Aldine classics, with many manuscripts and printed books,
                    of great rarity and in excellent preservation, and with the manuscripts of Twyne
                    and Fulman, the Oxford antiquarians. The Aldines were collected by the founder,
                    Richard Fox. In 1755, Lord Coleraine gave to this library a large and valuable
                    collection of Italian literature. The library of Christ Church would probably
                    have exceeded that of any contemporary establishment, had Wolsey been able to
                    complete his original design, which was, not only to supply it with such books
                    as had appeared since the invention of printing, but also with copies of the
                    most valuable manuscripts in the Vatican. This collection is principally
                    composed of the extensive and valuable library bequeathed by the Earl of Orrery,
                    amounting to 10,000 volumes; of that left to the college by Wake archbishop of
                    Canterbury, consisting of printed books and manuscripts, with a collection of
                    coins and medals; and of the contributions of a number of benefactors. In 17G7,
                    the numismatical series was further enriched by the collection of British and
                    English coins belonging to Dr Barton, and, in 1780, by that of oriental coins
                    collected by Dr R. Brown, canon and regius professor of Hebrew. The library of
                    Trinity College was instituted by the founder, Sir Thomas Pope, who was also the
                    first contributor of books. The collection was afterwards enlarged by various
                    benefactions, and is now one of considerable extent. The library of St John’s
                    College contains a valuable collection of printed books and manuscripts given by
                    Archbishop Laud; many specimens of natural and artificial curiosities, <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ι</hi> and relics of antiquity; with a collection of Greek,
                    Roman, and English coins, bequeathed by Dr Rawlinson, along with his books. In
                    the library of Wadham College are many early printed books, and a good
                    collection of classics and works on theology, together with French, Italian, and
                    Spanish literature. The library of Worcester College is a considerable
                    collection, and particularly rich in architectural books and manuscripts. The
                    Radcliffe Library, so called from the munificent founder, Dr Radcliffe, who left
                    L.40,000 for the erection of a public library in Oxford, with an endowment of
                    L.150 a year to a librarian, and L.100 for the purchase of books, is an
                    extensive and valuable collection, and contains some valuable but neglected
                    manuscripts.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The state

                    of oriental manuscripts in England is not satisfactory, and that things least
                    used are not always best cared for. The following is his own account of the
                    matter :—“We commenced a diligent search; at last we drew forth from a press
                    which had long been unvisited, the separate and tom portions of manuscripts,
                    covered with dust and dirt, and leaves rolled up together promiscuously. Oh,
                    what destruction did I then see! Nothing was ever scattered more confusedly from
                    the Sybil’s cave into every quarter of the heavens, when the leaves on which she
                    used to write her oracles were carried away by a sudden storm. I was not able to
                    examine them all, for I was in haste to return home, it being late in the
                    autumn. I selected, however, from the midst of that disgraceful contusion, a
                    fragment of the <hi rend="italic">Ramayana,</hi> and I put together almost the
                    entire manuscript of the poem ‘ <hi rend="italic">ãc Crisĭmi</hi><hi

                    therefore, although still ignorant of its wealth, possesses a manuscript which
                    is most are, and indeed unique in Sanscrit literature.” This statement requires
                    no comment. <hi rend="italic">(Journal of Education,</hi> vol. i. pp. 403,

                <p>'Ihe library of Trinity College, Cambridge, is extensive, and contained in a very
                    magnificent structure built by Sir Christopher Wren, being two hundred feet in
                    length, forty in breadth, and thirty-eight in height. The collection is
                    separated into thirty classes, distributed in cases of oak; and the books are
                    both numerous and valuable. Amongst other literary curiosities, there are some
                    interesting manuscripts in the handwriting of Milton. They are contained in a
                    thin folio volume, which was discovered by Professor Mason amongst the papers of
                    Sir Henry Puckering, and consist of the original copy of the Masque of Cornus;
                    several plans of Paradise Lost, composed at the period when he intended to have
                    made that subject the groundwork of a tragedy; and the poems of Lycidas,
                    Arcades, and several others. Here are also the Arabic manuscripts left by Dr

                <p>The University or Public Library of Cambridge is extensive, and contains much
                    that is valuable or curious both in the department of printed books, and in that
                    of manuscripts. The printed books comprise a fine series of <hi rend="italic"
                    >editiones principes</hi> of the classics, and a very considerable proportion of
                    the productions of Caxton’s press. The most important acquisition made by this
                    library was that of the collection which had belonged to Dr Moore, bishop of
                    Ely, amounting to 30,000 volumes, which were munificently purchased for six
                    thousand guineas by his majesty King George I., who presented them to the
                    library, and further gave L.2000 towards fitting up the apartments destined for
                    their reception. Bishop Moore’s collection, which is singularly rich in the
                    productions of the early English printers, was offered to the Earl of Oxford for
                    L.6000, and on his refusal was purchased and presented as has just been
                    mentioned. A method of arranging the books in the public library of Cambridge
                    was long ago proposed by Dr Middleton, but no catalogue of them has yet been
                    printed. The number of volumes in this library must now considerably exceed
                    100,000. Amongst the manuscripts contained in it are, 1. the celebrated
                    manuscript of the four Gospels and Acts of the Apostles, known by the name of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Codex Bezoe,</hi> which was presented to the university by

                    in the old Saxon character. St John’s College Library contains one of the most
                    valuable and extensive collections of books in the University, particularly in
                    biblical and classical literature, and is also enriched with some first editions
                    which came originally from the Harleian collection. The Pepysian Library,
                    Magdalen College, is so called from the founder, Samuel Pepys, secretary to the
                    admiralty in the reigns of Charles II. and James II. who bequeathed to this
                    college his valuable library, together with his prints and drawings. It is
                    remarkable for a collection of old English ballads, in five volumes folio, begun
                    by Mr Selden, and continued to the year 1700; and two volumes of Scottish
                    poetry, consisting of pieces by Gawin Douglas, Dunbar, Lindsay, Drummond, James
                    I. and other poets. Dr Percy, in his <hi rend="italic">Reliques,</hi> has made a
                    judicious selection from the former; and, in 1776, Mr Pinkerton published
                    copious extracts from the latter. Pepys’s collection of prints and drawings,
                    illustrative of the history of London, and his rare British portraits, are
                    particularly valuable.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The library of Earl Spencer, at Althorp, Nottinghamshire, though a private
                    collection, is eminently deserving of notice here, not so much by reason of its
                    extent, which is very considerable, as on account of the unrivalled treasures
                    which it contains in several departments of literature, sacred as well as
                    profane. This library, amounting to not less than 45,000 volumes, exclusively of
                    the Cassano collection purchased in 1820, was entirely formed by the late Earl
                    Spencer, within a period of time not exceeding twenty-four years; and it is
                    unquestionably the richest private collection in Britain, perhaps in

                    published in the sixteenth century, was laid by the purchase of the collection
                    of Count Reviczky, a foreign nobleman who had occupied himself in accumulating
                    rare and curious works of a peculiar description. But many scarce and valuable
                    impressions of the classical authors were afterwards obtained; and in the
                    departments of literature and the belles-lettres it was enriched with some
                    magnificent acquisitions. Impressions of Bibles and Testaments, and of portions
                    of the sacred text in almost all languages, are to be found in this
                    extraordinary collection; the departments of classical literature, in the Greek,
                    Latin, and Italian languages, are of equal, if not greater extent and value;

                    typography. It contains several books, consisting of impressions taken from
                    carved wooden blocks previously to the invention of metallic types, and thus
                    exhibiting the earliest specimens of stereotype printing. In others, engraved
                    figures constitute the principal part, to which is added a small proportion of
                    text, and only one side of the leaf is employed, the other being left blank.
                    Such is the <hi rend="italic">Ars Memorandi Notabilis</hi><hi rend="italic">per

                    consisting of a number of rude cuts of the principal events recorded in the
                    Gospels, with text on the opposite page; and such, also, is the <hi

                    surrounded by grotesque and hideous figures of angels and demons. The taste of
                    the time inclined to the monstrous or the absurd. In the former work St Luke is
                    represented by a bull standing on his hind legs, whilst St Mark is depicted as a
                    rampant lion. The <hi rend="italic">Historia Veteris et</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    executed prior to the year 1450, and is by some considered as the earliest
                    specimen of block-printing. Amongst the early printed and scarce bibles in the
                    Althorp Library, may be mentioned the Mazarin Bible, printed between 1450 and
                    1455; one supposed to be the work of Albert Pfister, prior to 1460; Fust and
                    Schoeffer’s Bible, 1462; that by Sweyheym and Pannartz, 1471; a Dutch Bible,
                    1477; Prince Radzivil’s Bible in Polish; besides other early copies in the
                    .different languages of Europe. The same collection contains the Latin Psalter
                    of Fust and Schoeffer, printed in 1457, being the first printed to which a date
                    is affixed; and another of nearly equal rarity, printed in 1459. Many of the
                    earliest editions of the classics, beautiful copies on vellum, and the works of
                    all the celebrated printers of the fifteenth century, add to the value of this
                    unrivalled collection. The Cassano Library,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Spencer in the year 1820, and soon afterwards united with his general
                    collection, formed a valuable addition to the Althorp Library. Amongst other
                    rarities, it contained the famous edition of Horace, printed at Naples in 1474,
                    by Arnoldus de Bruxella, of which there is no other known copy; that of Terence,
                    printed by Riessinger, without date, but probably not later than 1471; the
                    earlier productions of the Neapolitan press; rare editions of the early Italian
                    classics; specimens of early printing at Rome, including the edition of Juvenal
                    by Ulric Han; together with all the rare editions of Virgil, Horace, Ovid, and
                    other Roman poets.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>We come now to Scottish libraries, and shall commence with the largest as well as
                    richest of the number; that of the Faculty of Advocates. The plan of forming a
                    library appears to have been adopted by the Faculty as early as the year 1680.
                    The author and active promoter of the scheme was Sir George Mackenzie of
                    Rosehaugh. It was originally intended that it should consist merely of the works
                    of lawyers, and of such other books as were calculated to advance the study of
                    jurisprudence. This may be inferred from the inaugural address delivered by Sir
                    George Mackenzie when the library was first opened, and from several other
                    papers relative to the subject. At its commencement, this library had no certain
                    fund allotted for its maintenance. It depended upon and owed its increase to the
                    donations of benefactors, together with such sums as the Faculty from time to
                    time placed at the disposal of the curators. In the year 1700, the apartment
                    where the library was kept being nearly destroyed by fire, it was removed to the
                    place which it partly still occupies, namely, the ground floor of the Parliament
                    House. During the nine years immediately following, it must have increased
                    considerably,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In 17θ7,
                    the library received a large donation of books in natural history, to which many
                    of the most costly and magnificent works on that branch of science have since
                    been added.</p></note> since by the act passed in the eighth year of Queen
                    Anne’s reign, the privilege of receiving a copy of every book entered at
                    Stationers’ Hall was conferred upon it, alongst with eight other libraries, four
                    of which were Scotch, being those attached to the universities of St Andrews,
                    Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>The department of printed books comprehends, in a greater or less degree, almost
                    every branch of science, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205336"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-5336-0301"/>philosophy, jurisprudence, literature, and the
                    arts. As might be expected, the collection of law-books is extensive; but it is
                    much more complete in ancient than in modern works, many important treatises on
                    foreign jurisprudence being still wanting. The historical collection, which is
                    exceedingly valuable, contains almost every work of consequence that has been
                    published in Great Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, and Sweden.
                    This department alone comprehends upwards of 20,000 volumes. The collection of
                    Greek and Roman classics, though it cannot vie with some others, is also choice
                    and extensive, including several first and many early editions. The library is
                    rich in modern poetry and belles-lettres, and, besides the miscellaneous
                    department, contains a very considerable collection of voyages and travels. It
                    is defective in the great branch of mathematical and physical science; in
                    archaeology or antiquities; in early as well as modern Italian literature; and,
                    generally, in foreign literature of a recent date. Amongst the separate
                    collections are, the Astorga library, the Thorkelin collection, and that of old
                    Scottish books. A collection of Spanish books, amounting to about 3400 volumes,
                    which had formerly belonged to the library of the Marquis of Astorga, was
                    purchased from a London bookseller in 1824, for the sum of L.3000. It consists
                    principally of works on Spanish history, including the old chronicles, as well
                    as of books on law and theology, with a sprinkling of the old Spanish poems and
                    romances. The Thorkelin collection, so called from Professor Thorkelin, to whom
                    it originally belonged, contains about 1200 volumes, chiefly on northern law,
                    history, and antiquities. Of the Scottish books, those relating to old Scottish
                    poetry are exceedingly rare and curious. They amount to between three and four
                    hundred volumes, and their number is likely to be still further increased by the
                    zeal and research of the present librarian, Dr Irving, who has already made many
                    important additions to this collection, partly by the acquisition of new
                    articles, and partly by detaching curious pieces from other collections, and
                    putting them in a distinct and more accessible form. His labours in this
                    department, with which he is intimately conversant, have been beyond all praise;
                    and he is constantly on the watch to take advantage of every opportunity that
                    offers for augmenting its treasures. There is also a collection of German
                    dissertations, amounting to upwards of 100,000, called Count Diedrich’s
                    collection, which was purchased by Sir William Hamilton, on account of the
                    library, for the trifling sum of L.80. This library is not rich in typographical
                    rarities. It contains few Caxtons, and, with the exception of the Mentz Bible,
                    and some specimens of early printing in Scotland,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The first production of the Scottish press
                    preserved in this library should not pass unnoticed. It is a breviary composed
                    by he bishop of Aberdeen for the use of his cathedral, and printed in the year
                    1509; and it consists of two volumes in small octavo, but of he first volume the
                    title-page and some leaves at the end are wanting. The second volume, printed in
                    1510, has at the beginning a calendar, and at the end these words: “Opido
                    Edinburgensi impresso jussu et impensis honorabilis viri Walteri Chepman
                    ejusdemopidi Mercatoris quarto die Junii milesimo CCCCC decimo.” On the outside
                    of this leaf is a wooden engraving representing a man and woman clothed in skins
                    of beasts, with their shoulders bare, and their heads adorned with wreaths of
                    flowers; whilst between them stands a tree, from which is suspended a shield
                    with W. C. in cipher.</p></note> has but little to interest those who delight in
                    the productions of the press during the infancy 3Í the art. The total number of
                    printed volumes contained in the library does not, it is thought, fall much
                    short of 150,000.</p>
                <p>The department of manuscripts, though not so extensive is in some other libraries
                    of the same class, is neverthe-ess of great interest and value with reference to
                    the civil, and particularly the ecclesiastical history of Scotland. Soon after
                    the foundation of the library, the Faculty appear to have turned their attention
                    to the collection of manuscripts; and this important department now consists
                    &gt;f nearly 1700 volumes, of which about 250 have been added within the last
                    fifteen years. The most valuable portion of the manuscripts is that which
                    relates to the ecclesiastical state of Scotland immediately preceding the era of
                    the Reformation, and includes, amongst other things, thirteen chartularies or
                    volumes of records of the different religious houses, which escaped the general
                    destruction in which the edifices themselves were then involved. Considerable
                    light is also thrown on the civil and ecclesiastical history of Scotland at a
                    later period, by the documents and other materials contained in the collections
                    of Sir James Balfour, Sir Robert Sibbald, and Wodrow the historian. Balfour’s
                    collection, which consists of upwards of sixty volumes, was purchased at a
                    considerable expense in 1698. About the half of it consists of original state
                    papers, and several very curious royal letters written in the times of James VI.
                    and Charles I. From these, selections were made by Lord Hailes, and printed in
                    1762 and 1765. The Annals of Scotland, compiled by Sir James Balfour, were also
                    printed in 1824, 1825, in four volumes 8vo. But there still remain unprinted
                    some manuscripts on genealogy and heraldry, besides a considerable number of
                    curious documents. Sir Robert Sibbald’s collection, consisting of upwards of
                    thirty volumes, was purchased by the Faculty in 1723. It is chiefly of a
                    topographical and literary character; but the substance of the greater part
                    relating to topography has already been published. Wodrow’s collection is by far
                    the most voluminous, consisting of upwards of 160 volumes. It was chiefly from
                    this immense mass of materials that that laborious writer compiled his History
                    of the Sufferings of the Church of Scotland; but by far the greater portion of
                    the collection, containing many curious original documents not to be met with
                    elsewhere, is still unprinted. His correspondence with many eminent literary
                    characters, embracing a period of more than thirty years (from 1694 to 1726),
                    and extending to about thirty volumes, is also full of curious information
                    respecting the literature and history of the period to which it refers. A
                    collection of original documents belonging to the reigns of James V., Queen
                    Mary, and James VI., was presented to the library by the Earl of Balcarrasin the
                    year 1712; these papers have lately been arranged and bound, and now consist of
                    nine volumes folio. This department also contains Lord Fountainhall’s
                    collections, in his own handwriting, including his decisions, historical
                    notices, diary,and other matters. We may likewise notice the curious and
                    interesting papers of Paton, Murray, Anderson, and Hutton, all of which have
                    recently been arranged and bound in several folio and quarto volumes; and also
                    those collected by Mr Scott of Perth, consisting of about twenty volumes folio,
                    and comprising the Blackfriars charters, in three volumes, extracts from the
                    records of the Church of Perth, in four volumes, the records of the Hospital
                    from 1577 to 1732, extracts from the records of the Kirk-session, a chronicle,
                    and a register of baptisms and deaths. Amongst the Scottish historical records
                    are, letters-from James V., and the Earl of Arran, governor of the kingdom in
                    the infancy of Queen Mary, to the kings of England, France, Norway, and
                    Portugal, to the Duke of Guise, the Earl of Suffolk, and others, from 1539 to
                    1542: also original letters by Queen Mary, addressed to her mother the
                    queendowager, during the early years of that beautiful but ill-fated princess;
                    by Anne of Denmark, queen of James VI.; by Prince Henry and Prince Charles, his
                    sons; by <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205349" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5349-0302"/>the
                    Princess Elizabeth, his daughter; and by the Elector Palatine and his son to
                    James VI., entirely of a familiar nature.</p>
                <p>The same department includes a number of manuscripts on heraldry, genealogy, and
                    Scottish law, besides many of a miscellaneous nature. It also contains several
                    early manuscripts of the classics, and a few illuminated missals. Amongst the
                    former may be mentioned a very fine copy of Horace, belonging to the thirteenth
                    century; the plays of Terence, executed in the year 1436; a copy of the Epigrams
                    of Martial, in perfect preservation, which, from the style of the writing, has
                    been ascribed to the ninth century, and is supposed to be one of the most
                    ancient manuscripts of the Epigrams extant;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    several classics, as Cicero, Ovid, Juvenal, and Persius, all of considerable
                    antiquity. A manuscript copy of St Jerome’s translation of the Bible, supposed
                    to have been written about the tenth century, and said to have been found in the
                    Abbey Church of Dunfermline during the reign of David I.; the Auchinleck
                    manuscript, from which Sir Walter Scott printed the Romance of Sir Tristrem; and
                    Bannatyne’s manuscript, in two volumes folio, being a collection of ancient
                    poems made by different learned Scotchmen, lovers of antique song, and “written

                    this department of the library. It was from the Bannatyne collection that Allan
                    Ramsay selected the poems which were printed in the Evergreen; and from the same
                    source Lord Hailes extracted a volume, which was printed in the year 1770. In
                    1825, about a hundred volumes of Icelandic manuscripts, amongst which are
                    several ancient Sagas, were purchased of Professor Magnuson of Copenhagen, and
                    added to the collection; and in the following year, Mr Elphinstone, and Mr
                    Erskine, formerly of Bombay, presented to the library some valuable Persian and
                    Sanscrit manuscripts. Not long ago a beautiful manuscript of the Hebrew Bible
                    was purchased in Germany; it is in two large folio volumes; and the Pentateuch,
                    besides the original, has also the Chaldaic paraphrase. A manuscript of the <hi

                <p>The building which contains the bulk of the Advocates’ Library is not only
                    confined, but is in several parts exceedingly dark and inconvenient. The
                    historical department, however, has been separated from the rest of the
                    collection, and arranged in a spacious and elegant apartment, with convenient
                    side-rooms, recently provided for its reception, being intended to form the
                    grand entrance to a large building which it is proposed to erect for the
                    reception of the great body of the library, as soon as the necessary funds can
                    be obtained. The library is governed by five curators, one of whom goes out of
                    office annually by rotation, and another is elected in his stead from amongst
                    the body of the Faculty. Under the curators are a principal keeper or librarian,
                    and several assistants. The library is supported partly by the acquisitions
                    which it is continually making in virtue of the right conferred upon it by the
                    copy-right act, and partly by an annual sum paid to the curators for the use of
                    the establishment out of the revenue of the Faculty. No public institution in
                    Great Britain, or perhaps in Europe, is conducted with greater liberality than
                    the Advocates’ Library. Strangers arriving in Edinburgh are freely admitted
                    without introduction; and any one who is at all known is never denied the
                    privilege of resorting to, and of reading or writing in, the library. Very
                    eminent men have been keepers of this collection, particularly Thomas Ruddiman,
                    David Hume and Adam Ferguson. The present librarian, Dr Irving, well known by
                    his Life of Buchanan and other works, is a distinguished scholar, a learned
                    civilian, and eminently skilled in ancient Scottish history, biography, and
                    poetry.</p>
                <p>The first volume of the general catalogue was begun in 1735, and printed in 1742,
                    under the superintendence of the learned Ruddiman and Mr Walter Goodall; the
                    second, consisting of later acquisitions, was compiled by Mr Alexander Brown;
                    and this was followed by a third volume, printed in 1807, all in folio; but the
                    manuscript additions which have since been made are at least equal to other two
                    printed volumes of the same size. There are manuscript catalogues of the Astorga
                    and Thorkelin collections; but as yet there exists no separate catalogue of the
                    manuscripts. A catalogue of the law-books was printed in 1831, in one volume
                    8vo. There is no classed catalogue of the Advocates’ Library, nor even a classed
                    index to the general catalogue, which would be a great convenience to those
                    engaged in scientific or literary pursuits.</p>
                <p>The library of the Writers to his Majesty’s Signet is an excellent and valuable
                    miscellaneous collection of books in science, law, history, geography,
                    statistics, antiquities, literature, and the arts; and it has recently been
                    rendered much more accessible by the ample and spacious accommodation provided
                    for it. It is contained in two large and beautiful apartments, both under the
                    same roof, with small rooms adjoining. The accommodation altogether is perhaps
                    superior to that of any library in Britain. The books arc arranged in classes or
                    departments, not in conformity to any particular bibliographical system, but
                    with reference simply to the nature and extent of the collection, and the
                    circumstances necessary to be attended to in placing it in the particular
                    apartments which it occupies. The arrangement, however, is such as to afford
                    facilities for reference, and to exhibit, in a general way, the component parts
                    or branches of the collection. The upper apartment, in which about 14,000
                    volumes have already been placed, contains the following classes, viz. theology
                    and ecclesiastical history; general and particular history, biography, and
                    antiquities; arts and sciences; transactions of learned societies,
                    encyclopaedias, and dictionaries; polygraphy, or the collected works of authors
                    who have treated on various subjects; classics, translations, and works
                    illustrative of the classics; .and, lastly, belles-lettres and miscellaneous
                    literature in the learned as well as in foreign languages. The lower apartment,
                    and the adjoining small rooms, contain the classes of civil, Scottish, English,
                    and foreign law; British and Irish history, biography, antiquities, topography,
                    and statistics, with all works relating to these heads; geography, voyages and
                    travels; bibliography; belles-lettres, in the English language, and the
                    miscellaneous productions of British literature; besides collections of
                    periodical publications, parliamentary reports, and parliamentary debates, with
                    a collection of maps suspended in spring cases. The class comprising works
                    relating to the history, biography, antiquities, topography, and statistics of
                    the British empire, forms the most extensive department of this collection, and
                    is, in fact, nearly complete in most of its subdivisions. The choice and
                    condition of the books generally, and the rarity, value, and splendour of many,
                    deserve particular notice; and, indeed, this library, though supported
                    exclusively from the funds of the Society to which it belongs, possesses some
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205362" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5362-0303"/><hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the noblest and most expensive works ever published,
                    either abroad or at home. The number of volumes may be estimated at nearly
                    50,000. There is a classed catalogue, formed on De Bure’s system, and very
                    skilfully executed, which was printed in the year 1805; but this applies only to
                    a small portion of the collection, which has been very greatly increased since
                    the catalogue in question was prepared. An alphabetical catalogue of the whole
                    collection has been printed, in progressive parts; and to this there is now
                    (1836) in the Press, a <hi rend="italic">classed index,</hi> which will, in a
                    great measure, supply all the advantages of a catalogue raisonné. The government
                    of the library is vested in a body of curators, elected by the Society; and
                    under them are a principal librarian and several assistants. Here, as is the
                    case of the Advocates’ Library, the utmost liberality is shown to strangers, and
                    to literary men generally.</p>
                <p>ļ Like most other college libraries, that of the University !of Edinburgh was
                    founded by a donation; and, for a long period, the casual contributions of
                    benefactors constituted its principal means of support as well as of increase.
                    In 1580, Mr Clement Little, commissary in Edinburgh, bequeathed his library,
                    consisting of about 300 volumes, chiefly theological, to Edinburgh and the Kirk
                    of God; and this small collection was, not long afterwards, transferred by the
                    Town Council to the College, which they were then instituting. Little’s bequest
                    thus laid the foundation of the University Library. But it was subsequently
                    augmented, partly by the donations of citizens, and still more by the
                    benefactions of persons who had received their education in the College. Amongst
                    the latter may be mentioned, Dr Robert Johnston, the Rev. James Nairne, and,
                    above all, Drummond of Hawthornden, i∣one of the favourite sons of the Scottish
                    muse. Drummond bequeathed to the College his whole library, consisting of about
                    500 volumes; and the gift is the more valuable, because, independently of the
                    high reputation of the donor, the collection is enriched with many rare
                    specimens of our early literature, and may indeed be considered as altogether
                    unique and unrivalled. In 1763, the library of the incorporation of surgeons was
                    added to that of the &gt;College, in consequence of an agreement, which has
                    event-aally proved eminently advantageous to the former body, whatever may be
                    the case in as far as regards the interests )f the University. This collection
                    consisted of about 500 'volumes, almost entirely professional, and now of very
                    little "value. The principal bequest which the library has more recently
                    received is that of Dr William Thomson, who, in 1808, left it about 600 volumes,
                    chiefly on medical subjects, hi a testamentary bequest by the late General Reid,
                    who was educated at this university, mention is made of the ibrary, as an object
                    to the improvement and extension ∣∣bf which, his munificent legacy is, amongst
                    other things, '.o be applied. The funds by which the library is maintained, and
                    its progressive enlargement secured, are, ma-riculation fees, fees on graduation
                    in three faculties, a lonation of L.5 from each professor on his induction, an
                    <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> mnual payment of L.20 by the College of Surgeons,
                    occasional donations of books, and its acquisitions as one of the privileged
                    libraries; but from the sums tlļus realized ire of course to be deducted the
                    salaries of the persons employed in the establishment. The ordinary managenent
                    of the library is vested in nine curators appointed annually by the Senatus
                    Academicus, four of whom retire from office every year, and are immediately
                    succeeded by an equal number of professors next in seniority, who are willing to
                    undertake the duty. Four of these curators are from the medical, one from the
                    theological, and four from the general department, including classes neither
                    medical nor theological.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    p. 167, et seq.</p></note> This library consists of about 90,000 printed
                    volumes, including some great typographical rarities; and the accommodation now
                    provided for it is of the most magnificent description, the library-hall being
                    by far the most spacious and noble apartment in Scotland. As to the collection
                    generally, it contains much that is valuable, and a good deal that is both
                    curious and rare; but, considered as a repository of varied information in
                    science and literature, it is unequal and defective, being redundant in some
                    branches and deficient in others. Its most ample department is that of medicine,
                    a purely professional one, and more largely replenished than any other with
                    obsolete matter. Those of natural philosophy and natural history are tolerably
                    supplied with the works belonging to them. But the case is different in the
                    departments of metaphysical, ethical, and political science, in all of which the
                    deficiencies are still great, though, happily, in the way of being gradually
                    supplied. In classical literature, too, including under that head all that
                    relates to the exposition and illustration of the ancient authors, there are
                    perhaps few great libraries more defective.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    hoped, however, that every exertion will be made, not only to supply obvious and
                    glaring deficiencies, but also to give to the collection that character of
                    generality, founded upon the possession of all that is most useful and
                    interesting in every branch of knowledge, which constitutes the best
                    recommendation of a great public library. This it is which has imparted to the
                    library of Göttingen its great and acknowledged excellence. The only catalogue
                    yet printed is one of the books relating to medicine, arranged alphabetically
                    according to the names of the authors.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the university a theological library, founded towards the close of the
                    seventeenth century, and now containing about 5000 volumes.</p>
                <p>The history of the library of Glasgow College, though curious and interesting, is
                    chiefly a register of the numerous successive donations by which it was
                    gradually formed. Amongst the names of its early benefactors we find that of
                    George Buchanan, who, it appears, presented to the college twenty volumes,
                    consisting entirely of Greek works, chiefly classics,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Such as the works of Plutarch, Plato,

                    other benefactions, the extent of which cannot now be ascertained. This library
                    is said to contain upwards of 30,000 volumes; and the funds for its support are
                    derived from the interest of certain small sums bequeathed by individuals, from
                    graduation fees, and from the contributions of students, including the interest
                    accruing from the deposit money. It also enjoys the privilege of receiving books

                <p>There was very early a library in each of the colleges at St Andrews; but no
                    mention is made of an university library until about the commencement of the
                    seventeenth century. At that period, there occurs a notice of such a <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193205375" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5375-0304"/> collection; and a
                    catalogue of its contents, made at the time, is still extant, the books being
                    chiefly presents from James VI. and the members of his family. With this public
                    university library, those of St Salvator’s and St Mary s Colleges came, in
                    process of time, to be incorporated; and, rather more than half a century ago,
                    that of St Leonard s College, the best of the collections, was conjoined with
                    the rest. As now constituted, the library is supported by the interest of money
                    made up out of the excess of the receipts above the expenditure of its funds,
                    the surplus rent of some teinds and lands held in lease from the exchequer,
                    certain fees on graduations, and an annual payment by every student of the
                    university, exclusively of its right to receive books from Stationers’
                    Hall.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>App. to Report, p.

                    whole, an excellent collection. There is a printed catalogue to the year 1826,
                    and a progressive manuscript one since that time.</p>
                <p>There is reason to believe, that from the first institution of the university of
                    Aberdeen there was a collection of books at King’s College, but no particular
                    record of the library or its management, prior to the year 1634, is now to be
                    found. The collection is considerable, containing from 15,000 to 20,000 printed
                    volumes, and a number of manuscripts. Amongst the latter are, a splendid copy of
                    the Koran, said to have belonged to Tippoo Sahib; a work on Hindu theology,
                    written upon fine vellum, and rolled on a piece of ivory like the <hi
                    rend="italic">volumina</hi> of the ancients; and a Shaster in Sanscrit, written
                    on the leaves of trees. This library is entitled to a copy of every book entered
                    at Stationers’ Hall. Its funds, however, arc altogether inadequate, not only for
                    the purchase of new, and particularly foreign publications,· but even for
                    binding the books obtained from Stationers’ Hall, in the way proper for a public
                    library. The library of Marischal College had its origin in a collection of
                    books made at the time of the Reformation by the magistrates of Aberdeen, and
                    partly procured from the suppressed monasteries of that city.<note

                    the interest of which was to be applied as a salary to a librarian. Reid’s

                <p>The library of Trinity College, Dublin, owed its establishment to a very curious
                    incident. In the year 1603, the Spaniards were defeated by the English at the
                    battle of Kinsale. Determined to commemorate their victory by some permanent
                    monument, the soldiers collected amongst themselves the sum of L.1800, which
                    they agreed to apply in the purchase of books for a public library, to be
                    founded in the then infant institution of Trinity College. This sum was placed
                    in the hands of the celebrated Usher, who immediately proceeded to London, and
                    there purchased the books necessary for the purpose. It is a curious
                    coincidence, that</p>
                <p>Usher, whilst occupied in purchasing these books, met in London Sir Thomas
                    Bodley, engaged in similar business, with a view to the establishment of his
                    famous library at Oxford. From this commencement, the library of Trinity College
                    was at different periods increased by many valuable donations, including that of
                    Usher’s own collection consisting of 10,000 volumes, until at length its growing
                    magnitude requiring a corresponding increase of accommodation, the present
                    library-hall, a magnificent apartment of stately dimensions, was erected in the
                    year 1732. In 1787 the entire collection consisted of 36,047 volumes of printed
                    books, and 1111 volumes of manuscripts and prints. But since that time great
                    additions have been made to the library. When the French invaded Holland in
                    1794, the collection of Pensionary Fagel, amounting to upwards of 20,000
                    volumes, was removed to England, where, in 1802, it was purchased by the College
                    for the sum of L.8000, granted for the purpose by the trustees of Erasmus
                    Smith.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Vι, <hi

                    was printed nı the beginning &lt; 1802. Speaking generally of this collection,
                    in the preface Mr Paterson says, “It is one genuine library, which has been
                    accumulating in the family of Fagel, a name of the first respectability, and
                    which has borne in succession the highes dvι offices in the united states of the
                    Netherlands upwards of one hundred and twenty years. It abounds in many of the
                    choicest books in theology and ecclesiastical history, in classical and
                    philological learning, and in most branches of polite literature, arts, and
                    sciences; it inc udes almost all the great <hi rend="italic">corpora</hi> of
                    history, antiquities, and diplomatic science; the books of prints, ar-chaio
                    ogical, numismatical, and topographical (which are very numerous), are commonly
                    of the best impressions: as an historical, geogiap ncal, genealogical, and
                    statistical library, it may justly rank among the most
                    distinguished.”</p></note> Another important addition was made to the original
                    collection by the acquisition of the valuable classical and ltalian books which
                    had belonged to Mr Quin; and, altogether, the library of Trinity College now
                    forms one of the first order, at least in this country. In the department of
                    printed books, the total number of volumes is now supposed to fall little short
                    of 100,000. The Usher manuscripts amount to 693, the Stearne to 135, the
                    Stearneand Alexander to 77, and those presented by other persons to upwards of
                    200 volumes. Usher’s manuscripts may be classed into Bibles, and parts of
                    Bibles, with commentaries; breviaries, missals, Roman rituals, the works of the
                    fathers, and oriental writers; systematic, scholastic, and polemic writers;
                    catalogues, philosophical, medical, and historical; and, lastly, Irish histories
                    and genealogies, civil and ecclesiastical. The subjects of the Stcarne
                    manuscripts are somewhat similar to these, with the exception that some of them
                    treat of forensic subjects.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Having described the principal libraries of Great Britain and Ireland, we shall
                    now proceed to those of foreign countries, and, in particular, endeavour to give
                    some account of the principal collections in France, Spain, Italy, Germany,
                    Poland, Russia, Denmark, and Sweden. This account, however, must necessarily be
                    brief and imperfect; for, owing to the magnitude of the subject, the space we
                    can devote to the whole would scarcely be sufficient for an adequate description
                    of the treasures contained in the Vatican or the Royal Library at Paris.</p>
                <p>The libraries of France may be divided into those of the capital, and those of
                    the departments. The principal libraries<pb break="no" facs="nls:193205388"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-5388-0305"/> of the capital are, the Royal Library, the
                    Mazarin Library, the library of the Arsenal, the library of St Genevieve, the
                    City Library, and the libraries of the Chamber of Peers, the Chamber of
                    Deputies, the Institute, and the University. The libraries of the departments
                    are two hundred and fifty in number, exclusively of those which are specially
                    annexed to learned bodies, to establishments of public utility, to colleges, and
                    other institutions.</p>
                <p>The Royal Library of Paris is justly considered as the finest in Europe. It was
                    commenced under the reign of King John, who possessed only <hi rend="italic"
                    >ten</hi> volumes, to which 900 were added by Charles V., many of them superbly
                    illuminated by John of Bruges, the best artist in miniatures of that time. Under
                    Francis I. it had increased to 1890 volumes, and under Louis XIII. to 16,746. In
                    1684 it possessed 50,542 volumes; in 1775 it amounted to 150,000; and by 1790 it
                    had increased to about 200,000. At present it contains about 700,000 printed
                    volumes, and 80,000 manuscripts. In 1667, Louis XIV. having ordered all the
                    medals and curiosities contained in the royal residences to be collected
                    together, caused them to be deposited in the library. Learned antiquarians, sent
                    into foreign countries, augmented this collection; rare and precious objects
                    were successively acquired; and the library at present possesses the richest and
                    most varied collection that exists in Europe. The cabinet of engravings, also
                    founded by Louis XIV., is composed of paintings on vellum, designs, and an
                    immense collection of prints and maps, from the discovery of engraving to the
                    present time. It contains 1,400,000 prints or engravings, and 50,000 maps and
                    charts.</p>
                <p>The Royal Library is at present divided into the following departments: viz. Isŕ,
                    printed books; <hi rend="smallcaps">2ćZ,</hi> manuscripts, charters, and
                    diplomas; 3űř, coins, medals, engraved stones, and other antique monuments; 4Λ⅞,
                    engravings, including geographical charts and plans. These four departments form
                    four distinct establishments, which, by their importance and the richness of
                    their treasures, exceed every thing of the kind that is to be found in other
                    countries. It is indispensable that the library should every year make the
                    acquisition either of foreign books or of French works in which it is deficient;
                    and it is equally obliged to purchase manuscripts, prints, charts, and medals. A
                    decree of 1556, which fell into desuetude during the troubles of the Fronde, but
                    was renewed in 1689, imposed on publishers the obligation of furnishing to the
                    Library of the King copies of all works printed by privilege; and each copy
                    required to be bound. At present the law prescribes the deposit of copies of all
                    books printed; but the other condition is dispensed with. In consequence of this
                    privilege, the Royal Library receives annually about 9000 volumes stitched; and
                    the number of foreign books sent to it, or acquired by purchase, may be
                    estimated at from 2000 to 3000 volumes. Now, as the price of the binding of each
                    volume is, on an average, three francs, it follows that a sum amounting to about
                    36,000 francs, or L.1450, would be necessary, every year, to defray the expense
                    of binding alone. But as the funds have for many years been insufficient to meet
                    the whole of this expense, the library has at present more than 120,000 volumes
                    stitched or in boards, and of these there are about <hi rend="superscript">
                    of</hi>- <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> 000 which urgently require binding. There
                    are likewise 15,000 manuscripts which either require to be bound, )r of which
                    the binding should be renewed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The additions from the Vatican Library, selected by the French commissioners in
                    1797, were particularly valuable, amounting to 501 manuscripts. Of these, twenty
                    were Hebrew; forty Syriac; nineteen Coptic; eleven Chinese; 133 Greek, amongst
                    which were the celebrated <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Vaticanus</hi> of the Septnagint; 176 Latin, including the famous Virgil of the

                    twelfth, Plautus of the eleventh, Pliny of the tenth, and Ovid of the twelfth
                    centuries; besides many other manuscripts illustrative of the history of the
                    ninth and tenth centuries. Numerous manuscripts in modern languages were also
                    seized in virtue of the compulsory treaty of Tolentino, particularly the
                    Commedia of Dante, transcribed by Boccacio, the Arcadia of Sannazaro, Michel
                    Angelo’s letters, and also those of Henry VIII. and Anne Boleyn; besides 136
                    early printed books, thirteen Etruscan vases, and 737 ancient coins. To these
                    must further be added the manuscripts collected by the French in other parts of
                    Europe, to which their victorious eagles had penetrated. But the events of 1814
                    and 1815 were followed by as complete a restitution of the literary treasures as
                    of the works of art acquired by right, or rather by abuse, of conquest. Of the
                    contents of this magnificent, nay matchless collection, it would far exceed our
                    limits to give any details, or even to enumerate the choicest articles. It is
                    rich in every branch and department, unique in some, scarcely surpassed in any,
                    unrivalled in all taken together. Of books printed on vellum, it contains at

                    expense of the establishment is 274,000 francs, or nearly L.11,000 sterling,
                    which is provided for in the budget. The principal librarian is the celebrated
                    Hellenist, Μ. Letronne, with the title of director-president; the conservators,

                    1653. in 4to, treats of some manuscripts, which are divided into historical and
                    chronological, biblical and theological, epistolary and diplomatic, technical
                    and philological. Anicetti Mellot’s catalogue of the manuscripts in the Royal
                    Library was printed at Paris, 1739-1744, in four vols. folio. The first volume
                    contains the oriental manuscripts; the second, the Greek manuscripts; the third
                    and fourth comprise those in the Latin language. The catalogue of the printed

                <p>This library was founded by Cardinal Mazarin. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193205401" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5401-0306"/>formation of it was intrusted
                    to the learned Gabriel Naudé, who, having first selected all that suited his
                    purpose in the booksellers’ shops in Paris, travelled into Holland, Italy,
                    Germany, and England, where the letters of recommendation of which he was the
                    bearer enabled him to collect many very rare and curious works. In 1648, this
                    collection consisted of 40,000 volumes, and was already a public library, though
                    that of the king did not become one until 1737. Cardinal Mazarin by his will
                    bequeathed it to the college which he founded, and which, until the epoch of the

                    volumes, and 3437 manuscripts. It is remarkable for a great number of
                    collections containing detached pieces, and small treatises, which date as far
                    back as the fifteenth century, and exist nowhere else; nor has any other library
                    so complete a body of the ancient books of law, theology, medicine, and the
                    physical and mathematical sciences. It also possesses a most precious collection
                    of the Lutheran or Protestant authors. In one of the halls are placed models in
                    relief of the Pelasgic monuments of Italy and of Greece; in another is a
                    terrestrial globe, eighteen feet in diameter, formed of plates of copper, and
                    executed by order of Louis XVI. This monument, which is unique in Europe, is
                    unfortunately not finished; a sum of 25,000 francs (L.1000) would be necessary
                    to provide it with the requisite circles. The Mazarin Library is habitually
                    frequented by more than an hundred readers. It is supported by an annual grant
                    of about L.1400, provided for in the budget.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>This library, founded by the Marquis de Paulmy, formerly ambassador of France in
                    Poland, was, in 1781, acquired by the Count d’Artois, who conjoined with it
                    nearly the whole of the library of the Duke de Vali. re. It consists of more
                    than 175,000 volumes, of which about 6000 are manuscripts. It possesses the most
                    complete collection extant of romances, since their origin in modern literature;
                    of theatrical pieces, or dramas, from the epoch of the moralities and mysteries;
                    and of French poetry since the commencement of the sixteenth century. It is less
                    rich in other branches, but it has all works of importance, and, in particular,
                    contains historical collections which are not to be found elsewhere. The library
                    of the Arsenal has always attracted the attention of the learned from all parts
                    of Europe. It is constantly frequented by more than sixty readers, who there
                    apply themselves to scientific and literary researches. The annual grant for its
                    support is 36,000 francs, or L.1440. Μ. Charles Nodier is principal
                    librarian.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>The foundation of this library dates as early as the year 1624, when Cardinal de
                    Rochefoucauld, having reformed the Sainte-Geneviève, made it a present of 600
                    volumes. In 1687, the abbey had already 20,000 printed volumes, and 400volumesof
                    manuscripts. In 1710, Letellier, archbishop of Paris, bequeathed to it all his
                    books. At the epoch of the Revolution it possessed 90,000 printed volumes and
                    3000 manuscripts; at present it contains 160,000 volumes and 3500 manuscripts.
                    In it may be found all the academical collections, and a complete set of
                    Aldines; it is particularly rich in historical works; and its most remarkable
                    manuscripts are Greek and oriental. Its typographical collections of the
                    fifteenth century are not more valuable for their number than the high state of
                    preservation in which they are found. This fine library is daily frequented by
                    upwards of two hundred persons, of whom more than a half are students in the
                    different faculties. It is supported by an annual grant from the public treasury
                    of</p>
                <p>40,500 francs, or upwards of L.1600. The principal librarian is M. de Laney.<note

                <p>The City Library contains 50,000 volumes, and is supported by a grant of 7500
                    francs from the funds of the municipal council. 1he library of the Chamber of
                    Peers contains 16,000 volumes, and has allotted to it a sum of 10,000 francs for
                    the purchase of booksand to defray the expense of binding. 1he library of the
                    Chamber of Deputies contains 50,000 volumes, and receives annually a sum of
                    12,000 francs for the same objects. The University Library, which is placed in
                    the buildings of the Sorbonne, consists of 40,000 volumes, and is very useful to
                    the students of the different faculties, who frequent it in the intervals
                    between the lectures or prelections. It expends annually a sum of about 1800
                    francs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>The foundation of the library of the Institute was the old City Library <hi
                    rend="italic">(Jl3ibliothequx de la VillC),</hi> which consisted of scarcely
                    20,000 volumes. At present this excellent and useful collection amounts to
                    nearly 80,000 volumes. It is not yet complete in any department; but it
                    nevertheless exhibits the best possible selection of the principal works in all
                    the important branches of human knowledge; and it may be truly said that it is
                    kept up to the actual state of science and learning. In the acquisitions which
                    are made, the objectis not to search for rare editions, but to obtain such as
                    possess some peculiar merit. Academical collections of all kinds and of all
                    countries, magazines and journals of science and literature in all languages,
                    are to be found in it in greater number than any where else. The library
                    increases daily. Numerous works are presented to the Institute, which, on its
                    part, is constantly making new acquisitions; and the premises allotted for its
                    accommodation have become insufficient to contain its accumulations. This
                    collection is reserved for the members of the five academies of which the
                    Institute is composed; but all strangers presented by them are admitted, and it
                    is <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> public. As it is open everyday during seven
                    hours, the service therein is more severe than in the other libraries, which are
                    only open four hours, and <hi rend="superscript"> en</hi> ; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o</hi> y vacations. The number of books has been quadrupled
                    since the institution of the library, and yet the number of the conservators and
                    assistants remains the same. The annual expense of the establishment, though
                    arranged with the strictest economy, amounts to 46,500 francs, or about
                    L.1860.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>The provincial libraries of France, as they are supported at the expense of the
                    different cities, are naturally placed under the immediate direction of the
                    mayors and municipal councils'; but they are not the less on that account under
                    the superintendence of the superior authority of the minister of public
                    instruction. Their number, as already stated, exceeds 250, exclusively of those
                    attached to societies, colleges, and other institutions. Amongst the most
                    considerable are those of Bordeaux (115,000), Lyons (100,000), Aix (75,000),
                    Besançon (56,000), Amiens (48,000), Versailles (40,000), Marseilles (35,000),
                    Toulouse (30,000), &amp;c. The catalogue of the manuscripts in the library of
                    Lyons, 1518 in number, is one of the most interesting which has issued from the
                    French press (Paris et Lyon, 1812, in three vols. 8vo). The preliminary
                    disquisition contains notices of the ancient libraries of Lyons; the historical
                    essay on manuscripts contains a neat account of the materials anciently used in
                    writing; the biography of writers who have treated of the subject, though brief
                    is worthy of attention; and the manuscripts are classed and described with equal
                    judgment and learning.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The number of public libraries in Spain is much greater than has commonly been
                    supposed; nor have the science and literature of that country sunk to such a
                    state of depression as some have been pleased to represent. Few nations, it is
                    true, have ever been doomed to pass through so long and dreary a course of
                    misgovernment; in none have bad laws corruptly administered, and a system of
                    civil polity at variance with every sound principle, done more to cramp the
                    energies and debase the general character of the people. But in spite of the
                    evils which have thus been entailed upon her, Spain is by no means the degraded
                    and benighted country which many have been led to suppose. Her scientific and
                    literary institutions are respectable; several of her establishments are
                    admirable; and some of her collections are unique. The very extravagance and
                    absurdity of her fiscal regulations and expurgatory prohibitions have served to
                    defeat their own operation; and the contrabandistas have ministered to those
                    wants which, under a better and more healthy system, would have been supplied by
                    the regular dealer.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Le

                    where there is a demand, no law can prevent the supply, though it may change the
                    direction in which it flows. Hence the quantity of books of every kind in
                    general circulation has at all times been much greater than persons unacquainted
                    with the real state and condition of that country could have imagined. But our
                    business here is with the public and permanent collections of Spain, which are,
                    the Royal Library at Madrid, the library of the Escurial, and the libraries of
                    the provinces.</p>
                <p>There are in Madrid four public libraries, which are constantly open from nine in
                    the morning until two in the afternoon, holidays excepted. Of these, the
                    principal is the <hi rend="italic">Biblioteea Peal,</hi> which was, several
                    years ago, removed to a building erected for the purpose in the square beside
                    the palace. This noble collection is open to all, as far at least as the printed
                    books are concerned. The reading-tables are placed in three spacious apartments,
                    corresponding to as many sides of the edifice, which is built round a court,
                    with a fine stair-ease in the centre; in the middle of these rooms are rows of
                    tables provided with writing materials and chairs; and against£the walls are the
                    book-shelves, numbered and tastefully ornamented. The catalogues are kept in a
                    small room apart, where there are two or three persons in attendance to answer
                    the inquiries of the stranger, and to furnish him with the number and shelf
                    where any particular work may be found. The service of the library is excellent.
                    The principal attendants, ten in number, are respectable literary men, who find
                    here a maintenance, and leisure to follow their different pursuits. The Royal
                    Library contains 200,000 printed volumes, and from 4000 to 5000 manuscripts,
                    amongst which are many valuable Greek, Latin, and Arabic manuscripts, and
                    unedited works, chiefly Spanish. The establishment of the library consists of
                    one principal librarian, D. Joaquin Patino, six keepers, and the ten attendants
                    already mentioned. The <hi rend="italic">Monetario,</hi> or cabinet of medals,
                    is arranged in an elegant and beautiful apartment, and contains an unrivalled
                    collection of</p>
                <p>Celtic, Phoenician, Carthaginian, Greek, Roman, Gothic, Arabic, and modern coins
                    and medals, in excellent preservation. “Le cabinet des médailles de Madrid,”
                    says Μ. Faure, “est sans doute le plus remarquable de l’Europe. Tandis que
                    Paris, qui l’emporte si incontestablement sur la capitale des Espagnes par les
                    monumens des arts et de l’antiquité, n’a que cent mille médailles dans sa
                    collection, il y en a cent quatre-vingt-trois mille dans celle de Madrid: cent

                    is one of the Greek manuscripts, by D. Juan Yriarte (Madrid, 1769, folio); a

                <p>The convent of the Escorial, situated upon the southern declivity of the
                    Guadarrama chain, about half way up the mountain, owes its existence to a vow
                    made by Philip II. during the crisis of the battle of Saint-Quintin. It derives
                    its name from San Lorenzo del Escorial,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    present we have only to do with the literary treasures contained in this
                    magnificent edifice. In the library of the Escorial there are about 130,000
                    printed volumes, and between 4000 and 5000 manuscripts, of which 567 are Greek,
                    67 Hebrew, and 1800 Arabic. The Arabie manuscripts were originally much more

                    remains is the number just stated. Besides these, which are extremely curious,
                    there arc detached manuscripts of great rarity and value, particularly one of
                    the Four Gospels, written on 160 leaves in gold letters, and supposed to be of
                    the tenth century; a treatise by St Augustin, <hi rend="italic">De
                    Eaptismο</hi><hi rend="italic">Parvulorum,</hi> said to be in his own
                    handwriting; the original works of St Teresa; and a parchment roll containing an
                    original Greek manuscript by St Basil. The books are placed, whimsically enough,
                    with their backs to the wall, so that the edges of the leaves are turned
                    outwards, and the titles of the works written thereon. This was the practice of
                    Arias Montanus, whose library formed the basis of that of the Escorial; and the
                    same absurd method has continued to be followed for the sake of what is called
                    uniformity. The library of the Escorial was founded by Charles V.<note

                    to between 9000 and 10,000 volumes each.</p>
                <p>Italy is rich in literary institutions of all kinds, particularly in noble
                    collections of books and manuscripts. Indeed there is scarcely a city in the
                    whole peninsula without its library; and many of those which are considered as
                    small collections in that country would be differently estimated in most others.
                    It is to be regretted, however, that of some of the larger collections, as for
                    instance the Ambrosian Library at Milan, no adequate account can be given, owing
                    to the inaccessibility of the necessary materials.</p>
                <p>Amongst the libraries of Italy, that of the Vatican, at Rome, stands pre-eminent,
                    not more for its grandeur and magnificence, than for the inestimable treasures
                    with which it is enriched. The origin of this library is attributed by some to
                    Pope Hilarius, who, in the fifth century, founded one in the Lateran Palace. But
                    although it is probable, that, even prior to that period, the Roman church must
                    have possessed a considerable stock of books for the use of its clergy, yet it
                    may be supposed that the pontiffs were too much occupied with the dangers and
                    difficulties of the times, to have either the leisure or the means necessary for
                    the formation of libraries. That a good many volumes, however, had been
                    collected at an early period, seems pretty certain; nor is it less so, that Pope
                    Zacharias considerably augmented their number about the middle of the eighth
                    century. Still Nicholas V., learned himself, and a distinguished patron of
                    letters, is justly considered as the founder of the Vatican Library; for of the
                    collections of his predecessors little remained when he ascended the papal
                    throne, the books having been either lost or destroyed by the frequent removals
                    from Rome to Avignon, and from Avignon to Rome. This pontiff added above 5000
                    manuscripts to the original collection, placing all in the Vatican; and Calixtus
                    III. is said to have enriched it with many volumes saved from the libraries of
                    Constantinople, when that city fell into the hands of the Ottomans. From this
                    period, it continued to increase in a regular progression, receiving almost
                    every year vast additions, sometimes even of whole libraries, owing not only to
                    the favour of the pontiffs and various princes, but also to the well-directed
                    zeal of its librarians, many of whom have been men of eminent talents as well as
                    of high rank and extensive influence.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    reign of Pope Urban VIII. a most valuable addition was made by the purchase of
                    the library at Heidelberg, belonging to the Elector Palatine; and those of the
                    Dukes of Urbino, and Christina queen of Sweden, were likewise annexed to the
                    collection in the Vatican. The same pontiff despatched Leo Allatius into Germany
                    for the purpose of selecting the most valuable books to be sent to Rome;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Allatius wrote in Italian a

                    conjoined with the liberality of subsequent popes, the Vatican Library became
                    the richest perhaps in the world, at least in manuscripts, before the most
                    valuable of these were conveyed to Paris in the year 1797.</p>
                <p>This magnificent library consists of three divisions or compartments, besides the
                    vestibule; the ante-room, the double gallery, and the great saloon or hall. The
                    vestibule contains Chinese works relating to geography and chronology, together
                    with two columns bearing ancient inscriptions. The ante-room is appropriated to
                    the two keepers of the library, and the secretaries, or rather interpreters,
                    seven in number, who can speak the principal languages of Europe, and who attend
                    for the convenience of learned foreigners. In this apartment are also
                    accommodated those engaged in translating from the Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac,
                    Greek, and Latin languages; and it is open daily for the use of students,
                    Thursdays and holidays alone excepted. Passing from the ante-room, the visitant
                    enters a double gallery of two hundred and twenty feet in length, which
                    strangers at first conceive to be the whole library; but at its extremity there
                    opens upon the astonished visitant, in almost interminable perspective, another
                    gallery, which, according to some, exceeds a thousand English feet in

                    and painted with varied effect by painters of different eras and talents,
                    constitute the receptacle of this noble collection. The books are all kept in
                    close cases; and in the Vatican the stranger seeks in vain for that imposing
                    display of volumes which he may have seen and admired in other libraries. The
                    number of these has never been accurately stated; some confine it to 200,000,
                    others raise it to 400,000, and some swell it to more than 800,000,<note

                    exaggeration into the other extreme, reduce it as low as 90,000, and even below
                    50,000, or the number of the manuscripts. This monstrous discrepancy has been
                    occasioned partly by the want of a catalogue, and partly also by the books being
                    kept in close cases; but when we take into view the successive accumulations of
                    so many centuries, and consider the number of entire libraries which have, at
                    different times, been combined with this vast collection, we shall not probably
                    err in estimating the total number of printed volumes at upwards of 500,000,
                    amongst which is a choice collection of books printed in the fifteenth
                    century.</p>
                <p>But the superiority of this library consists not so much in the quantity of
                    printed books it contains, as in the number of its manuscripts, which are said
                    to exceed 50,000.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    pumber of manuscripts, like that of printed books, has been variously stated. In
                    Starke’s Guide (art. <hi rend="italic">Biblioteca Vaticana,</hi> c. vii.) it is
                    set down as “forty thousand.” The authoress of <hi rend="italic">Rome in the
                    Nineteenth Century</hi> (vol. ii. p. 380) informs us that the col <pb break="no"

                    And Mr Eustace says that it is supposed to exceed “fifty thousand.’ The last
                    estimate, we have reason to believe, is the nearest to the truth. As to the
                    authoress of <hi rend="italic">Rome,</hi> she evidently writes on a subject
                    which she had not examined. Vasi, after describing the rarities of the Vatican,

                    century, written in capital letters, and illuminated with miniatures,
                    representing the Latins and Trojans in the respective dresses of their own
                    times; a Terence equally ancient; another of the ninth century, illuminated with
                    ancient masks; a Greek Bible of the sixth century, written in capital letters,
                    according to the Septuagint version, and from which all the subsequent copies
                    have been taken; and the Gospels of St Luke and St John, written in the tenth
                    century, and bound in ivory. Amongst the rare manuscripts in this splendid
                    collection may also be mentioned, several Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, and Armenian
                    Bibles; a very large Hebrew Bible presented to the library by the Duke of
                    Urbino, for which the Venetian Jews offered its weight in gold; a Greek

                    presented to Innocent VIII. by the queen of Cyprus; a Missal written in 1118;
                    another adorned with miniatures by Giulio Clovio, the scholar of Giulio Romano,
                    and the finest miniature-painter of his time; a large Breviary, ornamented with
                    beautiful miniatures, and presented to the library by Matthias Corvinus, king of
                    Hungary; the Annals of Baronius, in twelve volumes, written with his own hand;
                    several volumes of Ecclesiastical History, by the learned Onofrio Panvinio; a

                    manuscript of Pliny, with five miniatures of animals; a beautiful copy of

                    Sacraments by Henry VIII. of England; several Letters between that royal
                    wife-killer and Anne Boleyn; several papers written by Martin Luther; and
                    manuscripts on Egyptian papyrus. This library possesses a very fine cabinet of
                    medals, which was carried off by the French, but compulsorily restored, after
                    the events of 1814 and 1815. There is also attached to it a chamber filled with
                    a fine collection of prints, to which admission can only be obtained by a
                    particular order; and in another are deposited the secret archives of the
                    Vatican, to which, of course, there is no admission at all. A cardinal is always
                    nominal librarian; but the actual head of the Vatican Library is the celebrated
                    Angelo Maio, so distinguished for the discoveries which he has made by
                    deciphering the palimpsest or rescribed manuscripts.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The Ambrosian Library, notwithstanding its appellation, has no connection with
                    antiquity, and owes its existence entirely to the munificence of Cardinal
                    Federigo Borromeo, nephew of Charles Borromeo, and his successor in the see of
                    Milan. This prelate began to collect books, when a student at Rome; and
                    enlarging his plan as he advanced in age and dignities, he, when raised to the
                    archbishopric of Milan, erected an edifice, placed in it his collection, and
                    opened it to the public under the title of <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca
                    Ambrosiana.</hi> This library contains between 40,000 and 50,000 printed
                    volumes, and upwards of 15,000 manuscripts; and there is annexed to it a gallery
                    of pictures, statues, antiques, and medals, comprising many articles of great
                    rarity and value. In the department of manuscripts is a collection of the

                    rescribed manuscripts, which have issued in the recovery of some ancient remains
                    believed to have been for ever lost, and entitled this ingenious and

                <p>Bologna, celebrated for its scientific and literary insti-. tutions, and its
                    academy for the encouragement and promotion of art, boasts likewise a great
                    public library. This extensive collection, consisting of above 100,000 printed
                    volumes, and from 4000 to 5000 manuscripts, is contained in the Manfredi Palace,
                    and is open to the public six days in the week. In the same palace are, an

                <p>The public libraries at Florence are the Mediceo-Lau-renzana, or Laurentian; the
                    collection bequeathed to the public by Magliabechi, by whose name it is
                    distinguished; the Marucelliana; the Riccardiana, which was purchased not long
                    since of the Riccardi family; and the library of the <hi rend="italic">Belle
                    Arti,</hi> containing the books which were taken out of the suppressed
                    convents.</p>
                <p>The Mediceo-Laurentian Library, which is contained in the convent annexed to the
                    church of San Lorenzo, was commenced by Cosmo de’ Medicis, the father of a line
                    of princes whose name and age are almost synonymous with the restoration of
                    learning. “His credit,” says Gibbon, “was ennobled into fame; his riches were
                    dedicated to the service of mankind: he corresponded at once with Cairo and
                    London; and a cargo of Indian spices and Greek books were often imported by the
                    same vessel.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    136.</p></note> As the natural disposition of this princely merchant led him to
                    take a very active part in collecting the remains of classical antiquity, so his
                    wealth and extensive commercial intercourse enabled him to gratify his taste to
                    the fullest extent. He enjoined his friends and correspondents, as well as the
                    missionaries who travelled into remote countries, to search for and procure
                    ancient manuscripts in every language and upon every subject. He availed himself
                    of the services of the most learned men, his contemporaries; and the situation
                    of the eastern empire, then falling into ruins, afforded him an opportunity of
                    obtaining many valuable works in the Hebrew, Greek, Chaldaic, Arabic, and Indian
                    languages. After the death of Cosmo, his son pursued the same object with steady
                    perseverance, and added considerably to the treasures which had been accumulated
                    by his father. But although the ancestors of Lorenzo de’ Medicis had laid the
                    foundation of the Laurentian library, the honour of raising the superstructure
                    belonged to Lorenzo himself, whose assiduity and liberality in enlarging his
                    collection of books, manuscripts, and antiquities, were unbounded. To this
                    object his time and his fortune, exceeding that of princes, were equally
                    devoted. Shortly after the death of Lorenzo, however, this matchless collection
                    was dispersed by the French troops under Charles VIII. in resentment of some
                    imaginary insult; and in the perpetration of this sacrilegious deed, “the Gallic
                    herd” were joined by the Florentines themselves, who openly carried off, or
                    secretly purloined, whatever they could discover that was most rare, curious,
                    and valuable. The library, however, was subsequently restored by the
                    perseverance and liberality of Leo X. who caused it to be removed to Rome; but
                    it was reconveyed to Florence by his successor Clement VII., who, by a bull
                    dated the 15th of December 1532, made provision for its future security. <note

                <p>Magliabechi, from being a servant to a dealer in vegetables, raised himself to
                    the honourable office of librarian to the Grand Duke of Tuscany at Florence, and
                    became one of the most eminent literary characters of his time. The force of
                    natural talent overcame all the disadvantages of the humble condition in which
                    he had been born, and placed him in a situation to make his name known and
                    respected. But he endeavoured to deserve still better of his countrymen, by
                    presenting them, some time before his death in 1714, with his large and valuable
                    collection of books, together with what remained of his fortune, as a fund for
                    its support. This constituted the foundation of the Magliabechian Library,
                    which, by the subsequent donations of several benefactors, and the bounty of
                    some of the grand dukes, was so much increased both in number and value, that it
                    may now vic with some of the most considerable collections in Europe. The books
                    printed in the fifteenth century have been described by the Abbate Follini, the
                    present librarian, who dedicated his catalogue<note anchored="true"

                    catalogue of the library. It is particularly rich in the early productions of
                    the Italian press, which are described alphabetically, with much accuracy of
                    detail; and to these are added brief notices of the lives of the different
                    authors, derived from the most authentic sources. The Magliabechian Library is
                    supposed to contain 150,000 printed volumes, and 9000 manuscripts; and the
                    public are admitted to it every day of the year, except on Sundays and
                    festivals. The Librarian has an annual stipend of 240 scudi, but not more than
                    100 scudi are expended annually in the purchase and binding of books.<note

                    Faria of the Laurentian, and it is open every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The
                    Riccardi collection is managed by the Canon Bianchi and a sub-librarian; it
                    contains 26,000 volumes. The collection of the <hi rend="italic">Belle Arti</hi>
                    consists of 11,000 volumes, and is open to the public every Tuesday, Thursday,
                    and Saturday. The disbursements on account of these various libraries are made
                    by their respective librarians, under the control of the minister of the
                    interior; the sums expended, however, are but trifling. The libraries of the
                    universities of Pisa and Sienna are valuable, each of them possessing about
                    50,000 volumes, to which an annual addition of <pb break="no"

                    scudi is respectively made. In almost all the provincial towns of Tuscany, there
                    are also to be found public libraries more or less extensive, which are all
                    placed under the control of the communal magistrates.<note anchored="true"

                <p>There are five public libraries at Naples, viz. the Royal Library, the
                    Brancacciano Library, the library of the University, the library of the Military
                    Staff, and the library of the Monks of St Jerome. The Royal Library contains
                    about 300,000 printed volumes and 6000 manuscripts; the University possesses
                    50,000 volumes; the Convent of St Jerome has an equal number; the Brancacciano
                    contains 10,000; and the Military Staff has 10,000. The public have free
                    admission to read in these libraries, but no books are allowed to be taken away.
                    They are all open every day, for about six hours, excepting on holidays, when
                    they are closed. The expenses of the Royal Library arc included in those of the
                    Museum, of which it forms part. It is entitled to two copies of all books
                    printed in the kingdom of Naples; and 4000 ducats (L.687) are annually
                    appropriated to the purchase of foreign books. The expenses of the library of St
                    Jerome are defrayed out of the funds of the Convent to which it belongs; but,
                    like the Brancacciano, the Military Staff, and the University Libraries, it is
                    entitled to one copy of every book printed in the kingdom of Naples. This
                    collection is singularly rich, chiefly in ancient books. There are no public
                    libraries in any of the provincial towns, excepting Foggia and Lucera; but in
                    every diocese there is a library belonging to the see, to which, upon
                    application, admission may at all times be readily obtained.<note

                <p>The remaining libraries in Italy are numerous, and some of them considerable,
                    particularly those of Venice and Turin. In the library of St Mark at Venice,
                    there is a copy of the Gospel of the evangelist of that name, which is affirmed
                    to have been written by himself. This library was founded in the fourteenth
                    century, the ςpllection having been begun by Petrarch, who bequeathed his books
                    to the republic. Cardinal Bessarion, by his will, added to the library the
                    curious collection of manuscripts which he had formed in Constantinople, in
                    Egypt, and in Greece; and further additions were subsequently made to it by
                    other cardinals. The library of St Mark is deposited in two apartments, one of
                    which is appropriated to manuscripts, whilst the other contains the printed
                    books. Though small when compared with other libraries of the Continent, this
                    collection includes many rare and valuable articles.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Balbi, in the appendix to his <hi

                    attention is paid by the Austrian government. This unparalleled collection
                    contains 8,664,709 stitched quires, divided into 1890 departments, and arranged
                    in 298 apartments. But whether its value corresponds with its magnitude, is a
                    point on which we have been left to our own conjectures. See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Athenaenm</hi> for the 19th March 1836.</p></note> The library attached to the
                    university of Turin contains 112,000 printed books, and a rich collection of
                    manuscripts. It is open to the public in general every day except festivals.
                    Connected with the university are several museums, particularly that of Egyptian
                    antiquities, purchased by the king, of Mr Drovetti, which is one of the richest
                    and most valuable in Europe. Attached to the university of Genoa, which now
                    belongs to the king of Sardinia, is a library, consisting of about 45,000
                    volumes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The General

                    Novara, and Vercelli. From a rescribed manuscript discovered by Niebuhr, the

                <p>The libraries of Germany, taking that name in its widest acceptation, are, some
                    of them, of the first order, and many of them extensive and important; but, from
                    the length to which this article has already extended, we must confine our
                    notices exclusively to the principal collections, which we shall describe in the
                    order, not of place or of time, but of their relative magnitude and value.</p>
                <p>The Imperial Library at Vienna is perhaps inferior only to that of the Vatican
                    and the Royal Library at Paris, for the rarity and value of its contents. It was
                    founded by the Emperor Frederick III. who spared no expense to enrich it with
                    printed bocks as well as manuscripts in every language. By the munificence of
                    succeeding emperors, numerous important and valuable accessions were made to the
                    collection; amongst which may be mentioned the large and interesting library of
                    Prince Eugene, and a considerable portion of the Buda Library, founded by
                    Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary. The Imperial Library occupies eight spacious
                    apartments; and a ninth is appropriated to a very valuable collection of medals
                    and other curiosities.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    are disposed according to their sizes, and comprise almost a complete series,
                    exhibiting the origin and progress of the typographic art. The number of works
                    printed in the fifteenth century exceeds 12,000, amongst which are four out of
                    the five <hi rend="italic">incunabula</hi> on vellum, printed by Pannartz at
                    Rome. Here also is a copy of the Soncino Bible, printed in 1488, by far the
                    scarcest, and perhaps the most valuable of all the impressions; a copy of the
                    first edition of Apuleius, printed in 1469, on vellum, and unique; and a copy of
                    the first edition of Aulus Gellius, printed the same year, on vellum, and also
                    unique. These two treasures were once the property of Cardinal Bessarion, and
                    are comparatively but recent acquisitions of the imperial collection. The
                    Florence Dante of 1481, with the commentary of Landino, and the plates of
                    Baldini from designs by Boticelli, is likewise in this library. This is the
                    finest copy extant, excepting that in Earl Spencer’s collection, each of which
                    possesses twenty copperplates.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    letters, according to the ancient orthography, profusely illuminated, and

                    together with many other rare, curious, and interesting manuscripts. The Greek
                    manuscripts in the Imperial Library have been described by Lambecius, Nessel,
                    and Kollarius, whose labours were confined to this class; and in the important
                    and accurate work of Denis may be found an ample account of the Latin, with a
                    few notices of oriental manuscripts, the ages of the different manuscripts being
                    stated where these could be ascertained. Besides the cabinet of medals, there is
                    also attached to the library a superb collection of engravings, consisting of
                    473 large folio volumes, 510 volumes of different sizes, and 215 folio cartoons.
                    The collection of music contains 6000 volumes, theoretical and practical; and
                    that of autographs exceeds 8000 pieces, classed under the heads of monarchs and
                    princes, ministers and statesmen, poets, philosophers, and men of learning or
                    science, generals and renowned warriors, artists, and others. The sum allowed
                    for the purchase of new books is about L.2000 annually. The Imperial Library is
                    open to the public every day except on Sundays, holidays, and the
                    vacations.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Balbi, <hi

                <p>In Vienna, the University Library ranks next to the Imperial Library, but the
                    number of books in it is not stated by Balbi. It received the collections which
                    belonged to the convents suppressed by Joseph II.; and since 1806 it has had a
                    right to a copy of every work printed in Lower Austria. Amongst what are called
                    the private libraries, the most important is that of Military Archives,
                    established in 1801, upon a plan devised by the Archduke Charles. It contains
                    6626 works on military science and art; twenty large folio volumes of bulletins,
                    gazettes, and journals, with an index; seventy-three atlasses, with about 3000
                    charts, maps, and plans, of various kinds; and a small collection of manuscript
                    military memoirs, amongst which are those of Montecuculi, who commanded the
                    imperialists opposed to Turenne, and of Prince Eugene. The libraries of oriental
                    literature, of natural history, of the Philharmonic Society, and of the Imperial
                    Archives, are also of great value. In the last are preserved the archives of
                    Venice, and Marino Sanudo’s original history of that republic, in fifty-six
                    volumes, which was unknown when Μ. Daru published his celebrated work. Of the
                    libraries belonging to individuals, the most remarkable are those of Prince
                    Metternich, Μ. Von Hammer, and Mr Castelli. Von Hammer possesses an unrivalled
                    collection of Turkish manuscripts. Mr Castelli’s is a dramatic collection,
                    containing upwards of 10,000 German dramas, original and translated; about 500
                    manuscripts; 700 portraits of actors, actresses, and dramatists; and an unique
                    collection of play-bills from the year 1600. The total number of libraries,
                    public and private, in Vienna, is forty-five; and even the latter are accessible
                    to students furnished with proper introductions.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The Royal Library at Munich is the most extensive collection in Germany,
                    containing 500,000 volumes of printed books and 16,000 volumes of manuscripts;
                    thus exceeding the Imperial Library at Vienna by 150,000 printed volumes, and
                    equalling it in the number of manuscripts. From a discourse on the origin and
                    increase of the library at Munich, delivered in 1784, by the Canon
                    Steigenberger, the librarian, and translated into Latin by Vitali, it appears
                    that the Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, Greek, and Latin manuscripts contained in this
                    library then formed a precious treasure; and, since the period to which this
                    discourse refers, numerous and important additionshave been made to all the
                    departments of the collection. The ancient manuscripts relative to the art of
                    music amount to a great number, and are exceedingly curious·<note

                    collection, which is most complete in general history, and in Greek and Latin
                    classic authors. Amongst the printed books are some of the rarest specimens of
                    early typography, .including 600 of the Aldine editions, and many on vellum,

                    with a vast quantity of valuable porcelain, partly of foreign, and partly of
                    Dresden manufacture. The expenses of the Royal Library are defrayed by the
                    state. The sum of 2500 dollars, equal to L.375, is allowed yearly for the
                    purchase of books, binding, &amp;c. The only other public library in Saxony is

                <p>The library attached to the university of Göttingen contains 300,000 printed
                    volumes, and 5000 volumes of manuscripts. But its extent is its least
                    recommendation; for it is not only the most complete amongst the universities,
                    but there are very few royal or public collections in Germany which can rival it
                    in real utility; and if not in Germany, where else? It is not rich in
                    manuscripts, even including the acquisitions which it made from Helmstadt, when
                    the university of that place was dissolved; and many other libraries, as Mr
                    Russell justly observes, surpass it in typographical rarities, and specimens of
                    typographical luxury; but none contains so great a number of really useful
                    books, in almost every branch of human knowledge, This library is mainly
                    indebted for the pre-eminence it has obtained to the labours and exertions of
                    the illustrious Heyne. In the year in which he came to Göttingen as second
                    librarian, the entire control of the library was committed to him, and he became
                    chief. From this moment commenced at once its extension and its improvement.
                    When Heyne went to Göttingen, it already possessed a library of from 50,000 to
                    60,000 volumes, which, compared with those of most universities, was a
                    considerable collection. At his decease it had, according to the most moderate
                    computation, increased, exclusively of extraordinary acquisitions, to upwards of
                    200,000 volumes. But this increase of number was its smallest claim to
                    admiration. At the commencement of this period entire departments of learning
                    were wholly wanting; at its close not only were these deficiencies supplied, but
                    the library had become proportionally rich in every department, and, in point of
                    completeness, unrivalled. It would be interesting to trace the manner in which
                    this change was effected; but neither our plan nor our space admits of such
                    details. The system of catalogues appears to be somewhat complete. There are, in
                    fact, four catalogues connected with each other. Every addition to the library
                    is first entered in the <hi rend="italic">Manual</hi> of the year, in which are
                    concisely written the title and date of the book, and the day of its reception.
                    Then the book is entered with its full title in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Accession-Catalogue,</hi> which is also commenced with every year, and forms at
                    its close four volumes; the first containing entries of books on theology; the
                    second, of books on jurisprudence; the third, of those on history; and the
                    fourth, miscellaneous works. These two catalogues are intended more particularly
                    for the use of the librarians; the remaining two are for readers. The third of
                    the series is a complete <hi rend="italic">Alphabetical Catalogue,</hi> in which
                    every book is entered under the author’s name, when given, or, when not given,
                    but known, with a reference thereto under the chief word of the title. Every
                    book of which the author’s name is not known, is entered under such chief word
                    of title; and, on one side, are also entered the date and form, with reference
                    to the entries of the same book in the Manual and the Accession-Catalogue; on
                    the other is entered the head of the classed catalogue to which the book
                    belongs. Lastly, the book is entered in the <hi rend="italic">Classed</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Scientific Catalogue,</hi> according to its subject, and is
                    then placed in that division of the library to which it belongs. The
                    alphabetical catalogue answers the question, whether a certain book is in the
                    library, and where it is to be found; and the scientific or classed catalogue
                    shows what books are contained in the library upon any given subject. Such is a
                    brief account of the mechanism of this very extensive library. A full exposition
                    of it would require the scientific <hi rend="italic">schematismus</hi> upon
                    which the whole is founded, and would lead us to take a general survey of human
                    knowledge.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Heeren, <hi

                <p>The Royal Library at Berlin contains 250,000 volumes of printed books, and 5000
                    volumes of manuscripts. This collection includes works upon almost all the
                    sciences, and in nearly all languages, but it is perhaps most complete in the
                    sciences. Amongst the manuscripts are several Egyptian deeds, written on
                    papyrus, in the demotic or enchorial character, but whether with or without
                    Greek registries, we have not ascertained. Professor Kosegarten, in his first

                    according to Dr Young’s method of interpretation. The same department also
                    includes several manuscripts of Lacroze, the celebrated author of the Coptic
                    Lexico, particularly his reply to Bergier, in which he mentions the additions
                    made to the Royal Library, the librarians, the number of books at the time when
                    he wrote, and the curious articles contained in the collection. No complete
                    catalogue has ever, so far as we know, been printed. Heinrick’s <hi

                    the latter including only the first two letters of the alphabet; but, even if
                    they had been finished works, they could have afforded little or no help in
                    ascertaining the actual contents of the collection. A good analytical account of
                    this library is still a desideratum.</p>
                <p>The public library at Stuttgart contains 197,000 printed volumes, and 1800
                    volumes of manuscripts. It is divided into three departments, each of which is
                    under the superintendence of one of the librarians, who are charged with the
                    purchase and binding of books, the keeping of catalogues, and other duties. The
                    general government of the library is vested in directors, who endeavour, as far
                    as their means allow, to procure every thing that is of real worth or value.
                    Recommendations from any of the authorities of the state, for the purchase of
                    particular works, are invariably attended to. All booksellers in the kingdom are
                    required to furnish a copy of every work published by them. To certain persons,
                    and under certain regulations, books are allowed to be lent out from the
                    library. The <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205505" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5505-0314"

                    about 4000 are expended in the purchase of books; and it is defrayed out of the
                    public treasury. There is a provincial library at Tubingen.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The library of Wolfenbuttel is little inferior to that of Stuttgart; it contains
                    190,000 printed volumes, with a few manuscripts. Besides the libraries connected
                    with various public institutions, as the Seckenburg Museum, and the institution
                    of Staendel for the Fine Arts, there is a public library at Frankfort, called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Stadt Bibliothek.</hi> This collection contains 50,000
                    volumes of printed books, and 500 volumes of manuscripts, of which 20 are
                    Abyssinian, 12 Turkish and Persian, 6 Hebrew, 2 Indian and Burmese, and the rest
                    in Latin, German, and other languages. No catalogue of this library has been
                    published since 1728; but a new descriptive one is, it seems, in progress. The
                    annual expense, which amounts to about 4400 florins, is principally contributed
                    by the public treasury.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Appendix to Report, pp. 492, 493.</p></note> The library of Naumburg was
                    founded in the sixteenth century by Julius Pflug, bishop of that place, who is
                    celebrated in ecclesiastical history as a zealous opponent of the Reformation,
                    and as one of the three divines deputed by Charles V. to draw up the plan of the
                    Interim in 1548. In the seventeenth century this library received a further
                    augmentation by the purchase of the collection of books formed by Thomas
                    Reinesius. The printed books and manuscripts, though fewjn number, are of
                    considerable value. Amongst the latter are the Scholia of Olympiodorus on
                    several of Plato’s Dialogues, written in the sixteenth century; a fragment of
                    Orpheus’s Argonautics, of the fifteenth; the Olympic Odes of Pindar, of the
                    sixteenth, apparently transcribed from an ancient manuscript; the Cassandra of
                    Lycophron, with the Commentary of Tzetzes, dated 1438; and several tracts of
                    Jamblichus, on the Pythagorean philosophy, belonging to the fifteenth
                    century.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Horne, <hi

                <p>There are many libraries in Holland, indeed almost every city has one, but the
                    principal collection is that belonging to the university library of Leyden. This
                    library was founded by λVilliam I. prince of Orange, and is justly celebrated
                    throughout Europe for the many valuable specimens of Greek and oriental
                    literature with which it abounds. To it Joseph Scaliger bequeathed his fine
                    collection of Hebrew books; and it was further enriched by the learned Golius,
                    on his return from the East, with many Arabic, Turkish, Persian, and Chaldaic
                    manuscripts. In addition to these, it received the collections of Holmanus, and
                    particularly those of Isaac Vossius and Ruhnken; the former containing a great
                    number of valuable manuscripts, supposed to have once belonged to Christina
                    queen of Sweden; and the latter, an almost entire series of classical authors,
                    with a collection of manuscripts, perhaps unique, amongst which are to be found
                    copies of several that were consumed by fire in the Abbey of St
                    Ger-ιnain-des-Prez. The library at Leyden is computed to contain 60,000 printed
                    volumes, and 14,000 volumes of manuscripts, many of which, as we have seen, are
                    equally curious and valuable.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>At Brussels there are two principal libraries; one of which, composed of printed
                    books, belongs to the city, and the other, consisting entirely <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> manuscripts, belongs to the government. The former was founded on that
                    which formerly appertained to the house of Burgundy, a family that gave to
                    Flanders several counts or earls, by whose liberality it was enriched with
                    numerous valuable manuscripts which, it would appear, are now separated from the
                    collection. Santander<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    library through its various fortunes, having been successively burned, buried
                    under ground, and decimated by French commissaries on the capture of Brussels.
                    Though restored to its ancient splendour by the care of Count de Cobentzel and
                    of Prince Stahremberg, minister plenipotentiary of the empress-queen, its
                    prosperity was of short duration. For, when the French armies overran the
                    Netherlands, and occupied Brussels, in 1797, Laurent, the representative of the
                    people, caused seven waggon-loads of books and manuscripts to be taken from the
                    Burgundy Library; and some time afterwards, Wailly, Leblond, and others, deputed
                    to commit a second spoliation, selected about 200 manuscripts for the National
                    (RoyaD Library at Paris. In 1797, a place was provided for the reception of the
                    books belonging to the. Burgundy Library; and in 1798, the collection was
                    enriched with all that was most valuable from the great depot of the Cordeliers,
                    which was then broken up. Since that period the Brussels Library has, by gradual
                    acquisitions, become more extensive than ever, and at present contains 140,000
                    volumes of printed books. The library of the government, as it is called,
                    comprises 15,000 volumes of manuscripts, which, however, have not been
                    particularly described. The city library is open four days in the week, from ten
                    o’clock in the morning until two in the afternoon, and the public have free
                    access to the collection. The ordinary annual expense of this establishment
                    amounts to 4800 francs (a mere trifle), but additional sums are from time to
                    time granted for the purchase of books. The library of the government is open
                    every day from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon; and the annual
                    expense amounts to 10,000 francs. The first of these establishments is supported
                    by the city, the second by the government out of the public treasury. The
                    provincial libraries of Belgium are those of Antwerp, Bruges, Ghent, Liège,
                    Louvain, Mons, Namur, and Tournay, three of which (those of Ghent, Liège, and
                    Louvain) are under the direction of the universities established at these
                    places, whilst the others are under the superintendence of the local

                <p>It is well known that a noble library, rich in valuable manuscripts, had been
                    formed at Buda, by the celebrated Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary; but this
                    collection was dispersed, on the capture of Buda by the Turks under Solyraan in
                    1526; and Cardinal Bozman in vain offered the conqueror two thousand crowns to
                    restore this part of the spoil. Some of the books which belonged to it have been
                    found in the Imperial Library at Vienna, in that of Wolfenbuttel, and in the
                    private collection of Morelli, librarian of St Mark’s at Venice.<note

                    modern; but it contains a manuscript, in three folio volumes, with nearly two
                    hundred fine drawings, descriptive of the antiquities excavated at Velleia
                    between the years 1760 and 1765. The university of Warsaw, founded by the
                    Emperor Alexander in 1816, had accumulated a library of about 150,000 volumes;
                    but, since the events of 1830 and 1831, every book and pamphlet in it, conceived
                    to be hostile to the Russian government, have been removed, and numbers of
                    scientific works have likewise been abstracted and sent off' to St Petersburg.
                    The university of Cracow has also attached to it a library, containing about
                    4000 manuscripts, amongst which is a Latin encyclopaedia, in a large folio
                    volume, written by Paul of Prague in 1459. But the most extensive and valuable
                    collection in Poland was that which Count Zaluski and his brother had formed,
                    and which, in 1747, was devoted to the public. The Zaluski Library, called also
                    the Library of the Republic, originally consisted of 300,000 volumes, including
                    upwards of 50,000 duplicates, which were subsequently disposed of; and by the
                    sale of these, together with the losses sustained by various depredations, the
                    collection was supposed, in 1791, not greatly to exceed 200,000 volumes. At
                    length, in 1795, this library was unceremoniously seized by Suwarof, hastily
                    packed up, and despatched to St Petersburg, to aggrandise the conqueror with the
                    literary spoils of Poland.</p>
                <p>The Imperial Library of St Petersburg is, according to Mr Edwards, “the <hi
                    rend="italic">creation</hi> of but a few years.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Letter to Benjamin Hawes, Esq. Μ. P. p. 35,
                    note.</p></note> ʹ We confess our inability to understand what this gentleman
                    means by the word “creation” here employed by him. A robber does not surely
                    create the wealth which he forcibly appropriates. Considerably more than half
                    the actual contents of the Imperial Library were obtained by one act of
                    wholesale spoliation. The French, when they conquered Italy and Belgium,
                    decimated the libraries of those countries. But the Russians, when they
                    triumphed over the independence of Poland, carried off entirely the largest
                    collection of books which that country could boast of. The original founder of
                    this library was Joseph, count de Zaluski, bishop of Kiof. In the space of
                    forty-three years he had acquired, at his own expense, above 200,000 volumes.
                    His brother, Andrew Zaluski, bishop of Cracow, enriched this numerous
                    collection, as well with books drawn from the museum of John III. king of
                    Poland, as with those which he collected from the libraries of his uncles,
                    Andrew Olszofski, primate of the kingdom of Poland, Prince Andrew Chrysostom,
                    bishop of Warmia, and Louis Bartholomew, bishop of Plock; and after having
                    joined to these the collection in his own cabinet, he transferred the whole, in
                    1742, to a house which had previously belonged to the family of Danilovitch, and
                    had probably come to him by inheritance. In 1747 he rendered it public, and
                    fixed an annual income or endowment for its support and increase. After thedeath
                    of this prelate, his brother, Joseph Zaluski, still further augmented it by the
                    addition of a great number of volumes, and, by his will, made in 1761,
                    bequeathed it, along with the house in which it was deposited, to the college of
                    Jesuits at Warsaw.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“The
                    celebrated library of Zaluski at Warsaw,” says Denis, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introduction to the Knowledge of Books,</hi> “was opened to the public in i747.
                    It must contain at present near 300,000 volumes. Benedict XIV. in 1752. issued a
                    bull of excommunication against those who should dare to commit depredations on
                    this library; but, notwithstanding, many books were carried off, particularly
                    during the late troubles. In 1747, the laborious librarian, Ianozki, made
                    notices of the rare books printed in Polish; and, in 17ð2, he published a
                    catalogue of the manuscripts in this library. After the death of its founder,
                    the Bishop of Kiey, the king and the commonwealth took possession of this
                    treasure, in spite of the attempts made by the heirs to retain it.” (Denis, <hi

                    that order in 1773, it was placed under the care of the commission of education,
                    and at last transferred to St Petersburg in 1795, as already mentioned. This
                    transportation being made by land, and along roads which the late season of the
                    year rendered impracticable, several cases suffered much from the inclemency of
                    the weather, others were broken or damaged, and the books which they contained
                    spoiled, misplaced, or separated, and the sets broken. The collection was
                    conveyed to the imperial cabinet in two convoys, and after the inventory had
                    been completed on the 23d of February 1796, it was found that the collection
                    still amounted to 262,640 volumes, and 24,573 prints. This library, thus seized
                    and carried off, and which had been packed in such haste at Warsaw, that the
                    books had been huddled in without any order, so that the volumes of the same
                    work were found dispersed in different cases, comprised in general all that
                    relates to the sciences, the arts, and the belles-lettres. The theological, and,
                    after it, the historical and literary branches, were the most considerable. The
                    theological department alone comprehended above 80,000 volumes. It was also rich
                    in topography, especially the histories of towns; and the literary branch
                    included a precious collection of classical books and works on bibliography; but
                    the departments of philosophy, mathematics, physics, voyages, and antiquities
                    were very incomplete.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    collection, instead of now ranking in the first class, would scarcely have been
                    entitled to a place in the third.</p>
                <p>This library, augmented by various other collections, amounts to about 400,000
                    printed volumes, and 16,Uθθ volumes of manuscripts. Its management is detailed
                    at length in the Appendix to the Report of the Select Committee on the British
                    Museum (p. 449, et seq.), to which we refer. The total annual expense for the
                    support of the Imperial Library, and paying the salaries of the employes,
                    amounts to 45,000 roubles; and the paltry sum of 7000 roubles is the utmost that
                    is allowed in any year for the purchase of books; from which we may infer that
                    its principal chance of further increase depends, not on the liberality of the
                    Russian government, but on the probability of some new conquest, followed
                    closely by a fresh act of spoliation. The public is admitted to the library
                    every Tuesday from eleven o’clock in the forenoon to three in the afternoon, to
                    visit the establishment, and on the Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays of each

                    in an abridged form, which it is unnecessary to exemplify. It appears by the
                    official returns, that the number of books put in order is about 103,000, and

                <p>The Academy of Sciences at St Petersburg was instituted by Peter the Great, who,
                    in his travels, had observed the benefits resulting from public societies for
                    promoting the advancement of knowledge. The library of the Academy originated in
                    2500 volumes which the Czar had, <hi rend="italic">more Rossico</hi> seized at
                    Mittau in his Swedish campaign, and which Catharine I. presented to the
                    newly-instituted society. It continued to increase, by the bounty of succeeding
                    Czars, and, in 1802, received an important addition in the library and cabinet
                    of Count Boutourlin, purchased by the Emperor Alexander. This collection is now
                    open to the public two days in the week, and contains about 70,000 volumes. Some
                    interesting particulars relating to this library may be found in the works of

                <p>There are three public libraries at Copenhagen, viz. the King’s Library, the
                    University Library, and Classen’s Library. The “King’s Library contains 400,000
                    volumes of printed books, and 20,000 volumes of manuscripts. The University
                    Library contains about 110,000 printed volumes, all collected since the year
                    1728, when the original library was destroyed by fire; together with 1761
                    Icelandic, 202 oriental, and 1228 other manuscripts, partly classical, partly
                    connected with Danish history, besides manuscript collections of the classics.
                    Classen’s Library contains about 35,000 printed volumes, but possesses no
                    manuscripts. These libraries, consisting of 568,000 volumes printed and
                    manuscript, are accessible to all respectable householders, and likewise to
                    strangers introduced by such; and, besides, the books are, under certain
                    restrictions, allowed to circulate. The King’s Library is general, and about
                    equally complete in all the branches of human knowledge. The University Library
                    is also to a certain extent general, but the main body of the collection has
                    been made chiefly with reference to academical education. Classen’s Library
                    consists principally of books of geography, travels, natural history, and
                    agriculture. The administration of these libraries seems to be equally
                    economical and efficient, and is conducted solely with a view to public utility,
                    which, in this case, means public instruction.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The public libraries, in Sweden are the Royal Library, situated in the northern
                    wing of the king’s palace at Stockholm, and the library called
                    Benzielstjerna-Engeström, founded by private individuals, but to which admission
                    is readily granted on recommendation. The Royal Library, which was founded by
                    Gustavus Vasa, and enlarged by the liberality of succeeding sovereigns, contains
                    70,000 volumes of printed books, with 2500 volumes of manuscripts, besides
                    16,500 diplomas, and isopen to the public every day excepting Saturdays,
                    Sundays, and holidays; besides, books are lent out on respectable
                    recommendation. The library of Benzielstjerna Engeström contains about 12,000
                    volumes of printed books, and 3000 volumes of manuscripts, rich in materials for
                    Swedish biography. Besides these, there are libraries attached to the different
                    academies. The number of provincial libraries in Sweden, including those of the
                    universities of Upsala and Lund, is thirteen. That of Upsala, which was founded
                    by Gustavus Adolphus, is the largest in Sweden, and contains 100,000 printed
                    volumes, with 600 volumes of manuscripts. A catalogue of the collection, by
                    Professor Aurivi-lius, was printed in the year 1814, in two vols. 4to.<note

                    was founded at the same time as that university, by Charles X., and possesses
                    about 40,000 volumes. These libraries are supported and increased by an annual
                    grant from the state, and by a fee paid by each student on entering the
                    universities. They are open every day, and each student can borrow books, on the
                    responsibility of a professor, or of some other respectable person. In those
                    provincial towns where large public schools, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >gymnases,</hi> are established, there are also public libraries, to the number
                    of about eleven in all. These libraries, which have been founded by private
                    individuals, are kept up much in the same way as those belonging to the
                    universities.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>In the United States of North America there are forty-three incorporated colleges
                    or universities, of which thirty have libraries of greater or less extent,
                    containing altogether 128,118 volumes. The largest college library is that of
                    Harvard, which contains 30,000 volumes; and the next is that of St Mary’s
                    College, Baltimore, which possesses 10,000 volumes. Besides these, there are
                    four colleges which have libraries to the amount of about 8000 volumes each. A
                    catalogue of the library at Harvard College, Massachusetts, was printed in 1830,
                    in three volumes 8vo; from which it appears that the number of books, which, in
                    1790, amounted to only 12,000 volumes, now exceeds 30,000, besides several
                    thousands of tracts. The first and second volumes of this catalogue contain a
                    list of the books in alphabetical order; and the third consists of a systematic
                    or classed index to the alphabetical catalogue. There are several other
                    considerable libraries in the United States, as the Public Library at
                    Philadelphia, the Congress Library at λVashington, and a few others ofless note.
                    The Loganian Library, which, in 1791, was incorporated with the Philadelphia
                    Public Library, contained about 15,000 volumes, amongst which were many rare
                    works in classical literature.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>At Constantinople there are, within the walls of the seraglio, two libraries,
                    which were founded by Achmed III. and Mustapha HL, and enriched with books
                    acquired by themselves or their successors. These libraries contain upwards of
                    20,000 volumes, and are gradually increased, either by purchase, by donations
                    made to the sultan by his grandees, or by confiscations of the effects of public
                    officers, amongst which books are commonly to be found.<note anchored="true"

                    and many erroneous reports have been circulated, respecting the contents of
                    these libraries. The Abbé Sevin, who arrived at Constantinople in December 1728,
                    failed to obtain admission into the sultan’s library; and, deterred by the
                    assurances he had received, that Amurath IV. had caused all the Greek
                    manuscripts to be burned, he deemed any further research or inquiry to be
                    hopeless; whilst succeeding travellers, relying on statements of a different
                    kind, have confidently asserted that in these libraries were preserved the
                    ancient collections of the Greek emperors.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It is not a little singular that Dr E. D. Clarke has made no

                    seraglio, through the instrumentality of a page who clandestinely copied a few

                    the learned Abbate, it appears that the merits of this double collection had
                    been greatly exaggerated. The libraries of the seraglio are much inferior to
                    some of those which are open to the public. Commentaries, explanations, marginal
                    notes, and other writings on the Koran, form the subjects of the largest
                    portion; to which succeed treatises on jurisprudence (also accompanied with
                    notes and commentaries), on philosophy, logic, astronomy, arithmetic, medicine,
                    and ethics. The historical works are few in number, and chiefly confined to the
                    Ottoman empire. There are some manuscripts in the Greek, Latin, and other
                    European languages; but no traces whatever have been discovered of the lost
                    decades of Livy, of the writings of Homer or Tacitus, or of those parts which
                    are wanting to complete the works of other ancient authors.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Besides those of the seraglio, Constantinople possesses thirty-two public
                    libraries, all varying in extent, but more or less celebrated for the number and
                    value of their manuscripts, which are neatly bound in red, green, or black'
                    morocco. The Mahommedans have a peculiar method of indorsing, placing, and
                    preserving their books. Each volume, besides being bound in morocco, is
                    preserved from dust in a case of the same material; and on it, as well as on the
                    edges of the leaves, the title is written in large and legible characters. The
                    books are placed one upon another in presses ornamented with trellis-work, and
                    arc disposed along the wall, or in the four corners of the library. All these
                    collections are open to the public throughout the year, excepting on Tuesdays
                    and Fridays; the librarians are as polite and attentive as Turks can be, to
                    those whom curiosity or love of study attract thither; and every one is at
                    liberty, not merely to peruse, but to make extracts from, the books, and even to
                    transcribe them entirely, provided this be done within the walls of the library.
                    To facilitate literary researches, each library is furnished with a catalogue,
                    containing the title, and giving a short account of the subject of each volume.
                    Theology, including the Koran and commentators thereon, jurisprudence, medicine,
                    ethics, and history, are the sciences chiefly cultivated by the Osmanlecs. The
                    books are all written with the greatest care, on the finest vellum; the text of
                    each page is enclosed in a highly ornamented and gilt frame-work; the beginning
                    of each chapter or section is splendidly illuminated; and the prices of the
                    manuscripts vary in proportion to the beauty of the characters.<note

                <p>Of the libraries in India, whether composed of European or of native works, the
                    want of the requisite information prevents us from attempting to give any

                    is certainly by no means flattering, “The books,” says he, “are about 10,000,
                    chiefly Latin and Portuguese, with a few Spanish, a very few Italian and Greek,
                    no French, and of course no English, and none of any other language. There are
                    not above twenty printed since the close of the seventeenth century. There are a
                    few bad editions of classics, but not a complété edition even of Cicero himself;
                    a great many schoolmen, casuists, and canonists, with some jurists; very little
                    history, scarcely any of modern times, except a little Portuguese; about ten
                    volumes of Portuguese and</p>
                <p>Spanish poetry; no morals, but as the handmaid or rather slave of superstition;

                    botany, no mineralogy, and no book even on mathematics by Euclid. I did not know
                    before that the world had produced 10,000 such useless and pernicious books, or
                    that it had been possible to have formed a large library, with so curious an

                    At the different presidencies, and in some other parts of British India, are
                    collections, more or less extensive and valuable, of European and native
                    productions; but they have not been particularly described. Of the native
                    libraries of India, we know but little. That of Tippoo Sahib, which fell into
                    the hands of the British when his capital was taken, consisted, according to
                    Stewart’s catalogue, of nearly 2000 volumes, many of them highly ornamented. In
                    China and Japan, and likewise in the capital of the Burman empire, there are
                    considerable collections, though of the precise nature of their contents we
                    still remain entirely ignorant.</p>
                <p>Having thus completed our laborious survey, which we have endeavoured to render
                    as complete as the materials to which we have had access would admit, it now
                    only remains to refer the reader to the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Bibliography,</hi> as containing various inquiries intimately connected with
                    the present subject; and which may, in fact, be said to constitute the Science
                    of those who are intrusted with the formation and superintendence of Libraries.
