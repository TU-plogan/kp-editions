                <p><label type="entry">LUCKNOW</label>, a city of Hindustan, in the province of
                    Oude, situated on the south bank of the river Goomty, over which there are two
                    bridges, one a very noble Gothic edifice of stone, and the other a platform laid
                    upon boats, and merely connecting the King’s Park with the palace. The Goomty is
                    navigable for boats of a common size at all seasons of the year, and falls into
                    the Ganges between Benares and Gazypoor. The last sovereign, Saadut Ali, had
                    brought over an iron bridge from England, and a place was prepared for its
                    erection; but, on his death, his successor declined prosecuting the work, on the
                    ground that it was unlucky; so that it is now left to be destroyed with rust.
                    The streets where the lower classes reside consist of mean houses built of clay,
                    “with the filthiest lanes between them,” says Bishop Heber, “that I ever went
                    through, and so narrow that we were obliged to reduce our front, and even a
                    single elephant did not pass very easily. A swarm of beggars,” he continues, in
                    the lively description which he gives of the aspect of the town and its
                    population, “occupied every angle, and the steps of every door, and all or
                    nearly all the remaining population were, to my surprise, as much loaded with
                    arms as the inhabitants of the country; a circumstance which told ill for the
                    police of the town, but added considerably to its picturesque effect. Grave men
                    in palanquins, counting their beads, and looking like moullahs, had all two or
                    three sword or buckler lacqueys attending <pb break="no" facs="nls:193209106"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-9106-0591"/>on them. People of more consequence, on their
                    elephants, had each a retinue of shield, spear, and gun, little inferior ito
                    that by which we were surrounded; and even the lounging people of the lower
                    ranks, in the streets and shopdoors, had their shields over their shoulders, and
                    their swords carried in one hand.” Lucknow is a very ancient city. It was
                    formerly the residence of the governors or nabobs of Oude, but was abandoned by
                    Shujah ad Dow-i∣eh after the battle of Buxar; on his death in 1774, however, his
                    successor returned to it; and being now the residence of the kings of Oude, it
                    has been greatly increased, and embellished by palaces and other public
                    buildings; and the bankers and men of property having accompa- 'ιied the court,
                    Lucknow became one of the largest and ∙ichest towns in Hindustan. In advancing
                    into the town, he buildings begin to improve, though the streets con-inue to be
                    equally narrow and dirty. Some of the streets ire, however, more spacious; and
                    one in particular is nentioned as being both wide and handsome. From he dwelling
                    of the British resident, all the way down he principal street, and afterwards
                    through the park of Dil-Koushar and the neighbouring drives, Lucknow appeared to
                    Bishop Heber to have more resemblance to ,ome of the smaller European capitals,
                    such as Dres-len, than any other town which he had seen in India. There are
                    several palaces in Lucknow belonging to the ing, but none of them are very
                    striking buildings. There ⅛ one close to the residency, which is merely a
                    clus-for of mean houses, with some morsels of showy architecture intermingled
                    like the offices of a college. The unister’s house is a very large pile of
                    buildings, in a dirty art of the town. There are many stately khans, and □me
                    handsome mosques and pagodas, scattered in dif-ιrent corners of the most
                    wretched alleys. The most triking buildings in Lucknow are the tombs of the late
                    ffawab Saadut Ali and of the mother of the present king, he gate of
                    Constantinople, and the imumbra or cathedral. The latter building consists of
                    two courts, rising with a Jeep ascent one above another. It contains, besides a
                    blendid mosque, a college for instruction in Mussul-san law; apartments for the
                    religious establishment main-fined here; and a noble gallery, in the midst of
                    which, nder a brilliant tabernacle of silver, cut glass, and previous stones, he
                    buried the remains of its founder Asuph Hi Dowlah. The whole is in a very noble
                    style of cast- ∣∙n Gothic, and is distinguished by richness and varie- ∣f, as
                    well as by the just proportions and general good ιste of its principal features.
                    Close to this fine group is ∣∣large and handsome, though a dull and neglected
                    look- ∣g pile, which is the palace or prison appropriated to the “fortunate
                    widows and concubines of deceased sove-ligns. There is a small summer palace of
                    the king’s ioout three miles from the city, to which there is a plea-ιtnt ride.
                    The house is small and ugly, but the park is intensive, and it is well stocked
                    with Indian deer, and pith fine red deer. The king has also a large menagerie,
                    ⅛ntaining a great number of scarce and curious animals; nd, on the banks of the
                    river Goomty, in a well wooded ∣rk, is a large collection of different varieties
                    of cows, “reels, and deer, and five or six very large rhinoceroses, ⅛nongst the
                    curiosities in the neighbourhood is Constantia, fie residence of the late
                    General Martin, who, from being “common soldier, rose to a high rank in the
                    Company’s ftny. His house is a large and whimsical building, and the gounds are
                    laid out in the worst possible taste, displaying i the outline and arrangements
                    the eccentric genius of the ¢ntriver. To the house is annexed a very fine garden
                    ad extensive grounds. The population of Lucknow is ⅛ιimated at 300,000; and
                    Bishop Heber is of opinion that iis sufficiently crowded to contain that number.
                    There i⅛n Lucknow a considerable number of European inha bitants, consisting of
                    the numerous dependents of the residency, and those Europeans and half castes
                    retained by the king in his employment. There are also many tradesmen amongst
                    both these descriptions of persons, and a strange medley of adventurers of all
                    sects and nations, who ramble thither in search of employment, which, however,
                    they seldom find. It is 650 miles travelling distance from Calcutta, from Delhi
                    280, from Agra 202, and from Benares 189 miles. Long. 80. 55. E. Lat. 26. 51. N.
                    The district of Lucknow is adjacent to the city, and is situated between the
                    26th and 27th degrees of N. lat. The country is generally a sandy soil, covered,
                    after a storm, with puddles of water. Some parts, however, are more fertile and
                    better cultivated. The country is watered by the Ganges, the Goggrah, and the
                    Goomty; and over the small river Sye is a bridge of fifteen arches, an excellent
                    specimen of Mahommedan architecture. The towns are mostly built of brick, and
                    there are still in many parts extensive mounds of brick dust, the only vestiges
                    of ancient cities. (Rennell’s <hi rend="italic">Memoir of a Map of
