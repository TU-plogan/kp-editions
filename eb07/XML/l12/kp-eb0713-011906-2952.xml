                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    tea-cannisters are made. Plates of iron being prepared of a proper thinness, are
                    smoothed by rusting them in an acid liquor, as common water made eager with rye.
                    With this liquor they fill certain troughs, and then put in the plates, which
                    they turn once or twice a day, that they may be equally rusted over. After this
                    they are taken out, and well scoured with sand; and, to prevent their rusting
                    again, are immediately plunged into pure water, in which they are to be left
                    till the instant they are to be tinned or blanched. The manner of doing this is
                    as follows: They flux the tin in a large iron crucible, which has the figure of
                    an oblong pyramid with four faces, of which two opposite ones are less than the
                    two others. The crucible is heated only from below, its upper part being luted
                    with the furnace all round. The crucible is always deeper than the plates which
                    are to be tinned are long; they always put them in downright, and the tin ought
                    to swim over them; to this purpose artificers of different trades prepare plates
                    of different shapes, though Μ. Reaumur thinks them all exceptionable. But the
                    Germans use no sort of preparation of the iron to make it receive the tin, more
                    than the keeping it always steeped in water till the time; only when the tin is
                    melted in the crucible, they cover it with a layer of a sort of suet, which is
                    usually two inches thick, and the plate must pass through this before it can
                    come to the melted tin. The first use of this covering is to keep the tin from
                    burning; for if any part should take fire, the suet would soon moisten it, and
                    reduce it to its primitive state again. The blanchers say, this suet is a
                    compound matter. It is indeed of a black colour; but Μ. Reaumur supposed that to
                    be only an artifice to make it a secret, and that it is only coloured with soot
                    or the smoke of a chimney. But he found it true so far, that the common
                    unprepared suet was not sufficient; for after several attempts, there was always
                    something wanting to render the success of the operation certain. The whole
                    secret of blanching, therefore, was found to lie in the preparation of the suet;
                    and this at length he discovered to consist only in the first frying and burning
                    it. This simple operation not only gives it the colour, but puts it in a
                    condition to give the iron a disposition to be tinned, which it does
                    surprisingly.</p>
                <p>The melted tin must also have a certain degree of heat. For if it be not hot
                    enough, it will not stick to the iron; and if it be too hot, it will cover it
                    with too thin a coat, and the plates will have several colours, as red, blue,
                    and purple, and, upon the whole, will have a cast of yellow. To prevent this, by
                    knowing when the fire has a proper degree of heat, they might try with small
                    pieces of iron; but, in general, use teaches them to know the degree, and they
                    put in the iron when the tin is at a different standard of heat, according as
                    they would give it a thicker or thinner coat. Sometimes also they give the
                    plates a double layer, as they would have them very thickly covered. This they
                    do by dipping them into the tin when very hot the first time, and when less hot
                    the second. The tin which is to give the second coat must be fresh covered with
                    suet; and that with the common suet, not the prepared.</p>
