                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">LAVATER, <hi rend="smallcaps">John Gaspard
                    Christian</hi></label>, best known by his writings on physiognomy, was born at
                    Zurich, in Switzerland, in 1741. He was brought up a protestant minister, and
                    entered into holy orders in 1761. He was for some time pastor of the orphans’
                    church in that city; but from the year 1778 he was deacon and pastor of St
                    Peter’s church in the same place. The eloquence of his discourses in the pulpit,
                    as well as the ardent zeal and Christian benevolence with which he discharged
                    the duties of his office, procured for him an early reputation. Though not much
                    conversant with books, he had a very extensive knowledge of human nature, and a
                    most acute discernment. His theological writings in prose and verse arc little
                    known, but his works on physiognomy have extended his fame throughout every part
                    of Europe. We are informed by umself, that he felt an early propensity to study
                    the human face, and frequently drew such features as made a peculiar impression
                    upon his mind; but his choice of physiognomy was fixed by the suggestion of Dr
                    Zimmerman, who, having heard his remarks on the singular countenance of a
                    soldier whom they saw passing by as they stood together at a window, urged him
                    to pursue and methodise his ideas. He soon acquired a full conviction of the
                    reality of physiognomical science, and of his own discoveries in it. His first
                    volume on this subject appeared at Leipzig in 1776, and the twenty sections of
                    which it was composed he modestly denominated fragments. With him it appeared to
                    be an axiom, that the powers and faculties of the mind have representative signs
                    in the solid parts of the countenance. This] notion he extended to all animated
                    nature, firmly believing that internal qualities invariably denote themselves by
                    external marks or tokens.</p>
                <p>Two more volumes soon appeared in succession, containing a wonderful assemblage
                    of curious observations, refined reasoning, delicate feeling, and philanthropic
                    sentiments, with a number of engravings highly finished and singularly
                    expressive. This work was well translated into the French and English languages,
                    and for some time formed the favourite topic of literary discussion. So much was
                    its author admired, that no foreigner of distinction passed through Zurich
                    without obtaining an interview with Lavater, and asking his opinion of some
                    character from a shade or miniature. His huge volumes, however, are now seldom
                    looked at except for the sake of the plates, and his physiognomical notions
                    appear to be consigned to oblivion with other sciences of a chimerical nature.
                    One of the best known of his miscellaneous publications is his Aphorisms on Man,
                    which contain originality both in sentiment and expression, with deep and
                    philosophical views of human nature.</p>
                <p>Lavater was zealously attached to the Christian revelation, and translated
                    Bonnet’s Inquiry into the Evidences of Christianity, into the German language.
                    This book he dedicated to the celebrated Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelsohn,
                    with a challenge either to refute it publicly, or profess his conviction of the
                    truth of its arguments. This challenge he afterwards confessed to have been
                    inconsiderate, and allowed that his zeal had misled him. His popularity at
                    Zurich was so extremely great, that in his walks it was no uncommon thing to see
                    the people flocking around him, and kissing his hand in token of respect. He had
                    a most exemplary moral character, and his zeal in doing good was scarcely ever
                    surpassed. He was mild and moderate in conversation, although naturally full of
                    fire and sensibility; he was candid in his estimate of such as differed from him
                    in opinion; he always rose early, and never took his breakfast till he thought
                    he had earned it. He was the determined enemy of tyranny in every shape, being
                    possessed of the genuine Swiss zeal for liberty. He was therefore a friend to
                    the French revolution at its commencement; but the rapine, plunder, and
                    bloodshed which afterwards disgraced it, made him one of its bitterest
                    adversaries. On the day when the unfortunate city of Zurich was stormed by
                    Massena in 1799, he received a wound in the breast from a Swiss soldier in the
                    streets, to whom he had formerly been a benefactor. He never wholly recovered
                    from the effects of this wound; and he brought on a train of dangerous symptoms
                    by attending for more than an hour, in the open air, a man who was condemned to
                    be shot as a spy. The activity and vigour of his mind, however, continued till a
                    short time before his death, which took place on the 2d of January 1801.</p>
