                <p><label type="entry">LEYDEN</label>, a circle of Holland, divided into three
                    cantons, viz. Leyden, Noordwyk, and Woubrugge, and containing about 60,000
                    inhabitants. The city of Leyden, which gives its name to the circle, is situated
                    on both sides of a branch of the river Rhine, which, though diminished by other
                    branches that take their course to the sea before it arrives at this city, still
                    retains its original name. It receives here the water of the smaller streams of
                    the Does, the Bliet, the Mare, and the Zyl, and is, besides, intersected by
                    several canals, thus dividing the city into numerous islands, which are
                    connected together by nearly 100 bridges. The streets are broad, clean, and well
                    paved; ιnd the high street, which runs through the whole city, is perhaps one of
                    the finest in Europe. The walks in and wound the city are distinguished by their
                    pleasing neatness. The most striking building is the stadthouse, in which is the
                    fine picture of the last judgment by Lucas. St Peter’s church is remarkable for
                    the sarcophagus to the memory of Boerhaave, and monuments to three of the most
                    distinguished citizens who lost their lives by the explosion of a vessel laden
                    with gunpowder in 1807. There are, besides, sixteen other churches, and two fine
                    hospitals, one of the finest of which is that which belonged to the Catholics a
                    few years ago. The university, founded in 1575, has long maintained a high rank
                    amongst the best institutions for education in Europe, and has produced the nost
                    distinguished men in every branch of knowledge. It now contains about twenty
                    professors in the four detriments of law, theology, medicine, and philosophy,
                    and from 300 to 400 students. Attached to the university is library, containing
                    60,000 volumes of books, and 14,000 ιanuscripts, some of them of the most
                    valuable and curious kinds. It has also an observatory, an anatomical icatre, a
                    botanic garden, a chemical laboratory, and several collections of natural and
                    physical curiosities. The trade and manufactures of Leyden were once very
                    extensive, but have much declined of late years. It has still, however, some
                    considerable manufactures of woollen and linen cloths, and the black and scarlet
                    cloths are much admired for their beautiful and permanent colours. The printing
                    of books, especially of classical books, was once a great branch of industry,
                    though now it is much diminished. Leyden has been the birth-place or residence
                    of some of the most distinguished individuals, especially of Rembrandt and
                    Lucas, painters; of Muschenbroeck and Boerhaave, naturalists; and of Scaliger,
                    Salmasius, Heinsius, and others, critical and classical scholars. In 1816, the
                    population was 28,600, but since that time it has increased, and, by the census
                    of 1830, appears to be 34,564, viz. 16,131 males, and 18,433 females. It is
                    situated in latitude 52. 8. 25. north, and longitude 4. 22. east. The environs
                    of the city are ornamented with many seats of the inhabitants. The soil is rich,
                    but, from its moisture, more appropriate for pasture than for grain. The dairies
                    are numerous, and afford butter excellent for its flavour; and, from being
                    capable of being kept a long time, it, along with cheese, forms an important
                    part of the exportable commodities of Holland.</p>

                    off the north-west coast of Ceylon, about thirteen miles in length by two and a
                    half in breadth. It contains excellent pasture for cattle and horses.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Leyden,</hi><hi rend="italic">John,</hi> a celebrated
                    linguist, antiquary, and poet, was born on the 8th of September 1775, at
                    Denholm, a village on the banks of the Teviot, nearly opposite to Minto House,
                    in the parish of Cavers and county of Roxburgh. His father was able to trace
                    back his pedigree through a line of shepherds and husbandmen who had long
                    occupied small farms on the estate of Douglas of Cavers, one of whom, Adam
                    Ledan, in Little Cavers, a stern Presbyterian, had been denounced as a rebel, in
                    a royal proclamation, in 1684. From his second to his sixteenth year, young
                    Leyden lived with his parents in a retired cottage near the bottom of the
                    “stormy Ruberslaw,” where he was taught to read by his father’s mother, and
                    where he had no companions except the inmates of that rustic dwelling, and no
                    books except the Bible, and such other volumes as are commonly possessed by the
                    Scottish peasantry. His chief delight in the years of childhood was to listen to
                    the tales of martial adventure and supernatural agency, recited by a blind uncle
                    of his mother, and to read such works as the Metrical Histories of Bruce and
                    Wallace, the Poems of Sir David Lindsay, and the <hi rend="italic">Arabian
                    Nights Entertainments.</hi> In his tenth year, he went first to school at
                    Kirktown, a distance of two miles from his father’s house, and there, under
                    three successive schoolmasters, he learned writing, arithmetic, and the elements
                    of Latin grammar. After having spent three years in this manner, he was placed
                    under the charge of Mr Duncan, a Cameronian minister at Denholm; and at the end
                    of two years, not unprofitably employed in this small seminary, he entered the
                    university of Edinburgh in November 1790. Mr Dalzel, then professor of Greek,
                    has repeatedly stated to the writer of this article, that he had seldom known
                    any young man who at first appeared worse prepared for college, and who so
                    speedily surmounted the disadvantages of imperfect tuition. He had accumulated a
                    great stock of knowledge by a process of study peculiar to himself; but he had
                    not thought it necessary to make himself master of grammatical rules; and, with
                    all his strength and acuteness of mind, he at this time expressed his meaning in
                    terms exceedingly awkward, and in a tone of voice so dissonant and loud as to
                    set his fellow-students in a roar. He attended three winter sessions at the
                    classes for languages <pb break="no" facs="nls:193204881"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-4881-0266"/>and philosophy, applying with extraordinary ardour
                    to every branch of inquiry connected with his academical studies, and to many
                    other pursuits in which none of his instructors could have guided him. The
                    vacations were generally passed in his native wilds amongst bis own relations,
                    with the exception of the summer 1792, when he acted as assistant in a village
                    school at Whitebanklee, or Clovenfords, on Cadon Water, a mountain stream which
                    falls into the Tweed below Ashiesteel, on the skirts of Ettrick Forest. The
                    charge of the school was left almost entirely to him; but the management of
                    thirty boys and girls, from six to twelve years of age, appeared to be a task
                    for which be possessed no manner of aptitude. Two of his pupils, who were
                    learning Latin, looked up to him with deference and admiration; one of whom did
                    not long survive him, and the other has held various appointments in the church
                    and the universities; but the children in general were in a state of
                    insubordination and tumult, which he endured with a degree of calmness, of which
                    those who knew him in maturer life would have conceived him to be incapable. At
                    this time his appearance was very prepossessing. He was ruddy and fair, with a
                    frame rather delicate than robust, and an expression of great good-nature and
                    gentleness in his features.</p>
                <p>In November 1793, he entered on the study of divinity, church history, and
                    Hebrew, and passed through the usual course of four years’ attendance, before he
                    was proposed for trials as a licentiate or probationer of the church of
                    Scotland. Much of his attention was in the mean time devoted to historical
                    research, to philology, to metaphysical speculations, and to natural history and
                    medicine. He was a member of various debating societies, in all of which he
                    distinguished himself by the fluency and copiousness of his unpremeditated
                    harangues, rather than by any graceful or polished eloquence. In one of these
                    institutions, he contracted an intimacy with Mr Henry Brougham, and with the
                    late Dr Thomas Brown and Mr Francis Horner, as well as with several other
                    individuals, who subsequently attained no inconsiderable distinction. About the
                    same time he formed an acquaintance with some literary men farther advanced in
                    life, as Mr Thomson, author of <hi rend="italic">Whist,</hi> a poem, and Dr
                    Robert Anderson, editor of the British Poets, and then supposed to be connected
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Magazine,</hi> to which both Leyden and Mr
                    Thomas Campbell, one of his youthful friends, contributed some of their earliest
                    poetical essays.</p>
                <p>When be had completed his theological education, he accompanied one or two pupils
                    to St Andrews in 1797, where he eagerly embraced the opportunity of attending
                    the lectures of Dr Hunter, professor of humanity, and of Principal Hill, one of
                    the divinity professors. He became also a member of the Theological Society, in
                    which he delivered a number of discourses, one <hi rend="italic">On the Argument
                    a priori for the Existence of God;</hi> another <hi rend="italic">On
                    Thanksgiving</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and two <hi rend="italic">On
                    Regeneration.</hi> He also engaged at almost every meeting in the discussion of
                    some controverted point in divinity or philosophy; and it cannot be doubted that
                    these discussions must often have been highly interesting, when such persons
                    engaged in them as Dr Chalmers, whose speeches differed from most of the others
                    in being generally read. Amongst the members at that period were, Mr Duncan, now
                    professor of mathematics at St Andrews, and Sir John Campbell, now
                    attorney-general of England. In one respect Leyden felt and acknowledged his
                    inferiority to the students at St Andrews, namely, in having paid scarcely any
                    attention to mathematics; a study for which he had so little turn, that, by his
                    own account, he could never comprehend the definition of a straight line, owing
                    to some metaphysical difficulty, which nobody could solve to his satisfaction.
                    He appears to have disliked the style of society in St Andrews, where, however,
                    he acquired more than one of his most valued friends, particularly Dr Hunter,
                    and another gentleman of high intellectual capacity and scientific attainments.
                    From the presbytery of St Andrews be received license to preach, in May 1798-
                    and on this occasion he was much disgusted by a vulgar piece of waggery,
                    attempted to be practised, at his expense, by one of the members, who told him,
                    that, as he would be called upon to return thanks after dinner, it was expected
                    that, according to established custom, he should give a specimen of his gifts in
                    prayer, by using a form of words comprehending all the leading doctrines of the
                    Christian faith. When the expected signal was given, Leyden stood up and began
                    to pronounce such a prayer as might have been very suitable for the church; but
                    after having proceeded at some length, and in a very sonorous voice, to
                    enumerate the Divine attributes, he perceived that the company was astonished by
                    this unusual exhibition, and sitting down abruptly in no very placid humour, he
                    was more than half disposed to inflict personal chastisement on the offending
                    individual, with whom he felt enraged, not merely on account of the indignity
                    offered to himself, but for the indecent mockery of one of the solemnities of
                    religion. About this time he returned to Edinburgh, where he frequently
                    preached, not indeed so as to attract popular admiration, but in a manner which
                    satisfied his numerous friends that he possessed a serious, as well as a
                    philosophical mind. His memory was retentive; but, in conducting the devotions
                    of a religious assembly, he was apt to be disconcerted by circumstances which
                    would have given him no uneasiness if he had been addressing a learned
                    society.</p>
                <p>In the winter of 1798, he attended some of the medical classes, and at this
                    period nearly lost his life, in consequence of his rash and unskilful treatment
                    of a complaint which he believed to be an attack of colic. He swallowed a glass
                    of spirits, in the expectation of receiving immediate relief; but the disorder
                    proved to be <hi rend="italic">enteritis,</hi> or inflammation of the
                    intestines, and his constitution was so much weakened by venesection,
                    blistering, and evacuations, that he never afterwards recovered the bloom of
                    health. In addition to his duties as a tutor in a family, by which much of his
                    time was engrossed, he had been engaged as a writer in the <hi rend="italic">New
                    London Review,</hi> and, amongst other articles, contributed those on Horne
                    Tooke’s <hi rend="italic">Diversions of Parley,</hi> on Dr Thomas Brown’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Observations on Zoonomia,</hi> and on Vallancey’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Sanscrit History of Ireland.</hi></p>
                <p>In the summer of 1799, he published a volume, entitled <hi rend="italic">A
                    Historical and Philosophical Sketch of the Discoveries and Settlements of the
                    Europeans in Northern and Western Africa, at the Close of the Eighteenth
                    Century.</hi> This interesting piece (an octavo of 442 pages) was written in
                    about six weeks, whilst the author was in bad health, and at a distance from
                    books; but it exhibits proofs of extensive information, as well as of sound
                    reflection. In the course of the autumn he engaged to publish <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Complaynt of Scotland,</hi> a very rare anonymous work in the Scottish
                    language, written early in the sixteenth century. It did not appear for nearly
                    two years; but the preliminary dissertation, extending to nearly 300 pages, as
                    well as the notes and glossary, indicated a compass of antiquarian lore, and a
                    depth of research in various other unfrequented walks of erudition, which could
                    not easily be rivalled. He also displayed great acuteness and ingenuity in
                    attempting to prove, from internal evidence, that <hi rend="italic">The
                    C°</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> m</hi><hi rend="italic">' playnt</hi> was
                    the production of Sir David Lindsay.</p>
                <p>Through Mr Richard Heber, to whom he was introduced by Mr Constable, he became
                    acquainted with the most distinguished literary characters in Edinburgh, and,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193204894" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4894-0267"/>amongst
                    others, with Sir Walter Scott, who at this time was engaged in collecting the
                    ancient traditionary rhymes published in the <hi rend="italic">Minstrelsy of the
                    Scottish Border</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a collection which Leyden
                    contributed largely to enrich, both by recovering unedited fragments of
                    antiquity, and by communicating imitations, written in the spirit and manner of
                    the age of chivalry, as well as by furnishing materials for many of the notes,
                    and particularly for the introduction to the tale of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tamlane,</hi> containing a learned dissertation on the Fairies of popular
                    superstition.</p>
                <p>In the year 1800, a plan was formed to establish him as assistant and successor
                    to the minister of his native parish'; but it failed, in consequence of the
                    reluctance of the incumbent to agree to an arrangement on which the heritors and
                    parishioners had set their hearts. Soon afterwards, he was anxious to obtain the
                    professorship of rhetoric and belles lettres in Edinburgh; but here also he was
                    doomed to experience a disappointment.</p>
                <p>About this time he made two successive tours through the Highlands, and collected
                    much curious information, which was once intended for publication. He wrote
                    several poems, founded on the remains of Celtic story, two of which have been
                    inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Border Minstrelsy.</hi> In 1801, he also
                    contributed to Lewis’s <hi rend="italic">Tales of Wonder.</hi></p>
                <p>The year 1802, the last which he spent in Scotland, was one of the busiest of his
                    life. About the beginning of the year, he had carried through the press nearly
                    half a volume of an enlarged <hi rend="italic">Account of the Progress of
                    Discovery in Africa.</hi> At the same time he engaged to conduct the <hi
                    rend="italic">Scots Magazine,</hi> on an improved plan; and the volume for that
                    year contains many articles furnished by him, and by another eminent
                    orientalist, the late Dr Alexander Murray. He was also employed in correcting
                    the papers of the Highland Society for publication; and he edited a volume
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Scottish Descriptive Poems, with some Illustrations
                    of Scottish Literary Antiquities,</hi> containing <hi rend="italic">Clyde,</hi>
                    by John Wilson, schoolmaster of Greenock; <hi rend="italic">Albania,</hi>
                    addressed to the Genius of Scotland; <hi rend="italic">The Day Estival,</hi> by
                    Alexander Hume; and <hi rend="italic">Poems,</hi> by William Fowler. Early in
                    this year, he offered to the African Society to explore the interior of those
                    obscure and inhospitable regions in which so many Europeans have perished. His
                    friends, alarmed at this apparently fatal resolution, became eager to obtain for
                    him an Indian appointment, that might give him access to the treasures of
                    eastern learning, which his past attainments peculiarly qualified him to
                    appreciate. Through the interest of Mr William Dundas, he was nominated
                    assistant surgeon; and though it was privately stipulated, that, on his arrival
                    in India, he was to devote himself chiefly to literary inquiries, he could not
                    be permitted to go out as a passenger in that capacity, without producing a
                    surgeon’s diploma, and undergoing an examination before the Medical Board. He
                    had attended many of the medical classes, but he had hitherto paid little
                    attention to the practice of surgery, and it was therefore necessary to prepare
                    himself for passing through the strict trials prescribed by the college of
                    surgeons. It reflects no slight credit on his capacity and application, that he
                    accomplished this task within six months. He was not equally successful in
                    procuring the degree of doctor of physic from the university of Edinburgh; but
                    having gone to St Andrews with certificates of his character and regular
                    education, and having satisfied the Senatus Academicus at a*private examination,
                    as well as by reading several exercises prescribed to him in the Latin language,
                    that degree was conferred on him there, on the 7th of August 1802. Whilst he was
                    occupied in these ’ ∙inpoetical avocations, he continued at every interval of
                    leisure to court the inspiration of the muses, and he gave the finishing hand to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Scenes of Infancy, descriptive of Te-νiotdale,</hi> a poem
                    which had been partly written before, but which was now enlivened by some of its
                    most touching passages, and left for publication in the hands of Dr Thomas
                    Brown, who, in the revision of the sheets, suppressed a number of verses which
                    the author conceived ought to have been retained.</p>
                <p>Leyden spent the winter in London, having narrowly escaped the misfortune of
                    sailing in the Hindostan, which was wrecked in its passage down the Thames. He
                    sailed from Portsmouth in the Hugh Inglis, on the 7th of April 1803, and soon
                    after his arrival at Madras, was attached as surgeon and naturalist to the
                    commission for surveying the districts of the Mysore, in which capacity he was
                    expected to turn his attention, not only to the natural history of the country,
                    but to the manners, institutions, and language of the inhabitants. His
                    constitution had nearly sunk under the labours to which he subjected himself,
                    and he was under the necessity of removing to Prince of Wales’s Island. Here he
                    was befriended by the governor, Mr Dundas, and here too he procured the chief
                    materials of the <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Languages and Literature of the
                    Indo-Chinese Nations,</hi> contained in the tenth volume of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Asiatic Researches.</hi></p>
                <p>He removed in 1806 from Prince of Wales’s Island to Calcutta, where, through the
                    favour of the governor-general, Lord Minto, he was appointed one of the
                    professors in the Bengal College, from which station he was soon transferred to
                    the office of judge of the Twenty-four Pergunnahs of Calcutta. The income
                    attached to this charge was applied chiefly in purchasing manuscripts, and
                    rewarding the native teachers whose instructions he solicited; and all his
                    leisure hours were spent in the eager investigation of the languages, the laws,
                    and history of the East. In 1809 he was appointed a commissioner of the court of
                    requests in Calcutta, and, in the end of the following year, having resigned
                    this office, he obtained the office of assaymaster of the mint. Soon afterwards,
                    he was required to attend Lord Minto upon the expedition to Java, that he might
                    be employed in collecting information with respect to the learning and
                    institutions of the native tribes, and that the governor-general might enjoy the
                    benefit of his services in negotiating with the local authorities, and in
                    adjusting the future government of the country. After the British troops took
                    possession of the city of Batavia, he ventured rashly into an ill-aired library,
                    supposed to contain many Indian manuscripts, and, on leaving it, was immediately
                    seized with a fever, which proved fatal three days after its accession, and a
                    few days before the conquest of the island was completed. He died on the 21st of
                    August 1811.</p>
                <p>A very high tribute to his memory was paid by Lord Minto, on occasion of a
                    visitation of the College of FortWilliam, after his lordship’s return from the
                    conquest of Java. “To speak of all that Dr Leyden had already performed,
                    especially in the prosecution of Asiatic learning—. to compute the treasures
                    which his incomparable genius, urging and sustaining his invincible powers of
                    mental labour, presented the fair promise of acquiring and accumulating—would be
                    to relate a history of the short Ιbut memorable life he was allowed to live, and
                    to expatiate into the yet more ample fields of inquiry of which he had projected
                    the survey. I need not remind those who hear me, of the zeal he had long
                    nourished for exploring the philology of the more eastern regions of Asia; of
                    the first steps he had already made in the prosecution of that purpose, by the
                    construction of vocabularies, but, above all, by methodising and reducing into
                    system the classification of the various languages spoken on the continent
                    intermediate between India and China; the various kingdoms and districts of
                    which, as they recede from each of these extreme points, appear, with some
                    relation to their local approximation, or to historical affinities, gradually to
                    have blended and assi <pb break="no" facs="nls:193204907"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-4907-0268"/>milated their respective languages into compound
                    dialects, partaking of both the distinct and primitive tongues. To this just and
                    authorized tribute to the literary merits of Dr Leyden, I must yet add a
                    personal testimony, prompted by personal experience, to virtues of a higher
                    class, neither connected with the talents and toils of a student, nor so
                    uniformly the companions of learned reputation, as it would be natural perhaps
                    to wish and to expect. But I speak it in the presence of many who can attest it
                    with myself, that, founder as he was of his own fortunes and reputation, and
                    climbing, by many laborious steps, from the lowest stage of social life, to an
                    eminence which many cannot even maintain, though placed yet higher by their
                    birth; no man, whatever his condition might be, ever possessed a mind so
                    entirely exempt from every sordid passion, so negligent of fortune and all its
                    grovelling pursuits, in a word, so entirely disinterested, nor ever owned a
                    spirit more firmly and nobly independent. I speak of these things with some
                    knowledge, and wish to record a competent testimony to the facts, that, within
                    my experience, Dr Leyden never, in any instance, solicited an object of personal
                    interest, nor, as I believe, ever interrupted his higher pursuits, to waste a
                    moment’s thought on those minor cares. To this exemption from cupidity was
                    allied every generous virtue worthy of those smiles of fortune which he
                    disdained to court; and amongst many estimable features of his character, an
                    ardent love of justice, and a vehement abhorrence of oppression, were not less
                    prominent than the other higher qualities I have already described.”</p>
                <p>Sir John Malcolm bears testimony, in terms equally strong, to the purity,
                    disinterestedness, and independence of his character, as well as to the
                    indefatigable perseverance and ardour with which he devoted himself to literary
                    and scientific acquirements; and, after adverting to some rather unpleasing
                    oddities of manner, “How trivial,” he adds, “do these appear, at a moment when
                    we are lamenting the loss of such a rare combination of virtues, learning, and
                    genius, as were concentrated in the late Dr Leyden.”</p>
