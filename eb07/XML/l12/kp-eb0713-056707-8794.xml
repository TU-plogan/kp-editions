                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">LORD</label>, a title of honotir, given to those who are
                    noble either by birth or by creation. The title is also by courtesy μven to all
                    the sons of dukes and marquises, and to the eldest ions of carls; and it is
                    likewise a title of honour bestowed &gt;n those who are honourable by their
                    employment, as Lord Advocate, Lord Chamberlain, Lord Chancellor, and the ike.
                    The word is Saxon, but abbreviated from two syl-ables into one; for it was
                    originally <hi rend="italic">Hlaford,</hi> which by hopping the aspiration
                    became <hi rend="italic">Laford,</hi> and afterwards by ontraction <hi
                    rend="italic">Lord.</hi> “The etymology of the word,” says poates, “is well
                    worth observing; for it was composed of <hi rend="italic">'laf,</hi> a loaf of
                    bread, and <hi rend="italic">ford,</hi> to give or afford; so that <hi
                    rend="italic                     superscript"> τ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ilaford,</hi> now <hi rend="italic">Lord,</hi> implies a giver of bread,
                    because, in hose ages, such great men kept extraordinary houses, and ed all the
                    poor; for which reason they were called <hi rend="italic">givers f bread,</hi> a
                    thing now much out of date, great men being auch fonder of retaining the title
                    than of observing the ractice for which it was first given.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lords, House of,</hi> one of the three estates of parlia-
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> rent, and composed of the Lords Spiritual and
                    Temporal.</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">Spiritual Lords</hi> consist of the archbishops and;
                    ishops. Though these lords are in the eye of the law a <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> istinct estate from the lords temporal, and are so distin-uished in our
                    acts of parliament, yet in practice they are sually blended together under the
                    name of The Lords; ιey intermix in their votes, and the majority of such
                    in-Ermixture joins both estates. From the want of a separate 5sembly, and a
                    separate negative on the part of the prelates, pme writers have argued very
                    cogently, that the lords ∣ιiritual and temporal arc now in reality only one
                    estate; and this is unquestionably true in every effectual sense, though the
                    ancient distinction between them still nominally continues. For if a bill should
                    pass their house, there is no doubt of its validity, though every lord spiritual
                    should vote against it (of which Selden and Sir Edward Coke give many
                    instances); as, on the other hand, it would doubtless be equally good if the
                    lords temporal present were inferior to the bishops in number, and every one of
                    those temporal lords gave his vote to reject the bill, though Sir Edward Coke
                    seems to doubt as to this.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Temporal Lords</hi> consist of all the peers of the
                    realm (the bishops not being in strictness held to be such, but merely lords of
                    parliament), by whatever title of nobility distinguished; dukes, marquises,
                    earls, viscounts, and barons. Some of these sit by descent, as do all ancient
                    peers; others by creation, as do all new-made ones; others, since the union with
                    Scotland and Ireland, by election. The Lords have a right to be, and constantly
                    are, attended by the judges of the courts of King’s Beuch and Common Pleas, and
                    such of the Barons of the Exchequer as are of the degree of the coif, or have
                    been made serjeants at law; as likewise by the king’s learned counsel, being
                    seijeants, and by the masters of the court of Chancery, for their advice in
                    point of law, and for the greater dignity of their proceedings. The secretaries
                    of state, with the attorney and solicitor general, also used to attend the House
                    of Peers, and have to this day their regular writs of summons issued out at the
                    beginning of every parliament, <hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tractandum</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">consilium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">impendendum,</hi> though not <hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">consentiendum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but whenever they have
                    been members of the House of Commons, their attendance here has, for a long
                    period, been dispensed with. Another privilege is, that every peer, by license
                    obtained from the king, may make another lord of parliament his proxy, to vote
                    for him in his absence; a privilege which a member of the other house can by no
                    means exercise, as he is himself but a proxy for a multitude of other people.
                    Each peer has also a right, by leave of the house, when a vote passes contrary
                    to his sentiments, to enter his dissent upon the journals of the house, with the
                    reasons for such dissent, which is usually styled his protest. All bills
                    likewise, which may in their consequences affect in auy way the rights of the
                    peerage, are by the custom of parliament to have their first rise and beginning
                    in the House of Peers, and to suffer no changes or amendments in the House of
                    Commons.</p>
