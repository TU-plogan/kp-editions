                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    in diet, in dress, and in equipage.</p>
                <p>Luxury, amongst the Romans, prevailed to such a degree that several laws were
                    made to suppress, or at least restrict it. The extravagance of the table
                    commenced about <pb break="no" facs="nls:193209262" xml:id="kp-eb0713-9262-0603"
                    />the time of the battle of Actium, and continued in great excess until the
                    reign of Galba. Peacocks, cranes of Malta, nightingales, venison, wild and tame
                    fowl, were considered as delicacies. A profusion of provisions was the reigning
                    taste. Whole wild boars were often served up, and sometimes they were filled
                    with various small animals, and birds of different kinds; a dish which they
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Trojan fun∙se,</hi> in allusion to the wooden horse
                    filled with soldiers. Fowls and game of all sorts were served up in pyramids,
                    piled up in dishes as broad as moderate tables. Lucullus had a particular name
                    for each apartment; and in whatever room he ordered his servants to prepare the
                    entertainment, they knew by the direction the expense to which they were to go.
                    When he supped in the Apollo, the expense was fixed at 50,000 drachmae, that is
                    L.1250. Marc Antony provided eight boars for twelve guests. Vitellius had a
                    large silver platter, called <hi rend="italic">Minervas</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Buckler,</hi> which is said to have cost a million of sesterces. In this he
                    blended together the livers of gilt-heads, the brains of pheasants and peacocks,
                    the tongues of phenicoters, and the milts of lampreys. Caligula served up to his
                    guests I pearls of great value dissolved in vinegar; and the same was also done
                    by Clodius the son of Aesop the tragedian. Apicius laid aside ninety millions of
                    sesterces, besides a mighty revenue, for no other purpose but to be sacrificed
                    to luxury; but finding himself involved in debt, he looked over his accounts,
                    and though he had the sum of ten millions of sesterces still left, he poisoned
                    himself from fear of being starved to death.</p>
                <p>The Roman laws to restrain luxury were the <hi rend="italic">Leges
                    Orchia,</hi><hi rend="italic">Fannia, Didia, Licinia,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cornelia,</hi> and many others. But all these were unavailing; for as riches
                    increased I amongst them, so did sensuality.</p>
                <p>What were the ideas of luxury entertained in England about two centuries ago, may
                    be gathered from the following passage, contained in a discourse prefixed to
                    Holinshed’s Chronicles. “Neither do I,” says the writer of this discourse,
                    “speak this in reproach of any man, God is my judge; but to show, that I do
                    rejoice, rather to see how God has blessed us with his good gifts, and to behold
                    how that in a time wherein all things are grown to the most excessive prices, we
                    yet do find means to obtain and atchieve such furniture as heretofore was
                    impossible. There are old men yet dwelling in the village where I remain, which
                    have noted three things to be marvellously altered in England within their sound
                    remembrance. One is the multitude of chimneys lately erected; whereas in their
                    young days there were not above two or three, if so many, in most uplandish
                    towns of the realm (the religious houses, and manor places of their lords,
                    always excepted, and peradventure some great personages), but each made his fire
                    against a reredoss [screen] in the hall, where he dressed liis meat and dined.
                    The second is the great amendment of lodging; for, said they, our fathers and we
                    ourselves have lain full oft upon straw pallets covered only with a sheet, under
                    coverlits made of a dogswaine or horharriots (to use their own terms), and a
                    good log under their head instead of a bolster. If it were so that the father or
                    good- <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> man of the house had a mattrass, or flock bed
                    and sheets, with a sack of chaff to rest his head upon, he thought himself to be
                    as well lodged as the lord of the town. So well were they contented, that
                    pillows (said they) were thought meet only for women in childbed; as for
                    servants, if they had</p>
                <p>I any sheet above them, it was well; for seldom had they any under their bodies
                    to keep them from pricking straws, that ran oft through the canvas and their
                    hardened hides. The third thing they tell of, is the exchange of treene [wooden]
                    platters into pewter, and wooden spoons into silver or tin; for so common were
                    all sorts of treene vessels in old times, that a man should hardly find four
                    pieces pewter (of which one was peradventure a salt) in a good farmer’s house.
                    Again, in times past, men were contented to dwell in houses builded of sallow,
                    willow, &amp;c. so that the use of oak was in a manner dedicated wholly unto
                    churches, religious houses, princes palaces, navigation, &amp;c. But now willow,
                    &amp;care rejected, and nothing but oak anywhere regarded; and yet see the
                    change, for when our houses were builded of willow, then had we oaken men; but
                    now that our houses are come to be made of oak, our men are not only become
                    willow, but a great many altogether of straw, which is a sore alteration. In
                    these the courage of the owner was a sufficient defence to keep the house in
                    safety; but now the assurance of the timber must defend the men from robbing.
                    Now have we many chimneys, and yet our tenderlins complain of rheums, catarrhs,
                    and poses; then had we none but reredoses, and our heads did never ache. For as
                    the smoke in those days were supposed to be sufficient hardening for the timber
                    of the house; so it was reputed a far better medicine to keep the goodman and
                    his family from the quacks or pose; wherewith, as then, very few were
                    acquainted. Again, our pewterers in time past employed the use of pewter only
                    upon dishes and pots, and a few other trifles for service; whereas now they are
                    grown into such exquisite cunning, that they can in a manner imitate by infusion
                    any form or fashion of cup, dish, salt, bowl, or goblet, which is made by the
                    goldsmith’s craft, though they be ever so curious and very artificially forged.
                    In some places beyond the sea, a garnish of good flat English pewter (I say
                    flat, because dishes and platters in my time began to be made deep, and like
                    basons, and are indeed more convenient both for sauce and keeping the meat warm)
                    is esteemed so precious as the like number of vessels that are made of fine
                    silver.”</p>
                <p>Particular instances of luxury, in eating, however, might be produced from an
                    earlier period, and would be found to surpass even the extravagance of the
                    Romans. Thus, in the tenth year of the reign of Edward IV., 1470, George Nevill,
                    brother to the Earl of Warwick, at his instalment into the archiepiscopal see of
                    York, entertained most of the nobility and principal clergy, when his bill of
                    fare was 300 quarters of wheat, 350 tuns of ale, 104 tuns of wine, a pipe of
                    spiced wine, eighty fat oxen, six wild bulls, 1004 weathers, 300 hogs, 300
                    calves, 3000 geese, 3000 capons, 300 pigs, 100 peacocks, 200 cranes, 200 kids,
                    2000 chickens, 4000 pigeons, 4000 rabbits, 204 bitterns, 4000 ducks, 200
                    pheasants, 500 partridges, 200 woodcocks, 400 plovers, 100 curlews, 100 quails,
                    1000 egrets, 200 rees, 400 bucks, does, and roebucks, 1506 hot venison pastics,
                    4000 cold ditto, 1000 dishes of jelly parted, 4000 dishes of jelly plain, 4000
                    cold custards, 2000 hot custards, 300 pikes, 300 breams, eight seals, four
                    porpuses, 400 tarts. At this feast the Earl of Warwick was steward, the Earl of
                    Bedford treasurer, and Lord Hastings comptroller, with many more noble officers;
                    and there were 1000 servitors, 62 cooks, 515 menial apparitors in the kitchen.
                    But such was the fortune of the man, that after his extreme prodigality, he died
                    in the most abject but unpitied poverty, <hi rend="italic">vinctus
                    jacuit</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">summa inopia.</hi></p>
                <p>And as to <hi rend="italic">dress,</hi> luxury in that article seems to have
                    attained a great height long before Holinshed’s time. For in the reign of Edward
                    III. we find no fewer than seven sumptuary laws passed in one session of
                    parliament to restrain it. It was enacted, that men-servants of lords, as also
                    of tradesmen and artisans, shall be content with one meal of fish or flesh every
                    day; and the other meals, daily, shall be of milk, cheese, butter, and the like.
                    Neither shall they use any ornaments of gold, silk, or embroidery; nor their
                    wives and daughters any veils above the price of twelvepence. Artisans and
                    yeomen; shall not wear cloth above 40s. the whole piece (the finest then being
                    about L.6 per piece), nor the ornaments before named; <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193209275" xml:id="kp-eb0713-9275-0604"/>nor the women any veils of
                    silk, but only those of thread made in England. Gentlemen under the degree of
                    knights, not having L.100 yearly in land, shall not wear any cloth above 4½
                    marks the whole piece. Neither shall they or their females use cloth of gold,
                    silver, or embroidery. But esquires having L.200 per annum or upwards of rent
                    may wear cloths of five marks the whole piece of cloth; and they and their
                    females may also wear stuff of silk, silver, ribbons, girdles, or furs.
                    Merchants, citizens, burghers, and artificers or tradesmen, as well of London as
                    elsewhere, who have goods and chattels of the clear value of L,500, and their
                    females, may wear as is allowed to gentlemen and esquires of L.100 per annum.
                    And merchants, citizens, and burgesses, worth above L.1000 in goods and
                    chattels, and their females, may wear the same as gentlemen of L.200 per annum.
                    Knights of 200 marks yearly may wear cloth of six marks the cloth, but no
                    higher; but no cloth of gold, nor furred with ermine: but all knights and ladies
                    having above 400 marks yearly, up to L.1000 per annum, may wear as they
                    please,ermine excepted; and they may wear ornaments of pearl and precious stones
                    for their heads only. Clerks having degrees in cathedrals, colleges, may wear as
                    knights and esquires of the same income. Ploughmen, carters, shepherds, and such
                    like, not having 40s. value in goods or chattels, shall wear no sort of cloth
                    but blanket and russet lawn at 12d. and shall wear girdles and belts; and they
                    shall only eat and drink suitable to their stations. And whosoever uses other
                    apparel than is prescribed by the above laws shall forfeit the same.</p>
                <p>Concerning the general utility of luxury to a state, there is much difference of
                    opinion amongst political writers. Montesquieu asserts, that luxury is necessary
                    to monarchies, as in France, but that it is ruinous to democracies, as in
                    Holland. With regard, therefore, to Britain, whose government is compounded of
                    both species, it is held to be a dubious question, how far private luxury is a
                    public evil, and, as such, cognizable by public laws; and indeed our legislators
                    have several times changed their sentiments as to this point; for formerly there
                    were a number of penal laws existing to restrain excess in apparel, chiefly made
                    in the reigns of Edward III. IV. and Henry VΠI. a specimen of which we have
                    inserted above. But all of them it appeared expedient to repeal at an after
                    period. In fact, although luxury will of necessity increase according to the
                    influx of wealth,- it may not be for the general benefit of commerce to impose,
                    as in the above-cited laws, an absolute prohibition of every degree of it; yet,
                    for the good of the public, it may be necessary that such as go beyond proper
                    bounds in eating, drinking, and wearing what by no means is suitable to their
                    station, should be taxed accordingly, could it be done without including those
                    who have a better title to such indulgence. This is certainly, however, a point
                    which should be maturely weighed before it be executed; and, in mercantile
                    countries at least, such restraints may be found prejudicial, most likely
                    impracticable, especially where true liberty is established. Sir William Temple
                    observes, speaking of the trade and riches, and at the same time of the
                    frugality, of the Hollanders,“That some of our maxims are not so certain as
                    current in politics; as that encouragement of excess and luxury, if employed in
                    the consumption of native commodities, is of advantage to trade. It may be so to
                    that which impoverishes, but not to that which enriches, a country. It is indeed
                    less prejudicial if it lies in native than in foreign wares; but the humour of
                    luxury and expense cannot stop at certain bounds; what begins in native will
                    proceed to foreign commodities; and though the example arise among idle persons,
                    yet the imitation will run into all degrees, even of those men by whose industry
                    the nation subsists. And besides, the more of our own we spend, the less shall
                    we have to send abroad; and so it will come to pass, that while we drive a vast
                    trade, yet, by buying much more than we <hi rend="italic">sell,</hi> we shall
                    come to be poor at last.”</p>
