                <p><label type="entry">LONDON</label>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> city, the metropolis of the British empire, is
                    situated on both banks of the Thames, if the name be taken collectively, and in
                    that sense, though chiefly within the county of Middlesex, includes a part of
                    Surrey, and, for purposes of criminal judicature (by the act of William IV,
                    called the Central Criminal Court Act), a portion of the counties of Essex and
                    Kent.</p>
                <p>Like most cities, the early history of this is lost in the obscurity of remote
                    ages. The first notice of its existence to which implicit credit can be given is
                    that in the Annals of Tacitus (lib. iv), who says, “Londinum cognomento quidem
                    coloniae non insigne, sed copia negotiatorum et commeatuum maxime celebre.” The
                    derivation of the name of this city has been variously traced, and though it
                    must remain a matter of doubt, we state that which seems the most probable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Llin</hi> in the Celtic or ancient British language signified a
                    lake, and <hi rend="italic">din</hi> a town or a harbour for ships. As until
                    recent dates the Surrey side of the river was often a lake in some parts, and a
                    swamp in others, the name might be easily changed from Llindin to London, and be
                    descriptive of its local position. It could got, however be a place of very
                    great importance at the time of the invasion of England by Julius Caesar, for
                    though that commander must have passed near it, he has not noticed it in his
                    Commentaries.</p>
                <p>The Romans, who appear to have taken possession of this city under the Emperor
                    Claudius, about 100 years after the invasion of Caesar, gave to it the name of
                    Augustus in honour of that prince. Under the Roman government it was erected
                    into a praefecture, and the inhabitants, though the name of citizens of Rome was
                    conferred upon them, were not allowed to be governed by their own laws, but by
                    military magistrates sent annually from Rome. It must then have acquired some
                    degree of importance, because, in several of the <hi rend="italic">itinera</hi>
                    of Antoninus, the roads are described by him as beginning or ending at this
                    place. The doubts respecting the author of the <hi rend="italic">itinera,</hi>
                    and the time when they were drawn up, make this inference of less authority.</p>
                <p>It seems certain that, under the Romans, London was not fortified at an early
                    period of their occupation; for when the Britons revolted against the Romans,
                    and were led by their Queen Boadicea, she captured the city and burned it, after
                    a general massacre of the inhabitants. It continued still without
                    fortifications, till, according to Woodward, the reign of Constantine, or,
                    according to Maitland, till the governorship of Theodosius, in the year 369. The
                    great number of coins of Helena, the mother of the Emperor Constantine, which
                    have been found under the walls, give the greatest degree of probability to the
                    opinion of the former of these authors. It was certainly erected into an
                    episcopal city by that emperor after he had been converted to the Christian
                    religion; and that increases the probability of the opinion that he constructed
                    the walls, for all the sees of bishops were originally within fortified
                    places.</p>
                <p>Whatever may have been the date of the erection of the walls, the limits to which
                    they then extended may now be ascertained by the concurrent testimony of all the
                    antiquarians, and by the ruins of the foundations and of parts of I the wall
                    which have been traced out within very recent periods.</p>
                <p>A fort on the site now occupied by the Tower of Lon-lon, formed the commencement
                    of the defences. A wall vas extended from it through the Minories to Aldgate,
                    whence it proceeded between Bevis Marks, Cammomile street, and Houndsditch,
                    across the churchyard of Bishopsgate to Cripplegate. It then took a southerly
                    course to Aldersgate, from which it run south-west by the back of Christ’s
                    Hospital and Old Newgate, and passing behind the present prison of Newgate and
                    Stationers’ Court, reached Ludgate. From that gate it proceeded westerly by Cock
                    Court to the river Fleet, now New Bridge Street, and terminated at a fort called
                    afterwards Barnard’s Castle. It was also then covered by another wall along the
                    bank of the Thames, which, however, was destroyed at a very remote period. The
                    extent of the wall, exclusive of that by the side of the river, was two miles
                    and one furlong; that on the bank one mile and a tenth. The height of the walls
                    was twenty-two feet, and they were defended by fifteen lofty towers. Through
                    some of these were the great roads leading to the different parts of the
                    kingdom. The praetorian way, or the Watling Street, passed under Newgate, and
                    then turned towards the river, where was a ferry connected with the road to
                    Dover. The'Hermin Street road passed under Cripplegate. Another passed through·
                    Aldgate and proceeded by Bethnal Green to the old ford over the river Lea, and
                    on towards Essex, Suffolk, and Norfolk. In process of time other roads were laid
                    out, when the gates corresponding to them were erected and-received the names of
                    Bridgegate, Ludgate, Aldersgate, Moorgate, Bishopsgate, and the Postem on
                    Tower-hill.</p>
                <p>It is probable that, after the Romans had been induced to withdraw their forces
                    from England, and left it exposed to the ravages of the northern tribes of Picts
                    and Scotch, London was not much improved or extended. When the Saxons had fixed
                    themselves in the country, and assumed something approaching to a regular
                    government, the city, which had suffered severely during the contests between
                    the Britons and the invaders, soon recovered its former rank, and acquired new
                    importance; so that at that period the Venerable Bede writes of it as a princely
                    town of trade under the rule of a chief magistrate, whose title of portgrave or
                    portreeve conveys the idea that its commerce by water must have been for the
                    time so great as to require magisterial superintendence.</p>
                <p>During those civil wars which the new Saxon masters of England carried on against
                    each other till the several kingdoms were united under one head in the person of
                    Egbert, in 819, the city of London, if it did not maintain a neutrality, seems
                    to have sufficiently increased in importance to induce that prince to make it
                    the capital of his whole kingdom; which it has continued to be ever since that
                    reign.</p>
                <p>Soon after this the Danes began their nautical predatory excursions, and at
                    length, after attacking the northern ports of the kingdom, in 849 entered the
                    Thames with 250 vessels, seized upon London, plundered and then burned it, and
                    exercised their savage cruelties on the inhabitants. A second attempt by some
                    piratical people was made, and with greater force, about two years after; but on
                    this occasion, King Ethelwolf and his son Athelbald collected a sufficient force
                    to disappoint and finally to overcome the invaders, though the returning
                    prosperity of London received a severe check by the attempt.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Alfred the Great, London soon began to recover from the ruinous
                    condition in which the attempts of the Danish invaders had left it. He restored
                    the ruined defences, expelled those of the Danes who had been settled there,
                    affirmed the privileges which had been conferred, added to them others, and
                    contributed much to ornament the whole city. Having made it a place of security
                    by its walls,rand capable of a powerful defence, it was placed under the
                    government of his son-in-law, Ethelred duke of Mercia<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193207741" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7741-0486"/>. In this condition it was,
                    when, in 893, an accidental fire bursting forth spread with unextinguisl}able
                    fury, and the houses being wholly constructed of wood, became at length a prey
                    to the flames. As the walls were uninjured by the conflagration, the security
                    they afforded encouraged the government and the inhabitants to restore their
                    losses with great expedition. The city was first divided into wards, and
                    magistrates were appointed to each, who then bore the name of sheriffs, a title
                    which had been first created for those who exercised the authority of the
                    monarch in the several districts into which he had divided the whole kingdom. In
                    the portreeve and those sheriffs are to be found the first traces of that system
                    which, with some variations, has continued to regulate the affairs of the city
                    to the present time. As soon as Alfred had settled the general state of his
                    dominions into moderate tranquillity, his attention was drawn to the capital,
                    and the spirit he inspired was speedily exhibited in London. The new houses were
                    constructed with more solidity, and with greater skill and ornament. The chief
                    material used in the buildings was still wood, but some of the nobility were
                    induced by the king to erect houses within the walls of the capital in which
                    stone or bricks were used, and a few of the more wealthy citizens followed the
                    example thus shewn to them; but still the number of such buildings was small in
                    proportion to the whole. At that time thatch was the universal covering.</p>
                <p>England had rested from the ravages of the Danes more than a century, when, in
                    1013, the King of Denmark, Swend, called by English writers Sweyne, or Sweno,
                    aided by Olaf Tryggvason, King of Norway, undertook the subjugation of the whole
                    kingdom. The Danish monarch landed in the Humber with a powerful and splendid
                    armament; and leaving his fleet there under the command of his son Kund or
                    Canute, marched his forces into Wessex, which he laid waste and subdued.
                    Ethelred then abandoned his palace and capital, and sought refuge in the Isle of
                    Wight. The burgesses of London opened their gates to the invader, who was
                    acknowledged as their king by the Anglo-Saxons; and Ethelred, who had married
                    Emma, daughter of the Duke of Normandy, repaired for safety to that country.</p>
                <p>Although war was still carried on in the kingdom by the Danes under Canute, who
                    had succeeded to the power of his father, and by the Anglo-Saxons under the
                    Prince Edmund Ironside, the result was so doubtful, that a compromise was
                    entered into by the two commanders, by which Canute secured his power over the
                    city of London, and was acknowledged and received there as the lawful sovereign.
                    Canute, then, as master of the whole kingdom, imposed upon his subjects a tax to
                    pay his army, amounting to L. 72,000, of which L. 10,500 was to be paid by
                    London. As far as the combined wealth and the population can be measured by the
                    amount of taxation, London might then be considered as constituting one-seventh
                    part of the whole kingdom, and this is nearly the proportion which it has borne
                    from that time to the present day.</p>
                <p>On settling the succession to the crown, after the death of Canute in 1046, the
                    English supported the son of King Ethelred, or, on default of him, Hardicanute,
                    a son of Canute, by Queen Emma; whilst the citizens of London espoused the
                    claims of Harold Harefoot, a son of Canute by the Queen. Edward’s party speedily
                    declined, and the two half brothers remained the sole competitors. Hardicanute
                    repaired early to England; and an assembly, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >wittena-gemote,</hi> was convened at Oxford, consisting of all the nobles to
                    the north of the Thames, at which Harold was raised to the throne. At this
                    assembly, where nobles only were admitted, the pilots of London, comprehending
                    probably those who were the chief merchants, also held a meeting, and no
                    important affairs were resolved upon without their cqnsent. Some have
                    represented this as the first instance of London having sent members to a
                    legislature; whereas it seems to have been more like an aristocratic assembly,
                    to which chartered citizens, forming a kind of commercial nobility, were
                    admitted.</p>
                <p>After the defeat of the Saxons, at the battle of Hastings, the city of London
                    tendered a ready submission to William the Norman, who confirmed to them the
                    privileges which former monarchs had bestowed, and granted additional power by
                    two new charters. The city was tranquil and prosperous; but it received a severe
                    check by a fire, which consumed a great part of the houses in 1077; and by
                    another, nine years afterwards, when the new buildings, as well as the old, were
                    consumed together. The fire of 1086, which began near Ludgate, burned the
                    cathedral of St Paul’s, which, however, was soon rebuilt, with more than its
                    former magnificence.</p>
                <p>During the reign of the second William, the prosperity of the city was in some
                    measure checked by the exactions he enforced, but in a greater degree by several
                    fires, some violent hurricanes, and extensive inundations. Henry, who succeeded,
                    granted several immunities to the city, which tended to increase its commerce;
                    and he especially restrained the rapacity of the Norman barons, and prohibited
                    within the walls the insolent conduct which they had practised to an enormous
                    excess. The city continued to flourish under Stephen, and his turbulent reign;
                    though, for his own warlike purposes, he exacted large sums of money. The
                    prosperity of the city seems to have begotten internal disorders. Many
                    confederacies were formed, in which some of the rich citizens engaged, to commit
                    robberies, and even murders, in the night time. For these the inhabitants were
                    made to pay a fine of five thousand pounds, and one of the conspirators, a rich
                    man of the name of Senex, was hanged, though an offer of five hundred pounds
                    weight of silver was made to save him from the gallows.</p>
                <p>Henry II. changed the title of portreeve for that of bailiff; and that officer
                    claimed, as a matter of right, the performance of the duty of butler at the
                    subsequent coronation of Richard I. In 1191, the bailiff assumed, or was
                    granted, the title of mayor; and the following year Henry Fitz-Alwene, who then
                    filled the office, issued orders in his own name, jointly with that of the
                    aldermen, for the prevention of fires. By this document it was commanded that
                    “all houses to be erected in London hereafter, whether in the city or in the
                    liberties thereof, should be built of stone, with party walls of the same; and
                    should be covered either with slates or tiles, to prevent those dreadful
                    calamities which were frequently and chiefly occasioned by houses built with
                    wood, and thatched with straw or reeds.” For this purpose it was also provided
                    by the more discreet men of the city, that “twelve aldermen of the city should
                    be chosen in full hustings, and there sworn to assist the mayor in appeasing
                    contentions that might arise among neighbours in the city, upon inclosure
                    betwixt land and land, and to regulate the dimensions of party walls, which were
                    to be of stone sixteen feet high and three feet thick; and to give directions
                    about girders, windows, gutters, and walls.” In 1198, Richard, who placed
                    confidence in the wisdom and fidelity of the city of London, when resolved to
                    fix a standard of weights and measures for the whole kingdom, committed to the
                    sheriffs of London and Middlesex the execution of his plan; and they were
                    charged to provide measures, gallows, iron rods and weights for standards, which
                    were to be sent to every part of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>King John, who succeeded Richard, conferred additional favours on the city of
                    London, by several charters which were granted in his reign. He first confirmed
                    Tormer grants, and conferred on the citizens the privilege of entering his
                    foreign dominions free from all tolls and taxes; a matter of considerable
                    advantage in the commerce with <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207754"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-7754-0487"/>Nortnatìdy, whence wine was imported, and to which
                    English wool was exported. This was, however, an affair of bargain, as the king
                    was paid for the privilege one thousand pounds weight of silver. By another
                    charter the citizens of London had conferred on them the jurisdiction and
                    conservation of the river Thames, and an additional grant of the Same right over
                    the river Medway. A third charter conveyed to the citizens the power of choosing
                    their sheriffs, who had before been nominated by the crown, and also invested
                    them with the right of shrievalty over the county of Middlesex, and valuable
                    fee-farm rents, of which they had been deprived under a former reign.</p>
                <p>Henry III. made several attempts to encroach upon those privileges which his
                    predecessors had conferred upon London; and this conduct was productive of many
                    serious disturbances both in London and in Westminster. They were suppressed by
                    violent and arbitrary measures, and at length the whole nation was in a state of
                    alarm, when the parliament interposed, and induced the king to redress, or
                    promise to redress, the most severe of the grievances that were the subject of
                    complaint; but, with respect to the city, the charters were renewed, and the
                    rights and privileges of the citizens confirmed. At this time the right of using
                    a common seal was granted. The king, however, during his whole reign, continued
                    to exact money from the city.</p>
                <p>During that long reign of fifty-six years, though the city was sorely afflicted
                    with two years of famine, first in 1258, when, according to Fleetwood, many
                    people were starved, and again, in 1270, when, according to the same authority,
                    “provisions were so scaree, that parents did eat their own children,” and wheat
                    was sold at a price, equivalent in our money to thirty-six shillings the bushel;
                    London on the whole continued to increase, but was disgraced, if not retarded,
                    in the progress of its foreign commerce, by the cruelties and plunderings which
                    were exercised towards the Jews who had settled there.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Edward I. the city was first divided into twenty-four wards, each
                    of which was then allowed to choose common councilmen and an alderman. Under
                    Edward III. the city received some additions to its authority, the most eminent
                    of which was the perpetual right of magisterial supremacy over the borough of
                    Southwark. An epidemic disease, or kind of plague, proved a calamitous
                    visitation to London. It first became apparent in 1348, and was said to have
                    been imported from the East. Its ravages were so extensive, that it is related
                    in the chronicles of the time that more than 50,000 persons became its victims;
                    and it did not altogether disappear till it had been nine years the source of
                    grief and anxiety.</p>
                <p>In the year 1380 the insurrection of Wat Tyler alarmed the city, but was soon
                    suppressed without much difficulty. It is stated to have been put down by the
                    zeal of Sir William Walworth, the lord-mayor, who stabbed the leader of the <hi
                    rend="italic">jaquerie</hi> in Smithfield. In commemoration of this event the
                    dagger was added to the arms of the city.</p>
                <p>The first illuminations in the city took place at the coronation of Henry IV.,
                    and, after the victories of Henry V. in France, they were again repeated; from
                    which time London began to be lighted at night by lanthorns.</p>
                <p>The latter part of the reign of Henry VI. was disturbed by insurrections in
                    several parts of the kingdom; the chief of which, as affected London, was that
                    in Kent under the guidance of John or Jack Cade. He collected a body of » 20,000
                    men, and having obtained some slight success over the Sheriff near Sevenoaks, he
                    advanced to London, which opened its gates to admit him, whilst the king fled to
                    Kenilworth. At first some order was preserved by Cade; but he found himself
                    unable to repress the riotous disposition of his followers. All became confusion
                    among them; and the leader being killed, and several of his followers execut ed,
                    the suppression of the revolt was the speedy consequence. This event occurred in
                    1450, and it was soon followed by the wars between the houses of York and
                    Lancaster. In this contest, the city of London chiefly favoured the interests of
                    the latter family; and, after the battle of Barnet, Edward IV. bestowed the
                    honour of knighthood on the mayor, the recorder, and twelve of the aidermen. In
                    this reign occurs the first notice to be found of bricks being used for building
                    London. They were burned in Moorfields. It was also the era in which the first
                    printing-press was constructed and worked by Caxton; and about the same time,
                    the cisterns and conduits for supplying water, in several parts of the city and
                    suburbs, were erected.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Henry VII. a nondescript disease, called the sweating sickness,
                    generally prevailed in England, but especially in London, where it appears that
                    two mayors and six aldermen, with numerous other citizens, fell victims to this
                    disease. Notwithstanding the very extensive spoliations committed on the city by
                    the king and his favourites, Empson and Dudley, some considerable improvements
                    were made. The chapel at Westminster, bearing that monarch’s name, was
                    commenced; the river Fleet was rendered navigable to Holborn Bridge; and an
                    artillery-ground for the practice of archery was established.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Henry VIII. the city successfully resisted the attempts of that
                    monarch to extort money without the authority of Parliament. Many improvements
                    were made, to which the suppression of several of the religious houses
                    contributed; nor were these much impeded by the religious persecutions sometimes
                    directed against Catholics, and at others against Protestants.</p>
                <p>In the short reign of his son Edward, London was permanently benefited by the
                    establishment of the great hospitals of Christ’s, of Bridewell, and of St
                    Thomas’s.</p>
                <p>Owing to the wise conduct of Elizabeth and her ministers, the prosperity of
                    London advanced during the whole of her reign. The great number of intelligent
                    and wealthy persons who took refuge there from the cruel wars carried on in the
                    Netherlands, and who were protected by the government, generated a spirit of
                    industry and order amongst all classes; and they introduced numerous
                    manufactures before unknown in England, which conferred benefits upon the whole
                    kingdom, and especially upon London, which was the chief point from which the
                    trade was carried on. She, as well as her successor James, was averse to the
                    great increase that was going on in houses and inhabitants in London, and both
                    issued unavailing proclamations to prevent its growth. As abundant materials of
                    that period are now extant, it may not be uninteresting to sketch from them a
                    short description of the extent of metropolis which created serious uneasiness
                    to the government of that time, and to enable the reader to contrast the state
                    of the city at that period, with the appearance which it now exhibits.</p>
                <p>By some apparently correct maps of the reign of James I. it may be seen that the
                    chief part of London was along Newgate Street, Cheapside, the Poultry and
                    Cornhill, and the various streets and alleys leading from them to the banks of
                    the Thames. Except in Coleman Street and a few scattered houses in Lothbury and
                    Bishopsgate, all the way lower down was garden-ground or fields. There was an
                    irregular street from Bishopsgate to Shoreditch Church, with open fields behind
                    the houses; and Houndsditch was a single row of houses, looking on the city
                    walls, with open fields behind them. What is now Goswell Street was then called
                    the St Alban’s Road, with a few houses. Clerkenwell consisted chiefly of the
                    monastery, the gardens, and buildings which had belonged to the church; and
                    thence to Gray’s-inn-lane was open field, with a few gardens. From Holborn
                    Bridge to Red Lion Street there were houses on both sides; but they ceased
                    there; and the road to the small village of St Giles’s had hedges on both sides,
                    and still <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207767" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7767-0488"/>has
                    the addition, “in-the-fields,” to its name. To the northward and westward of
                    this spot, all was open field, excepting on the road to Oxford, on both sides of
                    which were hedges and a few trees. Tyburn was then a hamlet two miles from
                    London. A road proceeded from the road to Oxford, and joined that leading to
                    Reading, opposite to what had been the hospital, but subsequently the palace, of
                    St James’s. There were a few houses near St Martin’s Church, in the way to the
                    garden of the convent; but Leicester Square, Long Acre, Seven Dials, and Drury
                    Lane were open fields.</p>
                <p>Along the Strand were houses on both sides, but those to the south were chiefly
                    palaces of the nobility, with gardens behind them extending to the river. These
                    were in the occupation of the peers, whose names have been given to the streets
                    which have been built on their stately mansions, viz. Northumberland, Salisbury,
                    Arundel, Cecil, Norfolk, Surrey, Villiers, Buckingham, and Essex. Each of the
                    noble owners kept barges, with watermen in splendid liveries, to convey them
                    either to the city or to the court at Whitehall, or to visit at Lambeth or
                    Chelsea.</p>
                <p>Spring-gardens were a series of walks extending to the palace of Whitehall,
                    whence to the Abbey there was a regular street, and a few beyond, facing the
                    water, near the spot on which Abingdon Street has since been built.</p>
                <p>On the Surrey side, there were not ten houses between Lambeth and where now is
                    the west foot of Blackfriars’ Bridge; but from that point a row of houses was
                    continued to the borough. Where Christchurch now stands, was a theatre of some
                    kind, called Paris Gardens. It is said that Ben Jonson was an actor on these
                    boards. It seems to have been most frequented on Sunday, and to this profanation
                    its fate has been attributed. Being filled with spectators in 1582, the
                    scaffolding fell, when a number of persons were killed and many much injured.
                    Below this was a large circular building for bear and bull baiting, which
                    attracted great crowds, and where it has been said Queen Elizabeth frequently
                    attended the spectacle. Southwark then extended but a short distance along the
                    High Street, and there were small scattered houses from Tooley Street to
                    Horsely-down.</p>
                <p>During the reign of James, the streets were first paved with stones. The city
                    was. however, visited by the plague in 1604, by which many of its inhabitants
                    were carried off.</p>
                <p>In the commencement of the reign of Charles I., the metropolis was once more
                    visited by the plague; and though it was not of long duration, the deaths
                    occasioned by it were estimated to amount to near 40,000 persons. In the civil
                    wars of that unfortunate period, a majority of the corporation of London, and
                    most of the lower class of citizens, took the side of the House of Commons; and
                    the treasury of the city was found of great service to the party they espoused.
                    As long as the king maintained an army, it was remarked by the writers of the
                    day that no building in the city was carried on; but, after the battle of
                    Leicester, the progress of erecting new houses proceeded as before.</p>
                <p>After the restoration of the monarchy, London began greatly to revive; but a
                    serious check was given to its advancement, first by that dreadful visitation
                    the plague, which first appeared in December 1664, and continued till January
                    1666. The greatest number of deaths were between May and October 1665, when the
                    victims of this disease increased from 500 to 8000 in a week. The effect of this
                    visitation, during its continuance, was to suspend all trade, to close the
                    exchange and the courts of law, and to leave the houses, which had been rendered
                    vacant by the demise of the occupiers, a prey to bands of thoughtless and
                    desperate plunderers. The total number of deaths occasioned by this calamity has
                    been estimated at 100,000, or nearly one-third of the whole population.</p>
                <p>A short period only intervened between this calamitous visitation and another,
                    which seemed to be a dispensation of Providence, to cure one evil by another. On
                    the 2d of September 1666, a fire broke out in a lane near London Bridge, then as
                    now called Pudding Lane. It was on a Sunday, when the people were repairing to
                    the churches. It spread with wonderful rapidity, being increased by a very high
                    wind; and it is remarked by Vincent, that during the progress of the fire, the
                    wind frequently changed its direction, so as to convey the inflammatory matter
                    to parts in which, a few minutes before, no apprehension of danger had been
                    entertained. The houses were mostly of wood, and much crowded together; water
                    was scarce, and the atmosphere dry. In every direction the fire spread; and
                    Evelyn, one of the most observant spectators, compares the whole spectacle to a
                    sea of fire. It raged four days and nights, and in that time five-sixths of the
                    whole city within the walls were reduced to ashes. In the destruction, the halls
                    of the companies, the churches, and other public buildings, though of less
                    inflammable substances than the dwellings, fell alike a sacrifice to the
                    devouring element. At length the blowing up of some houses by gunpowder,
                    depriving the fire of materials to feed upon, the progress was stopped near to
                    St Bartholomew’s Hospital, at a place called Pye Corner. The ruins covered a
                    space upwards of a mile in length, and half a mile in breadth. It would have
                    been difficult at that day, and is much more so at the present time, to estimate
                    the pecuniary loss suffered by this visitation. It was calculated by some, but
                    the grounds of the calculation are unknown, that the value of buildings and
                    goods consumed amounted to ten or twelve millions sterling. A spirit of wisdom
                    and generosity seemed to have been created by the magnitude of the suffering;
                    and the government, as well as individuals, made wonderful exertions to
                    administer relief. The tents in the Tower, and the sails from the shipping, were
                    converted into temporary coverings for sheds to accommodate the inhabitants. The
                    roads were almost choked with horses and waggons loaded with necessaries, and
                    the boats and barges upon the river were occupied in the same employment.
                    Measures were immediately adopted to rebuild the city, and a commission w∙as
                    appointed, of which Sir Christopher Wren was the most active member, for
                    adjusting the boundaries of the property that bad been covered with ashes, and
                    for regulating the new streets that were to be built. Attention was not only
                    directed to immediate necessities, but extended to other objects; such as
                    rebuilding the public edifices which had been burned, of which St Paul’s
                    Cathedral was one.</p>
                <p>By what means the number of labourers were collected, or from what funds the
                    money to pay their wages was obtained, has been often the subject of very
                    unsatisfactory inquiry; but it is certain that the city was rebuilt with a
                    degree of rapidity which excited the astonishment of the age that witnessed it.
                    The work was well conducted; for the greater part of the public and private
                    buildings which now exist were erected at that period, and are still firm and
                    strong after the lapse of 170 years. The city rose in about four years, more
                    commodious than before; and, however the fact may be accounted for, since that
                    period, it has never been visited by that tremendous disease the plague, whose
                    recurrence before had been so frequent and so extensively fatal.</p>
                <p>From the time of this reconstruction, few events are to be noticed that affect
                    London peculiarly. Almost all important occurrences belong rather to the history
                    of England than to that of its metropolis. The revocation of the edict of Nantes
                    in France brought to London many French Protestant families, who introduced the
                    manufactory of silk, and peopled Spitalfields, and of others, who being
                    ornamental jewellers and goldsmiths, were first established in Long Acre, Seven
                    Dials, and Soho.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207780" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7780-0489"/>
                <p>The continued growth of London in the reign of Queen Anne, induced the passing of
                    a law in 1711 for constructing fifty new churches, for which a provision was
                    made by a tax on all coals brought into the river Thames. The streets were first
                    generally lighted at night. The several parishes were provided with fire-engines
                    and buckets, and measures were instituted for watching the city. In the same
                    reign, Clerkenwell, Old Street, the lower part of Shoreditch, Marlborough
                    Street, Soho, Bedford Row, Red Lion Square, and a district north of Holborn,
                    were added to the city.</p>
                <p>In the reign of George I. some, but not great, additions were made to London,
                    chiefly to the north of Oxford Street, about Marylebone, and Berkeley
                    Square.</p>
                <p>Although the increase of London proceeded, it was at a languid pace, compared
                    with what has been more recently exhibited, throughout the whole reign of George
                    II. New parishes were erected, viz. St George’s, Bloomsbury; St Ann’s,
                    Limehouse; St Paul’s, Deptford; and St Mathew’s, Bethnal Green. The river Fleet
                    was covered with an arch, and a market built upon it; Grosvenor Square was
                    built, and also Westminster Bridge, with its appendage Great George Street.
                    Roads were also formed in several directions, the chief of which was that from
                    Paddington to Islington, surrounding the northern part of the city.</p>
                <p>The accession of George III. was followed by the peace of Paris in the year 1763,
                    and that event gave a fresh stimulus to improvement and extension. A new bridge
                    was built at Blackfriars, with handsome streets leading to it, and a great
                    number of new dwellings were erected on the Surrey side of the river. On the
                    north-west side the parishes of Paneras and Marylebone were formed. It was at
                    the same period that the excellent pavement forming the footpath for passengers
                    was first laid down, and the kennels removed from the middle of the streets to
                    the two sides of them. Most of the houses had large signs suspended across die
                    street, which darkened them, and prevented the circulation of air. These were
                    removed by law, and as they were used for distinguishing the several houses, the
                    practice <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> of fixing a number to each house was
                    introduced. About the same time the names of the streets, lanes, and squares
                    were ordered to be marked at each corner. During the fearly part of that reign,
                    the complaints of the Spitalfields weavers, and the agitation created by Wilkes,
                    with the war with America that succeeded these grumbling times, seem jto have
                    given a temporary check to extension, as only Somerset House and Manchester
                    Square, with some parochial chapels in Marylebone, date their commencement in
                    that series of years. The disgraceful riots of the year 1780, when, for a few
                    days, a contemptible mob destroyed the prisons and several other buildings, may
                    also have had a ten-Jency to impede improvements, which continued to proceed
                    with slow steps, even after the peace of 1783, till the iecession of Mr Pitt to
                    a firm seat at the head of the Ministry. Whether that minister was the cause of
                    the improvements which followed, is not a question to be discussed I nere, but
                    from this period the advance became more rapid, and has never slackened from
                    that to the present day; but, m the contrary, has been constantly proceeding
                    with ac- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> acierated force. The advance had its
                    chief source in the power communicated by the rise of the funds in a short
                    period from fifty to eighty-five; which supplied a spare capital for the
                    construction of docks, by which the commerce of the city was rapidly augmented,
                    and the ground near the water side covered with numerous and convenient
                    structures.</p>
                <p>The trade which enriched the eastern part of the metropolis extended its
                    influence, and displayed its effects, in the western parts. Bedford Square,
                    Russell Square, Brunswick Square, and the well-built streets contiguous to them,
                    have their origin at the period we refer to, and became the habitations of
                    persons, who, by property acquired in commerce, were enabled to spend the latter
                    portion of each day in more elegant quarters than the city offered; though, at
                    that time, the handsome square of Finsbury had been formed, with many good
                    streets in its vicinity.</p>
                <p>The accession of George IV. to the regency in 1812, followed by those glorious
                    victories which led to peace two years afterwards, must be viewed as an era from
                    which to date the commencement of that rapid advance in extent, in elegance of
                    design, and in excellence of workmanship which London now displays, and which is
                    rapidly proceeding.</p>
                <p>In the description of this vast city the first object is the population, its
                    numbers, and gradual augmentation. Like the rest of England, the number of
                    inhabitants in London was a subject of controversy, till the first census of the
                    whole kingdom taken in the year 1801, was produced to the public by the
                    indefatigable and accurate labours of Mr Rickman, under the sanction of an act
                    of Parliament. As the facts ascertained by him at that period have been
                    confirmed by the three subsequent decennial census of 1811, 1821, and 1831, no
                    doubt can be entertained of their complete accuracy.</p>
                <p>Mr Rickman in a kind of summary of population in the limits he assumes, and very
                    properly, as those of the metropolis, makes it in the year 1700 to have been
                    674,000, in the year 1801 to'amount to 1,031,500, in 1811 to 1,220,200, in 1821
                    to 1,481,500, and in 1831 to 1,776,556. As by the successive enumerations, it is
                    clear that the inhabitants have gone on increasing at the rate of twenty per
                    cent, in ten years (and there is no reason to suppose it has proceeded at a
                    slower rate in the last four years), we may add eight per cent, to the
                    population of 1831, and assume that at the present time (April 1835), it amounts
                    to 1,918,680.</p>
                <p>The limits to which this enumeration refers, is to all those parishes the
                    churches of which are situated within eight English miles in a straight line
                    from St Paul’s, adding a twenty-fifth part in each instance as a moderate
                    allowance for the great number of British seamen belonging to the registered
                    shipping at anchor in the Thames, for soldiers quartered in the Tower and in
                    other barracks, or for the transitory population continually arriving and
                    departing so irregularly as to escape all enumeration.</p>
                <p>In giving the population of the metropolis, we shall state that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">city within the walls</hi> in a condensed form, not enumerating
                    each parish, of which some have not 100 inhabitants; but in the <hi
                    rend="italic">city without the walls,</hi> where the parishes are more populous,
                    in Westminster, and in the out-parishes, we shall name each, with their
                    population at every decennial census.</p>
                <p>The city within the walls contains 97 parishes, with a church to each; and the
                    population amounted, in 1801, to 75,377; in 1821, 56,174; in 1831, to
                    55,778.</p>

                <p>Besides the portions formerly called London, the extension of its limits upon
                    every side has caused junctions between the metropolis and many large villages,
                    which are now scarcely to be distinguished from, and in fact form suburbs to it,
                    and rapidly increase with it. They are now as much a part of London as
                    Paddington or Marylebone, because the people who inhabit the houses have their
                    chief occupations in the metropolis, and are thence supplied with most of the
                    necessaries they consume. The calculation before noticed was made by Mr Rickman,
                    to shew the contrast between the population of London and that of Paris, and
                    comprehended a circle of eight miles around St Paul’s; but since the publication
                    of his reports, the law of 1834 has extended the criminal circuit of London
                    somewhat farther, and included in it not only the villages in Middlesex whose
                    prisoners were always tried at the Sessions at the Old Bailey, but has brought
                    within the limits of that court, towns and villages in Essex, Surrey, and Kent.;
                    The places forming, in this view, a part of London, besides those included in
                    the population already stated, are these: m Middlesex, Tottenham, Edmonton,
                    Hornsey, Highgate, ' Hampstead, Hayes, Hendon, Wilsden, Brentford, Acton,
                    Cheswick, Isleworth and Fulham, with Hammersmith; in Surrey, Battersea,
                    Bermondsey, Camberwell, Clapham, Streathaiti, Barnes, Putney, Tooting,’
                    Wandsworth, Mer- ;on, Mortlake, Kew, Wimbledon, and Richmond; in Kent, Eltham,
                    Charlton, Lee, Lewesham, Greenwich, Woolwich, Plumstead, and Deptford; and in
                    the county of Essex, Barking, East Ham, West Ham, Ilford, Low Layton,
                    Wal-hamstow, Wanstead, Chingford, and Woodford.</p>
                <p>Not to occupy too much space, the growth of the popu-ation of these places must
                    be omitted; but the number of inhabitants at the census of 1831 is extracted,
                    and stands thus: In the places within the county of Middlesex, as above
                    mentioned, 70,458; in the county of Surrey, 124,185; in the county of Kent,
                    79,971; and in Essex, 33,769; being together 308,389∙</p>
                <p>The whole population of the metropolis in May 1831 may thus be enumerated :—</p>

                <p>As the limits here assigned to the metropolis are different from those assumed by
                    Mr Rickman, the result of the numbers necessarily varies without any
                    incorrectness in either representation, each of which is taken from the same
                    ascertained facts. Mr Rickman, as has been before remarked, has very judiciously
                    added to the number of persons, as collected from house to house in the
                    metropolis, one twentyfifth part for seamen, military, and temporary residents;
                    which, considering the great number on board the ships, seems not too much.
                    Following the same rule, and adding that proportion to the number before stated,
                    we conclude that the sum total of the population in 1831 was 1,704,830; and,
                    allowing for the same rate of augmentation of two per cent, per annum, similar
                    to what has appeared by the accounts of former periods, we arrive at a
                    conclusion approximating<pb break="no" facs="nls:193207819"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-7819-0492"/> as nearly to accuracy as the nature of the matter
                    will admit, that, in June 1835, the metropolis as here defined contained
                    1,838,490 souls.</p>
                <p>London was founded in a situation peculiarly favourable for a large city. It
                    stands on the banks of a fresh-water river, but yet is operated upon by the
                    tides. The natural soil is composed of gravel and clay, with slight mixtures of
                    loam and clay, a soil easy to be made productive by addition of that animal and
                    vegetable matter which are exuviae of large towns. In every part there are
                    abundant springs of pure water. The valley of the Thames has an immediate
                    gradual ascent on the north side; and on the south side the range of hills is
                    not more than two miles distant, and the intervening flat land has by
                    embankments been well secured against inundations. The air is temperate and
                    rather dry than moist, and the health of the inhabitants has gradually but
                    rapidly improved from the beginning of the last century, when the deaths were
                    annually one in twenty of the whole population, whereas at present they are
                    about one in forty.</p>
                <p>The existence, the growth, and the prosperity of London have all been so indebted
                    to its situation on the river Thames, that any description of that city would be
                    imperfect which did not dedicate a portion of it to what relates to that noble
                    stream.</p>
                <p>The source of the Thames is just within the borders of Gloucestershire, a little
                    to the south-west of Cirencester; and after crossing a small angle of Wiltshire,
                    it again enters that county, and proceeds to Lcchlade. At that place it is
                    brought into connexion with the river Severn by means of a navigable canal,
                    which passes through a tunnel under the park of Lord Bathurst, and then proceeds
                    by Stroud to the river which passes Shrewsbury, Worcester, Gloucester, and
                    Bristol. This was the first communication which was formed between the two
                    greatest of the English rivers. Bold and public spirited as this attempt was,
                    those who have expended their money and their attention on it have reason to
                    regret the inadequate compensation which they have received or are likely to
                    receive.</p>
                <p>The Thames becomes first navigable at Lechlade, and by means of locks carries
                    long barges of about seventy tons burden; but the navigation is long and
                    expensive. In summer, when the water is low, it is necessary to pen it up at the
                    locks till a sufficient body is accumulated. When they are opened, the rush
                    carries them down till they get aground, when they must wait for the next flash,
                    as it is locally called, to carry them forward. In winter it often happens that
                    the water is so swollen as not to admit the barges, whose cargo is piled up
                    high, to pass under the arches of the bridges. Though the barges descend by the
                    current, they must be drawn upwards by horses against the stream, which is very
                    expensive, as, after heavy rains, it is not unusual to see fifteen or sixteen
                    horses drawn ng a single barge, and with the greater difficulty from the towing
                    paths being at such times covered with water. The Thames proceeds along its
                    rich, but in places contracted, valley, till it arrives at Oxford, where it is
                    joined by the Isis, a short but at times copious stream, rising near Iylesbury
                    in Buckinghamshire. From additional quantity of water the barges that navigate
                    from Oxford to London are of a greater burden than those which are used on the
                    more western portion of the stream.</p>
                <p>At Reading the river Kennet empties its water into the Thames. That river is
                    navigable upwards to Newbury, whence a canal connects it with the Avon, which
                    passes to Bath and Bristol; and thus another line of communication is formed
                    between the two great streams the Thames and Severn. Near Stains the river Coln
                    adds its water to that of the now great stream. A few miles lower the Wey joins
                    it, and by a canal from that stream to Basingstoke, a water intercourse is
                    formed with Winchester and Southampton. At Brentford a communication by a cut is
                    made into the Grand Junction Canal; and the Thames proceeds to London with no
                    addition to its water except from the river Wandle on the Surrey side, and some
                    small brooks on both sides. The effect of the tide is felt as high up as
                    Kingston, and sometimes even at Teddington. The rise of the tide just below
                    London Bridge is eighteen feet, by which vessels of three hundred and fifty tons
                    drawing sixteen feet water can approach to the Custom-house. At Deptford the
                    rise is more than twenty feet, by which the largest India ship drawing
                    twenty-three feet water may come to that place. The river continues fresh as low
                    as Woolwich, and even there it is only brackish at high-water in spring-tides.
                    The river above London flows generally over a gravelly or clayey bottom, which
                    gives growth to abundance of weeds, that afford shelter to vast multitudes of
                    fish, and protects them for the illegal fisherman more than the care of the
                    water-bailiff. The length of the course of the river, from the time it becomes
                    navigable at Lechlade, till it reaches London, is 138 miles. As the corporation
                    of the city are the conservators of the river, they appoint a navigation
                    committee, who have the superintendence of the towing-paths, the bridges, the
                    water-courses, and whatever relates to the river, as high as a stone marking the
                    city boundaries a little above the bridge at Staines. Above that place the
                    supervision is divided between the city and a body corporate, which is chiefly
                    composed of the land-owners on both sides of the river.</p>
                <p>The conservation of the river Thames below London is also in some measure under
                    the government of the corporation of the city, and extends up the Medway to
                    Rochester; but the corporation of the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House have a
                    concurrent jurisdiction. The city has the protection of the fishery, but the
                    soil of the river to the main sea is vested in the Trinity House, for the
                    benefit of poor and decayed seamen, their wives, widows and orphans, and no
                    ballast can be raised for any ship without its authority, under very heavy
                    penalties. The appointment and control of pilots, the erection and repairing of
                    marks on the land, the placing and keeping in order the buoys which indicate the
                    channels, and the establishment of floating lights, are under the
                    superintendence of the Trinity House. As there are numerous shoals in the river,
                    and some of them often shift their position, a great deal of vigilance is
                    required, as well as practical nautical knowledge, to perform these important
                    duties; and the legislature has placed the shipping of the port of London under
                    the direction of harbour-masters nominated by the corporation and approved by
                    the Trinity House, who direct the mooring of all vessels excepting within 200
                    yards of the docks, which space is under the control of the dock-masters. In the
                    river Thames, the time of the tides flowing, and the perpendicular height to
                    which it reaches at the full and the change of the moon, are as follow: At
                    London, at Ilf, it rises 18 feet; at Woolwich it is high water at Ilf, at
                    Purfleet at If, at Gravesend at 1∣, at Holy Haven at 12f, at the Nore I2∣; the
                    rise at Purfleet is 17 feet, at Holy Haven 15, and at the Nore 14; but allowance
                    must be made for the wind, which when high greatly affects the tide.</p>
                <p>The tide at the mouth of the Thames is thus full more than two hours before it is
                    high water at London Bridge, and after it flows there, it rises in height
                    upwards for half an hour, in the middle of the river, although the water may
                    have fallen a foot in height, having an eddy current on one or both sides the
                    stream. In like manner, it rises one foot in height before the flood appears to
                    run up.</p>
                <p>Owing to the numerous, and sometimes opposite, directions which the river takes,
                    the change of its currents according to the state of the tide, and the various
                    shoals in many parts, the navigation is intricate and difficult, and the river
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207832" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7832-0493"/>pilots are a
                    distinct class of men from the sea-pilots; the former conducting vessels to
                    Gravesend, and the latter taking charge of them to the Downs, or even to
                    Portsmouth, if they are bound to that place.</p>
                <p>Before the introduction of steam-vessels, and the application of them to the
                    purpose of towing ships, it frequently happened to large loaded vessels ready
                    for sea, whilst an easterly wind blew which would be favourable if they were at
                    sea, that they could not safely descend the river to take advantage of it. It
                    was too dangerous for such large vessels to attempt to drop down with the ebb
                    tide, and impossible to turn to windward against the flood tide; but now
                    steamers can take them in tow and carry them without risk to the part where they
                    can avail themselves of the propitious breeze.</p>
                <p>As the mouth of the Thames, like that of other great rivers, is filled with sand
                    brought down by the constant current of the water, through which banks the water
                    makes its way by channels of greater or less capacity, it is necessary that such
                    channels should be clearly pointed out either by buoys or lights. At the mouth
                    of the Thames, these indications of the channels are numerous, accurately
                    placed, and so distinguished that each can be easily known. The buoys are
                    chiefly to be distinguished by their colour, with due regard to their position
                    or bearing from some object upon the laud. They are securely moored, but turn
                    with the tide. Those upon the several channels are well known to the pilots, and
                    their enumeration here would be of no use, as no vessels attempt the passage in
                    or out without a pilot on board. The lights are fewer, and deserve notice. At
                    the Nore, where the Thames is about nine miles from shore to shore, one of the
                    great channels through the sandbanks begins; a light vessel is placed in the
                    room of a former one which was removed in 1825. The old vessel had two lights,
                    but the present has only one, though of great brilliancy. At the sunk sand there
                    is a floating light, which is an excellent guide for the King’s Channel; this is
                    only lour miles from Harwich lighthouses, for there are two of different
                    heights, which must be kept in a line in going through the channel to that
                    place. There are two towers with a light in each at the same height, but one of
                    these towers was in 1818 raised forty feet above its lightroom, in order to
                    serve as a day-mark.</p>
                <p>On the north passage through the sands, there is a great shoal called the
                    Galloper, extending about four miles in length and being half a mile wide, with
                    only six or seven feet water at low tide. Ever since the year 1804, a vessel has
                    been moored at the south-west end of the sand, in which two lights are exhibited
                    horizontally, from sunset to sunrise. This may be readily distinguished from the
                    Sunk and the Goodwin lights, as the former exhibits but one and the latter three
                    lights.</p>
                <p>There is a lofty lighthouse on the north Foreland, which is an ancient erection
                    of great importance to ships coming in from sea, by which a ledge of rocks which
                    stretch two-thirds of a mile northward from that point, may be avoided. On the
                    pier-head of Ramsgate a light is placed, the principal object of which is to
                    serve as a guide to the harbour. As the lights from the windows of the town were
                    liable to be taken for this, shades of red glass have been affixed, so as to
                    produce a clear red light easily distinguishable.</p>
                <p>The floating light of the Goodwin is intended chiefly for the benefit of vessels
                    arriving from the northward, which, if possible, keep to the eastward of it. In
                    order to distinguish this from the lights on the two Forelands, three distinct
                    lights are exhibited firom the vessel, which is with one mast and a yard
                    crossing it securely moored. The middle of these three lights is considerably
                    higher than those at the two extremes, thus forming an erect triangle not easily
                    mistaken. In foggy or hazy weather, a bell is kept constantly ringing on board,
                    to warn ships that they are near the north end of the sand. On board this
                    vessel, thus kept continually in motion, the small crew is frequently for a long
                    time completely cut off from all intercourse with the shore. On the south
                    Foreland there are one or two lighthouses, but these scarcely belong to the
                    mouth of the Thames, being placed chiefly with a view to prevent vessels from
                    running on the Goodwin sands.</p>
                <p>Complaints, as the commerce of London increased, became very frequent, of the
                    crowded state of the river, of the delay and difficulty of procuring good berths
                    for ships, and of the want of accommodation for discharging cargoes, owing to
                    the scarcity or the distance of commodious warehouses. These complaints called
                    the attention of the merchants and ship-owners, and at length that of the
                    government, to the subject. There were many difficulties to be surmounted,
                    arising from the vested rights of the corporation, and of private individuals
                    who had property in the mooring chains, in the legal quays, the suffrance
                    wharfs, the upland warehouses, and in lighters or other craft, all of which
                    would be injured by the construction of docks. Mr Pitt, then minister, applied
                    all the powers of his mind to the subject in the committee of the House of
                    Commons; and at length, after seven years’ agitation, and with ample
                    compensation to the sufferers, the law was put in force by the commencement of
                    the West India Docks, in February 1800, and by their being opened for the
                    reception of ships in August 1802.</p>
                <p>These, the first establishment of the kind in London, were formed in the gorge of
                    an isthmus called the Isle of Dogs, on the Middlesex side of the river. They
                    comprised at first an import and an export dock, each communicating with one
                    basin of five or six acres in extent, with the main river at Blackwall, and
                    another of two acres at the other end near Limehouse; and parallel to these was
                    constructed the city canal, which having been rendered useless by the
                    application of steam-vessels to tow ships, has been recently also formed into a
                    dock, and contains nineteen acres, now used as a depot for bonded timber.</p>
                <p>The export dock, where eastward-bound ships are loaded, is the smaller of the
                    two, being about twenty-five acres in extent. The import dock is of the same
                    length, but thirty feet wider, and occupies thirty acres of ground. The locks by
                    which admission to both is gained, are forty-five feet wide, and consequently
                    admit vessels of 1200 tons burden. At the highest spring-tides the water is
                    twenty-four feet deep; and there is within the docks sufficient space for 600
                    vessels of from 250 to 600 tons burden. A great benefit has been gained, both by
                    the revenue and the traders, by the separation of the import from the export
                    dock. They are parallel to each other, but are divided by stacks of warehouses,
                    the chief commodities in which are rum, brandy, and other spiritous liquors.
                    There are sheds on the side of the export dock, which afford shelter for goods
                    sent for exportation. The chief warehouses for import goods are on the quays
                    which bound that inclosure. They are admirably contrived for the reception,
                    preservation, and delivery of goods, and are capable of storing 170,000 hhds. of
                    sugar, besides coffee and other tropical productions.</p>
                <p>The whole space occupied by these docks and warehouses extends over 295 acres. It
                    is inclosed on every side; all the buildings are fire-proof; and the premises
                    are well guarded by watchmen, so that the system of pilfering, formerly
                    practised to a great extent on the river, is completely abolished. The carts or
                    waggons which convey goods to town are loaded from the backs of the warehouses,
                    without entering the dock-gates. The capital of the company which built and now
                    superintend the docks is L. 1,380,000, raised by subscriptions at different
                    times. The proprietors were limited to ten per cent, interest, and if the income
                    amounted to more, the tolls and storage were to be reduced in price. This
                    establishment had the mo <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207845"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-7845-0494"/>nopoly of the West India trade during the first
                    twenty years after their construction. At that time they accumulated a sum which
                    in 1819 induced them to lower their rates. But of late, from the competition of
                    other companies, though their profits did not reach ten per cent., they have
                    been induced to diminish the rates. The dividend now scarcely exceeds five per
                    cent.</p>
                <p>The nearest end of these docks is at Limehouse, three miles from the Royal
                    Exchange, and the other end at Blackwall is half a mile farther. The expense of
                    cartage, though the road is excellently paved, is therefore greater than from
                    the docks which have been subsequently constructed, and it is doubtful if the
                    benefit to the shipping by not proceeding so high up the river is an adequate
                    compensation.</p>
                <p>Some admirable contrivances have been recently adopted, by which the great body
                    of water in the docks is kept always sweet, and by which the constant deposit of
                    mud from the water of the river is carried away gradually.</p>
                <p>The docks which next followed the West India in their construction are the London
                    Docks, situated between Ratcliff Highway and the Thames. They were begun in June
                    1802, and opened for the admission of vessels in January 1805. They were
                    originally planned chiefly to receive ships and their cargoes loaded with
                    tobacco, wine, brandy, and rice. They consist of two docks of unequal extent;
                    the western covering a space of twenty acres, and the eastern of about seven
                    acres. The latter is entered through a small basin from Shadwell, and the former
                    has two through their basins, the one between Wapping Old Stairs and Bell Dock,
                    and the other at the Hermitage. The whole can commodiously receive 500 vessels
                    of from 200 to 800 tons burden. The warehouses are very magnificent; the most
                    extraordinary is that for bonded tobacco. The roof and pillars which support it
                    are of iron, and the whole building covers five acres of land, and is capable of
                    containing 24,000 hogsheads of that commodity. There is another warehouse for
                    tobacco, but of smaller dimensions. The vaults under these and the other
                    warehouses are in extent more than eighteen acres, and have space to store
                    66,000 pipes of wine or spirits. This company, like that of the West India
                    Docks, had a monopoly for twenty-one years, which expired in 1826; by this all
                    vessels loaded with wine, brandy, tobacco, and rice were bound to discharge
                    their cargoes on their premises.</p>
                <p>The company is governed by a directory, of whom the Lord Mayor and a certain
                    number of aldermen form part. Their capital was L. 3,328,000; and besides that,
                    as they had to pay for 1300 houses, which were taken down to make room for the
                    operations, they were compelled to borrow L. 700,000. This great expenditure,
                    and the rivalry of other similar associations, which have reduced the rates of
                    tolls and storage, have of late only enabled the company to pay two and a half
                    per cent, interest to the proprietors.</p>
                <p>The regulations to prevent fire and pilfering are as effectual in those as in the
                    West India Docks. The whole consists of seventy-one acres, and is walled, and
                    the hours for admission and for working are the same as in the other docks.</p>
                <p>The East India Docks followed those of London. The commencement of the work took
                    place in 1803, and its completion in 1806. They are at Blackwall, and designed
                    for the trade of the East India Company. They consist of an import basin of
                    eighteen acres, and of an export basin of about nine acres, with an entrance
                    basin of 2∣ acres. As they were constructed to receive ships of great burden,
                    the length of the entrance lock is 210, and the depths of the gates forty-eight
                    feet, and there is never less than twenty-three feet of water. The extent of
                    warehouse-room is small, as most of the commodities unloaded here are carried
                    immediately to the Company’s warehouses in the different parts of London. The
                    tea and the more valuable goods are conveyed in covered waggons, secured by
                    locks, along the Commercial Road, which has been constructed to communicate with
                    these and the other docks. The capital of the Company is L. 500,000, paying a
                    dividend of four per cent. The directors of the Company have the chief
                    management, and the ships are loaded and discharged by their servants, not by
                    the crews; and the regulations to prevent fire and plunder are of the strictest
                    kind.</p>
                <p>St Katharine’s Docks, the last that have been constructed, are situated between
                    the London Docks and the Tower. Though a great work, it was executed within a
                    year and a half, and first opened in October 1828. The whole extent of the
                    property is twenty-four acres, of which nearly one-half is included in the two
                    docks, communicating by a basin between them. The entrance is near Irongate,
                    where the lock from the river is 180 feet long, and 45 feet broad, and is so
                    constructed as to admit ships of 200 tons burden to pass out three hours before
                    high water, so as to enable them to reach Blackwall before the ebb of the tide
                    begins. Ships of 800 tons burden can be conveniently received into these docks,
                    as the water at the entrance is deeper than at any of the other docks, and they
                    can enter or depart by night as well as by day; and vessels drawing eighteen
                    feet water may be afloat at a buoy opposite the gates at low water. The two
                    divisions are estimated to be capable of receiving annually about 1400 merchant
                    vessels. The warehouses are very large and commodious, and, being partly erected
                    upon pillars close to the water, goods are craned up to them direct from the
                    hold of the discharging vessel, at a diminished expense of time and labour,
                    whilst the space is also thereby economised. The whole work has been executed
                    with great skill, taste, and judgment, and its situation being within a quarter
                    of an hour’s walk from the Royal Exchange and the Custom House, is a very great
                    accommodation.</p>
                <p>V The expense of this concern has been very great for its extent, arising chiefly
                    from the number of houses which required to be purchased and pulled down, to
                    make way for the excavation. The capital originally raised was L. 1,350,000,
                    since which L. 800,000 have been borrowed on the security of the tolls, for the
                    completion of the works, and the purchase of land, possessing river frontage,
                    from the Tower to the corner of Lower East Smithfield. This, which cost more
                    than L. 100,000, has been recently made applicable to the erection of a wharf,
                    at which steam-vessels can take in or land passengers without the inconvenience
                    of embarking by means of wherries. The regulations of this dock and the charges
                    are similar to those of the other.</p>
                <p>On the right bank of the Thames, extending along the side of the river at
                    Limehouse, reaching from Dog and Duck Stairs to near Cuckold’s Point, and
                    terminating nearly opposite to the entrance of the West India Docks, are the
                    Commercial Docks, and parallel to it the Surrey Canal. The Docks are of great
                    extent, inclosing within walls forty-nine acres, of which thirty-eight are
                    water. They were designed to receive vessels loaded with timber, corn, and other
                    commodities which are more bulky than costly. The warehouses are neither
                    extensive nor commodious, and their establishments not so constructed as to
                    entitle them to become bonding warehouses for many kinds of goods. They are
                    entered by a basin near Dog-and-Duck Stairs, which is sometimes called the
                    East-Country Docks, and the main body of the water within is divided into three
                    unequal parts. The Surrey Canal consists of an inner and outer dock at its
                    entrance, in which ships are received; but at present it is chiefly used for the
                    reception of vessels offered for sale. There is a communication by it with the
                    Croydon Canal. As the ships employed in foreign or colonial commerce generally
                    enter these docks to discharge or take in their cargoes, there is room left in
                    the river Thames for the coasting trade, including that with Ireland and Scot
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207858" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7858-0495"/>land. Of these
                    the greater portion are such as are loaded with coal from the northern counties,
                    which are allowed to anchor in what is called the Pool, a part of the river
                    extending from the Custom House to the entrance of the Regent’s Canal, near
                    Limehouse. In this part, 210 vessels may anchor at one time; but the average
                    number of them does not exceed 180, though about 7000 ship-loads of coals are
                    annually discharged.</p>
                <p>As the Regent’s Canal terminates near the London and the West India Docks, it may
                    be appropriately noticed in this place. The chief object of this work was to
                    save the expense of cartage through London of those articles brought by sea and
                    afterwards forwarded for consumption to the distant parts of the metropolis in
                    the north-west division, and to communicate there with the Grand Junction Canal.
                    It therefore passes in a circulai· course round London from Paddington on the
                    west to Limehouse on the east. It passes by a tunnel under Maida Hill to the
                    Regent’s Park, and from thence to Islington, under the street of which it is
                    carried through a tunnel about three quarters of a mile in length, where there
                    is a large basin. It then proceeds to Hoxton, Hackney, and Limehouse. It is nine
                    miles in length, and has twelve locks so admirably contrived, and so large, that
                    barges eighty-three feet long and fourteen wide can pass and not occupy more
                    than three and a half minutes in passing. It has much trade in coals, and some
                    in conveying goods from London to be sent to the northern parts of the kingdom.
                    It has been found a very expensive work, and, whatever may hereafter be its
                    increase of trade, does not at present pay more than fifteen shillings interest
                    on 21,400 shares of L.100 each.</p>
                <p>It would serve to give some idea of the trade of London in general, and the
                    utility of the docks as subservient to it, if our limits would allow of an
                    enumeration of the names and the quantities of all the commodities under the
                    king’s locks in the several bonding warehouses of the port. We have only room to
                    notice some of the most prominent.</p>

                    trade with the Netherlands. In the intercourse between London and France, the
                    number of British vessels employed is to that of foreign as seven to six; but as
                    the average of British vessels is somewhat larger, the proportion of tonnage is
                    as eight to five in favour of our own shipping. The vessels which bring cargoes
                    to the metropolis from Portugal, the Azores, and Madeira, from Spain and the
                    Canaries, and from the’ Italian states, are almost wholly British, as the number
                    and tonnage of the foreign ships that arrive, do not amount to more than two and
                    a half per cent.</p>
                <p>The commerce with the Ionian Islands, with Turkey, and Continental Greece, with
                    the Morea and the Greek Islands, with Egypt, with Tripoli, Barbary, and Morocco,
                    with the foreign territories in Africa and in Asia, and with China, is wholly in
                    British-owned vessels. In the London trade with the United States of America,
                    the foreign vessels, mostly those of the States, arc to the British vessels in
                    the proportion of nearly four to one. The commerce with the West Indies, and
                    with the continental colonies in America, is almost wholly conducted in British
                    ships, as out of 500 sail of vessels that arrived in the Thames with cargoes
                    from those parts there were only forty, and those of small size belonging to
                    foreigners.</p>
                <p>The whole of the commerce of Great Britain, with the colonies of North and South
                    America, with the islands in the West Indies, with the settlements on the coast
                    of Africa, and with the East India Company’s extensive territories, is carried
                    on by British ships alone; but it is not easy to estimate what proportion of it
                    employs ships belonging to London. In fact, those which at one period of the
                    year are employed in one branch of commerce, are often employed in another in a
                    different part of the same or of a succeeding year. Many, too, of the British
                    ships which arrive at or depart from London, are owned by persons resident in
                    other, especially the northern, parts of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>In the absence of any recent account, it may be as near an approximation to
                    accuracy as can be obtained, if the number and tonnage of the vessels belonging
                    to the port of London be assumed to bear the same proportion to the number of
                    those that belong to the whole of the kingdom, as is exhibited by the net amount
                    of the produce of the duty of customs. In this view the year 1833 may be taken,
                    when the whole sum drawn to the revenue from the three kingdoms was L.l
                    8,575,182: 15:9, and the sum drawn from the port of London was L.7,662,521. In
                    that year the tonnage of all the ships in the United Kingdom, and of our
                    possessions in Europe, was 2,271,301. Of this a vast part were occupied in the
                    coasting trade, and the vessels so employed were, in most cases, owned by
                    persons in the out-ports. The fisheries, whether for herrings, ling, or
                    pilchards, on our own coasts, as well as those for whales in the northern ocean,
                    or for cod on the banks of Newfoundland, are mostly conducted in vessels also
                    owned at the out-ports; and though the southern whale-fishery is chiefly carried
                    on from London, the tonnage it employs is insignificant when put in comparison
                    with that of the other branches here noticed. If a deduction be made for the
                    tonnage of the coasting vessels, including the colliers, and of the fishermen,
                    to the amount of 650,000 tons, from the 2,271,300 tons which appear on the
                    register, there will remain about 1,620,000; and, in conformity with the view of
                    reckoning the tonnage by the custom’s revenue, that of London being near
                    two-fifths of the whole kingdom, so, if the shipping of London be two-fifths of
                    that of the whole tonnage on the register, it will be about 650,000, which
                    cannot be very far from the truth.</p>
                <p>It is not easy, within a moderate compass, to give even a sketch of the fo. <hi
                    rend="subscript"> c</hi> ιgn commerce of London. It would be an epitome of that
                    of the whole world. The British capital is the emporium to which are brought the
                    products of all soils, and all climates, whether such as are spontaneously
                    produced, or such as have been gradually created by ages of observation and
                    application. It has in store ready for distant commerce, or for domestic use,
                    whatever the ingenuity and industry of man in any part of the globe can spare to
                    exchange for what his own country, or climate, or skill, cannot yield him. We
                    could, therefore, do little more here than point out, as we have done, the
                    foreign countries with which the chief intercourse is maintained, and the
                    proportions of it, as far as they can be indicated by the number and size of the
                    vessels that convey their commodities.</p>

                <p>One of the chief sources of occupation for shipping is the conveyance of coals to
                    London. They are chiefly brought from the north-eastern side of the kingdom, and
                    sold on their arrival by the cargo at an appropriate building in Thames Street,
                    called the Coal Exchange. The great dealers sell the coals by barge-loads to the
                    lightermen, wharfingers, and other retailers; and when they are discharged from
                    the vessels that bring them to the Pool, they are usually kept in coal barges at
                    the several wharfs, ready to supply the consumers. A great benefit has lately
                    been conferred on the public by the change in the mode of selling coals,
                    substituting weight instead of measure, or the ton for the chaldron. As coals
                    measure more when much broken, it was the interest of the dealers to break the
                    large lumps; but now that they are sold by weight, they have no inducement to
                    break them, and they are delivered more lumpy. Each waggon or cart that brings
                    coal to the consumer, is bound to bring appropriate weights and scales, and to
                    weigh such part, if the buyer should require it. By this some of the tricks
                    formerly played in this trade are prevented. The ton of coals is sold, including
                    cartage, which varies according to the distance from the water side, and the
                    porterage, according to the quality, from 24s. to 30s. The chaldron, which was
                    before the law 1st and 2d Will. IV. cap. 67, the legal measure, weighs one ton
                    five hundreds and a half.</p>

                <p>The institutions of the city of London, which have grown up with and out of its
                    commerce, are highly appropriate, by their localities, their arrangements, and
                    their regulations, for conducting business. The first object of importance to
                    every ship, on its arrival in port, is the <hi rend="italic">Custom* house.</hi>
                    This noble building has been erected on the site, but with much enlargement, of
                    a similar building which was destroyed by fire in 1814, as the preceding one had
                    been by a similar calamity in 1718. A considerable extension, and many
                    alterations in the building, had been commenced before the last fire occurred,
                    but that accident induced the erection of an entirely new edifice, which was
                    opened for public business in May 1817.</p>
                <p>The custom-house stands in Lower Thames Street, but its principal front is
                    towards the river, with a broad wharf, having noble stairs at each end, by which
                    to descend to the water, whence wherries are constantly plying for passengers,
                    who can embark or land at them with their baggage, but where no goods are
                    allowed to impede the way. The length of the front is 480 feet, and it is 60
                    feet in depth. On the view from the river, the front exhibits itself best, with
                    three portico, each composed of six pillars of the Ionic order, the centre one
                    of which projects somewhat more forward than the others, and is more elevated
                    from the ground by standing on arches. On the top of it is a balustrade, with a
                    clock in the centre.</p>
                <p>The arrangements of the interior are, however, most to be admired. The long room,
                    where most of the public business is transacted, is a noble apartment 186 feet
                    in length, and 60 in breadth, of an appropriate height, with desks on each side
                    for the several officers, and the centre left open for such of the public as
                    have business there. The other parts of the edifice are distributed with great
                    judgment into apartments adapted for the several branches of the office, in such
                    a way that between six and seven hundred officers, and more than a thousand
                    tidewaiters and messengers are enabled to work with regularity and dispatch,
                    thus forming a most pleasing contrast to the confusion, difficulty, and delay
                    which formerly prevailed.</p>
                <p>An accident happened to this building in 1825, when a part of the long room fell
                    in; it was found that the foundation had been insecurely constructed, upon which
                    the centre was taken down and rebuilt as it now appears, under the direction of
                    Mr Smirke.</p>
                <p>The improvements on the building and its arrangements, great as they are, are
                    trifling, when compared with the vast reform in the whole system which took
                    place by the law of 1812 (act 51st Geo. III. cap. 7∙), and by other salutary
                    regulations. Before that time, the highest offices were held by patent, and the
                    duties performed by deputies, and both were paid by fees. These were abolished,
                    and all are now paid by salaries. Patronage in promotion has been relinquished,
                    and the road opened to the advancement of the most meritorious officers; and, by
                    an order of the Treasury, when the Duke of Wellington was at its head in
                    February 1830, the salaries of the commissioners and other officers were
                    prospectively reduced; whilst directions were given to revise the whole
                    establishment, with a view to every possible reduction.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Dank of England</hi> is one of the most prominent objects
                    within the city, not so much from the structure, though that is magnificent, as
                    from the great influence its creation and progress have had on the state of
                    society in general, as well as on the commercial intercourse which it has
                    facilitated between different individuals at home, and between distant countries
                    with this kingdom, and with each other.</p>
                <p>The company was first founded in the reign of King William III., by act of
                    parliament, in 1694; the idea having been taken from the Bank of Amsterdam,
                    established eighty-five years before, whose success had been great, and its
                    influence seductive. After the incorporation, which provided that the company
                    should be ιmder the management of a governor, a deputy-governor, and twenty-four
                    directors, to be annually chosen, the business was for many years carried on at
                    the Hall of the Grocers, in the Poultry.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207897" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7897-0498"/>
                <p>It remained there some years, till the success of the undertaking had warranted
                    the court of directors to purchase a piece of ground, covered with buildings of
                    little value, in Threadneedle Street. Upon this a house was erected, on a
                    comparatively small scale, to which the business was transferred in 1733; and
                    soon afterwards, the present hall was opened, as well as the bullion-office. The
                    façade was then extended under the direction of Sir Robert Taylor, and two wings
                    were added, with the returns on the east and west sides, and several offices. In
                    this work, it was found expedient to remove the church of St Christopher le
                    Stocks, with the memorials of those who had been interred there. The whole of
                    this enlargement gradually advanced from 1770 to 1786, when, by the death of
                    Taylor, Sir John Soane became the bank architect, and he, in 1788, completed
                    that part of the plan. Under the superintendence of his judgment and taste, the
                    front and wings of the original structure were rebuilt in one harmonious manner;
                    and various other alterations having been adopted, the whole was, in 1825,
                    completed in conformity with the judicious designs of that most distinguished
                    architect.</p>
                <p>From the nature of the ground, fronting towards three public streets, on which it
                    was practicable to intrude, the area is an irregular square, having a front of
                    365 feet on the south or principal side, and 410 on the north side, on the east
                    side a front of 245 feet, and on the west of 440 feet; this is so managed, that
                    it does not appear to be a defect, from whatever point the whole mass is
                    surveyed.</p>
                <p>The principal entrance is from Threadneedle Street, though there is one from
                    Bartholomew Lane, and another from Lothbury. The interior contains eight open
                    courts, the rotunda or circular room, numerous large and smaller offices,
                    several committee rooms, and private apartments for the residence of officers
                    and servants. The principal divisions and subdivisions of the structure are on
                    the ground floor, and there are no rooms over the chief offices, whose height
                    forbids the erection of such; but beneath there are capacious vaults, and a
                    greater number of rooms than above ground. Within the building is an apartment
                    for the guards, and a separate room for the officers who have the command.</p>
                <p>It would require an elaborate work to describe all the particular beauties of
                    this edifice, or the peculiar adaptation and arrangement of its offices for the
                    management of the vast operations which are daily transacted; but to the
                    adaptation of the offices to the purposes for which they are designed, the
                    public are indebted for the order, expedition, and security with which every
                    thing is conducted. The principal or great division, for several of them have
                    subdivisions, are the great hall, the dividend offices, the discount-office, the
                    bullion-office, the accountant’s office, the chief cashier’s office, the
                    interior office or check upon forgery, and the parlour or apartment in which the
                    directors assemble. All of these are neat, clean, and light, and some of them
                    are elegant in their decorations and their furniture.</p>
                <p>The Bank has, by successive renewals of its charter, since the first was granted
                    in 1694, when the capital was L.l,200,000, been enabled to increase it to the
                    present amount of L.14,553,000, which is lent to government at an interest of
                    three per cent. The dividends on this capital have varied with the amount of
                    profit gained by its various operations. At first it was 8 per cent.; in 1697, 9
                    per cent.; between that period and 1767, its fluctuations were frequent, but
                    never lower than 4∣ per cent, nor high er than 6 per cent.; in 1788, it was
                    raised to 7 per cent.; in 1807, to 10 per cent.; in 1823, it was lowered to 8

                <p>The amount of the notes of the Bank of England in circulation, has, since its
                    establishment, varied from L.l,200,000 to L.30,000,000; of late years it has
                    varied only between L. 17,000,000 and L.24,000,000. The average during the last
                    fifteen years may be taken at L.20,000,000; whilst the deposits of government,
                    on the average, have been L.4,000,000, of which sum, thus amounting to
                    L.24,000,000, one-third is estimated to be invested in bullion, and two-thirds
                    in securities. By the parliamentary investigation which produced the preceding
                    accounts, it appears that the balance of the Bank, or surplus property, in 1832,
                    was L.2,637,760 To which is to be added the capital, , . 14,553,000</p>
                <p>Thus leaving together . . Th. 17,180,760</p>
                <p>a sum quite sufficient to make its stability as firm as the British
                    government.</p>
                <p>The following account will shew how much diffused is the property which is vested
                    in the public funds, the dividends of which are payable at the Bank; and how
                    much larger is the proportion in the hands of the middle classes than that
                    belonging the large stockholders.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">East India House,</hi> situated in Leadenhall Street, was
                    first erected in 1726, but it has been gradually enlarged, so as now to form a
                    building of vast size, accommodated to the various departments which the extent
                    of the company’s affairs require. Its principal front and a consi« derable part
                    of the interior have been built within the last thirty years.</p>
                <p>Towards Leadenhall Street it presents a front 200 feet in length, and having in
                    the centre a porticoof six Ionic fluted pillars, supporting a frieze with
                    allegorical figures, and on the top a statue of Britannia. The interior has some
                    fine apartments, especially the great court-room, in which meetings of the
                    proprietors are held. The new saleroom is one of the most complete apartments in
                    the city. It is adorned with pilasters, and with several appropriate paintings.
                    The sale-room is also adorned with some fine statues of Lord Clive, Sir Eyre
                    Coote, Sir George Pococke, and General Lawrence. The room of the committee of
                    correspondence is embellished with views of Indian scenery, and with the
                    portraits of Warren Hastings and of Marquis Cornwallis. The library is adorned
                    with busts of the historian Orme and of Hastings; but is of inestimable value
                    from the books, and especially the manuscripts, illustrative of the antiquities
                    and the ancient and modern history of India, and other parts of Asia. The museum
                    contains specimens of Indian arts and Indian curiosities of every kind, and
                    especially the throne of Tippoo Sultan taken at Seringapatam. The company has
                    several vast warehouses in different parts of the city. These they still retain;
                    and, from their adaptation to the purpose, it is now in contemplation to occupy
                    them as bonding warehouses for Indian and China articles.</p>
                <p>The East India Company was formed as a commercial body in 1599, and first
                    obtained a charter from Queen Elizabeth in 1600. Although, in subsequent
                    periods, the company acquired and extended vastly their territorial power, their
                    commercial character remained to them until it was taken away by the law of
                    1835. They are now, therefore, a kind of board governing British India, under
                    the superintendence of the Board of Controul chiefly, but with some power still
                    left in the hands of directors chosen by the proprietors of India stock, whose
                    dividends are guaranteed to them by the faith of parliament.</p>

                <p>Besides the above articles there was an exportation of .oreign cotton wool, in
                    1820, to the value of L. 93,402; of foreign skins, in 1823, 1824, and 1825, to
                    the value of L. 64,663; and of 54 bales of yarn, in 1829 and 1830, valued at L.
                    1291; whilst the annual stores sent out to the actory during the whole period of
                    twenty-three years, amounted to L. 79,582.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Royal Exchange</hi> is an edifice of more importance, from
                    the extensive mercantile affairs transacted within and around it, than either
                    from its beauty or its extent, in both of which it is excelled by many other
                    commercial cities. At the suggestion of Clough, who had been a clerk to Sir
                    Thomas Gresham, and afterwards established as his representative at Antwerp,
                    when that city was the great emporium of Europe, the knight undertook the
                    construction of n exchange for London. It was completed in 1567, and was soon
                    afterwards visited in state by Queen Elizabeth, upon which occasion the title of
                    Royal was conferred upon it. All the upper parts were at that time filled with
                    shops from the bottom to the top. That building was destroyed by the great fire
                    of 1666, after which it was rebuilt in its present form by a corporation of the
                    city, and the company of mercers, at the expense of more than eighty thousand
                    pounds. It was opened by Sir William Turner, lord-mayor, on the 28th of
                    September 1669. In the new building the statue of Sir Thomas Gresham was placed
                    within it, but not in a conspicuous situation. There are also statues of Charles
                    I. and Charles II., and in the centre is a statue of Sir John Bernard, long the
                    representative in Parliament of the city, who gained and maintained his
                    popularity by the tenacity of his opposition to all the measures, whether good,
                    bad, or indifferent, that were proposed by Sir Robert Walpole. The Exchange is a
                    square, surrounded with arcades, and divided into quarters assigned to the
                    respective merchants tradingto the different parts of the world, called the
                    Scotch, French, and American walks, or named from other countries; and some
                    parts are known as the walks of different traders, who did or might resort to
                    them. These divisions are, however, quite undefined, and by no means in practice
                    so used. Within the area there are no shops, but the walls are almost covered
                    with placards, advertising sales of goods or of ships, and various other
                    notifications. The outside all around is occupied by small shops, or by offices
                    of brokers, notaries, and persons of similar calling. On the upper floor, on the
                    north side, is Lloyd’s Coffee-house, consisting of two long and lofty rooms,
                    where the great business of insurance against losses by sea is conducted between
                    brokers and underwriters. The society, who regulate this, employ agents in all
                    ports, who furnish reports of the arrival and departure of vessels, and give the
                    needful information as to the character, condition, and equipment of the ships.
                    The accounts are registered accurately, and each subscriber has a book, into
                    which are written, from time to time, by the clerks of the establishment, such
                    descriptions of every vessel, as enable the underwriters to calculate the nature
                    of the risk, and the premium it deserves. Upon the same floor is a large
                    auction-room, an office for a joint-stock insurance company, bearing the name of
                    the building, and the office for the relief of sick and hurt seamen in the
                    merchant service. An institution, called from the founder Gresham College, long
                    occupied, or rather might have occupied, if hearers would have attended, a part
                    of this floor. By will he left a part of his fortune to provide lecturers in
                    divinity, astronomy, music, and geometry. Each of them had a salary of L. 100
                    per annum, but rarely delivered any lectures, as no auditors were in attendance.
                    In consequence of this useless kind of expenditure, the trustees, in 1830,
                    transferred the professors to the London institution, where, it is to be hoped,
                    they may be found of benefit to the interests of science. The cellars under the
                    Exchange arc let out for warehouses. It has been calculated that, on an average,
                    two hundred thousand persons daily visit the Exchange, but this can be little
                    more than a guess. Much of the business which used to be transacted upon the
                    Exchange has necessarily been divided, as commerce has gone on increasing; and
                    the merchants and brokers resort much to coffee-houses in the vicinity of the
                    building, which are distinguished by the names of the places with which the
                    traders that frequent them have connexion, such as the East India, the New York,
                    the Carolina, &amp;c.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207949" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7949-0502"/>
                <p>Most of the larger transactions are negociated by the means of brokers, who in
                    general confine themselves to one branch of trade, with which their interest
                    induces them to become thoroughly acquainted. Many of them embrace several
                    branches; but those of the first class have large capitals or extensive credit,
                    and are enabled to accommodate merchants with advances of money, or acceptances
                    to a large amount upon the security of goods placed in their hands for disposal.
                    In the West India trade some of them have large show-rooms, in which are
                    exhibited samples of sugar, coffee, and the other tropical products. Shipbrokers
                    are employed in buying and selling vessels, in hire - ing them by charter, in
                    entering and clearing them out, in collecting the freights, and other business,
                    which much abridges the labour, and saves the anxiety of ship-owners and
                    ship-captains. Insurances, whether by joint stock companies, or by individual
                    underwriters, are effected by the instrumentality of policy-brokers, who form a
                    distinct class, and are paid by a commission of five per cent, on the premiums,
                    and a fixed share of the profit which arises on the balance of their account
                    with the underwriter. The rate of Exchange between London and the commercial
                    cities in other parts of the world is fixed twice a-week between the drawers and
                    the takers of foreign bills, and announced to the exchange-brokers at the close
                    of each of the days.</p>
                <p>Most of the brokers are licensed by the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, but
                    that does not apply to ship-brokers, nor in actual practice to most of the
                    stock-brokers. Those so admitted must give security for the due performance of
                    the duties entrusted to them, and not deal or make gain in goods; but it is
                    apprehended this last condition is more generally broken than observed. There is
                    a class of brokers which has come into existence within a few years, who are
                    said to have made fortunes of an enormous amount. They are usually called
                    bill-brokers, but are properly money-brokers, employed in arranging negociations
                    in money matters of a large amount, between bankers, merchants, and others, who,
                    in the fluctuating nature of their trade, either have occasion to lpnd or to
                    borrow money upon indisputable security. Though the commission paid to such
                    brokers is small, yet the extent of the transactions have made it a lucrative
                    business.</p>
                <p>Near to the Royal Exchange is another institution called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stock Exchange,</hi> wherein bargains are made for the real purchase and sale
                    of property in the public funds, and where is carried on the enormous business
                    of buying and selling stock for a future day, at a fixed price in speculation,
                    as it is delicately called, though in fact, for the most part, it is only
                    gambling upon a large scale. The house is near the Bank, and is conveniently
                    arranged, and handsomely fitted up. It was erected in 1804, at the expense of
                    the subscribers, who elect a committee to manage the affairs, and who have power
                    to make regulations, and to admit or expel such members as they please. Near to
                    it is the market for foreign funds; and in the rotunda of the Bank of England is
                    a crowded assemblage, who carry on some real, but more gambling, transactions in
                    public securities.</p>
                <p>Having noticed those establishments in London which are chiefly subservient to
                    the commercial intercourse between the metropolis and foreign countries, we
                    proceed to mention others, whose main object is internal, though it extends also
                    to external affairs.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Post-Office</hi> is one of those institutions which in this
                    country has arrived the nearest to perfection, and is not only worthy of the
                    talent by which it has been advanced, but justifies the pride which its
                    consideration inspires. It is not necessary here to trace the history of the
                    establishment from the commencement, in the reign of Charles I., 1635, nor the
                    advances it made up to 1784. At that period the letters were conveyed with
                    dilatory irregularity which was the inducement of Mr Palmer of Bath to suggest
                    and arrange a plan for the conveyance of letters by coaches. After due
                    consideration, the experiment was first tried between London and Bath, and was
                    found to be so safe, so quick, and so economical, that the scheme was in due
                    time adopted, and every part of the kingdom in a few years became participators
                    of the benefit, whilst the State drew from it a constantly progressive revenue.
                    In 1783 the net proceeds of the Post-Office did not exceed L. 145,000 per annum,
                    and it now regularly yields about ten times that amount.</p>
                <p>The old post-office in Lombard Street had been long complained of as inadequate,
                    or ill adapted to the extent which the establishment had acquired; for it had
                    grown, under the direction of Mr Palmer, first as comptroller, and of Mr, now
                    Sir Francis Freeling, as secretary, to such a scale, that though buildings near
                    to it had been added, the want of room prevented the most beneficial arrangement
                    of the several branches of the institution.</p>
                <p>The site chosen is central, sufficiently near for the purposes of commerce, and
                    much nearer to the offices of government than the former spot. This magnificent
                    but simple edifice was begun in St Martin’s le Grand, in 1825, and the business
                    transferred to it in 1829. It is of the Grecian Ionic order of architecture. The
                    basement is of granite, but the superstructure is of brick, faced with Portland
                    stone. The building is in length 400 feet, and in breadth 80 feet. The portico
                    in the centre of the front is 70 feet broad, consisting of six columns of
                    Portland stone, resting on pedestals of granite, and supporting a triangular
                    pediment, beneath which is this inscription, “Georgio Quarto Rege,” and the date
                    in Roman capitals, “MDcccxxĭx.” At the extremity of each wing is a porticoof
                    four columns. In this front are forty-four windows. The east front is quite
                    plain, and has upwards of 180 windows.</p>
                <p>Under the centre porticois a vestibule of noble effect, on the north side of
                    which are the receiving rooms for letters, and apartments for the sorters of
                    inland letters. These extend the whole length. The mails are received at the
                    east front. The foreign-office is on the south side, as well as the offices of
                    the receiver and accountant. At the east end of the vestibule are the twopenny
                    offices. The sorters’ room is an apartment of forty-six feet by twenty-four, in
                    which their operations are performed with a dispatch and regularity that is
                    astonishing. A novel mode has been adopted for conveying letters, which have
                    come into the wrong department, from one room to another; they are placed in
                    small waggons beneath the pavement, and made to travel through a tunnel by
                    machinery.</p>
                <p>The whole building is fire proof, and machinery conveys coals and water to every
                    part of the building. The whole is lighted by gas, and is furnished with more
                    than one thousand burners. The assistant-secretary has a residence in the
                    building, and in the upper rooms are apartments for the clerks to sleep in, as
                    they are necessarily up early to receive the mails.</p>
                <p>As the business of this office must be performed in the space of two or three
                    hours in the morning, and the same period in the evening, it demands a regular
                    system for the sorting of so many letters. The average is about 46,000 letters,
                    which arrive at six in the morning, and these are generally counted, examined,
                    charged, and delivered to the letter-carriers by half-past eight or nine
                    o’clock. In the evening the same number is received at the'windows, and must be
                    dispatched before eight o’clock. As the greatest number is received just before
                    seven, the greatest expedition is used to complete the whole operation. The
                    letters are first arranged as they arrive from the receiving-houses in different
                    compartments, marked with the name of the mail by which they are to be sent,
                    which is performed by the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207962"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-7962-0503"/>mior clerks. The senior clerks then mark on each
                    letter Ae amount of postage, which is done at the rate of one <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> 2cond of time for each letter, and the letters are
                    placed 1 boxes labelled with the names of the towns. The re-civing-office is
                    closed at seven o’clock, when the letters )r each town are summed up, and the
                    summation put in ιe bag with them. Letters may be sent later than seven, y
                    paying a fee, which is allowed as a perquisite to the 'ιnior clerks. The bags of
                    letters are tied, sealed, and de-vered to the several guards at eight
                    o’clock.</p>
                <p>The delivering of the letters in the morning is expedited by means of <hi
                    rend="italic">accelerators</hi> or light-built carriages first used when the new
                    building was occupied. A postman, or rather coachman, in these takes different
                    divisions of the town, and drops the letter-carriers, with the letters, in their
                    various walks, which saves the difference of time between walking and riding,
                    and produces a most expeditious delivery in the most distant parts of the
                    metropolis. The inland office employs about 200 clerks and sorters, and about
                    the same number of persons for the delivery of letters. The foreign office has
                    twenty clerks, and thirty-four for the delivery. The two-penny post employs
                    about fifty persons.</p>

                <p>As the post-office is peculiarly a department of expendi-I re as well as of
                    revenue, much care and attention is ap-qied in making the contracts with those
                    who convey the nails, and great economy in adjusting the appropriate saisies to
                    the different officers. This is clear from the num-κr of persons employed under
                    the postmaster-general, being more than 3000, with from 4000 to 5000 horses, and
                    near 200 coaches. The packet service costs L. 115,000 yearly; the mileage to
                    mail-coaches, and the pavments to guards, tolls, &amp;c. amount to about L.
                    72,000; and the expense of conveying letters to Nova Scotia, Canada, and
                    Jamaica, to which parts the packets do not go, costs L.l 2,500.</p>

                    building, erected within a few years, under the direc-tín of that eminent
                    architect, Smirke. It consists of three sθreys, having a centre ornamented with
                    columns, and a Aliment displaying the British arms, and two wings with pasters.
                    Within the enclosure is a house for the master, al accommodation for the other
                    officers of the establish- ⅛nt∙ The interior is appropriately arranged for the
                    ma- ^factory of coined money, all of which is executed by the best machinery,
                    invented by Bolton, with some recent improvements. The whole is put in motion by
                    a steam-engine, and lighted by gas, and is capable, in case of need, of coining
                    a vast quantity of coin in an almost incredibly short space of time. Strangers
                    are only admitted to see if upon some special recommendation of the
                    superior.</p>

                <p>In Broad Street is the <hi rend="italic">Excise Office.</hi> It was originally
                    the property of that eminent merchant Sir Thomas Gresham, and is remarkable as
                    being the spot upon which the Royal Society was founded. It was begun here from
                    Wilkins, afterwards Bishop of Chester, having apartments in it, at which, in
                    1658, meetings were held of scientifie men, consisting of Dr Ward, afterwards
                    Bishop of Salisbury, the great and good Mr Boyle, Sir William Petty, Doctors
                    Wallis, Goddard, Willis, and Bathurst, and Sir Christopher Wren, with a few
                    more. Sueh were the founders of that society which has done so much for the
                    promotion and diffusion of scientific knowledge, and whose fame is only bounded
                    by the limits of the civilized world. It 1711, it was removed from this place to
                    Crane Court, Fleet Street, and thence to the present apartments in Somerset
                    House. Gresham House was, after the great fire, converted into alms-houses,
                    which were sold to government in 1763, and on the spot was built that extensive
                    structure now used by the commissioners of the excise branch of the public
                    revenue. It is a capacious edifice, consisting of two ranges of building,
                    separated by a court-yard, and connected by a passage through it with
                    Bishopsgate Street. It iswell arranged in the interior for the dispatch of
                    business, which greatly facilitates that regularity, expedition, and security
                    which peculiarly distinguish that portion of the public service.</p>
                <p>An institution, which has proved of vast benefit to the art of navigation, has
                    its chief establishment on Tower Hill, and is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trinity-House.</hi> This society was founded in 1515, when the British navy
                    first assumed a systematical form, by Sir Thomas Sport, who was comptroller of
                    the navy, and commander of the great ship <hi rend="italic">Henry Grace</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Dieu.</hi> It was first established at Deptford, Strand, under
                    the name of “the Master, Wardens, and Assistants of the Guild or Fraternity of
                    the most glorious and undivided Trinity.” In process of time it has acquired
                    large property, and the members being chosen partly from the highest rauks, but
                    chiefly from men of skill in the naval profession, it is a body highly
                    respectable and useful. Its members are frequently seated with the judges on the
                    bench to assist by their advice in maritime affairs. They examine and nominate
                    pilots, superintend the light-houses, buoys, and land-marks, regulate in London
                    the ballasting of ships, examine the masters of his Majesty’s ships of war, and
                    superintend the mathematical studies of the youth of Christ’s Hospital. The
                    corporation now consists of a master, four wardens, eight assistants, and
                    eighteen elder brethren; and though they retain the old house at Deptford, where
                    they have an hospital for decayed masters of ships and their wives, they hold
                    their chief sittings at their new house. As they are the guardians of many cha∙
                    ritable funds, they yearly relieve the distress of numerous poor seamen and
                    their families. Their elegant house was built in 1793 by Wyatt. It is of
                    Portland stone, with a rustic basement, over which is one storey adorned with
                    Ionic columns and pilasters. In it are many portraits of eminent naval men,
                    particularly of the celebrated Admiral Sir John Leake, who distinguished himself
                    at the battle of La Hogue, and captured Gibraltar, Carthagena, and Minorca, in
                    the reign of Queen Anne. There are also preserved captured flags and other naval
                    trophies.</p>
                <p>Hitherto attention has been directed to the commerce of the metropolis, and the
                    institutions connected with that part of it, which is carried on by maritime
                    means. It will now be proper to notice the distribution of the various articles
                    which foreign commerce conveys to London. It has already been observed, that the
                    intervention of brokers is had recourse to in mercantile transactions; but
                    between the merchants and consumers, there are other classes of traders who
                    constitute an important part of the inhabitants of the metropolis. This may be
                    best described by taking some prominent article of commerce, and attending to
                    its distribution; and as sugar is one of the largest amount of any commodity
                    brought by sea, it is best adapted to the purpose we have in view. The West
                    India merchants import it by ship-loads, but in the ships are various qualities,
                    according to the plantations which produce it. Upon their landing, samples are
                    exhibited of the different qualities, classed according to their value, upon
                    boards by the brokers. The wholesale grocers purchase the sugars by boards of
                    ten, twenty, or forty hogsheads at a time, and then sell them to the retail
                    grocers, whose demand is limited, by single hogsheads, or by portions of
                    hogsheads. The profit of the intermediate wholesale grocers is generally small,
                    but as the amount is large, and the return quick, it is generally a lucrative
                    trade. It facilitates the great operations of the importing merchant, and
                    accommodates the condition of the retailer, and these middlemen or wholesale
                    groeers being generally possessed of large capitals, buy with ready money, and
                    sell oncredit, which, though short, is of great service to the retailers, who
                    are commonly less provided with capital. If the wholesale grocer can return his
                    capital three or four times in the year, with but a profit of two per cent,
                    beyond the interest, he is amply repaid for the use of his capital, and the
                    increase of his profit is scarcely felt by the consumer. It is not necessary
                    here to entertain the question, whether it would not be better for a community
                    that all transactions in commerce should be conducted solely by ready money; our
                    object being rather to shew the existing mode, than to indulge speculations on a
                    supposititious arrangement under a different state of affairs.</p>
                <p>The other great articles of commerce are distributed in the same manner as sugar.
                    Thus tea is bought at the India House by the wholesale tea-dealers in lots of
                    several chests, and sold by them to the retailers in single chests, or part of
                    chests; so are currants, raisins, figs, coffee, spices, rice, and in a great
                    degree wine, rum, brandy, and gin. There are, indeed, a few in each branch of
                    trade who are bothwhole∙ sale and retail traders; but they form the exceptions,
                    not the rule.</p>
                <p>In a similar way the wholesale traders of the metropolis become the channels for
                    conveying the articles manufactured in one part of the kingdom to the retailers,
                    and the latter to the consumers in the other parts of it. Thus wholesale houses
                    in London collect the cloths of Yorkshire; the stuffs of Norwich; the cottons of
                    Lancashire or Scotland; the linens of Ireland, or of the northern counties; the
                    iron-ware of Birmingham; the cutlery of Sheffield; the pottery and porcelain of
                    Staffordshire; the bottles of Northumberland; the ribbons of Coventry and Leake;
                    and the hosiery of Nottingham, Leicester, and Derby; and from their warehouses,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207988" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7988-0505"/>by the
                    assistance of their travellers, they supply the chief demand of the shopkeepers
                    in the smaller towns in the southern and western counties of England.</p>
                <p>Thus London, from the capital possessed by its merchants, its easy accessibility
                    from every part of the kingdom, and the facilities of direct conveyance to and
                    from it, has become a trading place far beyond what its own production and
                    consumption could ever have created. The system of banking pursued in London is
                    peculiarly favourable to the interest and the convenience of the intermediate
                    trade. There are seventy private banking houses in the city and its adjuncts;
                    most of the traders keep accounts in them; and the surplus money of some
                    accounts is used to discount bills for those who need it, whilst acceptances for
                    goods sold, the practice of giving which has vastly increased, can easily be
                    converted into money. The bankers can spare a greater portion of their balances
                    than they could do if they were liable to general calls for it; but that is not
                    much the case, from the establishment created among the bankers called the
                    clearing-house. At that place, near Lombard Street, each banking house sends a
                    clerk with the checks on other houses received in the course of the day, and
                    there exchanges them with the checks drawn upon them. By this exchange of paper,
                    sums of enormous magnitude are paid and received mutually, with the use of only
                    a small sum of money, or of Bank of England notes. In fact, in London, generally
                    speaking, there is much less money left in a state of absolute rest, than in
                    proportion to its amount is to be found in any other of the commercial cities of
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>The ease and certainty with which assorted cargoes for ships bound to foreign
                    markets can be furnished is a great advantage to London, and particularly to
                    that intermediate class of traders called warehousemen or wholesale dealers.
                    There is no product of any part of the United Kingdom, none of those of the most
                    distant parts of the globe, that may not be obtained in London, without causing
                    any detention to the departing vessels, and without any great advance in the
                    price beyond the cost of conveyance.</p>
                <p>ì Although London, when compared with some of the towns of the north of England
                    and of Scotland, can scarcely be entitled to the name of a manufacturing place;
                    yet the various articles fabricated in and around it, afford great occupation to
                    numerous individuals; and they have been the nurseries in which the most
                    important branches of national industry have received their birth and their
                    first growth. The silk trade is that which at present gives employment to the
                    greatest number of hands. This was originally introduced by French Protestant
                    refugees, many of the descendants of whom still continue the trade of their
                    ancestors. The number of persons employed in the several operations of dyeing,
                    winding, warping, and weaving silk, a ι large proportion of whom consists of
                    females and children, is estimat3d at 48,000. The new-fashioned goods and the
                    Fancy articles are mostly made here; and any kind of goods that happens
                    afterwards to become much in demand, is &gt;oon made, where food, fuel, and
                    labour are cheap, upon which it ceases in London. The change of fashion and the
                    Variation of taste is so frequent, that the silk-weavers do not decline in the
                    metropolis, notwithstanding the numer- . ms power-looms which make silk goods in
                    the other parts if the kingdom. The good effects of the nurture which the
                    metropolis affords to infant fabrics, may be illustrated by .ome facts relating
                    to the silk trade. In the middle of the Mast century, silk gauzes were
                    exclusively made in Lon-I Ion. But some disturbances amongst the weavers, caused
                    i family or two whose property was embarked in that busi-ιess to remove to
                    Scotland in the beginning of the reign ∙f George III. They there established the
                    silk gauze trade, ∙mploying operative weavers, who had been occupied in naking
                    gauzes of flax, commonly known by the name of , Scotch lawns or clear lawns. The
                    attempt succeeded, and soon became so extensive that the great and flourishing
                    town of Paisley owes its present state to this circumstance. The effect of this
                    early nurture of the trade did not stop with itself. In a few years, the fashion
                    of wearing silk began to decline, and the experiment was tried to turn the hands
                    who had woven silk gauzes to the kindred manufactory of muslins like gauze, but
                    made of cotton. Book muslins, as they were called, and afterwards other sorts of
                    muslin, were then fabricated: a trade on the extent and value of which to the
                    whole kingdom it is unnecessary here to expatiate.</p>
                <p>There are numerous small articles which are either made exclusively in London, or
                    which, having the name of “town made,” are better reputed than any others.
                    Amongst the first are silk fringes, coach lace, gold and silver lace, lapidary
                    articles, Prussian blue, and some others; amongst the latter, as is well known
                    to all ladies, are needles, pins, fine scissors, and penknives, to which may be
                    added musical, mathematical, and surgical instruments; brushes, combs; clocks,
                    watches, jewellery of the superior kinds, gold and silver plate; ornamental and
                    useful furniture, coaches and other carriages, saddlery, painters’ and dyers’
                    materials; numerous medicinal and chemical preparations, particularly magnesia,
                    aquafortis, sal-volatile, essential oils, and other articles.</p>
                <p>The publication of books is a great trade in London. The population return of
                    trades is necessarily indistinct; but, according to it, there are 8950 males
                    above twenty years of age, who are booksellers, printers, binders, or otherwise
                    employed. It gives subsistence to about 50,000 individuals. The tailors and
                    shoemakers furnish with their respective articles of dress many who do not
                    reside in London, and many even in the colonies and in India. The numbers of the
                    tai!ors are stated at 13,783. Those of the shoemakers and menders amount to
                    15,274; but the chief part of the shoes furnished to London are made at
                    Stafford, Northampton, and Newcastle-under-Line. The bakers are stated at 5209;
                    the butchers at 4069; the carpenters, 12,254; the cabinet-makers, 4921; the
                    publicans, 4804; the upholsterers, 1724; the glaziers and plumbers, 2272; the
                    bricklayers, 4874; the house-painters, 4439; the blacksmiths, 4106; the
                    whitesmiths, 1822; plasterers, 1725; and the stone masons, 1592.</p>
                <p>As these numbers relate solely to males above twenty years of age, they can only
                    be used for the purpose of comparison; but as females are excluded, and all
                    males below twenty, we may perhaps be justified in assuming that the number of
                    individuals subsisting by means of these professions may be multiplied by
                    four.</p>
                <p>It is obvious to remark the great number of persons employed in the construction
                    or reparation of buildings, and the proportion they bear to those engaged in
                    other kinds of industry. This seems to show that the metropolis is still most
                    rapidly advancing in improvement, as it must be in wealth, since the erection of
                    new houses of any kind is the best evidence cf a previous accumulation of
                    capital.</p>
                <p>The next object of attention is the quantity of provisions consumed in London
                    annually, and the means by which supplies arc procured. The annual supply of
                    cattle, in the last ten years, has been 153,228; that of sheep, 1,265,958; <hi
                    rend="superscript">!</hi> that of íàtted calves, 20,780. The pigs are estimated,
                    but little faith can be placed in the calculation, as one-tenth of the number of
                    sheep. If the weight of the cattle be taken at 300 lbs. on the average, and the
                    offal be taken at 200 lbs., the weekly amount consumed will be 1,766,092 lbs.
                    If, in the same way, the weight of the sheep be taken on the average at 80 lbs.
                    each, and the offal at 20 lbs., the weekly weight consumed will be 2,035,788
                    lbs. The calves, averaging 140 lbs., with 35 lbs. allowed for offal, would give
                    a result of 61,191 lbs.</p>
                <p>Thus, taking the whole into view, the weight appears to be </p>

                </table>
                <p>We thus arrive at a weekly consumption of 4,361,342 lbs., or to a daily
                    consumption of623,049 lbs., being, for 1,800,000 persons, 5∣ ounces per day, or
                    109 lbs. yearly. The statistical accounts of Paris give, as the annual
                    consumption of each person in that city, 86 lbs.; and at Brussels the estimate
                    is three pounds higher, or 89 lbs. In no other city of Europe, excepting perhaps
                    Hamburg, does the consumption reach so high as in Paris.</p>
                <p>The preceding remarks on animal food are only made for the sake of comparison,
                    and not to obtain great confidence. The only actually ascertained facts are the
                    numbers of the oxen and sheep, all the rest being estimate or conjecture. It is
                    well known that cattle are purchased at Smithfield, and driven to the towns near
                    London to be slaughtered, and that many cutting butchers in such towns buy
                    cattle of the carcass butchers in London. From many distant towns much meat is
                    sent to the metropolis, when cut into joints. The legs with the loins of sheep,
                    and the best parts of the roasting pieces of beef, are sent by coaches to the
                    butchers of London, and the inferior parts of the same animals are sold in the
                    country markets. All this makes any calculation, whatever foresight may be
                    applied to the subject, very uncertain and doubtful. The weekly account of sales
                    here quoted only applies to the animals brought to Smithfield, of which an
                    account is taken by the city authorities. The sales have not increased with the
                    increase of the population, and chiefly because other markets recently rising,
                    the amount of sales in them has increased. One of these is at Southall, on the
                    Uxbridge road; another at Balls Pond, Islington; and one near Croydon. Of these
                    no accurate account can be obtained.</p>
                <p>The quantity of corn consumed in London is as difficult to be ascertained as that
                    of meat. The market of Mark Lane, where, in two buildings of handsome appearance
                    and commodiously fitted up, the principal transactions in grain and flour are
                    conducted, is no criterion of the quantity actually consumed. There are
                    speculations at times going on, which baffle all conjecture. Besides, much of
                    the bread made in London is compounded of flour brought by sea from the northern
                    parts of England, and some even from Scotland and Ireland. Most of the mills
                    which supply the best flour are either in the vicinity of London, or at such a
                    distance that a waggon and horses can go and return within the day. On the river
                    Colne, from Walford to the Thames, are several powerful mills. On the river
                    Wandle, in Surrey, are also some; and there is one enormous mill at Wandsworth,
                    partly worked by steam. The Thames below London conveys to it much corn and
                    flour; the best of both is brought from the shores of Kent and Essex; but much
                    comes from the more distant ports in the counties of Suffolk, Norfolk, and
                    Lincolnshire. The supply of oats is chiefly obtained from Lincolnshire and the
                    rich marshes of the Isle of Ely, which export at Wisbeach or Lynn. Barley is
                    generally supplied from the turnip farms of Norfolk, and from the lands of the
                    lighter kinds in Cambridgeshire,</p>
                <p>Hertfordshire, and Bedfordshire; but much of it is made into malt before it is
                    sent to London. According to the accounts of the inspector of corn returns, the
                    quantity sold in London has been as follows.</p>

                <p>London is well supplied with fish of all kinds, according to the season. The
                    greater part is brought by vessels to the wholesale fish-market at Billingsgate,
                    in Lower Thames Street. Many of these vessels are Dutch, which catch the fish,
                    chiefly turbot, on the Dogger Bank, and convey it to market; but much is taken
                    by our own fishermen. From Scotland, abundance of salmon, in the proper months,
                    is brought to Billingsgate, packed in ice. In some years there have been
                    imported from Norway as many as 1,200,000 lobsters, and some from Heligoland.
                    There is no duty upon turbot or lobsters, but all other fish, if not caught by
                    British fishermen, are prohibited. At some periods great quantities of fish,
                    chiefly mackerel, are brought to London by land-carriage. Large quantities of
                    cured fish are fiir-nished to the metropolis, such as the salted cod brought
                    from Newfoundland, the smoked and the salted herrings caught in Scotland, and on
                    the shores of Norfolk and Suffolk. The fish trade still centres in the city at
                    the old market of Billingsgate, an attempt to establish a market of competition
                    at Hungerford having hitherto failed. The trade is carried on chiefly by means
                    of salesmen, who contract for the cargoes as they arrive, and retail them out to
                    the fishmongers, of whom there are 950 scattered about in every division of the
                    metropolis and the contiguous villages. The oyster fishery depends chiefly on
                    the demand in the metropolis, where only the best can be obtained. The feeding
                    of them is carried on chiefly at Colchester, to which neighbourhood they are
                    brought from the shores of Hampshire and Dorsetshire, and laid down in beds on
                    creeks, to grow and fatten during two or three years. The trade employs about
                    200 vessels of from fifteen to forty-five tons burden. The quantity caught of
                    late years has been from 14,000 to 15,000 bushels. The packing them in small
                    barrels as presents, is a considerable trade. The quantity of fish brought to
                    London has been estimated at 50,000 tons weight annually, but with what degree
                    of correctness this is stated, we have not ascertained.</p>
                <p>The land around London is much too valuable to be destined for the growth of
                    corn. Whatever may have been the original quality of the soil (and it was
                    probably once very poor), the draining in the swampy parts, and the vast
                    quantity of manure which a great city supplies, has made it some of the most
                    productive in the kingdom. It is, however, chiefly devoted to feeding cows,
                    whose milk must be brought fresh to the consumer, or in growing such delicate
                    fruits and vegetables as are injured by long keeping or long carriage. The
                    number of cows kept for milking is <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208014"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-8014-0507"/>calculated at about 12,000, yielding about 10,000
                    gallons of milk, which is supplied at each house twice a-day out of tin pails.
                    The grass-land is hardly sufficient to feed that number, and some part of their
                    food, besides hay, consists of grains from breweries, and often of Swedish
                    turnips or mangel wurzel, brought from farms at a distance.</p>
                <p>Except this feeding land, the greater part of the soil is appropriated to
                    nurseries or horticulture. The first yields flowers in abundance, and young
                    plants of the various kinds proper for gardens. The latter produce the best of
                    culinary vegetables that are required for daily use in the metropolis. The more
                    delicate kinds used for salads are eminently good. The lettuces, especially, are
                    more approved than any grown at a distance from London. Cabbages, broccoli,
                    cauliflowers, and other plants of the Brassica tribe, are deemed to be more
                    appropriate products of the soil and atmosphere of the vicinity of London, than
                    of any other parts of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>Those fruits which are of the most perishable kind are grown nearest to London,
                    particularly raspberries, strawberries, and cherries in their season. These are
                    commonly gathered at a very early hour in the morning, and sent to the
                    first-rate fruit shops, on the heads of women, mostly from Wales, and are ready
                    quite fresh at the hour of breakfast. Gooseberries, currants, and the common
                    wall-fruits are amply supplied. The vegetables from Chelsea, Hammersmith,
                    Fulham, and on the banks of the river are conveyed for the most part by the
                    river Thames, and consigned to Covent Garden and the other vegetable markets,
                    where they are met with those products that arrive in carts. They are generally
                    sold by salesmen or factors, and then distributed throughout the metropolis by a
                    class of small traders denominated green-grocers.</p>
                <p>The more common and less perishable vegetables, such as potatoes, turnips,
                    carrots, and parsnips, are grown at a greater distance, but arc brought to the
                    same markets, and are dispensed to the consumers in a similar manner. It may
                    here be remarked, that the vicinity of Gravesend is celebrated for the
                    excellence of its asparagus and artichokes, the greater part of which is
                    conveyed to London by the steam vessels. Not far from that place is a kind of
                    farm which could be profitable nowhere but in the vicinity of a great city. A
                    few acres are destined to grow watercresses. These are gathered early every
                    morning, bound up in small bunches, and despatched by a light cart to London,
                    where it arrives by the hour of breakfast, and is distributed by persons who cry
                    them through the streets for sale. Poultry is abundantly if not cheaply
                    provided; but if dear, it is remarkably good. Higglers travel the country round
                    London and purchase fowls in the lean state. These are carefully fattened at
                    some large establishment for that purpose in the eastern side of London. Pigeons
                    are also kept for poulterers’ shops, and many tame rabbits. Of late hares,
                    pheasants, and partridges have been allowed to be sold, and are obtained at
                    moderate prices. These articles furnish subsistence to about 350 traders, known
                    by the name of poulterers, who sometimes unite with them the dealing in butter,
                    eggs, and sausages.</p>
                <p>.· The markets in the metropolis are numerous, but the most considerable of these
                    can here receive no other attention than mentioning their names and
                    localities.</p>
                <p>Covent-Garden has been already noticed as the place for vegetables. It is the
                    centre of a square, and has been newly built within the last six years by the
                    Duke of Bedford, the proprietor. It is an elegant and commodious structure, with
                    two ranges of shops running from north to south, and three from north to south.
                    In these and in the open parts of the market the display of fruits, flowers, and
                    vegetables, especially at an early hour of the morning, is a very gratifying
                    spectacle. Its situation is convenient, and the access to it from every side
                    peculiarly easy.</p>
                <p>Newgate market is one of the largest, dealing much by wholesale both in meat and
                    vegetables. There are many carcass Dutchers who sell the whole animals when
                    slaughtered, without the skin, tallow, and entrails, to others in the same
                    market, or in other parts of the town, who sell it by the joint, and are
                    distinguished by the name of cutting butchers. There are also salesmen as well
                    as retailers of fruit and vegetables. The great or wholesale markets are on
                    Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.</p>
                <p>Leadenhall market rivals that of Newgate in the number and extent of the carcass
                    and cutting butchers, and excels it in the trade of skins and leather. A new
                    market called Farringdon has been constructed to supply the want of Fleet
                    market, which has been removed to form a good avenue. It is large, covering more
                    than an acre of ground, and the building, which was finished in 1829, cost the
                    corporation of the city L.200,000. It is very commodious, but hitherto not
                    filled with sellers and buyers.</p>
                <p>Hungerford market has been built only two years, on the site, but enlarged, of a
                    former market. It is an elegant and commodious structure, most appropriately
                    fitted up. As it stands on the bank of the Thames, and has convenient access to
                    the water by stairs, it was expected that the vessels with fish would come up
                    and discharge them; but that expectation has not been fulfilled, nor are the
                    greater part of the shops occupied. It was built by a joint stock company. The
                    length of the interior is 140 feet, and the breadth 70. The front to the river
                    has a fine appearance.</p>
                <p>The great markets for hay and straw are held in Whitechapel, in Smithfield, in
                    the Borough, in the Haymarket, and near the Paddington canal. The other markets
                    are Newport for butcher-meat, Borough for meat and vegetables, and Honey Lane
                    for the best qualities of their several kinds of food; Clare, Cumberland,
                    Fitzroy, Grosvenor, Hoxton, James, Oxford, Red Lion, Mortimer, Tottenham' Court,
                    St Luke’s, St George’s, Shadwell, Sheppard’s, Brooks, and Chelsea, are all of
                    them markets upon a retail scale, but sufficiently supplied to accommodate the
                    population in their immediate vicinity with what they require.</p>
                <p>The class of tradesmen called cheesemongers, of which there are 1395 in the
                    metropolis, deal chiefly but not all of them exclusively in butter and cheese.
                    Some of them add to their proper trade that of selling hams, bacon, and tongues.
                    The sale of butter is said to be 24,650 pounds, and that of cheese to be
                    26,700,000; but this must at best be a doubtful estimate.</p>
                <p>The mode by which the poorest classes are supplied with food, according to the
                    power of purchasing it, is by small shops scattered through every part of the
                    outskirts of the town. In some of these, small portions of meat, or of puddings,
                    or of vegetables may be obtained ready cooked, at very low rates. In some parts
                    these are in cellars, which are the most homely and cheapest. Of late a practice
                    has prevailed of carrying about potatoes ready boiled, and kept warm, which are
                    sold to the most destitute, who can only command a penny or even a halfpenny,
                    and with that can purchase a meal, though a very scanty one.</p>
                <p>No city can become large unless it is built on the banks of a river which
                    abundantly supplies it with water both for drinking and for cleanliness; and
                    when it becomes extended far from the river, the expense and the labour to be
                    applied to afford a supply of water to such parts is very grèat, especially if,
                    as is almost always the case, the ground rises in height as it is more removed
                    from the stream. Although London is supplied with many excellent springs of
                    fresh water, they were early found to afford an insufficient supply, and,
                    besides, the water was not fitted for many purposes. Various means have been
                    adopted to secure an adequate portion of water, each of which deserves notice;
                    but the most prominent is that which still affords nearly one-half the quantity
                    that is consumed.</p>

                <p>In the early part of the reign of James I., Sir Hugh Middleton, a citizen of the
                    Goldsmith Company of London, undertook at his own risk and charge to convey to
                    the elevated hill above the city a river of fresh and good water. He began the
                    work in 1608, but the city refusing to embark in the undertaking, the King
                    covenanted to advance money for the purpose on condition of half the property
                    being conveyed to him. This agreement was made in May 1612, and in September
                    1613 the water was let into the basin at the place now called the New River head
                    at Islington. From thence by subsequent labour it was at length conveyed by
                    pipes underground to the several streets and houses that required it. Since that
                    period the company has augmented its supply first from the river Lea and then
                    from other sources; and the concern has proved highly beneficial to the company.
                    The principal supply is obtained at Amwell in the county of Hertford, whence
                    preserving the level so as to have only a fall of two inches in a mile, it flows
                    forty miles with a gentle motion, and in that distance passes under 200 bridges,
                    until it reaches the main large or circular reservoir whence it is distributed
                    to the inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The next attempt to supply water was by the Chelsea Water-work Company in the
                    year 1723; and these two, with some aid from machinery at London Bridge,
                    continued to supply the north side of the Thames till 1810, when three new
                    companies, the East London, the West London, and the Grand Junction, were
                    established by authority of different acts of Parliament.</p>
                <p>The following account from Wade on the Police will best describe the operations
                    and practical effects of the companies. The progress of the New River has been
                    noticed. There are at Clerkenwell two reservoirs having between them a surface
                    of about five acres and a depth of ten feet. These reservoirs are 84∣ feet above
                    low water-mark in the Thames, and by means of steam-engines and a standpipe an
                    additional height’of sixty feet can be given to the water; so that all the mains
                    belonging to this company are kept full by a considerable pressure of water. The
                    highest service given by the New River is the cistern on the top of Covent
                    Garden theatre. The aqueduct by which the water is brought has only a fall of
                    two inches in a mile; thus it wastes by evaporation in summer, and is impeded by
                    frosts in the winter. At such times the company pump an additional supply from
                    the Thames at Broken Wharf, between Blackfriars and Southwark Bridges. To this,
                    however, they seldom have recourse, and their engine, erected since the works at
                    London Bridge have been removed, has worked only 176 hours in the year. The New
                    River Company supply 66,000 houses with water at an annual average of 1100
                    hogsheads each, or, in all, about 75,000,000 hogsheads annually.</p>
                <p>The East London water-works are situated at Old Ford, on the river Lea, about
                    three miles from the Thames, and a little below the point to which the tide
                    flows. By the act of parliament this company must take its water when the tide
                    runs up, and the mills below have ceased working. The water is pumped into
                    reservoirs, and allowed to settle, and a supply of 6,000,000 gallons is daily
                    distributed to about 42,000 houses. This company supplies no water at a greater
                    elevation than thirty feet, and the usual height at which the delivery is made
                    to the tenants is six feet above the pavement. They have 200 miles of
                    iron-pipes, which, in some places, cost them seven guineas the yard. This and
                    the New River are the only companies that do not draw their supply wholly from
                    the Thames.</p>
                <p>The West Middlesex Company derive their supply of water from the Thames at the
                    upper end of Hammersmith, 9⅜ miles above London Bridge, where the bed of the
                    Thames is gravel. The water is forced by engines to a reservoir at Kensington,
                    309 feet long, 123 wide, and 20 deep, which is paved and lined with brick, and
                    is elevated 120 feet above low water in the Thames. They have another reservoir
                    on Little Primrose Hill, about 70 feet higher, and containing 88,000 hogsheads
                    of water, under the pressure of which the drains are kept charged in the event
                    of fires. They serve about 15,000 tenants, and the average daily supply is
                    2,250,000 gallons.</p>
                <p>The Chelsea water-works derive their supply from the Thames about a quarter of a
                    mile east from Chelsea Hospital, and they have two reservoirs; one in the Green
                    Park near to Piccadilly, and another in Hyde Park near to Mount Street, the
                    former having an elevation of 44, and the latter of 70 feet. These reservoirs
                    till very recently had never been cleaned, nor had any preparation been made for
                    that purpose in their construction. About one-third of the water served out by
                    this company is allowed to settle in these reservoirs, and the remaining
                    two-thirds are sent directly from the Thames. This company has recently
                    constructed works by which they can filter their water by passing through
                    successive beds of stone and sand before it is sent to the reservoirs. The
                    Chelsea Company serves about 12,400 houses, and their daily supply amounts to
                    1,760,000 gallons.</p>
                <p>The Grand Junction Company derive the whole of their supply from the Thames
                    immediately adjoining Chelsea Hospital, whence it is pumped without any
                    filtration or settling into three reservoirs at Paddington. These are
                    respectively about 71, 86, and 92 feet above high water-mark in the Thames;
                    their united contents arc 19,355,840 gallons; and by means of a stand-pipe the
                    water is forced to the height of 147 feet, or about 61 feet above the average
                    height in the reservoir. The number of houses supplied by the Grand Junction
                    Company is 7,700, and the average daily supply of water is 2,800,000
                    gallons.</p>
                <p>The Lambeth Company take their supply from the Thames between Westminster and
                    Waterloo Bridges. It is drawn from the bed of the river by a suction-pipe, and
                    is delivered to the tenants without being allowed to subside, there being only a
                    cistern of 400 barrels at the works, as a temporary supply till engines can be
                    started. The greatest height to which the company force water is about 40
                    feet</p>
                <p>The South London or Vauxhall Company take their supply from the river Thames by a
                    tunnel which is laid six feet below low water-mark, and as far into the river as
                    the third arch of Vauxhall Bridge. At that particular place the bed of the river
                    is described as being always clean, and without any of those depositions of mud
                    and more offensive substances that are found in many other places. Besides the
                    greater purity of the bed of the Thames there than where any of the companies on
                    the south side take their supply, the company allow the water to settle in
                    reservoirs. This company supplies about 10,000 houses with water at the rate of
                    1,000,000 gallons daily.</p>
                <p>The Southwark water-works are the property of one individual. They are supplied
                    from the middle of the Thames below Southwark and London Bridges; and the water
                    thus taken is sent out to tenants without standing to settle, or without any
                    filtration further than it receives from passing through grates of wire or small
                    holes in metallic plates. The number of houses supplied from these works is
                    about 7,000, and the daily supply of water about 720,000 gallons.</p>

                <p>The three last companies, which all supply the south side of the river, will
                    appear to have a far less average supply than the others on the north side. This
                    arises from the difference in the size of the houses and the number of
                    inhabitants. Thus the Grand Junction, which supplies the houses of rich
                    districts, contributes near five times as much water per house as Lambeth, which
                    is one of the poorest.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the companies taking the water from ’the Thames within the
                    limits to which the tide flows, it is necessarily, in the first instance, loaded
                    with many impurities. The reports that were recently circulated relative to the
                    deleterious quality of the water have been shewn to be very greatly exaggerated.
                    The statement of Dr Bostock, given in the report of the commissioners, shews
                    that by far the greater part of the impurities in the Thames water are
                    mechanically suspended in, and not chemically combined with it; that they may be
                    separated from it by filtration, or by merely allowing it to stand at rest. Most
                    of the companies have recently made considerable efforts to improve their water;
                    and though they may not have done as much as they might and ought to have done,
                    a considerable improvement has been effected, and there is not the slightest
                    foundation for the notion that the impurities of the water have ever been such
                    as to affect in any degree the health of the inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The beverage next to water in importance is the porter of London, a malt liquor
                    much celebrated in every part of the world. Its flavour has been attributed to
                    some peculiar properties in the water from which it is manufactured; but as some
                    of it is made from Thames water, some from New River water, and some from
                    natural springs within the premises of the brewers, that cannot be the cause.
                    The breweries are generally very large establishments, with vessels of all kinds
                    of most incredible capacity; and the malt as well as the liquor is conveyed from
                    one part of the premises to another by machinery set in motion by steam power.
                    The capitals invested in many of the large breweries arc enormous; for not only
                    do the cattle, drays, vessels, and premises employ much, but most of them have
                    numerous public-houses either by purchase or on leases, and the occupants placed
                    in them are bound to take the beer from the houses to which the premises belong.
                    There l ire some persons keeping public-houses who brew their own beer, but
                    their number does not much exceed twenty, and their operations are necessarily
                    on a contracted scale. Tn 1831, the number of males above twenty years of age
                    who are occupied in brewing appears by the parliamentary returns to have been
                    563; but this is a very Indeterminate mode of viewing the extent of the
                    trade.</p>
                <p>Before the alteration of the law by which the tax on beer was taken off, the
                    books of the excise office afforded exact ιccounts of the quantities of beer
                    annually brewed, but now it is difficult to collect any facts with accuracy. In
                    the year 1830, the quantity brewed, in barrels of thirty-six gallons, the last
                    of those in which the tax was collected by the ten principal houses in London,
                    was as follows :—</p>

                <p>These supply the chief consumption, the others, though numerous, not producing
                    more than one-fifth of the great houses.</p>
                <p>One class of public establishments of the most beneficial nature to trade
                    especially, but in a greater or less degree to all other persons, consists of
                    the various Insurance offices in London. These may be divided into three
                    sections, viz. 1st, insurances on property at sea against all risks; 2d,
                    insurances of houses and other goods against losses by fire; and, 3d, insurances
                    on lives.</p>
                <p>Marine insurances are chiefly e’ffeeted at Lloyd’s coffeehouse, which has been
                    already noticed under the head of Royal Exchange; but there are four joint stock
                    companies who insure against sea risks to a large extent, and who for some
                    descriptions of business are preferred to the underwriters at Lloyd’s. Two of
                    these are of ancient establishment, viz. the London Assurance Company, and the
                    Royal Exchange Company. Two others arc of more recent foundation, one called the
                    Alliance Marine Assurance Company, and the other the Indemnity Mutual Marine
                    Assurance Company. All of these are of indisputable credit and high honour, and
                    transact a vast deal of business. Besides these there are clubs or associations
                    formed by shipowners, who agree, each entering his ships for a certain sum, to
                    divide amongst themselves each other’s losses. The more public institutions act
                    in some measure in concert with the great mass of underwriters who carry on
                    their operations at large, so far as to contribute to the expense of collecting
                    information respecting the condition and equipment of all shipping in every
                    port, and defraying the general expenses of the committee of Lloyd’s.</p>
                <p>The business of insuring against fire, and the premiums on the different
                    descriptions of risks, are so well known, that any enumeration of them here
                    seems unnecessary. The offices existing in London, and the amount they have paid

                <p>Each of these companies maintain fire-engines and a company of firemen, who, as
                    soon as an alarm is given, hasten to the spot where a fire has broken out, and
                    lend their assistance to extinguish it, and to aid the inhabitants in removing
                    or saving their property.· On such occasions they are also found of great
                    service to check the depredations of thieves, who commonly congregate wherever a
                    fire happens.</p>
                <p>This business of insurance against fire has led to the establishment of county
                    offices for the purpose in most parts of England; but except that at Norwich,
                    which has a branch in London, and one at Exeter, they do but little business.
                    The stamps of all the others scarcely amount to £100,000.</p>
                <p>The business of Life Insurance is one almost exclusively known in England, and
                    chiefly carried on in London; and no other country has adopted the system which
                    has been so successfully pursued by us. The first society of the kind in England
                    was the Amicable, established in 1706. The Royal Exchange and the London
                    Assurance companies began to insure on lives in the latter part of the reign of
                    George I., after which several projects of the kind were started and failed. In
                    the year 1763, the Equitable was first established. This subject engaged the
                    attention of Dr Richard Price, an eminent mathematician, whose judicious
                    suggestions caused that society to obtain a high degree of success, and
                    encouraged others, on his principles, to start the various companies which now
                    exist in the metropolis. The greatest business of all these companies consists
                    in receiving a sum by annual payments, according to the age of the life insured,
                    on condition to pay at the death a given sum. The annual sum is greater or less
                    as the person is younger or older, and regulated by tables of the expectation of
                    life, framed from the most accurate views that have been obtained of the average
                    mass of human mortality. The tables used by most of the companies are those of
                    Carlisle and Northampton, calculated on the proportion of deaths in a given
                    number of persons. Some of these tables having been thought uncertain or
                    erroneous, the government has employed Mr Finlayson, and the companies Mr Milne
                    and other calculators, to render them more perfect, and much assistance has been
                    received from the facts relating to births and deaths by the population reports
                    of Mr Rickman.</p>
                <p>Life insurances are effected by different companies on various principles. One
                    class receives a fixed annual premium, and pays a fixed sum when death occurs,
                    and the proprietors themselves receive whatever benefits may accrue. The Pelican
                    belongs to this class. Others divide the whole of the profits equally between
                    the assured, though they may be divided into two sections, such as the Amicable,
                    which distributes the profits among all the assured; whilst the Equitable allows
                    none to participate iΛ the profits, except such as are assured for the whole
                    term of their lives. The third class have a body of proprietors distinct from
                    the assured, and the profit is shared between the two bodies in various
                    proportions, and in various modes. ∙ Thus the Crown Company divides two-thirds
                    of the profits amongst the insurers for life. The Economic divides three-fourths
                    of the profits amongst the assured. The Atlas gives the whole, by a septennial
                    division, to those insured above L.100 for the whole of life. The Rock allots to
                    the assured two-thirds of the benefit, and adds one-third to the capital of the
                    proprietors. The others, viz. the Alliance, the Imperial, the Norwich Union, the
                    Atlas, the European, the Guardian, the Hope, the Globe, the Law Life, and the
                    Medical and Clerical, divide the whole profits, but differ much in their various
                    times and manners of applying such profits.</p>
                <p>The houses of several of the insurance companies are a great ornament to the
                    streets where they have been erected. The finest of them are the County and
                    Provident, in Regent Street; the Equitable, in New Bridge Street; the Union, in
                    Cornhill; the Globe, in Cornhill; the Albion, in New Bridge Street; the British,
                    in the Strand; the London and the Pelican, in Lombard Street.</p>
                <p>The prosperity of London has been much advanced by the Bridges built over the
                    river Thames, and by the facilities of intercourse with the districts to the
                    south of it being thereby facilitated. In ancient times the connexion with those
                    districts was maintained by means of ferries, the property of which belonged to
                    individuals or to societies. Some of these were adapted for foot-passengers, and
                    others for horses, or for other cattle; and the access by the roads •leading to
                    the ferries was such as to forbid the general use of wheel-carriages, so that
                    even heavy goods were brought by pack-horses. The land on both sides was of a
                    marshy fiaturc, and the cost of constructing roads was one amongst many
                    obstacles to the erection of bridges. With regard to the six bridges now on the
                    Thames, none of them has any connexion with ancient recollections except London
                    Bridge, to which the first notice will be directed, and then attention will be
                    given to the others, according to the dates of their construction.</p>
                <p>At what period a bridge was built across the Thames, at the spot now occupied by
                    one, cannot be settled. It could not have been before the year 993, when the
                    Danish invader Unlaf sailed up the river as high as Staines; nor later than the
                    year 1016, when Canute the Dane, in besieging London, was impeded in his
                    operations by a fortified bridge, which compelled him to cut a canal on the
                    south side of the river from Rotherhithe to a spot to the west of the city, and
                    thereby complete the investment. The remains of this great work were found in
                    1694, at the place called Dock-head.</p>
                <p>Howe the historian, represents that construction as the work of the monks of St
                    Mary Overy, who not only built the bridge, but kept it in repair. But however
                    that may be, it was built of wood, and was burned in 1136. It was then rebuilt
                    of stone, and commenced in 1176, and it occupied thirty-three years to complete
                    it, having been finished in 1209.</p>
                <p>This great work was founded on enormous piles, driven as closely as possible
                    together, and on their tops were laid planks nine inches thick, strongly bolted,
                    on which the base of each pier was placed. Around all were the sterlings to
                    protect the foundation, which so contracted the passage of the water as to form
                    a fall of five feet with the ebb-tide, which caused the loss of thousands of
                    lives between its erection and removal. The length of this vast work was 915
                    feet, and it had 19 arches of unequal dimensions, and greatly deformed by the
                    sterlings, and by the houses on each side, which overhung it· in a most terrific
                    manner. In most places they hid the arches, and nothing appeared but the rude
                    piers. It was narrow, darksome, and dangerous to passengers from the multitude
                    of carriages; arches of strong timber frequently crossed the street, from the
                    tops of the houses, to keep them together, and to prevent them from falling into
                    the river. The houses had shops mostly tenanted by pin and needle makers.
                    According to Fuller, the first needles were made by a Spanish negro in
                    Cheapside, who died without communicating his art; but one Crouse, a German, in
                    the reign of Elizabeth, first taught the Eng∙ lish to make them.</p>

                <p>I In one part of the building was a drawbridge, which was protected by a strong
                    tower, that served to admit ships, and served on several occasions as a means of
                    defence. On the top of this tower was constantly presented the horrid spectacle
                    of the heads of persons condemned for treason.</p>
                <p>The new bridge, which was begun in June 1824, and completed in 1831, is about 200
                    feet higher up the river than that which it replaced. It is a fine object,
                    projected by the late Mr Rennie, and executed by his sons. It is built of Scotch
                    and Derbyshire granite, and is composed of five elliptical arches, the central
                    one being the finest ever erected. On eidιer side of the ends of the bridge are
                    five flights of steps reaching to the water. The foundation of the whole is laid
                    on piers, which were driven down twenty eet into the stiff blue clay forming the
                    bed of the river, ιnd on their tops are horizontal sleepers, on which the first
                    course of masonry was placed. The whole length of the bridge is 928 feet, the
                    breadth of the water-way 692 feet, the width from the outside of one parapet to
                    that of the other 56 feet, the span of the centre arch 152 feet, that αf the
                    arches on each side of it 140 feet, the height above jow water-mark 55 feet, and
                    the width of the carriage-way ∣33∣ feet. It is a proud monument of the present
                    age. The money expended in building the bridge amounted to L.542,000, but to
                    this must be added the cost of the approaches, consisting partly of old
                    buildings, and partly of ground, so that the whole cost amounted to L.711,000.
                    Much of this sum has been borrowed upon the security of the estates of the
                    corporation.</p>
                <p>That noble structure, as it was then denominated, called Westminster Bridge, was
                    begun in January 1739- The first stone was laid by Henry Earl of Pembroke, of
                    whom Walpole reports, that no nobleman had a purer taste in architecture. The
                    design was made by Μ. Labelye, a native of France. The work was not completed
                    till November 1748, having thus occupied eight years and nine months. The
                    expense of its erection was L.389,500. It is built wholly of Portland stone. The
                    difficulties in the foundation were great, and were only surmounted by L.40,000
                    being expended on materials for that part of the work. The length is 1223, the
                    breadth 44, and the foot-path 7 feet. It consists of thirteen large and two
                    small arches, the centre one of which is 76 feet wide, and the others decrease 4
                    feet each as they proceed towards the two end arches, which ire no more than 52
                    feet. On each side is a stone balustrade 6 feet 9 inches in height, with arched
                    recesses for shelter from the rain; the height of this has been a subject of
                    censure, because it obstructs a clear view of the noble expanse of water, and of
                    the fine objects, especially to the east, which are scattered with no unsparing
                    hand. The side has been known to rise at this bridge 22 feet, much <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">ό</hi> the annoyance of the inhabitants of the lower parts of
                    Westminster, for at such times their cellars are filled with water, and the
                    floor of Westminster Hall so covered with it, hat the judges and others require
                    boats to bring them mt, or wait until the ebbing of the tide lower the
                    water.</p>
                <p>Blackfriars’ Bridge fills up the space which was once the filthy mouth of Fleet
                    ditch, and formed a continuation of the river Fleet from Holborn Bridge, but
                    which was a broad lat surface filled with mud, on which coal barges rested when
                    the tide was out, but floated at the time of high-wa-er. It was commenced in
                    October 1760, and finished in he same month of the year 1768. The plan was
                    fur-ιished by Robert Mylne, a Scotch architect, and the expense of the
                    construction was L.l 52,840: 3: 10. The corporation of London advanced the
                    money, and were to oe repaid by a daily toll, which, after some years, became
                    inly a Sunday toll, and a few years later was altogether given up. The
                    corporation, in a political fit, resolved that t should be called after the name
                    of William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, then a favourite statesman with that body; but
                    that name has never been adopted, except on the brass-plate below the
                    foundation. The small square, however, which adjoins the bridge, bears the name
                    of Chatham Place. The bridge is composed of nine elliptical arches, the centre
                    one, of which is 100 feet wide. The whole length is 995, the breadth of the
                    carriage-way is 28 feet, and that of the footway 7 feet. Over each pier is a
                    recess, supported by elegant Ionic pillars, and at each extremity are handsome
                    flights of steps leading to the water, where boats are at all times in
                    attendance. It is just half-way between the two more recently-erected bridges
                    called Waterloo and Southwark, and has a fine view of both, as well as of St
                    Paul’s cathedral, and many other interesting objects.</p>
                <p>A bridge across the Thames between those of Westminster and Blackfriars had been
                    long a desideratum, but no effort was made to erect one before the year 1806,
                    when Mr Dodd, an architect, formed a party, who obtained an act of Parliament,
                    and smoothed some of the obstacles which had impeded the progress of such an
                    undertaking. But the committee and Dodd having disagreed, the work devolved on
                    that eminent architect the late Mr Rennie, who lived to complete this most noble
                    of all the structures of the British metropolis. ’ The work commenced in 1811,
                    when the foundation was laid, by driving into the ground at the bottom of the
                    river, the piles upon which the several piers rest. Each of those piers have
                    under them 320 piles of 20 feet in length, and 13 inches diameter, which are
                    driven down, being one in every square yard. The bridge is built partly of
                    Cornish, and partly of Aberdeen granite. The arches are elliptical, and all of
                    the same size, and the road is consequently without any elevation or depression
                    on passing it. The roads upon both sides leading to it have been raised so as to
                    maintain a complete level to and over it. The style of the building is plain yet
                    noble. It consists of nine arches equal in span, being 120 feet. The whole of
                    the road from the Strand, where its ascent begins, to the Surrey side, which has
                    been raised on forty brick arches, is 2890 feet. The length of the stone-work
                    within the abutments is 1242 feet. The width of the bridge within the
                    balustrades is 42 feet, that of the pavement or footway is 7 feet. The clear
                    water-way under the nine equal arches is 1080 feet. At each extremity of the
                    bridge are handsome flights of steps leading to the water.</p>
                <p>This structure was erected in five years, and first opened on the 18th of June
                    1817, the anniversary of the victory of Waterloo, from which it receives its
                    name. The ceremony was graced by the presence of the Prince Regent, afterwards
                    George IV., the Duke of Wellington, and other distinguished personages. At the
                    extremities of the bridge are toll-houses, of neat Doric structure, with
                    turnstiles, which, by means of machinery below, indicate the number of persons
                    that pass through, and thus act as a check on the collectors of the toll. The
                    cost of this bridge, which was constructed by a joint-stock company, amounted to
                    one million sterling, and it is to be regretted that the spirited society should
                    be such pecuniary sufferers as they are at present. The chief hope of a better
                    state of affairs, rests upon the expectation of a great increase of buildings on
                    the Surrey side of the river.</p>
                <p>Vauxhall Bridge, the next in date, connects Chelsea with the parish of Lambeth.
                    It was commenced in 1813, when the first stone was laid by Charles Duke of
                    Brunswick, and finished in 1816, at an expense of L.150,000, which is to be
                    discharged by the tolls over it, which are necessarily high. It is composed of
                    nine arches of equal span, made of cast-iron, resting on piers formed by a
                    wooden frame, faced with stone and Roman cement. The length is 860 feet. The
                    arches are 78 feet in the span, and 29 feet in height. It was projected by Mr
                    Dodd, who began it, and for a short time the conduct of the operation fell into
                    the hands of Mr Walker, but it finally came under the direction<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193208079" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8079-0512"/> of Mr Rennie, by whom the
                    work was finished. The land upon the Middlesex side was very swampy, and it has
                    cost much to make a good road to it. It forms a good communication with the
                    western part of the town, and especially with the buildings erecting near
                    Belgrave Square.</p>
                <p>The latest of the bridges is that called, after the part to which it leads from
                    Queen Street, in the city, the Southwark. It was projected by Mr Wyatt, but
                    began to be constructed by Mr Rennie in 1814, with the aid of Mr Weston as
                    sub-engineer. It was completed in 1819, having cost, including the expense of
                    forming the avenues to it, L. 800,000. Messrs Joliff and Banks contracted to
                    perform the work, and the cast-iron was supplied from the foundery of the
                    Walkers at Rotheram.</p>
                <p>This stupendous bridge consists of three cast-iron arches, resting on massive
                    stone piers and abutments. The distance between the abutments is 708 feet. The
                    extent of each abutment inclosed, including the land and the inverted arches, is
                    71 feet, formed of solid masonry. There are two piers, 60 feet high from the bed
                    of the river to the top of the parapet, 24 feet in breadth between high and low
                    water marks, and 75 feet long between one acme and another of the salient
                    angles. The foundations of these piers are each about twelve feet below the bed
                    or bottom of the river, and rest upon a platform of timber 2∣ feet thick; these
                    platforms repose on about 420 piles, most of which are driven 24 feet into the
                    earth, making the depth, from the shoe of the piles to the parapet of the piers,
                    98 feet. The two side arches are 210 feet each in span, and the centre arch 240,
                    with 43 feet clear opening above low-water mark at medium tides. The centre arch
                    is thus the largest in the world, exceeding the admired bridge at Sunderland by
                    4 feet, and that of the once highly boasted Rialto of Venice by 167 feet. Many
                    of the iron single or solid castings weigh ten tons each, and the total weight
                    of iron in the bridge is 5308 tons. This bridge was constructed with so much
                    accuracy, that, when the centerings of the middle arch were removed, it only
                    sunk at the vertex one inch and seven-eighths. At the end of the bridge are
                    turnstiles, with machinery to shew the number of passers through, similar to
                    those of Waterloo Bridge. The tolls are lower than those of Waterloo for all but
                    foot-passengers. They have not yet amounted to such a sum as the shareholders
                    expected, or as they probably will become when all the avenues leading to it
                    receive the improvements that are in contemplation.</p>
                <p>The attempted Tunnel under the Thames is so connected with the purpose for which
                    bridges are constructed, that the two kinds of undertakings may be said to be in
                    contact. Mr Brunel, the eminent mechanic and projector of public works, had
                    formed a scheme for making a tunnel under the Thames, near Gravesend, which had
                    failed; but the failure, instead of deterring him from other attempts, urged him
                    on, by the conviction that it was practicable, and would be beneficial to the
                    public. The confidence in his talents, assiduity, and integrity, was so great,
                    that a company was speedily formed, and an act of Parliament was passed,
                    incorporating it, for the specific purpose of the tunnel, in June 1824. The
                    expense was estimated at L 160,000, which was soon subscribed.</p>
                <p>The great merit of the invention for excavating with security, entitles it to a
                    particular description. A general idea of the means proposed by this great
                    engineer may be obtained by supposing a hollow box, of sufficient strength for
                    its purpose, open to the rear, but closed on the front with moveable boards, and
                    sufficiently large to contain one man at work. The front is placed against the
                    face of the earth to be removed, and separates the workman from it. By means of
                    the moveable boards, he can expose any part of the earth at his discretion. When
                    he has removed one board, he excavates the earth which was behind it, to the
                    depth directed, and -places the board against the new vertical surface exposed;
                    the board is then in advance of the box, and is kept in its place by props,
                    which have their support in the rear. When he has thus proceeded with all the
                    boards, it will be evident that an excavation will have been made equal to the
                    area of the front of the box, and of a certain depth; and that the boards will
                    be all in advance equal to this depth, and held there, disengaged from the box.
                    The box is then pushed forward by screws to the boards, and the operation of
                    excavation then recommences. The brick-work is immediately executed up to the
                    box, and the security of the work is complete. When the area of excavation is
                    proposed to be large, as in the case of this particular tunnel, a number of
                    similar boxes is required. Their size is not increased, but they are arranged
                    side by side to the width intended, and tier on tier to the height proposed.
                    Those which are over each other are attached so as to be moved together in one
                    vertical group, and have no connexion with the others on their sides. This whole
                    assemblage is called the shield. In large excavations the whole shield is not
                    moved forward at once; any one of the vertical groups may be advanced
                    independently of any other, and the mode adopted is, to push on the alternate
                    ones equally to a certain distance in front, and then to bring up and advance
                    those left behind through the intervals of the first, and so on alternately.</p>
                <p>Early in the year 1825 the shaft was begun which was necessary to be sunk on the
                    Rotherhithe shore, in order to get down to the level of the intended works at
                    that end of the tunnel. The sinking of this shaft, though the principle was well
                    known to those employed in sinking wells, required a great degree of skill and
                    intrepidity on the part of the engineer, owing to the magnitude of the
                    operation.</p>
                <p>A tower or cylinder of brick-work, 50 feet in diameter, 40 feet in height, and
                    the walls of which were 3 feet in thickness, and resting on a circle of
                    cast-iron, having its lower edges chisel-shaped, was built with the utmost care
                    on the surface of the ground, and immediately over the situation of the intended
                    shaft. In the upper part was suspended a steam-engine, of thirty-six horse
                    power, for the purpose of draining and lifting the excavated earth to the
                    surface.</p>
                <p>This tower was begun on the 2d of March 1825, and, on the 1st of April, the
                    excavation commenced within the inclosure. As the work proceeded, this vast
                    structure, with its engine, descended without accident, and continued to do so
                    for twenty days, through successive strata of gravel and other earths, until, at
                    37 feet from the surface, it rested upon a solid bed of clay. It was there
                    permitted to remain, but the excavation was continued, and the cylinder under
                    built to the depth of 24 feet. At this level the diameter was reduced to 25
                    feet, and another cylinder inserted, sunk 20 feet more. This lower part was
                    intended as a tank or receptacle for drainage water; and suction pipes of the
                    engine-pump were carried into it, for the purpose of carrying it off. The total
                    height of this extraordinary shaft is 84 feet, 64 feet of which are of 50 feet
                    diameter, and 20 of 25 feet. It consumed 260,000 bricks, and 1200 barrels of
                    cement, and the weight of it is about 900 tons. It is intended eventually as the
                    staircase for persons on foot. Near it, a little to the southward, a shaft is to
                    be built, by which carriages are to ascend and descend, which will be 160 feet
                    in diameter.</p>
                <p>The soundings along the proposed line across the river give 12 feet water at low
                    tide, and 36 at the highest, in the deepest parts; the bed of the river was
                    found to be a stratum of sand, about 3 feet 8 inches thick, lying upon one of
                    about half that thickness, composed of clay and sand, beneath which was a bed of
                    tenacious clay. The descending order of the strata, at the lower part of this
                    bed, in which the tunnel is executed, is as follows: Stiff blue clay about 2
                    feet; silt, 7 feet; silt, mixed with shells, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208092"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-8092-0513"/>7 feet; indurated clay, 3 feet; silt and gravel
                    stones, 3 feet. It was found that the whole length from shaft to shaft would be
                    1300 feet.</p>
                <p>Early in December the first horizontal excavation commnenced. At the bottom of
                    the wider part of the shaft a hield of cast-iron, weighing 120 tons, 37 feet in
                    width by 22 feet in height, and 8 feet in depth, with a complement if thirty-six
                    men, each in his respective cell, was entered into the solid earth, and began
                    its new and extraordinary march. It proceeded for several months, at a rate of
                    about two feet in twenty-four hours, displacing from 90 to 100 tons of earth,
                    which was lifted to the surface by the engine in the shaft. In each foot 5500
                    bricks were used. On the 2d of March 1826, it had advanced 470 feet, or about
                    one-third of the whole lengtn; and, though the line of the tunnel dips about 3
                    feet in 100, the excavation in one part, towards the middle of the river, had
                    approached within 10 feet of the watler above it. The brick-work which followed
                    immediately, filled exactly the aperture which was made by the shield, and
                    contained in its mass two arched passages or roadways, each 13 feet 9 inches
                    wide, and 16 feet 10 inches high, lying by the side of each other, with a wall
                    of 3 feet 6 inches between them. The passages at first have no connexion, but
                    are subsequently laid together by arched perforations through the brick-work
                    that separates them. The sides are three feet, and the arches at top and bottom
                    2 feet 7 inches thick at their smallest parts. About 1,000 bricks per day were
                    used, entirely laid in cement; and the labour of one hundred men was constantly
                    kept up by relays at stated periods. A main from a gas-work was laid along the
                    floor, which conveyed the gas to columns placed in the connecting arches as they
                    were formed, branches from which illuminated both the roadways, and a total
                    freedom from water was preserved by drains beneath, which emptied themselves
                    into the engine-tank beneath in the shaft. In the use of these, and innumerable
                    other expedients to facilitate the progress, and anticipate or overcome the
                    difficulties, of this extraordinary work, Mr Brunel displayed such fertility of
                    invention, depth of resource, and professional intrepidity, as must place him in
                    the highest rank of professional engineers. But these qualities were destined to
                    a very severe trial. On the 18th of May 1827, at a distance of 544 feet from the
                    shaft, the river found its way through a portion of loose earth, and entered the
                    tunnel, through the shield, with a velocity and volume that filled the tunnel
                    and the shaft in fifteen minutes. This happened whilst the workmen were at their
                    duties, but no lives were lost. About 1000 tons of loose soil and rubbish
                    descended into the tunnel.</p>
                <p>The breach was examined by means of the diving-bell, and repaired by depositing
                    about 1500 cubic yards of clay, in bags, in and around it. The water was then
                    pumped out, nad the permanent works were found very slightly injured; the shield
                    was restored and adjusted, and in the latter part of September the work was
                    recommenced. The dangerous part was passed, and 52 feet added to the length
                    before achieved, when, on the 12th January 1828, the river broke through the
                    shield a second time. The tunnel was filled in less than ten minutes, and the
                    rush of water brought with it a current of air that put out the lights; and,
                    principally owing to this circumstance, six of the workmen were unable to
                    extricate themselves; the rest escaped. Mr Brunel reported that the aperture in
                    the bed of the river was much less than at the former accident, and consequently
                    that the mischief might be repaired at much less expense. The point at which
                    this irruption occurred was at 600 feet from the shaft, within 25 feet of the
                    middle of the channel of the river, leaving about 700 feet to be executed. The
                    breach was, however, stopped, the water pumped out, and the rubbish removed.</p>
                <p>The funds of the company were now nearly exhausted. Independently of the expense
                    caused by this last accident, the expenditure up to that time had been L.
                    157,000, of which about L. 38,500 had been laid out in the purchase of premises
                    and machinery, and L. 118,500 in the works. The directors, in their report,
                    state that the sum of L.75,000 will be required to complete the Tunnel to the
                    north embankment. As the public appeared to take a great interest in the
                    completion of the work, it was resolved to try the effect of contributions; but
                    though some individuals subscribed liberally, the amount was on the whole but
                    small, and not more than sufficient to clear the works. It was then determined
                    to open the tunnel to the inspection of the public, on paying one shilling for
                    admission. But this has done little more than defray the expense of keeping the
                    works and the machinery in good order.</p>
                <p>Of late the government has been prevailed upon to grant the company a loan of
                    exchequer bills, and the work is again proceeding; but the prospect of its
                    completion is still obscure, owing more to the want of pecuniary power than to
                    any doubt of the practicability of its final accomplishment.</p>
                <p>The Hospitals of London are numerous, and some of them very wealthy, especially
                    those of royal foundation, which will here receive the first notice. <hi
                    rend="italic">St Thomads Hospital,</hi> in the High Street of Southwark, was
                    founded by the prior of Bermondsey in 1213, and surrendered to Henry VIII. in
                    the year 1538. The corporation of London having purchased the manor of Southwark
                    in the reign of Edward VI., are ex-officio governors; but others are elected as
                    governors who subscribe L.50 to the institution. The building having become
                    dilapidated by time, was taken down, and rebuilt by voluntary subscriptions in
                    1693, and then formed three squares, to which were added, in 1752, a new portion
                    of considerable magnificence, which comprised several wards and various offices.
                    It now consists of four quadrangular courts. In the first are the wards for
                    females; in the second two chapels, with houses for the treasurer and other
                    officers; the third court contains wards for the men; and the fourth, besides
                    wards for men, has hot and cold baths, a surgery, the theatre, capable of
                    containing 300 persons, in which lectures to the pupils are delivered, and the
                    apothecary’s dispensary.</p>
                <p>There are in the institution 18 wards, with 485 beds. It is destined to receive
                    the sick poor, and those maimed by accident. The former must be recommended by a
                    governor, but the latter are received at any hour, without recommendation. The
                    annual expenditure is about L. 10,000; and in some years 11,000 patients have
                    received assistance either within the building, or at their own residences. This
                    is one of the chief surgical schools of the metropolis. The medical officers
                    being men of the greatest talents in the profession, naturally draw around them
                    those who are solicitous to acquire skill and knowledge.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">St Bartholomew’s Hospital</hi> is near the church of St
                    Bartholomew the Greater. It is in fact only the choir of an ancient conventual
                    church, belonging to a priory of blackfriars, founded by one Ralièrc, who had
                    been a minstrel or jester to King Heirry I., whom, as the tradition goes, in a
                    horrible dream, from which he was delivered by St Bartholomew’s appearance, the
                    saint warned to quit his profligate life, and found this religious house. To
                    this person, however, who lived in the year 1102, have the inhabitants of
                    London, during more than seven centuries, been indebted for one of the most
                    beneficent of its public institutions.</p>
                <p>The king made Ralière a present of a waste spot of ground, on which he built an
                    hospital for a master, brethren and sisters, for the entertainment of the
                    diseased poor, for women with child till they should be delivered, and for the
                    support of such children whose mothers died in the house, till they obtained the
                    age of seven years. It was placed under the management of the priory; and its re
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208105" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8105-0514"/>venues, by
                    what means acquired does not appear, were found, at the dissolution of the
                    priory, to amount to about L. 305 annually, a large sum at that day. By the
                    liberality of numerous contributors, by benevolent legacies, and above all by
                    the increased value of land, this institution has gone on increasing in wealth
                    and utility. The present building was commenced in 1729∙ Although the ancient
                    erections had escaped the great fire of 1666, yet they had become ruinous from
                    age, when, by voluntary subscriptions, a sum to rebuild it wholly was collected.
                    It is a noble pile, composed of four buildings, which form a large square, and
                    are joined together by stone gateways. One of these piles contains a large hall
                    for meetings of the governors, an accounting-house, and other offices; and the
                    three other piles consist of apartments well arranged, in which are the
                    patients. The principal gate is of the Doric order, consisting of a large arch
                    placed between two pillars, supported by emblematic figures. The grand
                    staircase, leading to the hall used by the governors, was gratuitously painted
                    by Hogarth, and the subjects are the Good Samaritan and the Pool of Bethesda.
                    The hall is deemed the finest apartment in London, its proportions being those
                    of a double cube. Henry VIII. settled L.500 per annum on the institution, and a
                    full length portrait of him adorns the room, whilst the walls are covered with
                    the names of the contributors, who, by donations of L. 50 and upwards, have been
                    chosen governors. There is also a fine portrait of Dr Ratcliffe, who left L. 500
                    a-year for the improvement of the diet, and L. 100 a-year to purchase linen for
                    the patients; and of Perceval Pott, the eminent surgeon, who was a great
                    benefactor to the institution. In the window there is a portrait of Henry VIII.
                    delivering the charter to the Lord Mayor, and Prince Arthur, with two noblemen
                    holding white rods, standing near him. Attached to the south pile of the square
                    is the dispensary, a stone building, in which medicines and dressings are
                    prepared.</p>
                <p>The physicians and surgeons of this establishment are the first for skill and
                    talent in the kingdom; and this, with the numerous patients, makes it one of the
                    best medical schools of the metropolis. The number of patients annually relieved
                    generally exceed 10,000; and the expenditure of the institution, about equal to
                    its income, is nearly L. 30,000 a-year.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Guy’s Hospital,</hi> in St Thomas’s Street, Southwark, is
                    perhaps the most extensive beneficent institution, that in modern ages has been
                    founded by one individual. Thomas Guy was the son of an anabaptist lighterman
                    and coaldealer in the borough. Upon his death his widow removed to her native
                    town of Tamworth, with her only child, and from thence at the proper age sent
                    him to London, to be bound apprentice to a bookseller in Cheapside. When he had
                    served his term, he commenced business for himself, with a capital of two
                    hundred pounds. He connected himself with some others in an illegal trade in
                    bibles, which were printed in Holland and smuggled into this country, to the
                    great injury of those who enjoyed the exclusive right to deal in them. This was
                    successfully carried on for some time; but it was abandoned by some
                    prosecutions. Guy then prevailed on the University of Oxford to contract with
                    him for their privilege of printing bibles. By this and other operations,
                    accompanied with great economy, he was enabled to amass an early competence, and
                    then he established some charitable institutions in Tamworth, where he had
                    passed his early youth. By the sale of bibles, by buying up seamen’s tickets in
                    the latter part of the reign of Queen Anne, when they were at a great discount,
                    and operations in South Sea stock in the reign of George I., he had acquired a
                    vast fortune, without increasing in the same degree his personal expenses.</p>
                <p>Guy had been a most extensive contributor, at an early period of his prosperity,
                    to the hospital of St Thomas, in which he had been at the expense of adding to
                    the former part three additional wards. At seventy-six years of age, he took
                    from the governors of that hospital a piece of vacant ground adjoining, on lease
                    for 999 years, for which he paid them L. 18,793, 16s., and began to build his
                    hospital in 1721. At his death, which happened in 1724, he bequeathed to the
                    institution the vast sum of L. 219,499.</p>
                <p>The building is entered from an area, inclosed by handsome iron gates, in which
                    is a statue of the founder. It consists of a centre and two wings, and behind
                    the former a separate part for the reception of lunatics. One of the wings
                    contains a hall and a room for business, and the other a chapel.</p>
                <p>The hospital was originally established for 400 sick and diseased persons, and
                    for 20 incurable lunatics. The average number now admitted is about 2250
                    patients, besides upwards of 20,000 out-patients. It has an admirable
                    establishment of medical men of the highest rank in the several branches of the
                    healing art, and is one of the best schools for students in medicine and
                    surgery.</p>
                <p>The governors are a corporate body, appointed from those of St Thomas’s, in
                    number sixty; and if there are not forty, the Lord Chancellor has the power to
                    name as many as shall complete the number to fifty. A committee of twenty-one
                    has the management of the interior, of whom seven are changed each year. There
                    is attendance at the surgery constantly, and all accidental patients are
                    instantly admitted.</p>
                <p>A splendid bequest has been added to the previous resources of the institution,
                    by the will of Mr Thomas Hunt, who, in 1829, left L. 200,000, on condition that
                    adequate accommodation should be made for the admission of 100 additional
                    patients.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Christ-church Hospital,</hi> near St Bartholomew’s, is a royal
                    foundation. It was originally the house of the Greyfriars, or mendicants of the
                    order of St Francis, founded in 1225, by John Ewen, a mercer. The church was
                    considered as the most superb of the conventual class, and was erected by the
                    contributions of various devout and distinguished persons. The choir was added
                    in 1306 by Margaret, second Queen to Edward I. Isabella, Queen to Edward II.,
                    gave three score and ten pounds of silver, and Queen Philippa, wife of Edward
                    HL, gave three score and two pounds, towards the building. John de Bretagne,
                    Duke of Richmond, built the body of the church at a vast expense, and Robert de
                    Clare, Earl of Gloucester, gave twenty great beams out of his forest of
                    Tunbridge.</p>
                <p>The. reputation for sanctity which this order of friars had acquired was so
                    great, that numbers of persons of the highest rank deemed their future state
                    secure if they died in that order, and were interred within its walls.
                    Multitudes, therefore, were crowded into this holy ground. Amongst others, no
                    less than four queens are recorded, and many of the highest rank of the
                    nobility, and members of the royal family. Many of those who suffered under the
                    sentence of the law for atrocious or for state crimes were consigned to the holy
                    precincts, in order to secure their eternal salvation.</p>
                <p>At the suppression of the religious houses by Henry VI1I., the fine church, after
                    being despoiled of its ornaments for the king’s use, was made a storehouse for
                    French prizes, and the monuments were sold or destroyed; but Henry, from remorse
                    or superstitious fear, granted the church to the city, and directed it to be
                    opened for divine service.</p>
                <p>The conventual building remained in a dilapidated state till the latter end of
                    the reign of Edward VI. The story told is, that the amiable young prince was so
                    deeply impressed by a sermon which he heard from Bishop Ridley, that he resolved
                    to found three great hospitals in the city. These were, St Thomas’s, in the
                    borough of Southwark, for the sick or wounded poor; Bridewell, for the
                    thriftless; and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208118" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8118-0515"

                    apprenticed at proper ages to different rades.</p>
                <p>At first this institution was upon a contracted scale, but eing gradually
                    enlarged, it consists of common schools for oys and girls. Charles II. joined to
                    it a mathematical school, nd charged the Exchequer with an annuity of L.1000 for
                    ,s support; and a private individual, named Travers, in-reased the capacity for
                    that kind of study. The corpora-ion of London are governors, but any individual
                    contri- <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> uting L.400 is elected to that rank. The
                    pupils are nominated by the,governors in their turn as vacancies occur; ut the
                    aldermen of London have one annual nomination ach. The greater part of the
                    children admitted are those f freemen of London, or of clergymen of the
                    established hurch. A branch of this institution is maintained at Hert-mrd. The
                    total number of children is about 1100. The ducation is well conducted, and, as
                    there are funds appro-riated for that purpose, those who excel in classical
                    learn-ιg have good exhibitions at the university. The mathematical boys are
                    fitted for the navy or other professions; ι∏d many very distinguished men have
                    received their eduction here. The buildings are old and irregular; but of ∣ιte
                    years have received great improvements, and latterly n opening has been made
                    into Newgate Street, shewing me front of the new hall, in the architecture of
                    the Tudor ge. In the hall is a fine picture of Edward, the founder, y Hans
                    Holbein. 'The pupils are well fed, and warm-L, though coarsely clothed, and
                    carefully attended when ck. The masters are generally men of great merit. The

                    connection with London, cannot be unnecessary here.</p>
                <p>The ancient building of St Mary of Bethlehem was found-id by Simon Fitzmary,
                    sheriff of London, in 1247. It con-lsted of a prior and canons, brethren and
                    sisters, and pro-ιably stood in St Martin’s in the Fields, but was removed ∣ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> om thence at the instance of one of our kings, who
                    was ∣nnoyed at the presence of lunatics, for whom it was founded, being so near
                    his own residence. It was therefore removed to Bethlehem without Bishopsgate. In
                    1545, the Iity was presented with the hospital, and under their direction it
                    continued till it was found too small for the num- ∣er of unfortunate beings
                    that sought relief. In 1675, the I..ord Mayor and Aldermen removed the hospital
                    to the .!&gt;uth end of Moorfields, and, at an expense of L. 16,000, rected a
                    magnificent pile of buildings. It was designed Ider the plan of the palace of
                    the Tuillcries in Paris, ilouis XIV. was so incensed that his palace should be
                    made tie model for a lunatic hospital, that it was said he ordered ιmost
                    whimsical and not very decent revenge. This build- ∣ <hi rend="superscript">
                    l</hi> ιg was 540 feet in length, with a gallery from one end to lie other, out
                    of which were the doors to the ranges of apartments for the patients on both
                    sides of it. Two large wings fere added to the building in 1734, which enabled
                    it to admit 250 patients. Being in a decayed state, it was resolved 11 remove
                    the whole institution to a more airy spot. The few hospital was begun in St
                    George’s Fields in 1812, and finished in 1814, at the cost of L.100,000. It has
                    a magnificent front 580 feet in length; the centre is surmounted <hi
                    rend="superscript"> l</hi> y a dome, and ornamented with an Ionic porticoof six
                    olumns, supporting the arms of the United Kingdom. The ∣ιterior is well
                    arranged, and capable of receiving 200 pa-ents. In the hall arc two fine figures
                    representing raving nd melancholy madness, which were formerly on pedes-ïls
                    before Old Bedlam, and have always excited the greatest admiration. The annual
                    income and expenditure of this institution is about L. 18,000.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Bridewell</hi> is in Bridge Street, Blackfriars, which, as well
                    as the church and the parish in which it stands, received the name from a holy
                    well dedicated to St Bridget or Bride. It was formed in part out of the remains
                    of an ancient castle, which stood near the river Fleet. Many of the materials,
                    in the reign of William the Conqueror, and in that of Henry I., were applied to
                    reconstruct St Paul’s cathedral. It subsequently became the residence of several
                    of our monarchs; and Henry VIII. fitted it up for the reception of the Emperor
                    Charles V., upon occasion of his visit to England in the year 1522. The emperor,
                    however, preferred the Abbey of Blackfriars for his own residence, but his
                    retinue was lodged at Bridewell, and both were connected by a gallery over
                    Fleet-ditch, and a passage cut through the city wall. Henry himself took up his
                    abode in Bridewell in 1529, whilst the question of the validity of his marriage
                    was under discussion in the hall of Blackfriars.</p>
                <p>It was neglected anddiad fallen into a state of decay, when Bishop Ridley
                    requested it of Edward VI. for a charitable purpose. It thus came into the hands
                    of the city, who have used it as a house of correction for disorderly persons,
                    idle apprentices, and vagrants; and of late years eight or nine hundred persons
                    have been annually consigned to it for punishment or amendment. The buildings
                    consist of a quadrangle, on one side of which is an extensive hall, representing
                    the founder and some of the benefactors; whilst the other sides are occupied by
                    the prisoners. Another house connected with the institution has been recently
                    erected in St George’s Fields.</p>
                <p> The Church of St Bride’s, near to this building, was erected by Sir Christopher
                    Wren, and is distinguished by the beauty of its spire. The interior is imposing.
                    It has a clock illuminated at night; and it has been in some measure opened to
                    the public view, by purchasing the ruins of some houses which had been burned
                    down in Fleet Street.</p>

                    a much larger scale. Contributions for the purpose have flowed in with great
                    liberality. The magnificent structure, which is an ornament to the entrance of

                    afterwards added, by the liberality of the late Mr Whitbread, a department for
                    patients afflicted with cancer, who are admitted to remain during their

                    of three physicians, an accoucheur, and three surgeons. It is under the
                    management of a patron, a president, fourteen vice-presidents, and a committee
                    of the governors, who are such persons as contribute three guineas annually to
                    the establishment.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">London Hospital</hi> is a vast pile of building in
                    Whitechapel Road, to which spot it was removed, when it obtained a charter, in
                    1759∙ It had before existed in Prescot Street, Goodman’s Fields, since 1740. The
                    patients received here are chiefly sick and wounded seamen, watermen,
                    coal-heavers, ship-wrights, rope-makers, and labourers in the dockyards and on
                    the quays. It is a subject of regret that this hospital, situated in a district
                    where more relief is required for the sick and diseased than perhaps in any
                    other division of the metropolis, should be so deficient in resources to be
                    unable to occupy the whole of the building with patients, though zealous
                    attempts have not been wanting to obtain the disposal of more ample funds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">St Lukds Hospital,</hi> in Old Street Road, was originally
                    instituted at a place called Windmill Hill, near Moorfields, in 1732, and
                    removed to the present spot in 1751, but not completed till 1786. It is destined
                    for the reception of such lunatics as are deemed incurable, as well as for those
                    of whom some hope is entertained. It is a solid large edifice, nearly 500 feet
                    in length, consisting of three stories besides the basement, and with attics at
                    the extremities; and the whole has an imposing effect. The interior contains
                    apartments for the medical and the other officers, and accommodation for 300
                    patients, of whom 100 are on the incurable list.</p>
                <p>The annual income of the hospital is about L∙9000. Persons paying twenty guineas
                    at once, or paying seven guineas, and agreeing to pay three pounds eighteen
                    shillings in the four succeeding years, are admitted to become governors.</p>

                <p>To the list of charities connected with the circumstances of disease, might be
                    added the names and situations of twenty-seven dispensaries. These are to be
                    found in every district of the metropolis, and in them constant attendance is
                    given to the cases of the diseased, who are recommended by governors. Advice and
                    medicines are afforded gratis at the houses, and the sick unable to attend are
                    visited by the professional men at their own homes. It deserves to be noticed,
                    to the credit of the liberality of the gentlemen of the medical profession, that
                    in all of those charities the aid of physicians and surgeons of the greatest
                    skill is gratuitously afforded.</p>
                <p>Besides those charitable associations in behalf of lying-in women, which appear
                    ostensibly, there are in every quarter small societies of from ten to twenty
                    ladies, who furnish the necessary clothing and food, within their respective
                    circles, to indigent females, whilst waiting for, or recovering from, their
                    confinement. The benevolence of the inhabitants of London, proved by the
                    numerous institutions for the relief of the diseased, has had a beneficial
                    effect on the health of the whole of the population of the kingdom. It has
                    produced one of the best schools of the healing art, because one in which the
                    greatest number and variety of cases may be attentively examined, and where
                    instructions arising from actual practice may be most advantageously
                    acquired.</p>
                <p>∣ Schools of anatomy were first opened in London about the year 1720, and have
                    been extending ever since; and now every hospital has become a school, at which
                    not only anatomy, but every branch of medical or surgical knowledge, may be
                    acquired. Lectures are delivered by men of the first eminence, during the winter
                    months, and practice, especially in the hospitals, is admirably combined with
                    theory. By a late law, greater facility has been given to the study of anatomy,
                    by the greater facility of obtaining subjects for dissection than was formerly
                    enjoyed.</p>
                <p>The more public establishments for the promotion of the art of healing may be
                    here noticed.</p>
                <p>The College of Physicians stood originally in Knight Rider Street, then in Amen
                    Corner, and at length in Warwick Lane, near to Newgate. It was founded by <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> Dr Linacre, who first rescued the medical art from the
                    hands of illiterate monks and empirics. He had studied in Italy, and had been
                    successively physician to Henry VII. and VIII., and Edward VI., in whose reign
                    he died, in 1524. He was the first president of the college, and was succeeded
                    by Dr Caius, the founder of the college of that name in Cambridge.</p>
                <p>As the building in Warwick Lane had become injured by time, it was resolved to
                    build a new and more appropriate pile, in a more favourable spot. Pall-Mall East
                    has been selected, and its eastern side forms a most imposing part of the new
                    square, in which the image of Charles I. stands. It was designed by that eminent
                    artist Smirke, and the valuable materials of the ancient house were removed to
                    it in 1823. The portico of six Ionic columns, leads to a noble hall, the roof of
                    which is supported by fluted Doric pillars, each consisting of a single block of
                    stone. On the left is a dining-room, in which are numerous portraits,
                    particularly those of Henry VIII., Cardinal λVolsey, and Sir Hans Sloane. A
                    handsome staircase leads up to the library, which is surrounded with a gallery,
                    and contains a valuable collection of books, and some anatomical preparations,
                    and also portraits of Drs Harvey and Ratcliffe, with a bust of King George IV.,
                    by Chantrey. The examiners’ room has several portraits, as well as busts of Drs
                    Baillie, Mead, and Sydenham. There is also a small but neat theatre, a
                    reading-room, and other apartments.</p>
                <p>The college is constituted in a president, elects, and fellows, who license all
                    physicians who practise in the bills of mortality, and grant extra licenses to
                    those who practise in the rest of the kingdom. The fellows can only be appointed
                    by such as have graduated at Oxford or Cambridge.</p>
                <p>• The Royal College of Surgeons was assembled for many years in the Old Bailey,
                    near the Sessions-House, and the bodies of those criminals were carried to it
                    for dissection, who by the law were subject to that operation. It has been now
                    removed to Lincoln’s Inn Fields, to a structure erected for the use of the
                    college.</p>
                <p>This was one of the old city guilds or companies connected with that of the
                    barbers till the reign of Henry VIII., when they obtained a separate charter.
                    Since that time various and important regulations have been obtained to increase
                    its utility and respectability. The duty of examining medical officers for the
                    navy and army, and for the East India service, has devolved on them, and without
                    their examination no person is allowed to practise surgery in London or
                    Westminster, or in a circuit of seven miles round the hall.</p>
                <p>The hall is a noble building of the Ionic order, with a handsome portico over
                    which is inscribed, <hi rend="italic">Collegium regale</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >chirurgorum,</hi> and above that are the arms of the college, supported by the
                    two sons of Aesculapius. The interior is grand and appropriate, containing a
                    theatre in which lectures are delivered on anatomy and other subjects connected
                    with the profession, which arc illustrated by the collection in the rich museum,
                    and especially the invaluable preparations of the late John Hunter, purchased by
                    order of the government. In these is exposed to view the gradations of nature
                    from the most simple state in which life is found to exist up to the most
                    perfect and most complex of the animal creation, man. There is also a rare
                    collection of objects of natural history, with specimens of vegetable and fossil
                    productions. There is also a most valuable library, and admission to every part
                    is to be obtained from anv member of the company.</p>

                <p>The apothecaries of London were formerly incorporated with the company of
                    grocers; but in 1617 a separate charter was granted to them, which enabled them
                    to regulate the sale of drugs and medicines, and to sell them for gain. This is
                    now a trading company. They have a house and large old premises in Water Lane,
                    near Blackfriars Bridge, where they sell drugs and chemical preparations, and
                    such is the accuracy with which the latter are prepared, that many practitioners
                    administer none but what is obtained from their laboratory. The whole of the
                    medicines for the navy and the army are compounded and supplied from their
                    manufactory or stores. Prescriptions for private persons are also made up by
                    them. The Physic Garden at Chelsea is under the direction of this company,
                    having been bequeathed to them by Sir Hans Sloane, on condition that they should
                    present annually to the Royal Society fifty new plants till the number should
                    amount to 2000. This condition has been punctually fulfilled, and the specimens
                    arc preserved in the collection of that society. A general herbarizing tour is
                    made yearly by the members of the company for the improvement of students and
                    apprentices. By some legislative enactments several powers have been conferred
                    on the company. No person is now allowed to practise in any part of England or
                    Wales, without having first obtained a certificate of his qualification from the
                    court of examiners of this company. As a trading concern it is profitable, and
                    the directors, besides giving very sumptuous entertainments, divide a good
                    yearly sum amongst its members.</p>
                <p>There are a variety of independent societies established in London, which are
                    voluntary associations, and not incorporated bodies. One of the first of these
                    is in Bolt Court, Fleet Street, and was opened in 1773 at Crane Court, by an
                    introductory lecture delivered by Dr Lettsom. There is a library, consisting of
                    more than 30,000 volumes; and the object of the society is to receive medical
                    papers, and useful facts, respecting difficult and extraordinary cases, to
                    increase exertion by bestowing honorary rewards, and to preserve and increase
                    their collection of medical books.</p>
                <p>Another and similar association was established in Lincolns-Inn-Fields in 1805.
                    It has an extensive library, and ranks amongst its members some of the most
                    eminent members of the faculty in the metropolis.</p>
                <p>Lectures on anatomy, physiology, medicine, obstetrics, and chemistry, are
                    delivered at stated times at the various hospitals, at the London University,
                    and at King’s College, by the most celebrated men in the profession. Others are
                    delivered at theatres of anatomy in Great Windmill Street, at Mr Tanton’s in
                    Hatton Garden, at a theatre in Webb Street, Maze Pond, in the borough, and by
                    many medical men at their own houses. These lectures are sometimes advertised in
                    the newspapers, but more commonly made known by the medical booksellers. The
                    terms vary from two to five guineas for the first course, but to those who
                    attend more than one, the rate is subsequently lowered, as well as for an annual
                    or perpetual ticket of admission. These lectures are commonly given in the
                    autumn or the winter.</p>
                <p>The Royal Humane Society may not improperly be noticed in connexion with medical
                    societies. The object is to restore persons apparently drowned. It was founded
                    in 1774, and has a permanent house in Chatham Place. It has been so far of use
                    that more than five thousand persons have been rescued from death, after their
                    lives appeared to have terminated; and by its example forty-five other similar
                    associations have been formed in different parts of the kingdom. The Society
                    offers rewards to persons who, within a certain time after the accident, rescue
                    drowned people from the water, and convey them to places where means for their
                    recovery can be applied, and also gives medals to those who have exerted
                    themselves to save persons from death by water. It has eighteen receiving houses
                    in and about London, the principal of which is in Hyde Park, near the Serpentine
                    River. In them every thing necessary for the resuscitating process is kept in a
                    state of constant readiness, and attendance can be immediately obtained.</p>
                <p>A Veterinary College was established at Camden Town in the year 1791, for
                    promoting the knowledge of farriery, under a president and twenty-four
                    directors. There is a professor, and, upon an average, about thirty pupils. The
                    buildings are extensive, and appropriate lectures are delivered, and dissections
                    performed, whilst an infirmary for horses has been established.</p>
                <p>In looking at the edifices in London dedicated to religious purposes, it is
                    impossible, from their great number, that the great majority can receive any
                    further notice than the bare mention of their names. But the two cathedrals are
                    national objects, to which all look with attention and a degree of veneration
                    that requires a descriptive account, and some others are sufficiently
                    distinguished to claim more notice than being merely named.</p>
                <p>The cathedral church of St Paul’s, the fame of which is only second to that of St
                    Peter’s at Rome, stands on an elevated spot, the best that could have been
                    chosen for its display, above the north bank of the river Thames, on the
                    position where similar ecclesiastical edifices, through a succession of
                    centuries, had been placed</p>
                <p>The best authority we have for the origin of this church, is that of its great
                    restorer Sir Christopher Wren. His opinion that there had been a church on the
                    spot, built by the Christians in the time of the Romans, was confirmed. When he
                    searched for the foundations for his own design, he met with those of the
                    original presbyterium or the semicircular chancel of the old church. They
                    consisted wholly of Kentish ruble-stone, artfully worked, and consolidated with
                    exceedingly hard mortar in the Roman manner, and much excelling the
                    superstructure. He refutes the notion which had prevailed of its having been a
                    temple of Diana.</p>
                <p>The first church is supposed to have been destroyed in the persecution of
                    Diocletian, and to have been rebuilt in the reign of Constantine. This was again
                    demolished by the Pagan Saxons, and restored in 603, by Sebert, a petty prince,
                    ruling under Ethelbert, King of Kent, the first monarch of the Saxon race, who,
                    at the instance of St Augustin, appointed Melitus, the first Bishop of London.
                    Erkenwald, the son of King Ossa, the fourth in succession after Melitus,
                    ornamented the cathedral very highly, and improved its revenues from his own
                    patrimony. For this he was canonized, and his relics, with those of his dress
                    and furniture, were imagined to have virtues sufficient to restore the sick to
                    health.</p>
                <p>When the city was destroyed by fire in 1086, the church was burned, when Bishop
                    Mauritius began to rebuild it, and laid those foundations, which remained till
                    its last destruction by fire in 1666. Though that prelate lived twenty years,
                    and his successor Beauvages enjoyed the see upon equal terms; yet, from the
                    magnitude of the plan, it was still unfinished. Henry I. granted materials,
                    consisting of part of the Palatine tower, exempted ships bringing stone from all
                    tolls, and contributed to the work the tithe of all the venison in his forests
                    in Essex.</p>
                <p>After the death of the latter of these prelates, who had applied the whole
                    revenues of the episcopate to the work, the building was interrupted, and the
                    choir was burned in 1135. When that was restored does not appear; but the
                    consecration did not take place till 1240, or 225 years after the work had been
                    commenced by Mauritius.</p>
                <p>The dimensions of this noble temple, as taken in 1309, were as follow: The length
                    600 feet, the breadth 120, the height of the west part from the floor 102, and
                    of the east part 188 feet. The height of the tower was 260 feet, and <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193208170" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8170-0519"/> !of the spire,
                    which was made of wood, and covered with lead, 274 feet. The whole area occupied
                    by the church was 'a little more than three acres and a-half, being one-third
                    more than the ground covered by the present cathedral. It required enormous
                    funds to defray the expense of erecting such an edifice. The several monarchs
                    who reigned during the long time it was building, resigned their revenues
                    arising from the customs or taxes on the materials, and furnished wood from the
                    royal forests; the prelates also gave up much of their revenues, and, what
                    proved a still greater resource, their payments for indulgences and for
                    commutation of penance. The Pope gave a release from sixty days’ penance, the
                    Archbishop of Cologne a relaxation of forty days, the Archbishop of Canterbury
                    forty days; and each prelate thus excited his flock to contribute liberally.</p>
                <p>The church contained numerous shrines and altars, richly adorned; the high altar
                    especially, which sparkled with gems and gold, was the gift of numerous
                    votaries. John, King of France, when a prisoner, first paid his devotions at the
                    shrine of St Erkenwald, and presented at it four baI sins of gold; and the gifts
                    at the obsequies of princes, fo-! reign and British, were of immense value. On
                    the day of the conversion of the tutelar saint, the charities were prodigious,
                    as well as other expenses. Thus, on one such occasion, by order of Henry HL,
                    fifteen hundred tapers were placed in the church, and fifteen hundred poor
                    persons fed in the church-yard.</p>
                <p>The sanctity of the place did not prevent thieves and profligates of all
                    denominations from assembling within the precincts, and there committing, under
                    favour of the night, murders and every sort of crime. Edward I. gave permission
                    to the dean and canons to inclose the whole within a wall, and to have the gates
                    shut every night, to exclude disorderly people. Within the walls was the
                    bishop’s palace, where several of our sovereigns were lodged, and sometimes the
                    foreign ambassadors, with their retinue, were quartered in it. Before the
                    cathedral, was the famous Paul’s Cross, a pulpit of wood on stone steps, and
                    covered with lead, from which eminent divines were appointed to preach every
                    Sunday. The court, with the mayor and aldermen, and the principal citizens,
                    resorted to the place, and sat in the open air, but the king and his train had
                    covered galleries. It was not only used for preaching, but also for promulgating
                    laws, issuing papal bulls, anathematizing sinners, exposing penitents under
                    censure of the church, and denouncing those who had incurred the displeasure of
                    the crowned heads. Before this cross Jane Shore, the concubine of Edward IV.,
                    was brought, divested of all her splendour, after which she fell a victim to the
                    malice of crook-backed Richard. One of the best uses to which this cross was
                    applied, was perhaps the sermon on the thanksgiving for the victory over the
                    Spanish Armada, in the year 1588, which was preached by command of Queen
                    Elizabeth. The last sermon delivered at the cross, was by Dr John King, Bishop
                    of London, in the year 1620, in the presence of i King James I. and his court,
                    attended by the city dignitaries. The object of it was to collect contributions
                    for the repair of the cathedral. The spire had been set on fire by lightning, in
                    1561, and it was designed by the sums thus collected to restore it. Inigo Jones
                    was called upon to furnish plans; and, in 1633, some slight beginnings were
                    made, not to replace the spire, but to make alterations in the style of the
                    western portico But in this, little progress was made, and the fire of 1666,
                    which destroyed the whole magnificent pile, made way for the exercise of the
                    talent and judgment of Sir Christopher Wren, who planned and completed the
                    existing magnificent fabric.</p>
                <p>That great artist, Sir Christopher Wren, brought to the construction the whole
                    weight of a powerful mind, then in the full vigour of manhood, and every step
                    was thoroughly examined before it was made. The foundation was first to be
                    provided for; and, having found the former remains, he was induced from
                    curiosity to dig deeper, till he came to a layer of hard and close pot earth. He
                    found that, on the north side, it was six feet thick, that it became thinner
                    towards the south, and on the decline of the hill was scarcely four feet. On
                    advancing farther, he met with nothing but loose sand; at length he came to
                    water and sand, mixed with the shells of periwinkles and other sea fish, and, by
                    boring, came at last to the beach, and under that the natural clay, which
                    evinced that the sea had once occupied the space upon which St Paul’s now
                    stands. This sand had been one of those sand-hills so common on the coast of
                    Holland and Flanders, as well as on our own shores. It was the opinion of our
                    great architect, that all the space between Camberwall Hill and the hills of
                    Essex had been a vast bay, but at low water a sandy plain; all which appeared in
                    some remote age to have been embanked, possibly by the Romans, who were much
                    employed in that useful kind of work, <hi rend="italic">paludibus
                    emuniendis.</hi></p>
                <p>The foundation being secured, the next step was to prepare the plan of the
                    intended temple; and in this, as in every part of the subsequent progress,
                    nothing was done that was not preceded by the closest consideration. Sir
                    Christopher made a model in wood of his first conception for rebuilding the
                    church in the Roman style. In it he had an eye to the loss of the Pulpit Cross,
                    and had supplied its place with a magnificent auditory within, for the reception
                    of a large congregation. This was approved of by men of excellent judgment, but
                    laid aside under the notion that it had not a sufficiently temple-like form. A
                    second plan was then made, selected out of the various sketches which he had
                    drawn. On this design Sir Christopher set a high value; but this also was
                    rejected, when the third, which produced the present noble pile, was approved
                    and executed.</p>
                <p>The first stone was laid by Sir Christopher on the 21st of June 1675, and it was
                    completed by him in 1710; but the whole decorations were not finished till 1723.
                    It is remarked as a singular circumstance that the edifice was begun and
                    finished under the same architect, by one Strange, the only master-mason, and
                    during the episcopate of the same prelate, Dr Henry Compton, Bishop of London;
                    whereas the church of St Peter’s, at Rome, was one hundred and thirty-five years
                    in building, during the pontificates of thirteen popes, and carried on by twelve
                    successive architects.</p>
                <p>Having thus compared the time occupied in building these two temples, we may also
                    here compare their respective dimensions. The height of St Peter’s, to the top
                    of the cross, is 437 feet, that of St Paul’s is 340 feet. The length of the
                    former is 729 feet, that of the latter 500. The greatest breadth of St Peter’s
                    is 364, that of St Paul’s 180 feet. Although Sir Christopher Wren was most
                    intimately acquainted with the whole process of planning, and the progress of
                    building St Peter’s, he cannot be charged with having copied from that stately
                    pile. The whole was the conception of the mind of our celebrated countryman, and
                    is thus exclusively, both in the planning and the execution, whatever may be its
                    merits or its defects, of native growth.</p>
                <p>The church is surrounded with an iron balustrade, placed on a dwarf wall; and at
                    the west end is an area in which is the statue of Queen Anne, and at the other
                    extremity, within the same inclosure, are burying-grounds for some of the
                    adjacent parishes. The whole of the church is built of stone brought from the
                    Isle of Portland, in Dorsetshire, and is now very much discoloured by time, and
                    the effects of coal smoke. The principal entrance is under a noble portico
                    facing the west, consisting of twelve Corinthian columns, supporting a portico
                    above it of eight columns, of the composite order. The history of St Paul’s
                    conversion is sculptured on the entablature. On the centre of the pediment<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193208183" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8183-0520"/> is a statue of
                    the patron saint, and at the sides are those of St James, of St Peter, and of
                    the four evangelists. The base or floor of the church is gained by ascending
                    twenty-four steps of black marble, where noble folding doors open into the
                    church. The corners of this front are furnished with two turrets, with each a
                    dome, terminating in a gilded pine-apple. The southern turret contains a
                    powerful clock, and the northern contains a fine peal of bells.</p>
                <p>The north and the south entrances correspond with each other in the style of
                    their architecture, being domes supported by Corinthian columns, with steps to
                    ascend in a semicircular form. The eastern end of the building is of a
                    semicircular shape, richly ornamented with a great variety of fine sculpture.
                    The floor is composed of alternate slabs of black and white marble, and is a
                    level surface to the choir, without any rising, as is commonly the ease in
                    ea-thedrals. The floor of the altar is interspersed with porphyry, but neither
                    in the choir, nor in any part of the decorations, does the interior of the
                    church correspond to the elaborate magnificence of the exterior.</p>
                <p>The entrances from the three doors meet where, (as the whole of the pile is in
                    the form of a cross), the upright part of that figure is intersected by the
                    transverse part, or nearer the east than the west end of the buildings. Over
                    this is the magnificent dome supported by columns of such extent as to give a
                    kind of heavy look to the whole interior, though they are not too large to
                    harmonise with the great weight they support. Few objects strike the beholder
                    more forcibly than this dome, when surveyed from the floor whence it rises. Some
                    of the trophies of victory acquired during the wars in which the country has
                    been engaged, are placed here, as well as at the west end of the cathedral, in
                    honour of the marine and land forces by whom they were gained.</p>
                <p>The dulness which, fifty years ago, appeared to the spectator standing under the
                    dome, when he looked not upwards but around him, has been relieved by the
                    monuments, all executed since that period, to the memory of the eminent men that
                    have disappeared from the theatre of their renown.</p>
                <p>It was not till 1790 that the thought was entertained of filling this part of the
                    cathedral with the memorials of the mighty dead, whether celebrated for their
                    learning, their virtue, their talents, or their bravery. The scheme was no
                    sooner suggested than it was aeted upon, and the first monument was soon
                    afterwards erected to John Howard, the philanthropic visitor and improver of
                    prisons and of hospitals. It was the work of the late Bacon, with an inscription
                    from the pen of Samuel Whitbread, the second member for Bedford of that name.
                    Since that time the events of war have much contributed to increase the number
                    of these honourable and sacred memorials. They must be here noticed, but it
                    would require a long dissertation to describe the characters of the individuals,
                    to whose memory they have been erected, or the merits of the various artists to
                    whom the execution of them was entrusted. The fine monument to Lord Nelson was
                    the work of Flaxman. The following can be briefly noticed only :—Sir William
                    Jones, by Bacon junior; Earl Howe, by Flaxman, and Sir Joshua Reynolds, by the
                    same artist; Captain Hardinge, by Manning; Sir Ralph Abercromby, by Westmacott;
                    Lord Rodney, by C. Rossi; Captain Westcott, by Banks; Sir John Moore, by Baeon;
                    Lord Collingwood, by Westmacott; Captain Duff, by Baeon; Captains Moss and Riou,
                    by C. Rossi; General Dundas, by Baeon junior; Generals Craufurd and Mackinnon,
                    by Baeon junior; Dr Johnson, Marquis Cornwallis, and Lord Heathfield, by Rossi;
                    General Pieton, by Gahagan; General Ponsonby, by Baily; Captains Hutt and
                    Burgess, by Banks; General Bowes and Colonel Cadogan, by Chantrey; Captains
                    Falkner and</p>
                <p>Millar, by Hayman; and Generals Hay and Mackenzie, by Langworth.</p>
                <p>Over the entrance to the choir is a marble slab, with a Latin inscription thus
                    translated: “Beneath lies Christopher Wren, the builder of this church and of
                    this city, who lived upwards of ninety years, more for the benefit of the public
                    than of himself. Reader, if you seek for his monument, look around you.” The cry
                    beneath the cathe dral contains inscriptions to Wren, to Bishop Newton, to the
                    painters Barry and Opie, and to some other individuals; but the chief object of
                    attention is the tomb of Nelson, whose body rests there near to that of his
                    friend Collingwood. Other illustrious persons have been interred there, to whom
                    hitherto no memorials have been erected, nor is it known if any such designs are
                    contemplated, viz. Alexander Wedderburne, first Earl of Roslyn; Sir John
                    Braithwaite, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Benjamin West, Sir Thomas Lawrence, Henry
                    Fuseli, George Dawe, and Sir John Rennie.</p>
                <p>In the choir the cathedral service is daily performed. On Sundays there are two
                    services; and on the first Sunday of each term it has been the custom for the
                    Judges, and the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, to attend in the morning. This part has
                    a fine organ, supported by marble pillars of the Corinthian order. The throne of
                    the bishop, and the seats for the city corporation, are of curiously carved
                    wood. The reading-desk is formed of the extended wings of an eagle of bronze,
                    standing on a pillai·, and surrounded with gilded rails. An early service is
                    performed in a chapel near the north-west corner of the church, which begins at
                    six in the morning in summer, and at seven in the winter. The ecclesiastical
                    officers appertaining to this cathedral, besides the bishop, are the dean, the
                    chancellor, the preeentor, the treasurer, four canons residentiary, twenty-four
                    prebendaries, and one layman, the chancellor of the diocese, which includes the
                    whole of London, of the counties of Middlesex and Essex, and a part of
                    Hertfordshire.</p>
                <p>Within one of the pews a door leads from the floor of the church, by a winding
                    stair-ease of 280 steps, to the circular gallery, at the foot of the interior of
                    the dome, commonly denominated the Whispering Gallery; a name to which it is
                    entitled, by the increased intensity of sound within its limits. This increase
                    is such, that <hi rend="italic">a</hi> whisper may be commuiyeated from a person
                    on one side to another opposite to him in the gallery, though the distance is
                    100 feet, if the voice of one and the ear of the other be directed to the wall.
                    The effect was not designed, nor was it discovered till after the building had
                    been completed. The sound, on shutting the gallery-door, seems like loud
                    thunder. From this spot the paintings in the interior of the dome may be seen to
                    great advantage. They were from the peneil of Sir James Thornhill, and admirably
                    pourtray all the most striking events in the life of St Paul, as narrated in
                    sacred history.</p>
                <p>From this gallery the passage is short to another, which on the outside surrounds
                    the bottom of the dome, and is known by the name of the Stone Gallery, from
                    which, being higher than any of the surrounding buildings, a good view, in clear
                    weather, may be obtained of the whole city and suburbs. F rom this point there
                    is a further ascent of 254 steps in a number of staireases, or rather ladders
                    with rails, to the upper exterior or the golden-gallery. As the way from one to
                    the other passes through, a vacancy left between the interior and the exterior
                    dome, it is dark, and to those who first enter upon it alarming, but the guards
                    against danger are quite sufficient to protect those who ascend. From the height
                    of the golden gallery the view is necessarily more extensive, and comprehends
                    the adjacent country to the hills of Hampstead to the north, and those of Surrey
                    to the south; whilst the course of the river, both up and down, may be
                    distinctly traced. Above this gallery <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208196"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-8196-0521"/>is the hall and cross. These parts had been so
                    affected by their weight, and the length of time they had been exposed to the
                    influence of the weather, that fear was entertained for their safety. In 1822
                    they were taken down, and jreplaced by other ornaments of the same figure and
                    dimensions, but of more appropriate materials, which were Also of less weight.
                    The whole, therefore, is now in a safe fetate. The present, like the old ball,
                    measures six feet in ∣liameter, and is capable, with squeezing, of containing k

                    they Scarcely see more than they would in a covered copper boiler. I Nearly on a
                    level with the whispering gallery, over the ìouth aisle of the nave, is the
                    library, furnished with a colection of books by Bishop Compton; but most remark-
                    ∣ιble on account of the curious floor, consisting of more ∣-han two thousand
                    pieces of oak, curiously laid together, ιnd for a most beautiful geometrical
                    flight of steps.</p>
                <p>The mechanical works in the southern turret, over the kest end of the church, are
                    curious and interesting. The ;reat clock has a pendulum fourteen feet in length,
                    and the freight, whose descent gives motion to the clock, is of one Hundred
                    pounds. The length of the minute-hands of the ∣hals is eight feet, and of that
                    of the hour-hands five feet [live inches. The diameter of the dials is eighteen
                    feet ten Inches, and the length of the figures that indicate the hours wo feet
                    two inches and a half. The loud and clear-sound-ng bell which strikes the hours
                    has been heard and dis-I inguished at two miles distance, and, when the weather
                    is ∙lear, can be distinguished from all others in the metropo-I is. It is about
                    ten feet in diameter, and weighs four tons .nd a half. It is never tolled except
                    on the death of any jnember of the royal family, of the Lord Mayor or Bishop If
                    London, er of the Dean of the Cathedral.</p>
                <p>In the cathedral two meetings are annually held, which íxcite great interest, and
                    usually attract considerable crowds if spectators and auditors. The first is
                    that of the chil- ∣ren of the several parochial charity-schools of the
                    metro-Lolis. These are marched under the care of their teachers, (nd placed in
                    temporary galleries, rising above one another Inder the dome, presenting the
                    gratifying spectacle of from I ight to ten thousand children of both sexes,
                    neatly clothed, ∣ dio are receiving gratuitous instruction. Divine service i;
                    performed, and a sermon by some eminent divine is ’ reached, when the whole of
                    the children join in singing L ’ ιe hundredth psalm to Luther’s noble tune, the
                    effect of *∣γhiclι is uncommonly interesting and beautiful. The day nishes with
                    a collection for the schools and the occasion.</p>
                <p>An annual assemblage held in St Paul’s, is intended to apport the charitable
                    institution for the benefit of the sons fthe clergy. Handel’s grand Dettingen Te
                    Deuni, with one of his most beautiful choruses and appropriate an- ⅛ ιems are
                    performed by a powerful orchestra, supported by he principal gentlemen, both lay
                    and clerical, belonging h) the three choirs of St Paul’s, Westminster Abbey, and
                    he Chapel Royal, who make a point of attending and of ∣erforming gratuitously. A
                    rehearsal precedes the grand Performance; and at both very large sums are
                    obtained as 'pntributions to the benevolent institution.</p>
                <p>i Some of the dimensions of the cathedral have been already stated, and the
                    others are as follow. The breadth lorn north to south, at the transept, is 285
                    feet; the height, ∣ <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> &lt;elusive of the dome, is
                    110 feet; the circuit 2292 feet; lid the ground it covers 2 acres 16 perches and
                    70 feet.</p>
                <p>In the reign of James I. and of Charles I., the body of the i ιthedral was the
                    common resort of the politicians, the newsmongers, and the idlers of the day. It
                    was called <hi rend="italic">Paul’s</hi> I <hi rend="italic">Valk,</hi> and the
                    frequenters known by the name of Paul’s √dkers, as is mentioned in old plays and
                    other books of that i line. The <hi rend="italic">Microcosmographia,</hi>
                    printed in 1626, gives a Microns description applicable to the cathedral, and
                    illus- ’ ative of the manners of London, which is worth inserting here in the
                    quaint phraseology of the period. “It is the land’s epitome, or you may call it
                    the lesser ile of Great Britaine. It is more than this, the whole world’s map,
                    which you may discerne in its perfectest motion, justling, and turning. It is a
                    heap of stones and men, with a vast confusion of languages, and, were not the
                    steeple sanctified, nothing liker Babel. The noise in it is like that of bees, a
                    strange humming or buzze, mixed of walking tongues and feet. .It is a kind of
                    still roare, or loud whisper. It is the great exchange of all discourse, and no
                    business whatsoever but is here stirring and afoot. It is the synod of all pates
                    politicke, jointed and laid together in the most serious posture; and they are
                    not half so busie at the parliament. It is the antickc of tailes to tailes and
                    backes to backes; and for vizards, you need go no further than faces. It is the
                    market for young lecturers, whom you may cheapen here at all rates and sizes. It
                    is the general mint of all famous lies, which are here, like the legends popery
                    first coyn’d and stampt in the church. All invertions are emp-tyed here, and not
                    few pockets. The signe of a temple in it is the thieves sanctuary, which robbe
                    more safely in the croud than a wildernesse, whilst every searcher is a bush to
                    hide them. It is the other expense of the day, after plays, taverne and a
                    baudyhouse; and men have still some oathes left to sweare here. It is the ears
                    brothell, and sa- ‘ tisfies their lust and ytch. The visitants are all men
                    without exceptions; but the principal inhabitants and possessors are stale
                    knights and captains out of service; men of long rapiers and breeches, which
                    after all turne merchants here, and trafficke for newes. Some make it a preface
                    to their dinner, and travell for a stomacke; but thriftier men make it their
                    ordinary, and board here verie cheape. Of all such places it is least haunted
                    with hobgoblins, for if a ghost would walk, move he could not.”</p>
                <p>The ancient history of this magnificent pile is necessarily involved in the
                    common obscurity of remote ages. If any credit can be given to tradition, it
                    stood originally on an island in the Thames, called Thorney Island. But if it
                    was once an island, it must have been by the stream dividing, and one branch of
                    it, above Millbank, running in a direction towards the spot where the Chelsea
                    water-works now stand, from thence by Pimlico into the Park, and then rejoining
                    the other branch somewhere about Scotland Yard. Another tradition places it on
                    the site of an ancient heathen temple dedicated to Apollo. Having barely noticed
                    these reports, we come to a period more within the compass of accurate history.
                    Wedmore, who was a man of great learning, and examined all the extant records,
                    fixes the date of the abbey and buildings between the years 730 and 740. It was
                    in all probability injured if not destroyed by the Danes, for it was rebuilt by
                    King Edgar, at the urgent suggestion of Dunstan, and by him appropriated to the
                    order of the Benedictines, with sufficient endowments for the support of twelve
                    monks.</p>
                <p>In the turbulent times that followed the reign of Edward the Confessor, it was
                    injured by the sacrilegious fury of contending parties, which induced that pious
                    monarch to renovate and improve it. The Norman style of architecture was
                    adopted, as appears from fragments of the building which were recently in
                    existence, and from a few which still remain. Considerable revenues were
                    established for the monks by the king, and the nobles, stimulated by him,
                    contributed largely. During the incumbency of the Abbot Lawrence, about the year
                    1159, many repairs were executed on the out-buildings, and the roof, which had
                    suffered severely, was replaced by a new one, and for the first time covered
                    with lead.</p>
                <p>The whole building was, however, taken down and rebuilt by the same prince. It
                    was begun in 1425, but not finished till fourteen years later, after his
                    decease. An accidental fire destroyed the roof, but by the contributions of <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193208209" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8209-0522"/> the king, of the
                    monks, and of other pious persons, it was repaired, and restored to the beauty
                    and splendour which it still displays. A chapel was added at this time, on the
                    spot where now stands the curious specimen of the Gothic architecture of its
                    age, known by the name of Henry VII.’s Chapel, it having been built in the reign
                    of that prince, who laid the first stone of it on the 24th of January 1502. His
                    design was to preserve it as a burying-place for himself and the other members
                    of the royal family.</p>
                <p>During the long interval between the death of Henry VIII. and the accession of
                    William and Mary, little care was taken to preserve this ancient edifice. It had
                    been somewhat defaced in the civil wars, and generally neglected afterwards; but
                    soon after the Revolution, the parliament voted a considerable sum for the
                    reparation, and Sir Christopher Wren was appointed the architect, to superintend
                    the expenditure. The defective parts were then duly repaired and strengthened,
                    and two new towers were erected, which, by some critics, have been thought not
                    to harmonize with the general structure, which is Gothic, whilst the towers are
                    decorated with Roman ornaments.</p>
                <p>The principal object of attention in the exterior, with the exception of the
                    towers and of Henry VII.’s Chapel, is the magnificent Gothic porticoleading into
                    the north cross, or Solomon’s gate, which has been adorned by a window of modern
                    design, admirably executed.</p>
                <p>In the interior, the Gothic arches separating the nave from the side-aisles are
                    supported by forty-eight pillars of grey marble, and are so disposed that the
                    whole body of the church may be seen on entering the western door, which has a
                    most commanding appearance.</p>
                <p>The choir is of less ancient date than other parts. It is in the Gothic style,
                    and it is divided from the nave by an elegant screen of stone, erected from the
                    designs of Mr Blore. The altar-piece is of ancient workmanship renewed; and the
                    Mosaic pavement in front of it is also very curious, said to have been executed
                    by Richard de Ware, formerly Abbot of Westminster.</p>
                <p>On the northern side of the choir are some monuments which deserve notice,
                    chiefly on account of their antiquity. These are to the memory of Aymer de
                    Valence, Earl of Pembroke, and his countess, and of Edward Crouchback, Earl of
                    Lancaster; and on the south are two, remarkable for the same reason, to Sebert,
                    the original founder of the abbey, and to Anne of Cleves.</p>
                <p>The roof of the lantern, which was destroyed by an accidental fire in 1803, has
                    been rebuilt, butin a style better harmonizing with the rest of the building
                    than the one which preceded it, and is now richly adorned with carving and
                    gilding.</p>
                <p>There are within the structure several chapels, all of which will reward the
                    antiquary for the time occupied in their inspection. Two of them pre-eminently
                    require some description. The chapel of Edward the Confessor is at the east end
                    of the choir, and contains the shrine of that monarch, a piece of workmanship
                    affording a fine specimen of the skill of the age in which it was executed, that
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Henry III. In this are the tombs of Editha, the Queen
                    of Edward, of Henry III., of his son Edward I., and several other royal
                    personages. Here are preserved the iron sword of Edward I., and a part of his
                    shield, and the coronation chairs. The most ancient of these chairs was brought
                    from Scone, in Scotland, with the other regalia of that kingdom, by Edward I. in
                    1297, and has been used at the coronation of all our kings to the present time.
                    The other chair was constructed for the coronation of Mary, the wife of William
                    III. The skreen of this chapel is adorned with several statues, and with various
                    legendary hieroglyphics respecting the Confessor, executed in basso-relievo.</p>
                <p>The chapel of Henry VII. was commenced in 1502, and was executed, according to
                    some, under the direction of</p>
                <p>Sir Reginald Fox, or, according to others, by Bolton, the Prior of St
                    Bartholomew’s. It is built of Yorkshire stone,' and the expense of it is said to
                    have been L.14,000. It is at the eastern part of the abbey, and constructed in
                    the florid Gothic style. The exterior is adorned with fourteen octagonal towers
                    jutting from the building in different angles, and ornamented with exquisite
                    sculpture. A thorough repair of it was executed between the years 1810 and 1822,
                    for which parliament voted the sum of L.42,000.</p>
                <p>The steps by which the ascent to the chapel is gained are of black marble, under
                    a porticowhich is at the entrance, with gates of brass, most curiously laboured.
                    The lofty stone ceiling contains a variety of figures. The stalls for the
                    Knights of the Bath are of wood, now of a deep brown colour, with Gothic
                    canopies beautifully carved, and the seats of the esquires to the knights
                    correspond in their workmanship, and are all ornamented with curious devices.
                    The pavement is of black and white marble. The banners of the knights project
                    over the stalls, and the whole has a most imposing effect. On entering, the tomb
                    of the founder and the brass chapel present themselves, and at the end are the
                    chapels of the Dukes of Richmond and Buckingham of past ages. The windows were
                    formerly of painted glass, and in each pane a white rose, the badge of the royal
                    house of Lancaster. The roof is nearly flat, and is supported on arches between
                    the nave and the side aisles, which are turned upon twelve Gothic pillars,
                    curiously adorned with figures, fruit, and foliage.</p>
                <p>The chapel was destined to the sole purpose of interring the members of the royal
                    family; and the rule has been adhered to so far, that none but those of the
                    blood-royal have found a sepulchre within the vaults beneath it. In the north
                    and south aisles of the chapel are many monuments to royal and noble persons; in
                    the former, that of Edward V., of Queen Elizabeth, of Mary Queen of Scotland,
                    and some others; and in the latter, of Monk Duke of Albemarle, of Margaret
                    Countess of Richmond and Derby, mother of King Henry VII., and many others.</p>
                <p>In both the naves, at the west end, and in Poet’s Corner, are numerous monuments
                    to princes, nobles, statesmen, land and sea warriors, divines, lawyers,
                    philosophers, historians, poets, painters, sculptors, musicians, dramatists, and
                    others, distinguished for their rank, virtue, valour, patriotism, learning, or
                    taste; a list of which, with due notices, however short, would fill a
                    volume.</p>
                <p>Besides the church, many of the ancient appendages of the abbey remain, such as
                    the cloisters, filled with monuments, in a quadrangle, with piazzas around it;
                    the chapter-house, now filled with ancient records, amongst which is a fine copy
                    of Doomsday-book, still in excellent preservation, whose leaves are only allowed
                    to be turned over by silver tongs; the crypt beneath the chapter-house, the roof
                    of which is supported by plain ribs, diverging from a short round hollow pillar,
                    and having walls eighteen feet in thickness; and the residence of the Dean, and
                    of the several ecclesiastics attached to the church, who assist daily in the
                    public service in the choir.</p>
                <p>Not far from the abbey stood the sanctuary, the place of refuge once granted to
                    criminals of certain classes. The church belonging to it is supposed to have
                    been the work of the Confessor. Edward V. was born within the precinct; and here
                    his unhappy mother took refuge with her younger son Richard, to secure him from
                    his cruel uncle. Near to it was the almonry, where charity was dispensed; but it
                    is more remarkable as being the place in which the first printingpress was
                    established in England, by William Caxton, in 1474, and where the first English
                    book was printed, written, according to tradition, by Thomas Milling, then
                    abbot, and entitled “The game and play of the Cheese.”</p>
                <p>The length of the abbey, exclusive of Henry VII.’s chapel, is 416 feet on the
                    outside, and 383 within. The <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208222"

                    the bhurch at the transept is 203 feet, the height of the nave 102 feet, the
                    length of the choir 156 feet, and the breadth 'if it 28 feet.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> The clergymen belonging to this church are the

                    with one of the hospitals, for the cure of ,he diseased, but deserving notice,
                    which may be given to it n this part of the article. The <hi rend="italic"

                    house for Carthusian monks, founded by a Sir Walter Many, a successful officer
                    in the wars with France under Edward HL, ⅛ave to this establishment its
                    existence, and (with a slight hange) its name about the year 1349; it is
                    situated on a )iece of ground which he had purchased for the interment of those
                    who had died of the plague, to which, according o some, fifty thousand, and
                    according to others one hun-lred thousand had fallen victims. Ralph Stratford,
                    Bishop :»f London, bought another piece of ground adjoining, on which he built a
                    chapel, and inclosed a burial-ground called Pardon Church-yard, in which
                    criminals and suicides were Buried.</p>
                <p>The Carthusians regulated these premises till the sup- )ression of monasteries,
                    when there were twenty-four monks &gt;f that rigid order. Though the last prior
                    acknowledged he king’s supremacy, this did not save the institution. l’t vas
                    seized with others, and then granted to persons who old it to Thomas Duke of
                    Norfolk, who again disposed .'»fit to a charitable individual Thomas Sutton.
                    This man, possessed of vast wealth, and devoted to beneficent purposes,
                    converted his purchase into a magnificent hospital, ∣ onsisting of a master, a
                    preacher, a head and second maser, with forty boys, and eighty decayed
                    gentlemen, who had teen soldiers or merchants, besides physician, surgeon, and .
                    egisters. 'Having, in the reign of James I., obtained an; ct of Parliament for
                    the purpose, he endowed the institu-ion with L.20,000 in money and landed
                    estates of the afi-ual value of L.4500.</p>
                <p>I Scarcely any of the ancient conventual buildings are now standing, but the
                    present pile was chiefly erected by the Duke of Norfolk before he had sold it to
                    Sutton. The mapel is a venerable edifice with Gothic windows, in which, n
                    painted glass, are the arms of the founder. The house f flιe master is a curious
                    suite of rooms. The old courtoom is richly decorated with carving and pointing.
                    The . brary, the gift of a Mr Wray, is a fine old collection.</p>
                <p>I This charity is under the government of trustees, who re usually selected from

                    those on the foundation there are many I &lt;ther scholars, who board in houses
                    near it, in which some of he junior teachers superintend their conduct whilst

                <p>I As it is not possible in this work to notice all the nu-ιerous churches in the
                    metropolis, and as a selection of those ιost remarkable must be made, it seems
                    best to begin that flection by some of the sacred edifices in Westminster, here
                    they are generally larger than those in the city, and where the number of them
                    is in a much less proportion to the population than in the eastern division of
                    London.</p>
                <p>The church of <hi rend="italic">St James,</hi> in Piccadilly, was built in the
                    latter part of the reign of Charles II., but was not consecrated till the
                    accession of his brother James. The great extension of London made new churches
                    desirable, and a part of the parish of St Martins-in-the-Fields was separated
                    from it, and attached to this new erection. It was built on a piece of ground
                    where the house of the gay Henry Jermyne, Earl of St Albans, the favoured lover,
                    perhaps the secret husband, of Henrietta Maria, the widow of Charles I. formerly
                    stood. It was built by Sir Christopher Wren, partly of stone, and parly of
                    brick. It is well proportioned, being 85 feet long, 60 broad, and 45 high; and,
                    having deep galleries on both sides and at the end, it is adapted for a large
                    audience. The most remarkable object in the church is a fine font of white
                    marble, the work of Granlin Gibbons. It is supported by the tree of life; the
                    serpent is offering the forbidden fruit to our first parents who stand beneath;
                    on one side is engraved the Baptist baptising our Saviour; on another St Philip
                    baptising the Eunuch; and, on the third, Noah’s dove bringing the olive branch,
                    the symbol of peace to mankind. The chancel above the altar is enriched by some
                    beautiful foliage in wood by the same great artist. The living is a rectory, and
                    the right of presentation to it is vested in the Bishop of London at present;
                    Lord Jermyn had one turn in three, but conveyed it to the episcopate. The pulpit
                    of this church has been occupied by some of the most pious and learned ministers
                    of the established church, who have been successively the rectors.</p>
                <p>Church of <hi rend="italic">St Martins-in-the-Fields.</hi> This building was
                    erected in 1721, on the site of an ancient church, said to have been constructed
                    500 years before. It is remarkable for its magnificent facade, with a porticoof
                    eight Corinthian columns, which is seen to great advantage as the termination of
                    the long street of Pdl-Mall. It is 140 feet in length, 60 in breadth, and 45 in
                    height, being furnished with deep galleries, and with seats in the aisles; it
                    will accommodate 3500 persons. The interior is handsome, and the decorations
                    fine, but at present they need both painting and gilding. The ceiling is
                    elliptical, which is deemed favourable for hearing. Near to it is the
                    vicarage-house, recently built at the sole expense of Dr Richards, the late
                    vicar, in a superior style. The tower is lofty and handsome, and contains a peal
                    of twelve bells. Around it, under the pavement, are some recently constructed
                    catacombs finished in 1830, and the parish has besides a burying-ground at
                    Camden Town.</p>
                <p>Church of <hi rend="italic">St John the Evangelist</hi> at Milbank, Westminster.
                    This is one of the churches built in the reign of Queen Anne, by Sir John
                    Vanbrugh, the successor of Sir Christopher Wren. It is a singular building, too
                    much incumbered with ornaments. On the north and south sides arc portico
                    supported by massive pillars, and at each of the four angles is a stone tower
                    with a pinnacle. The front is an elegant portico supported by Doric columns,
                    which order is continued in pilasters round the building. The interior was much
                    improved in 1825, and it is now lighted with gas. It is 140 feet in length, 90
                    in breadth, and 50 in height, and can accommodate 2500 hearers. Over the altar
                    is a painted window representing our Saviour’s descent from the cross, and the
                    Apostles St John and St Paul.</p>
                <p>Church of <hi rend="italic">St Georges,</hi> Hanover Square. This edifice was
                    erected in 1724, being one of the fifty built under the act passed in the reign
                    of Queen Anne; but the ground on which it stands was presented to the parish by
                    the liberality of General Steward, who bequeathed L.4000 for the purpose. Next
                    to St Martins-in-the-Fields, it is the handsomest church in London. The fine
                    porticoconsists of six Corinthian columns, with an entablature and pediment; <pb

                    a street, it is not seen to the greatest advantage. The steeple is very
                    magnificent. The interior is executed with more expense than taste. The
                    altar-piece, painted by Sir James Thornhill, represents the Last Supper. The
                    church is 100 feet in length, 60 in breadth, and 45 in height, and can
                    accommodate 2500 hearers. This parish has also a church at Pimlico, and a
                    burying-ground near Tyburn turnpike.</p>
                <p>Church of <hi rend="italic">St Margaret.</hi> This building is placed in such a
                    situation as to impede the view of Westminster Abbey, and by contrast with that
                    edifice, to appear less worthy of notice than it would be in another situation.
                    It is the church of the House of Commons, with a pew for the Speaker, and a
                    gallery for members. On this account it has often been repaired at the public
                    expense, and its decorations and ornaments are of great value. On the altar
                    table is a basso-relievo, representing Christ at Emmaus. There is a fine painted
                    window, prepared at Dort in Holland in the reign of Henry VII., representing the
                    crucifixion. The church is 130 feet in length, 65 in breadth, and 45 in height,
                    and accommodates 2000 auditors. In one of the aisles is a tablet to the memory
                    of Sir Walter Raleigh, who was buried there. In the enclosure by the church, a
                    bronze statue to the memory of Mr Canning, by Westmacoc, has been erected.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">St Georges Church,</hi> Bloomsbury, was one of the fifty
                    ordered to be built in the reign of Anne, but it was not finished till 1731,
                    when the statue of George I. was placed on the top of the tower. It was built by
                    Hawksmoor, and, contrary to the general practice, extending from north to south.
                    It has an admired porticoof eight Corinthian columns. In it are some handsome
                    monuments, especially one to the late Charles Grant, constructed at the expense
                    of the East India Company. The church is 110 feet in length, 90 in breadth, and
                    50 in height, and can accommodate 2000 auditors.</p>
                <p>The church of <hi rend="italic">St Mary-le-Strand</hi> was built by Gibbs, under
                    the act of Queen Anne, and completed in 1717∙ It is an elegant pile of
                    architecture, with an entrance at the west end by a flight of steps in a
                    circular form, which leads to a porticoof Ionic columns covered with a dome, and
                    the columns in the same order are continued in pilasters round the whole
                    building, and in the intercolumniations are niches tastefully ornamented. It is
                    70 feet in length, 30 in breadth, and 48 in height, and has a modern painted
                    glass window.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">St Clement Danes Church,</hi> in the Strand, was built in 1680
                    by Sir Christopher Wren. It is built of stone, with two rows of windows, the
                    lower plain, but the upper ornamented; and the termination is by an attic. On
                    the north, as well as on the south side of the front is a porticowith a dome,
                    supported by Ionic columns. The steeple, which is lofty and beautiful, was
                    erected by Gibbs in 1719∙ The church is 96 feet long, 63 broad, and 48 high.
                    Both these churches are inconveniently placed, as the noise, from the constant
                    succession of carriages passing close to them, prevents the distinct hearing of
                    the preacher’s voice.</p>
                <p>The church of <hi rend="italic">St Anne,</hi> Soho, in Dean Street, was built in
                    1685, on account of the great increase of inhabitants in the parish of St
                    Martin’s-in-the-Fields, of which this district then formed a part. It received
                    its name from the Saint, in compliment to the then Princess Anne of Denmark, who
                    afterwards became Queen. It is a brick building, 110 feet long, 60 broad, and 40
                    high, and is rendered singular by a circular tower, surmounted by a large ball,
                    containing a clock with four dials. There is a fine organ, a present from King
                    William III., and two paintings of Moses and Aaron around the tablets on which
                    the decalogue is painted. ∙ At the back of the church is a tablet in remembrance
                    of Theodoric, King of Corsica, who was interred there.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable of the churches in the western part of the metropolis that
                    have been opened within the last eighteen years are the following :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">All Souls Church,</hi> in Langham Place, is a beautiful but
                    singular structure, erected in 1824, from the designs of Mr Nash, and contains
                    space for 1800 persons. The steeple consists of a circular tower, surmounted by
                    a cone. The tower rests on a flight of steps, and the lower part is surrounded
                    by a peristyle of twelve Ionic columns, the capitals of which are profusely
                    ornamented. The base of the cone is also surrounded by a peristyle consisting of
                    fourteen Corinthian columns, supporting an entablature and balustrade. The cone
                    is fluted and carried to a point, without the usual addition of either
                    weathercock or vane. The interior is very pleasing; three sides are occupied by
                    galleries, and the fourth by the altar, which is adorned with a painting by
                    Westall, of Christ crowned with thorns. Above the front of the galleries rises a
                    colonade of Corinthian columns, supporting the ceiling, which is enriched with
                    sunk panels.</p>
                <p>The new church of <hi rend="italic">St Luke's,</hi> Chelsea, which was
                    consecrated on the 28th of October 1824, is one of the most beautiful edifices,
                    in the Gothic style, that has been produced of late years. It is built of brick
                    but faced with stone, and is divided into a nave and aisles. At the east and is
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> large window and splendid altar screen; and at the west
                    end is an organ, built by Nichols. The church is 130 feet long, 61 wide, and 60
                    high, and it accommodates 2000 persons conveniently. It has a handsome tower
                    with pinnacles at each angle, the height to the top of which is 142 feet. In it
                    is an excellent peal of bells. The architect of this work was Mr Savage.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Marylebone New Church,</hi> in the New Road, was originally
                    designed as an additional chapel of ease to the parish; but when the interior
                    had been fitted up and arrangeait was so much admired, that it was thought
                    expedient to make it a parish church. A small stone cupola, which had been
                    erected, was taken down, and the present tower, adorned with representations of
                    the winds, substituted. The front was increased in length; and the porticoof six
                    Corinthian columns, was tastefully attached to the building. The interior is
                    rendered remarkable by a double gallery. The organ is over the altar, and stands
                    at the south end of the church; and a picture, by West, of the nativity, forms
                    the altarpiece. The foundation was laid in July 1813, and the consecration was
                    performed in February 1817. The length of the church is 125 feet, the breadth
                    70, and the height 53. The height of the tower is 154 feet, and the width of the
                    portico20 feet. The builder was Mr Hardwicke. At this church more than three
                    thousand baptisms are annually performed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Christ Church,</hi> in Woburn Square, is an elegant edifice,
                    completed in 1833. It is in the style of the architecture which flourished in
                    this country in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The principal front has
                    a tower, which is united to a spire 150 feet in height. There are five entrance
                    doors in the front, and the same number of windows, with mullions and rich
                    tracery over them. The interior, calculated for 1500 persons, is a square of 70
                    feet each way, and has an height of 48 feet. Four massive pillars form a
                    transept, and support arches; the arms of the transept being equal to the length
                    of the nave, and thus a Greek cross is described. The great east window is
                    enriched with mullions and elaborate tracery, and being 28 feet by 13 becomes an
                    important feature in this elegant church.</p>
                <p>The new church of <hi rend="italic">St Pancras</hi> was consecrated in May 1822.
                    It is built of brick, but faced with Portland stone, and the design of it by Mr
                    Inwood, is in imitation of the Temple of Erecthcus at Athens. The porticois a
                    beautiful object, consisting of six Ionic pillars, beneath which are three
                    doors, the centre of which is an exact representation of the entrance to the
                    Greek temple. At each end of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208248"

                    registry and vestry room, and formed on the model of the Pandro-iseum, which was
                    attached to the Temple of Erectheus. I The steeple, which is 160 feet in height,
                    is also from the Athenian model, being an imitation of the Temple of the <hi
                    rend="subscript"> l</hi> Winds. The interior, which is 170 feet in length, and
                    60 in breadth, is particularly elegant, the windows being composed ∣of
                    ground-glass, with coloured borders; and the galleries 'supported by pillars
                    taken from casts of the Elgin marbles.</p>
                <p>The church of <hi rend="italic">St Giles'-in-the-Fields,</hi> was erected in the
                    year 1730, on a spot where formerly stood an hospital, in the front of which Sir
                    John Oldcastle was burned for his religious opinions in the reign of Henry V. It
                    is a fine building, with a tower at the west end of the Doric and Ionic orders,
                    terminated by a steeple, the clock of which is how illuminated at night. The
                    ceiling is arched, and supported by Ionic pillars. At the north-west corner of
                    the churchyard is a handsome porticocalled the Resurrection Gate, having over it
                    a fine bronze representation of that expected event executed about 1687∙</p>

                    winder the direction of Sir Christopher Wren in 1670. It is 126 feet in length,
                    exclusive of the ambulatory at the west end, is 58 feet in breadth, and 35 in
                    height, and calculated for 2000 auditors. The tower is 140 feet in height, with
                    four modern spires at the angles. The altarpiece, of the Corinthian order, and
                    the roof, supported by twelve Tuscan pillars, produce a very fine effect.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">St Peter’s Church,</hi> Pimlico, is a chaste building of the
                    Ionic order, erected in 1826 from the design of Mr Hakewell. The portico

                <p>The churches in the city, though more numerous than n the other parts of the
                    metropolis, are in general much smaller, and so are the congregations; for in
                    some parishes to many houses have been taken down in order to erect ∣&gt;ublic
                    buildings, and so many of the more substantial trades-ιιen and merchants prefer
                    to live either in the country or it the west end of the town, rather than at
                    their houses of business, that but few in comparison attend the parish churches,
                    whilst those churches in the more fashionable or lnore pleasant parts are in
                    general crowded to excess, especially if the preachers are at all popular.</p>
                <p>I <hi rend="italic">Christ’s Church,</hi> in Newgate. Street, is one of the
                    largest bf the city churches. It was built by Sir Christopher Wren on the site
                    of a former church, which, before the Reformation, had belonged to the
                    Franciscan monks. It s a beautiful structure, but hidden by the houses that
                    surround it. The tower is square and lofty. The pulpit is !uriously carved with
                    representations of the Last Supper, ιnd of the four evangelists. The font is of
                    white marble, domed with <hi rend="italic">alto relievos.</hi> The western

                    with a very Celebrated peal of bells; and was in 1820 improved and trengthened.

                    oldest churches in London, and none more attracted the attention of passengers,
                    owing to its clock, at which appeared two coarsely clad athletic figures with
                    clubs in their hands, who struck a bell to give notice of the hours and quarters
                    of hours. These have been sold to the Marquis of Hertford, with their machinery,
                    to ornament his villa in the Regent’s Park. The sale was made when the church
                    was rebuilt in 1834. It is now a handsome Gothic edifice, but placed thirty feet
                    farther back than before. The southern front is a tower of freestone, square as
                    high as the belfrey, which is lighted by four large windows. Above these windows
                    an octagonal battlement, springing from corbelled heads, surmounts the tower,
                    the four corners of which are ornamented by pinnacles; and thence rises an
                    octagonal lanthorn, each angle having a buttress and fencal, and each front two
                    windows, one above the other; the whole being terminated by a richly-ornamented
                    crown parapet. The entrance doorway is finished with rich tracery, and flanked
                    by two buttresses. The arms of the kingdom and of the city are placed upon each
                    side of it, and four blank shields over it; an iron rail and gate separating the
                    whole from the street. The interior of the church is appropriately finished in a
                    style harmonising with the exterior, and the ornaments are extremely rich. The
                    total height of the tower is 130 feet. The accommodation provided is for about
                    900 persons. The whole well deserves notice, and does great credit to the skill
                    and taste of the architect, Mr John Shaw, who died just as the work was .
                    finished.</p>
                <p>The church of <hi rend="italic">St Saviour,</hi> in the Borough of Southwark,
                    belongs to two parishes, St Margaret’s and St Mary Magdalen. It was formerly a
                    priory, but, from various repairs, little of its original architecture remains.
                    It is, however, a noble fabric, with three aisles running cast and west, and a
                    cross aisle. It measures 270 feet in length, 54 in breadth, and 47 in height;
                    and the breadth of the cross aisle is 109 feet. The tower, which is surmounted
                    by four pinnacles 150 feet high from the ground, is remarkable as the spot from
                    which Hollar took his views of London, both before and after the great fire. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Lodge Chapel,</hi> at the cast end of this magnificent church,
                    and which forms its most interesting part, had undergone some insufficient
                    repairs, and being still dilapidated, it was proposed to pull it down, to avoid
                    the great expense which was deemed necessary to preserve it. This project having
                    been opposed by many of the admirers of our Gothic architecture, a successful
                    appeal was made to the public in order to raise the funds necessary to save it
                    from destruction. The necessary sum having been obtained, the work is now
                    proceeding with great rapidity, every part being made an exact <hi rend="italic"
                    >facsimile</hi> of the original fabric. By an act of Parliament of the . session
                    1833, an additional width was given to the opening in the main street leading
                    from the new bridge, which is now such as to display the whole of the fine
                    church of St Saviour to the greatest advantage.</p>
                <p>The church of <hi rend="italic">St Stephen's,</hi> Walbrook, though but little
                    known, is considered by critics as the best specimen of the taste of Sir
                    Christopher Wren, who built it after the fire, according to a design borrowed
                    from the celebrated Palladio. The plan is original, but chaste and beautiful.
                    The dome, supported by eight arches, springing from eight Corinthian columns, is
                    light and scenic in its effect, and scarcely corresponds with the simple
                    solemnity of our religions worship. Over the altar is a fine picture
                    representing the interment of St Stephen, by West. The church is 75 feet long,
                    36 broad, and the central roof 34 feet high.</p>
                <p>The great number of the churches in London forbid even an enumeration, but it may
                    be confidently affirmed that, varying as they do in age, in style of building,
                    in decorations, and in extent of accommodation, all of them are kept in
                    excellent order, as regards cleanliness, neatness, and warmth.</p>

                    formularies.</p>
                <p>The new churches and chapels which have been built or rebuilt under the direction
                    of the commissioners for building churches, from sums partly raised by voluntary
                    contributions, and partly from the aid supplied from the Parliamentary grant,

                <p>All of these are capacious buildings, capable of accommodating from 1500 to 2200
                    hearers each, and about two-thirds of the sittings are free to all persons. The
                    total number of churches of the established religion in the metropolis,
                    according to the limits here presumed, is 149, and of chapels 88. These 237
                    buildings may, on an average, accommodate about 1200 persons in each; for though
                    a few of the older churches are small, yet the vastly greater capacity of some
                    of the old, like St Martin’s and others, and all the new, and those in
                    Westminster of all ages, more than compensate for the narrow limits of the more
                    ancient edifices. There is thus church accommodation for 255,000 persons.</p>
                <p>Besides these structures destined for the national church, there are numerous
                    buildings appropriated to the various sectaries who prefer other modes of
                    worship, or adopt different professions of faith. As they are varying bodies, it
                    is difficult either to estimate the number of their places of worship, or to
                    classify them with much confidence of accuracy. Though the buildings occupied by
                    dissenting congregations are for the most part neat and commodious, few of them
                    have that imposing exterior which demands attention; and many of them are in
                    courts, or lanes, or narrow streets, or in the outskirts of the metropolis.</p>
                <p>There are two, however, sufficiently distinguished from the rest to merit notice.
                    The Roman Catholic church in Moorfields, a modern structure of great capacity,
                    is a plain building, but ornamented with paintings which produce a fine effect.
                    The altar is adorned with marble columns, and there is a fresco painting of the
                    Crucifixion, on which the light from behind is thrown so as to produce a fine
                    effect. On the ceiling are representations of the Virgin Mary, of the infant
                    Jesus, and of the four Evangelists, surrounded by paintings of the principal
                    events in the life of our Saviour, all executed by Μ. Angelo, an Italian
                    artist.</p>
                <p>The members of the Established Church of Scotland resident in London have lately
                    erected an edifice for the celebration of their form of worship in Regent’s
                    Square, near to Gray’s Inn Lane. The building is in the Gothic style, and may
                    vie with most of those lately built for the English church. It is 100 feet in
                    length, and 63 in breadth, and is capable of containing 1800 persons. It is
                    after a design of Mr Tile, and well executed.</p>
                <p>The number of places of worship, other than those of the Established Church, is
                    207, of which 16 belong to foreign Protestants, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, French,
                    Swiss, or German, and they are both of the Lutheran and of the Calvinist
                    communion. The Roman Catholics occupy seventeen chapels, four of which belong
                    properly to foreign ambassadors. The Jews have six synagogues. The others are
                    used for the public worship of the various descriptions of Protestants. Twelve
                    of these are of the Scottish nation, and presbyterians either of the Established
                    Kirk, or of some of the secessions from it. The Wesleyan Methodists, including
                    the different branches into which the sect is divided, have seventeen chapels.
                    The Whitfield Methodists, or those of Lady Huntingdon’s connexion, possess five
                    chapels. The Quakers, or Friends, occupy six meeting-houses. There are
                    eighty-eight chapels denominated Calvinist, many of which are Independent, and
                    some few Presbyterians, but the most are occupied by congregations collected by
                    some popular preacher, who do not make any specific opinions a centre of union,
                    and have little connexion with each other. There are forty-four meeting-houses
                    of Baptists, comprehending both Arniinians and Calvinists, but the latter are by
                    far the most numerous; in some of these the service is performed in the Welsh
                    language. The Arians and Socinians, calling themselves Unitarians, have eight
                    chapels. There are, besides, small chapels used by Swedenborgians,
                    Sandemamonians, Huntingdoneans, Moravians, and Free-thinking Christians, but not
                    more than one to each sect. As many of these chapels are very small, and only a
                    few of them large, they do not probably upon an average provide room for more
                    than half the number of auditors that can be accommodated in the churches and
                    chapels of the established faith. It is doubtful, if taking one with another,
                    they include more than 500 persons each.</p>
                <p>The religious zeal of the metropolis is not more evinced by the regard paid to
                    the edifices of devotion than it is by the anxiety displayed by numerous
                    societies formed for the promotion of piety and virtue. These are of various
                    descriptions. The distribution of Bibles and other pious writings is the express
                    object of some of these associations. Of these two are pre-eminent by their
                    extent. One of them, called the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge,
                    consists of members of the National Church, and disseminates the sacred
                    Scriptures, the Book of Common Prayer, and other books of practical religion.
                    The other, composed of Christians of all religious denominations, confines its
                    distribution to the Bible alone. It is called the British and Foreign Bible
                    Society, and employs persons to translate the holy books into languages in which
                    they were never seen before, and in conveying them to the countries where they
                    are gratuitously dispersed. Its distribution in this country is very
                    considerable. Both these societies have various branches connected with them,
                    some in London, and others more numerous in the different parts of the kingdom,
                    and these branches, like the parent society, collect money and disseminate pious
                    books. There is an old society called the <hi rend="italic">Society for
                    Promoting Religious Knowledge,</hi> chiefly consisting of Calvinistic
                    dissenters, who distribute their writings amongst the poor. There is likewise a
                    Naval and Military Bible Society, and a Merchant Seamen Bible Society, whose
                    names are significant of their objects. The pious desire to spread the knowledge
                    of Christianity amongst unbelievers in distant countries has given rise to the
                    following missionary societies :—</p>
                <p>Society for Propagating the Gospel in foreign parts, which was established in
                    1701, and receives aid from government.</p>

                    incorporated in 1794.</p>
                <p>Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East in 1800.</p>
                <p>Baptist Missionary Society in 1792.</p>
                <p>London Missionary Society in 1795.</p>
                <p>Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society in 1802.</p>
                <p>Moravian Missions of the United Brethren in 1732.</p>
                <p>London Association in aid of Moravian Missions in 1817.</p>
                <p>Other missionary societies are framed for the purpose of )perating within the
                    United Kingdom, one object of which s attended to by the Society for promoting
                    Christianity ιmongst the Jews, founded in 1808, whose expenditure has ιeen very
                    liberal, and another called the Philo-Judaean, established in 1826.</p>
                <p>Besides these, there are societies for promoting missions it home, and in the
                    neighbouring European countries. They ire the Continental Society, the Christian
                    Union Society, he Irish Evangelical Society, the Hibernian Society, the ßaptist
                    Irish Society, the London Itinerant Society, the Village Itinerary Society,
                    British and Foreign Seamen’s Society, Port of London Society for promoting
                    Religion Lmong Seamen, Port of London and Bethel Union Society, ιnd Episcopal
                    Floating Church Society.</p>
                <p>According to the best accounts which can be obtained, he whole sum annually
                    collected in London for this class if benevolent designs amounts to nearly L.
                    350,000. Much if the money is raised, and many subscriptions procured, ry public
                    meetings, at which exciting speeches are made, lescribing the success of their
                    operations, and pressing on he auditors the necessity or piety of assisting
                    these instituions. Meetings of this description have become so nume-ous, that a
                    large public building has been erected for hold-ng them, called Exeter Hall, in
                    the Strand. It is a fine tructnre, and the interior is very appropriate for the
                    inended purpose.</p>
                <p>London is the source from which the law of England is dispensed over the whole
                    kingdom, and in it originate all he important legal proceedings. On this
                    subject, the Inns if Court, in which legal knowledge is imbibed, and in vhich
                    the initiation of the most respectable branch of practitioners is performed,
                    deserve the first notice. There are bur of these inns, which have the power to
                    call to the bar ’ uch students of their society as have passed the due
                    prepara-ιory period, which occupies five years for all who have not graduated at
                    the universities, and three years for those who *ιave proceeded to the degree of
                    Master of Arts. No examination takes place at their admission. These societies
                    re of a nondescript nature, not being corporations in the ≡gal sense, but yet
                    possessing considerable wealth, and ex-rcising great power, with little or no
                    actual controul, by (leans of a body called the Benchers, which is chosen by
                    ules of their own.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Temple</hi> is situated partly within and partly without he
                    city. It receives its name from the religious military I rder of the Knights
                    Templars. They were originally cru-ι <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> ιders, who,
                    happening to be quartered in places adjacent to the holy temple of Jerusalem, in
                    1118, consecrated them-! elves to the service of religion by deeds of arms. Hugo
                    de ‘aganis and Geoffrey of St Omers established the order, by inding themselves
                    to chastity and obedience, and professI ιg to protect the pilgrims to the Holy
                    Land from all wrong nd robbery on the road. By their devotion, and the fame f
                    their gallant actions, they became very popular in every I art of Europe, and
                    were so enriched by the favour of prin-es and other great men, that, at the time
                    of their dissolu-on, they were found to be possessed of sixteen thousand ch
                    manors. Their riches seem to have been their chief rime, though their wealth
                    enabled them to indulge in ex-pssive luxury. Crimes were imputed to them, and
                    they ere condemned without proof. They founded the Temple in London in the year
                    1185, and continued in possession of it till their suppression in 1310. When
                    they were condemned to penance and dispersion, Edward II. granted their house to
                    Thomas Earl of Lancaster, and on his rebellion to Aymer de Valance, Earl of
                    Pembroke, on whose death it reverted to the crown. It was then given to the
                    Knights of St John of Jerusalem, for their gallant defence of the Island of
                    Rhodes against the Turks. These knights, in the reign of Edward III., granted
                    the Temple to the students of the common law, to whose use it has ever since
                    been applied.</p>
                <p>The church of the Temple is an object of great curiosity. It was erected in 1185,
                    on the model of the church of the holy sepulchre at Jerusalem. The entrance is
                    through a door with a Saxon arch. The form is circular; it is supported by six
                    round arches, each resting on four round pillars, bound together by a fascia. It
                    has undergone a thorough reparation since 1828, and has been recased with stone.
                    It contains many monuments of eminent men connected with the establishment
                    during its existence; amongst others, of the eminent lawyers Plowden, Selden,
                    and Vaughan. A division of the establishment was made into the Inner and Middle
                    Temple, which now form two distinct bodies, having their members, revenues, and
                    regulations separate, but enjoying the church in common. Each of these bodies
                    admits or calls students to the bar; each provides for them tables of three
                    grades for the benchers; the barristers and the students are provided, during
                    term time, at very moderate rates. The whole of the buildings are divided into
                    separate suites of apartments, in which men of all degrees of expenditure find
                    accommodation. The garden of the Temple, formed by embankment on the side of the
                    river, is a pleasant promenade, which has been rendered celebrated by
                    Shakspeare, who makes it the place where the badge of the white and red rose
                    originated, under which the respective partizans of the houses of York and
                    Lancaster were arranged. The chaplainship of the Temple is a valuable and
                    honourable office, and has been filled by some of the greatest divines of the
                    English church. The chaplain is denominated the Master.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lincoln’s Inn</hi> is an old building in Chancery Lane, partly
                    in the liberty of the Rolls, and partly in Westminster. It was originally a
                    Dominican monastery, but, on the monks removing to Blackfriars, the ground was
                    granted to Henry Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, who built upon it an inn, or residence
                    for himself, where he died in the year 1312. From this the present name has been
                    derived. In the reign of Henry VIII., one of the Bishops of Chester granted
                    leases of the buildings to certain students of the law, reserving a lodging for
                    themselves when they came to London. It has a chapel built on massive pillars,
                    with a dry walk under it. The hall is used as a court out of term. The power of
                    calling to the bar, the service of the tables, and other matters, are nearly
                    regulated in the same manner as in the two Temples. The new square and stone
                    buildings contain many good apartments; and there have been other modern
                    erections.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gray’s Inn,</hi> the last of the four establishments from which
                    barristers emanate, is in Holborn. It was the residence of the Lord Greys in
                    1315, and was sold by one of them to Hugh Denys, and then came to the Prior of
                    Sheene, who disposed of it to the students of law. It has its Hall adorned with
                    a curiously carved oak-screen, with portraits of the three kings of the house of
                    Stuart. The chapel is not remarkable; but it has a good and spacious garden, in
                    which new buildings have recently been erected. The regulations for admitting
                    barristers, for the service of the table, and for other matters, differ but
                    little from those of the Temple and Lincoln’s Inn; but the number of
                    professional men, especially of barristers, is much larger in proportion to the
                    establishment, than in the other Inns of Court.</p>
                <p>There are other piles of building in the same vicinity, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193208287" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8287-0528"/>still called inns, which were
                    such probably in former times, and occupied as preparatory schools of law, or by
                    the attorneys and attendants on the courts. These are, Clement’s Inn, with a
                    hall, in which there is a portrait of Judge Hale, and those of some others, and,
                    in the square, a fine statue of a negro, holding in his hand a sun-dial.
                    Thaves’s Inn, in Holborn, has been purchased by the society of Lincoln’s Inn,
                    and is occnpied by private persons. Clifford’s Inn, in Fleet Street, is small
                    and old. Staples Inn, in Holborn, is said to have been formerly the wool-market;
                    in its hall are casts of the twelve Roman Emperors, and some portraits. Lyon’s
                    Inn, in Newcastle Street, was originally an inn with that sign; it is small.
                    Furnival’s Inn, in Holborn, belonged to a noble family of that name, now
                    extinet; it has been lately rebuilt, in a style which makes it an ornament to
                    the street. Barnard’s Inn is also in Holborn, but has nothing to render it
                    remarkable. Symond’s Inn, in Chancery Lane, was formerly used by the Masters in
                    Chancery, before their removal to the public office in Southampton Buildings.
                    New Inn, in Wych Street, is small, and in some way connected with the Middle
                    Temple. There are in all of these separate apartments, reached by common
                    staireases, into which they open. They are let indiscriminately to any tenants,
                    but are chiefly occupied by persons of the different branches of the legal
                    profession. There are two others, called Sergeant’s Inn, one in Chancery Lane,
                    mostly occupied by sergeants-at-law; the other in Fleet Street, with private
                    dwellings, except that the Amicable Insurance Company have their office in
                    it.</p>
                <p>The Courts of Law established in the metropolis are, in number and jurisdiction,
                    conformable to the requisitions that are made on them by the nature and division
                    of the law, and by the business transacted in them. The chief courts are in
                    Westminster Hall. On entering the great or eastern door, the first on the right
                    hand is the King’s Bench; the Common-Pleas Court, the Exchequer, the Bail Court,
                    the Vice-Chaneellor’s and the Chancellor’s follow in succession; and above
                    stairs is the Court of the Master of the Rolls. In a building, once a part of
                    the Exchequer, adjoining, and which, according to tradition, was the Star
                    Chamber, is a court for the new Judges of Bankruptcy.</p>
                <p>During term time these courts are occupied by the respective judges. They are
                    neatly and appropriately fitted up, and tolerably commodious. In the intervals
                    between the terms, the Lord Chaneellor, the Viee Chancellor, and the Master of
                    the Rolls, sit at Lincoln’s Inn; the Chief Baron of the Exchequer in Gray’s Inn;
                    and the Chief Justice of the King’s Bench and of the Comn on Pleas try jury
                    causes at the Guildhall of the city, where appropriate courts are prepared to
                    receive them.</p>
                <p>There are two civil-law courts in Doctors Commons. The first is the
                    ecclesiastical court, which takes eognizance of blasphemy, heresy, divorces,
                    adultery, fornication, simony, incest, and some other crimes; and also regulates
                    the induction to church preferments, the rights of pews, churches, and
                    burial-grounds, the probates of wills, and the granting administration in cases
                    of intestacy. It is the depositary of all wills in the province of Canterbury;
                    and they are so carefully preserved and registered, that reference can be made
                    to any will in a few minutes, and the examiner, for the small fee of a shilling,
                    may read any one in the place. The other court, called the Court of Admiralty,
                    is empowered to decide on all cases of capture of ships, to judge of crimes
                    committed on the high seas, and to determine disputes between sailors and their
                    captains in merchant ships. The Court of Arehes is also held at the same place,
                    and is a court of appeal from the ecclesiastical court. There are two classes of
                    practitioners in these courts, the proctors and the advocates. The former must
                    be admitted by a fiat from the archbishop, before the judges will admit them to
                    practise. The advocates are only such as have taken the degree of doctor of laws
                    in one of the universities. The whole building is somewhat in the style of a
                    college, inclosed with gates, and contains, besides the courts, apartments for
                    the judges and officers, and chambers for the advocates.</p>
                <p>There are some other inferior courts, such as that of the Lord Mayor, of the
                    Sheriffs, several for the recovery of very small debts, called Courts of
                    Request, and the Marshalsea, or Palace Court. To these may be added the
                    Insolvent Debtors’ Court, which has much more practice than any∙of them, being
                    presided over by regular and well-in-structed Judges, whose jurisdiction extends
                    over the whole kingdom. Upon fairly giving up the whole of his effects, and
                    rendering a true account of his debts, the prisoner is by this court released
                    from confinement.</p>
                <p>The principal criminal court is that of the Sessions-house in the Old Bailey, the
                    jurisdiction of which was extended, by a law in 1834, to many parts of Surrey,
                    Kent, and Essex, where it did not reach before. It is nominally presided over by
                    the Lord Mayor and aldermen; but the prisoners are tried by the regular judges,
                    a few by the Recorder, and some by the Common Sergeant. Inferior offences are
                    tried before the justices of the peace for the county of Middlesex, at the
                    Sessions-house at Clerkenwell. Misdemeanors are also tried at Horsemonger Lane,
                    by the justices of Surrey, and at Guildhall by the city authorities. The Lord
                    Mayor sits at the Mansion-house, and an aiderman at Guildhall, to judge in
                    smaller matters, and to inflict punishment correspondent to their guilt on
                    offenders. There are eight offices of stipendiary magistrates beyond the limits
                    of the city, who, like the Lord Mayor and aidermen, have the power to punish, by
                    fine and imprisonment, for disorderly conduct, and for various other offences
                    specified in various acts of parliament. These magistrates, like those of the
                    city, examine into crimes of the highest nature, and, on the charge being made
                    probable, commit them to prison, to be tried at the gaol delivery. At each of
                    these offices three magistrates attend, and they have from eight to twelve
                    constables attached to them, called police-officers, who, besides their pay,
                    make profits from the services of summonses, warrants, searching for offenders,
                    and portions of penalties.</p>
                <p>The prisons in London are appropriated to various purposes, and under different
                    authorities. The first to be noticed is <hi rend="italic">Newgate,</hi> which is
                    under the jurisdiction of the Lord Mayor, aldermen, and sheriffs, and is the
                    common gaol for London and Middlesex. It was burned by the mob in the riots of
                    1780, but speedily rebuilt, as at that time there was little wood in it. It is
                    divided for three classes of culprits; one part for convicts, another for those
                    to be tried and such as have been committed for misdemeanors, and the third
                    divided into two parts, for tried and untried females. The number of prisoners
                    varies from 350 up to 900. There is a chapel within the walls, in which divine
                    service is performed twice every Sunday, and once on three other days of every
                    week. The largest of the prisons is the Middlesex house of correction in
                    Coldbath Fields, which commonly contains about 1200 persons, who are employed in
                    picking oakum. A tread-mill is in operation; and of late silence amongst the
                    prisoners has been enforced, which seems to have produced a very beneficial
                    effect.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Giltspur Street Prison</hi> is near to Newgate. It is a pile of
                    considerable extent, of rustic stone work, but has only apartments for about 200
                    prisoners. These are such as are under examination previous to commitment,
                    besides vagrants or disorderly persons taken up at night. It is sometimes used
                    as a house of correction, and the persons sent to it are employed in various
                    kinds of work. .</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cleìkenwell Prison</hi> is near the house of correction in Spa
                    Fields, and is a common gaol for the county of Middlesex. It receives prisoners

                <p>The institutions of the metropolis for the purposes of the professional education
                    of legal and medical men having been already noticed, it seems proper to advert
                    to those esta- )lishments which are designed to promote and diffuse ‘mowledge in
                    general, whether scientific, historical, or clas-ical.</p>
                <p>The first of these is the <hi rend="italic">Royal Society,</hi> founded in the
                    eign of Charles II., now holding its meetings in apartments )rovided by the
                    crown for that purpose in Somerset House, ts labours and its merits are so well
                    known, that any de-cription or encomium here would be superfluous. It ∣!onsists
                    of a president and a council, composed, with the "ice-presidents, of twenty
                    members, and a numerous body ∣f fellows chosen by ballot. It has a secretary, an
                    assistât secretary, and librarian, and holds weekly meetings on ∣Thursday
                    evening, and one annual meeting on the 30th of November, when the council and
                    officers are chosen.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Royal Society of Antiquaries</hi> was founded in 1751, , nd
                    is also provided with apartments by the public in Somerset House. It is managed
                    by a council of twenty-two I members, chosen annually on the 23d of April, and
                    has ιzeckly meetings on the Thursday evenings. Its researches I ιto the
                    antiquities of this kingdom, and of other countries, • ave been diligent, and
                    have thrown great light upon many <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> istorical
                    subjects and events.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Royal Society of Literature</hi> is of recent origin, aving
                    been founded in 1825. It has published two voi'ιmes of its proceedings, of great
                    curiosity, and has con- ' 'ibuted to the inquiry respecting the Egyptian
                    hicrogly-i hies, by printing several fasciculi of such of them as seem Mi the
                    best preservation. It has a president, ten vice-predents, and a council,
                    annually chosen of fifteen members, i ιcluding the English and foreign
                    secretary, and the trea-I ιrer. Its weekly meetings are on the Thursday morning,

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Royal Institution</hi> in Albemarle Street, was founded ί»
                    1800, chiefly by the exertions of Count Rumford. It I is a good chemical
                    apparatus, which was long employed ’ the best manner by the late Sir Humphry
                    Davy, and, tier his connection with it ceased, lectures continued to be
                    ⅛livered, both on subjects of science and taste, which have ltd much influence
                    on the promotion of knowledge. It us a tolerable library, and the current
                    periodical literature collected for the use of members. The lectures are an-
                    ⅛unced in the journals.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">London Institution,</hi> in Finsbury Cireus, is an
                    es-lblishment of the same kind as that in Albemarle Street. <hi rend="italic"
                    >I</hi> is a handsome erection, and has a most valuable library, well arranged,
                    and lectures are delivered on scientific subjects.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Linnaean Society</hi> was founded in 1802, in Soho Square,
                    it holds its meetings on alternate Thursdays, in the evening, and has been
                    successful in extending the knowledge of botany, both as regards foreign and
                    British plants.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Horticultural Society,</hi> whose objects arc pointed out
                    by its name, was founded in 1808, and has a suite of apartments in Regent
                    Street, where, on alternate Tuesdays, in the season, displays are made of
                    improved specimens of fruits, flowers, and other products of the garden.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Zoological Society</hi> was first established in 1829, and
                    in the few years that have passed, has met with unexampled success and
                    approbation. Its house is in Bruton Street, where a large collection of stuffed
                    animals may be seen; but the most attractive part of this institution is its
                    garden in the Regent’s Park, to be hereafter noticed.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Royal Asiatic Society</hi> was founded in the year 1820, in
                    Grafton Street, and holds its weekly meetings on Saturday, and is occupied with
                    researches into eastern literature.</p>
                <p>These societies are here separately classed, because they are chartered bodies;
                    but there are others without charters which are not less useful or respectable,
                    and equally deserving of notice.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and
                    Commerce,</hi> was first established in the year 1754, and has beneficially
                    applied itself to the purpose which its name announces. It meets in John Street,
                    Adelphi, but has annual exhibitions, in some larger buildings, of improved
                    mechanism, and of other inventions, and of specimens in the fine arts, where
                    prizes of an appropriate nature are distributed to successful competitors.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Russell Institution,</hi> in Great Coram Street; the
                    Western Literary and Scientific Institution in Leicester Square; the city of
                    London Literary and Scientific Institution in Aldersgate Street; the
                    Metropolitan Literary Institution in Chatham Place; the Surrey Institution, in
                    Union Row, Camberwell; the Southwark Literary and Scientific Institution, in
                    Trinity Place, Blackman Street; and the Belgrave Institution, in Sloane Street,
                    have all been established within the last fifteen years. Their objects are the
                    same as those of the Royal and the London Institution, and, as far as their
                    several degrees of pecuniary power extend, they are of use in promoting the
                    spread of knowledge.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Society,</hi> properly described by its name as having for
                    its object <hi rend="italic">the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge,</hi> now forms a
                    prominent part of the means of general instruction. It was first established in
                    1827, in South Square, Gray’s Inn, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208339"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-8339-0532"/>and its progress has been excessively rapid. Its
                    attention is chiefly directed to publishing, in a form so economical, as to
                    bring them within the reach of a vast number of persons, a great variety of
                    works of such a nature, as must tend to improve the minds of those who are
                    anxious to acquire knowledge. By using good but not high priced paper, by
                    stereotyping, and by printing large editions, they are enabled to furnish their
                    books at very low rates. Their Almanac, their Penny Magazine, their Penny
                    Cydopaedia, and numerous other works, are all well and faithfully executed, and
                    every degree of scrutiny is applied to prevent in them the insertion of whatever
                    may tend to weaken the moral or religious principles of the readers.</p>
                <p>Some other societies have been formed on the same, or nearly the same plan; but,
                    though equally commendable in their design and execution, they have not been
                    attended with equal success.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Geological Society,</hi> formed in 1826, has been favoured
                    with a suite of apartments by government, in Somerset House, where its valuable
                    collection of fossil and mineral specimens is rapidly increasing. It meets on
                    the first and third Fridays in each month, when communications are made which
                    must tend to increase the knowledge of this branch of science.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Astronomical Society,</hi> though not of more than twelve
                    years’ existence, has acquired and maintained the highest reputation by its
                    publications. It is composed of the most eminent astronomers of this kingdom,
                    and holds a constant communication with those of other countries. It holds
                    monthly meetings on the second Friday of each month, but its principal labours
                    are performed in the observatories of the several members, of which several have
                    been erected in different parts of the kingdom, chiefly in consequence of the
                    impulse given by the society.</p>
                <p>The Fine Arts have also societies established for their promotion, which may be
                    mentioned here. The <hi rend="italic">Royal Academy of Arts</hi> was established
                    by royal charter in 1768, and has apartments at Somerset House, where they have
                    a good collection of paintings, casts, and statuary, and where, under their
                    direction, an annual exhibition is made of the productions of the pencil and the
                    chisel of British artists.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">British Institution,</hi> in Pall Mall, is an association
                    of amateurs, who obtain the best pictures from their owners, and produce them
                    annually in an exhibition at their house. It was founded in the year 1805. There
                    is besides the Society of Painters in Water Colours, who annually exhibit the
                    productions of its members and others. The powers of the art, in this branch,
                    are very great, and have rapidly increased since the establishment of this
                    society in the year 1804.</p>
                <p>The societies for the cultivation of music are all of recent formation. Those
                    which may be distinguished as public institutions are the Royal Academy of Music
                    in Tenterden Street, founded in 1822; the Royal Harmonic Institution, in Regent
                    Street; the Philharmonic and the Mètropolitan Cambrian Institution. This
                    delightful art is taught in both instrumental and vocal branches, by numerous
                    private professors, and is displayed at the numerous private concerts annually
                    given by eminent performers, in the theatres, and the various assemblages where
                    dancing is combined with it.</p>
                <p>Amongst the most prominent institutions for general instruction, the <hi
                    rend="italic">London University</hi> deserves the first notice. It was commenced
                    by voluntary contributions, begun at a public meeting in July 1825, and
                    commenced some slight operations in the February following, and the first stone
                    of the building was laid on the 30th of April 1827. It was designed upon a plan
                    so extensive, that the pecuniary means to execute it were found insufficient,
                    and the centre only has been finished. It is a beautiful and classical edifice,
                    and. in its present state, is sufficiently ample for the number of students. The
                    whole is well arranged with lecture rooms, apartments for the apparatus of
                    natural philosophy, a spacious library, and an anatomical theatre. It receives
                    pupils in law, in the various branches of medical study, in the general
                    sciences, in classics, and in modern languages. The professors have usually been
                    men eminent in the respective branches they undertake to teach, but the frequent
                    change in them must have been somewhat disadvantageous.</p>
                <p>The number of pupils in 1835 was as follows:—In the medical school 394, of whom
                    sixteen attended to veterinary medicine alone, and of the remainder 132 attended
                    the practice of the hospital. The students in the Faculty of Arts were 141, of
                    whom fifteen attended solely to law. Twenty-five of them attended law and other
                    subjects, and seven of them attended political economy. The numbers in the
                    junior school were 375, thus making a total of 901.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">King’s College</hi> was founded somewhat later than the London
                    University. It has been built by voluntary subscriptions, on a vacant piece of
                    ground on the east side of Somerset House, and has been erected so as, in
                    harmony with that building, to form one of the wings of its front towards the
                    river Thames. It was opened on the 8th of October 1831. The college is
                    patronized by the dignitaries of the church and the more zealous of its lay
                    members, and instruction in the Christian religion, according to the forms and
                    faith of the establishment, forms part of the course of education. In the chapel
                    daily religious worship is performed. In these two respects it differs from the
                    London University. The other subjects of education for which it provides are
                    attended to by professors of great merit, and in this respect it differs but
                    little from the rival institution. The college has attached to it a preparatory
                    school, where the first elements of classical literature are well impressed on
                    the pupils, and where the modern languages are taught.</p>
                <p>The number of pupils, in the beginning of 1835, was as follows :—</p>

                <p>Within the metropolis are several schools for classical literature of the highest
                    kind, besides those of the Charterhouse, and of Christ’s Hospital, for a select
                    number of pupils, which have already been noticed. The most celebrated is St
                    Paul’s School, founded by Dean Collet, in 1509. It is at the eastern end of St
                    Paul’s Churchyard, and has been rebuilt on the same site since the year 1822. It
                    is an elegant building, with a magnificent porticosupported by six columns. It
                    was originally destined to educate 150 boys gratis, but has now more than double
                    that number. The masters are excellent. The school consists of eight forms; in
                    the first the rudiments are taught, and the pupils are advanced to the eighth,
                    from which, with a competent portion of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, they are
                    removed to one of the universities, where they have the benefit of good
                    exhibitions. The Mercers’ Company are the trustees of the institution.</p>
                <p>Merchant Tailors’ School, in Suffolk Lane, Canon Street, was founded by that
                    company in the year 1561. The building was destroyed by the great fire of 1666,
                    and the present house erected on the same spot. It is very spacious, and
                    supported on the east by stone pillars, forming a cloister, within which are
                    apartments for the ushers. Adjoining<pb break="no" facs="nls:193208352"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-8352-0533"/> the school are the library and chapel, and
                    contiguous is a house for the head master.</p>
                <p>In the school about 300 boys are educated, of whom 100 are taught gratis, 50 at
                    2s. 6d. per quarter, and 50 at 5s. Annual examinations are held, and public
                    exercises performed by the scholars, of whom several are sent annually to St
                    John’s College, Oxford, which was principally founded for the use of this
                    school, and where there are no less than forty-six fellowships for those
                    educated in it.</p>
                <p>Besides these classical schools of ancient foundation, many valuable institutions
                    have been recently formed by. a kind of joint-stock proprietors, which afford
                    excellent education. They are in connexion with King’s College, and have similar
                    regulations and methods of teaching with that institution. They are built in
                    good taste, and capable of receiving about 300 boys, and of qualifying them for
                    admission to the universities. Already one has been opened at Pimlico, one at
                    Kensington, one at Islington, one at Hackney; and in several other parts of
                    London they are either built or building. Those boys sent by proprietors are
                    taken at a little lower rate than the others, but the highest charge is
                    moderate.</p>
                <p>i It is impossible to calculate the number of day and of ’boarding· schools for
                    both sexes in and around the metropolis. They are of all degrees of utility, and
                    of all classes, is regards the expense of them.</p>
                <p>∣, Attention to the education of the poor has vastly increased of late years.
                    Half a century ago there were in every part of the city what were called
                    ward-schools, in which a numoer of both sexes were taught reading and writing,
                    and ..he catechism, and uniformly clothed; and in each of the )ut-parishes the
                    same system was followed. These, to the lumber of eight or nine thousand, were
                    accustomed to attend divine service on a fixed day at St Paul’s, where tem-
                    &gt;orary seats under the dome were prepared for them, and .hey presented a most
                    striking and even delightful exhi-oition. Of late years other schools upon what
                    is called ..he national plan have been framed and increased. Inant and day
                    schools have also been established, and instruct great numbers.</p>
                <p>By a report of a committee of the House of Commons, nade in 1833, the following
                    is the result of the inquiry instituted as regards purely charity schools of all
                    kinds :—</p>

                <p>The above are returns from the county of Middlesex, including the city and
                    Westminster; and if the inhabitants of the county beyond the limits of the
                    metropolis be taken as equal to those in the Southwark part of the metropolis,
                    the result will be the same.</p>
                <p>In the amusements of the metropolis the attention is first of all attracted to
                    the theatres. Considering the number of inhabitants and their aggregate wealth,
                    London has fewer of such houses than most of the other capitals of Europe. The
                    most fashionable and splendid is the <hi rend="italic">Opera House,</hi> where
                    the music and the dancing highly delight the visitors. It was burned down in
                    1790, and has since been rebuilt at an enormous expense, from a design of Nash.
                    The interior is arranged with a total disregard of cost. It is nearly the
                    largest theatre in Europe. The stage is sixty feet long, and eighty broad, and
                    the distance between the opposite boxes is forty-six feet. Each box is inclosed
                    with curtains, and those who occupy them sit in chairs. These boxes are either
                    private property or hired for the season. The pit and gallery are open to those
                    who chuse to pay the price. The whole is capable of accommodating 2500
                    spectators, and those who frequent it are either persons of the highest rank or
                    amateurs, or those who are desirous of being thought to belong to one or other
                    of these classes. The prices of admission are high, but do not equal the expense
                    of the establishment, which is involved in debt, and also frequently embroiled
                    with proceedings in the Court of Chancery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Drury Lane Theatre,</hi> in Bridge Street, enjoys, with the
                    theatre in Covent Garden, a kind of monopoly, by patent, as far as regards the
                    mere exhibition of tragedy and comedy. It has been burned down, but was replaced
                    in 1811 by the present large edifice. It is simple, and of the Doric order,
                    having in front a handsome portico surmounted by a statue of Shakspeare, added
                    in 1820. The grand entrance leads through a spacious hall, supported by five
                    Doric columns, to an elegant rotunda, whence staircases ascend to the boxes. The
                    interior of the house presents about three quarters of a circle from the stage,
                    and has a splendid though not a gaudy appearance. It is illuminated by an
                    elegant gas chandelier, which hangs over the centre of the pit. The stage at the
                    opening of the curtain is 43 feet wide and 38 high. The diameter of the pit is
                    53 feet, and the height of the house from the pit floor to the ceiling is 50
                    feet. It is calculated that 3600 persons may be conveniently seated, one-half of
                    which number must be in the boxes. During Lent performances of sacred music are
                    given instead of regular dramas.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Covent Garden Theatre</hi> has its principal front in Bow
                    Street, and much of the rest of the building is hid by houses. It was destroyed
                    by fire in 1808, after which the present edifice was erected on an extensive
                    scale. It is nearly of a square form, and the design was taken from the Temple
                    of Diana in the Acropolis of Athens. The front is ornamented with statues
                    representing comedy and tragedy, and <hi rend="italic">basso-relievos</hi>
                    descriptive of the ancient and modern drama. The interior is elegant, having at
                    the entrance an Ionic staircase, between the columns of which are suspended
                    Grecian lamps. The stage is very spacious, and there are three rows of boxes, an
                    extensive pit, and two galleries, which are calculated to seat 3000 spectators;
                    it is throughout lighted by gas. A superb chandelier over the centre of the pit
                    produces a fine effect. When the house is crowded the admission money received
                    at the doors amounts to about L.900.</p>
                <p>From the complicated nature of the property, both these great theatres, like the
                    Opera House, have been the subject of frequent litigation, and heavy charges
                    have on that account been incurred. The Court of Chancery has seldom been free
                    from dramatic suits. The taste for dramatic performances in this country appears
                    of late to have changed much, and owing to the size of the houses, which are too
                    large for the human voice to be distinctly heard, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193208365" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8365-0534"/>the pieces represented depend
                    more upon splendid exhibitions that strike the eye than upon the elegant
                    language of the authors of dramatic works. The expense of these kinds of
                    exhibitions, and the falling off of spectators, have very much embarrassed the
                    affairs of these great concerns.</p>
                <p>Whilst the two great theatres are closed, that in the Haymarket is allowed to be
                    opened. It was once occupied by the celebrated Foote. The present house, on the
                    same site, was rebuilt in 1821, from the designs of Mr Nash. The front is
                    ornamented with a lofty portico supported by six columns of the Corinthian
                    order, over which are nine circular windows, richly sculptured. It is much
                    smaller than the two regular theatres, but has two ranges of boxes, with a pit
                    and gallery. The prices of admission are lower than at the other houses.
                    Sometimes a company of French actors have performed in it.</p>
                <p>Besides these, which may be called the houses of the regular drama, several
                    theatres have been opened which require to be briefly noticed.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">English Gpera House, or Lyceum,</hi> in the Strand, is
                    newly rebuilt, after being destroyed by a fire in 1830. As its name denotes, the
                    pieces represented are in a great measure musical. In the interior, it is 40
                    feet in diameter, and 37 feet in height, with a handsome saloon 63 feet by
                    24.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Royal Circus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Surrey
                    Theatre,</hi> in Blackfriars Road, was chiefly destined for exhibitions of
                    horsemanship, but has of late produced^ ballets, melo-dramas, and similar
                    performances.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Royal Victoria Theatre,</hi> in Waterloo Bridge Road, built
                    in 1818, is well calculated for dramatic representations, but the performers are
                    not of the highest class. It is sometimes called the Coburg Theatre.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Olympic Theatre</hi> in Wych Street was used for equestrian

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Royal Fitzroy Theatre</hi> in Tottenham Court Street
                    exhibits performances of farces, burlettas, and pantomimes. It was formerly
                    called the Regency Theatre.</p>
                <p>According to some newly-contrived plans, theatres of a still lower description
                    are kept open. These are the Royal Clarence, near Battle Bridge; the Queen’s
                    Theatre, Windmill Street, Haymarket; Dibdin’s Sans Souci Theatre, London Bridge
                    Theatre, and Ducrow⅛ Olympic Circle in Whitechapel.</p>
                <p>In the summer months, the gardens of Vauxhall, on the Surrey side of the new
                    bridge of that name, are an inviting place of amusement. They have been a place
                    of resort for more than a century, and during that whole period have been
                    constantly improving in decoration, as well as advancing in the price paid for
                    admission. These gardens arc extensive, and, when lighted, have a beautiful
                    appearance, from the variegated lamps in the several walks, from different
                    portions of light distributed in the walks, and from the numerous
                    embellishments. In the centre is an orchestra, and opposite to it an elegant
                    pavilion for large parties, whilst in other places are boxes of various sizes,
                    suited to large or small parties, in which refreshments are served.</p>
                <p>Many of these are adorned with paintings. In fine weather the music is performed
                    in the orchestra, but when it is damp the band is assembled in the rotunda,
                    which is a fine apartment, seventy feet in diameter, adorned with some fine
                    historical paintings upon the walls. Parties are formed for dancing in many
                    parts of the premises, and in the few weeks of very warm weather it is a
                    delightful place of recreation. The fire-works are magnificent, and there are
                    many transparencies exhibited. Few objects in London have so striking an effect
                    on foreigners as the sight of these gardens, and hence almost every large city
                    on the continent has in its environs an establishment of a similar kind, all
                    retaining the name which it bears in the country whence the idea was conveyed to
                    them.</p>
                <p>In so vast an assemblage of persons as London presents, where the incomes, the
                    tastes, the education, and the manners arc so various, it is difficult to
                    describe the several sources of amusement that occupy their spare time. Public
                    exhibitions do not seem so congenial to our habits as to the inhabitants of more
                    southern climates; and other sources of relaxation require to be provided.
                    Amongst the male portion of the higher classes, the club-houses are a refuge
                    from ennui; and they have greatly increased of late years, both in numbers and
                    in elegance of building, decoration, and furniture. At all of them newspapers,
                    periodical publications, and the current new works are provided; dinners,
                    breakfasts, and refreshments are prepared; and in most of them, in moderation,
                    but in others to a disgraceful extent, the practice of play is introduced. In
                    these clubs congenial society is to be found, for though some of them are more
                    open than others, yet many are restricted to particular walks of life. Thus the
                    United Service, the Naval, the Military, the University, and others are composed
                    of one description; but as many members of them are also members of other clubs,
                    such as the Athenaeum, the Travellers, the Alfred, the Union, and others, a
                    sufficient variety is found to enable them to keep free from what may be
                    denominated clanship.</p>
                <p>As there are already more than twenty-five of these societies, varying in their
                    regulations in the sum paid at admission, and in the annual subscriptions, it
                    would be useless, as well as tiresome, to describe them. The number of members
                    in each club varies very much, a few having bnt 400, and still fewer 1500. The
                    subscribers to the whole amount at present to about 18,000; but as some
                    subscribe to more than one, and a few to three or four, it may fairly be
                    estimated, that the number of gentlemen, of some consideration and wealth, who
                    find amusement in these elegant houses, cannot be less than 12,000. The sums
                    annually expended in these establishments, when the cost of their erection is
                    included, has been calculated to amount to more than L. 160,000 annually.</p>
                <p>The coffeehouses, which formerly abounded, and then formed a favourite lounge for
                    many persons, have much decreased with the growth of clubs, which have a less
                    promiscuous society, as none who has not some tolerable pretensions can easily
                    become a member. These meetings form a medium between domestic circles and
                    public assemblies, and are in tolerable harmony with the character and
                    disposition which prevail in what is usually termed good English society.</p>
                <p>Another source of amusement has been of late intro &lt; duced, but rather more
                    appropriate to the ladies than to the gentlemen. These arc the bazars,
                    consisting of shops, or rather stalls, for the sale of elegant light fancy
                    articles, either of dress or of domestic ornament, but comprehending a great
                    variety of goods, and, what is of importance, mostly served by respectable
                    females. Some of these display uncommon elegance in their fittings up. The most
                    remarkable of the number arc the Soho Bazar, in the square of that name; the
                    Queen’s Bazar, in Oxford Street; and the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208378"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-8378-0535"/>Pantechnico, in Belgrave Place, which have been
                    the longest open. These have, however, been vastly excelled by a new one in St
                    James’s Street, opened in 1832. It consists of two spacious halls on the ground
                    and first floor, which communicate by a magnificent staircase, decorated with
                    mirrors of a large size. But another in the building, known by the name of the
                    Pantheon in Oxford Street, opened in 1834, is thought to excel the St James’s
                    Bazar. The form of the interior, the adjoining garden, and the decorations, give
                    it a peculiar character, and excite great admiration.</p>
                <p>To these amusements must be added, the indulgence of agreeable walks in St
                    James’s and the Green Parks, whose beauties have been much improved within the
                    last few years, the promenades in Hyde Park or the Regent Park, and the
                    delightful mixture of wood and water to be enjoyed in Kensington Gardens.</p>
                <p>. In a city of such vast extent as the metropolis, there are lmany objects worthy
                    of consideration, which cannot well be grouped under any specific class; and
                    though, to a certain extent, it has been attempted in this article, it becomes
                    convenient to take a survey by making a kind of tour of 'the different parts
                    comprising the whole. In doing this it [seems desirable to begin with the city,
                    and proceed round it from the east, to the north and the west, and end with the
                    south or Surrey side.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Guildhall</hi> of the city of London, being the ter- ‘
                    ruination of King Street, proceeding from Cheapside, is m ancient building of
                    the beginning of the fifteenth century. Before its erection the court-hall of
                    the city was in A1dermanbury, whence it was removed in 1411 to the present
                    edifice. It has a Gothic front, recently put in a good state of repair. The
                    great hall is 153 feet in length, 48 in ’ jreadth, and 55 in height, and from
                    its capaciousness, is capable of containing seven or eight thousand persons. At
                    Tie cast end is a raised platform called the hustings, from ,vhich, at
                    elections, or other public occasions, the speakers address the audience, but
                    can, with difficulty, make themselves heard by those at the lower end. It is
                    also used is a dining apartment on the festival usually called Lord Vĭayor’s
                    Day, held in November. Over one of the windows ire two colossal figures,
                    commonly named Gog and Magog, vhich are supposed to represent a Saxon and an
                    ancient 3riton. This apartment is ornamented by some sculpture, ,n honour of
                    Lord Chatham, by Bacon; in honour of his son William Pitt, by Bubb; and of Lord
                    Nelson, by Smith. There is also a statue to Alderman Beckford by Moore, with ι
                    speech that never was spoken, but written by Horne Tooke. Jver the entrance is
                    the orchestra, and opposite to it the! &gt;assage leading to the chamber in
                    which the Common Coun- :il assemble, and other rooms, which are occupied by the
                    udges of the Court of King’s Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer for the trial of
                    city causes. The Common Coun- :il Room is ornamented with some good pictures and
                    busts if Lord Nelson, the Duke of Wellington, and Granville , Sharp. The
                    Chamberlain’s office is in one part of the build-; ng, and there is within it a
                    library, with a good collection of I looks and papers belonging to the city, and
                    adjoining to it s a museum. Near to it is an apartment for the sitting
                    al-lerman; and on the side is Blackwall Hall, which is now ιsed as the Court of
                    Bankruptcy.</p>
                <p>I The <hi rend="italic">Mansion-House</hi> is the residence of the Lord Mayor ∣f
                    London during his year of office. It is a large stone I ιuilding, erected upon
                    the site of a market called Stocks, be- ∣ween the year 1739 and 1753. No public
                    building has ∣cen the subject of more severe architectural criticism than his.
                    It is, however, in spite of a heavy structure over the &gt;ediment, a
                    magnificent pile, and is also seen to great dis-dvantage by its confined
                    situation; but this evil is now remedied by the removal of some of the houses
                    that hid the iew of it, and by the opening of a more spacious way to it direct
                    from the New London Bridge. The front has a wide and lofty portico composed of
                    six fluted columns of the Corinthian order, with two pilasters on each side.
                    Beneath this portico a flight of steps on both sides leads to the principal
                    entrance. On the left of the entrance-hall is the justice-room, a kind of court
                    of justice, in which the Lord Mayor sits daily in his magisterial capacity. On
                    the principal floor is a magnificent hall, described as the Egyptian Hall,
                    adjoining to which is an elegant and spacious drawing-room. The Egyptian Hall is
                    used for dinner parties, of a more select kind than is usually collected upon
                    the Lord Mayor’s Day at the Guildhall. Easter Monday is the chief festival, when
                    after the dinner a ball is given, in a suitable apartment on the next story
                    above. There are in it good family apartments, and suitable apartments for
                    cooking and for servants.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Merchant Tailord Hall,</hi> belongs to one of the richest of
                    the guilds or companies of the city of London. It stands in Threadneedle Street,
                    on the south side. The hall is one of the largest and best proportioned rooms in
                    the city, and it is chiefly remarkable for the great number of men, the most
                    eminent for rank and talent, who have been members of the company, and whose
                    portraits are here to be seen. This company was founded in the reign of Henry
                    VII., in the year 1480, and is called in the charter the art and mystery of the
                    fraternity of John the Baptist. There have at different times been admitted into
                    it seven kings, one queen, seventeen princes and dukes, two duchesses, one
                    archbishop, thirty-one earls, five countesses, one viscount, twenty-four
                    bishops, sixty-six barons, seven abbots, seven priors, and an innumerable list
                    of esquires. In the present day some of our most illustrious men have been
                    admitted to the fellowship; and the annual festivals are distinguished by the
                    rank, talent, and virtues of those who join in them. The company possesses large
                    estates, the income of which is chiefly devoted to benevolent purposes. They
                    support an hospital for their decayed members, and are the patrons of a school,
                    in which the pupils have been regularly imbued with a degree of classical
                    knowledge. The school is in Suffolk Lane, Cannon Street. It is a fine building,
                    forming a kind of cloister, in which are apartments for the master and three
                    ushers. There are in it about 300 boys, of whom 100 are taught gratis, and 50 at
                    ten shillings a-year. They have valuable exhibitions, and numerous fellowships;
                    at St John’s College, Cambridge, numbers are annually elected, according to the
                    proficiency which they discover at the general examination.</p>
                <p>Many of the other guilds of the city, of which there are no less than ninety-one,
                    called companies, have halls, a few of them very fine buildings, and most of
                    them sufficiently large; but many of the smaller companies being destitute of
                    such accommodations, hold their meetings in taverns.</p>
                <p>The goldsmiths existed as early as the year 1180, and were long the chief bankers
                    of the metropolis. They have now the assaying of all articles made of gold and
                    silver. Their hall has been recently rebuilt upon the site of the former, in
                    Foster Lane. It is an edifice of noble proportions, the centre of which is
                    composed of six Corinthian columns, supporting an entablature surmounted by a
                    rich cornice. The five centre windows have balconies, and over them are the
                    sculptured arms of the company. The furniture and decorations of this new
                    building excite the highest admiration.</p>
                <p>The hall of the drapers, in Throgmorton Street, is a large square building, on
                    the site of the residence of Cromwell Earl of Essex. It has handsome apartments,
                    a good garden, and is adorned with a fine portrait of Lord Nelson, by Beechey,
                    and some others. This company has some large estates in Ireland.</p>

                    from the reign of Edward II. to that of Elizabeth, when an Earl of Abergavenny
                    sold it to the company, which then, as now, was a rich trading body. It was
                    destroyed by the fire of 1666, when the loss in books and other property was
                    estimated at L.200,000. It had long the monopoly of publishing almanacs, and
                    though it has lost the exclusive privilege, continues to print large editions
                    under the name of Francis Moore, by which and other operations, the members are
                    enabled to divide some profit amongst themselves.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mercers' Hall,</hi> in Cheapside, was originally the hospital

                    front is adorned with figures of Faith, Hope, and Charity, and it contains some
                    very fine apartments. It is a rich corporation, with considerable patronage; and
                    in the list of its members more than sixty have been Lord Mayors, amongst the
                    rest Whittington, Sir Richard Gresham, and Sir Thomas Gresham.</p>

                    constructing New London Bridge, a new and elegant one has been erected at the
                    foot of that fine pile. It is executed with much taste from the design of Mr
                    Roberts, presenting an imposing front towards the river, and another towards the
                    street. It has a granite basement and the superstructure is of Portland

                    portraits of Lord Chatham, and of his son William Pitt, who were members of the
                    company. Other halls deserve mention and inspection, but our limits forbid even
                    a short description of them. The best are, Ironmongers’ Hall, in Fenchurch
                    Street; Barbers’ Hall, in Monkwell Street; Salters’ Hall, in a court of Cannon
                    Street; Skinners’ Hall, on Dowgate Hill; Saddlers’ Hall, in Cheapside;
                    Coachmakers’ Hall, in Noble Street; Vintners’ Hall, in Thames Street; and
                    Painters’ Hall, in Trinity Lane.</p>
                <p>That elegant Doric column called the <hi rend="italic">Monument,</hi> on Fish
                    Street Hill, is a splendid specimen of the taste and genius of its architect Sir
                    Christopher Wren. It was constructed to commemorate the great fire of London in
                    1666, which destroyed the chief part of the city, and broke out in Pudding Lane,
                    near to the pillar. It is a fluted column, rising from the ground to the height
                    of 202 feet. It stands on a square pedestal of 40 feet, and the diameter of the
                    shaft is 15 feet. There is a winding marble staircase within it, which gives
                    access to a gallery with an iron balcony, from which is a fine view of the city
                    and the suburbs. The top of the column terminates in a large blazing urn of
                    brass gilded. This work was commenced in 1671, and finished in seven years, at
                    the expense of L. 14,500. It is built wholly of Portland stone, of which it is
                    said 28,500 feet were employed. On the northern face of the pedestal is an
                    inscription in Latin, narrating the circumstances of the fire, and stating, that
                    the destruction occasioned by it was 89 churches, the guildhall, city-gates,
                    many public structures, hospitals, schools, libraries, a great number of stately
                    edifices, and 13,200 dwelling-houses, and that the surface thereby covered with
                    ruins and ashes amounted to 436 acres. The inscription on the northern side is
                    designed to commemorate the merits of King Charles II., in assisting to repair
                    the evil created by the fire, and to raise the city again to more than its
                    former splendour. It states that a tax on coals was imposed to pay the expenses,
                    and that, in three years, that was finished which was supposed to require an
                    age. On the eastern side the inscription merely recites the date of the
                    commencement of the column, its progress, and the date of its completion. The
                    western front has an emblematic carving of the tragical scenes which occurred at
                    the fire, which was ably executed by Cibber, the father of the poet and player
                    of that name. The whole building has been repaired of late years; and the
                    inscription on the base, which Pope described as a lie, attributing the fire to
                    the Roman Catholics, was very properly removed in the year 1830.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sion College,</hi> in London Wall, was originally a nunnery
                    attached to the church of St Aphage, Cripplegate; but its resources having
                    failed, it was at length granted to the master of the Jewel Office, who held it
                    till it was destroyed by the great fire; but a fund for its support having been
                    established by Dr White, in 1623, it was again rebuilt, and a society
                    incorporated, having the supervision of the almshouse, in which ten men and as
                    many women are provided for. In a spacious hall, in which meetings of the London
                    clergy are held, is a large and valuable collection of books, to which access is
                    given with great readiness. The institution has been enriched by donations at
                    various times. The library contains many portraits of eminent divines who have
                    been members of the college, amongst whom are those of Archbishops Secker and
                    Tennison, and Bishops Gibson, Compton, Terrick, and Sherlock. A benevolent
                    society has been formed here for the relief of indigent widows and families of
                    the clergy of London and its vicinity.</p>
                <p>In proceeding upon a tour from the city, we shall take the course which has been
                    pointed out by the law, in constituting the new boroughs around the metropolis,
                    and thus arrive at the Tower Hamlets. In this part, the most prominent objects
                    have already been noticed, being the Docks, the Mint, and the Trinity House. The
                    dwellings in this borough are mostly occupied by the inferior classes of
                    tradesmen, or by handicraftsmen, or by day-labourers; but there is one object,
                    the Tower of London, whose historical relations entitle it to a fuller
                    notice.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tower of London.</hi> The origin of this building is lost in
                    obscurity. It is known, by an examination of boundaries, which took place after
                    the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury, that the walls were built on an ancient
                    foundation, but at what period no evidence could be obtained. The great square
                    tower, called the White Tower, foolishly attributed to Julius Caesar, was
                    certainly built in 1078, under the direction of a great military architect,
                    Gundulph, bishop of Rochester. Fitzstephen gives it the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Arx</hi><hi rend="italic">Palatina,</hi> or the Palatine Tower,
                    and states, most romantically, that the mortar of the foundation was tempered
                    with the blood of beasts. The commander had the title of Palatine bestowed upon
                    him, as was the custom in that age. Within this tower is a very ancient chapel,
                    said by Stowe to be coeval with the building, having a long and dark flight of
                    steps ascending to it. It was used for the devotions of the kings and queens who
                    were residents in the building. In the year 1092, a violent tempest caused much
                    injury to the Tower, which was, however, repaired by William Rufus, and by his
                    successor. The first of those monarchs added another castellated building on the
                    south side, between it and the Thames, which was afterwards called St Thomas’s
                    Tower, beneath which was Traitors’ Gate, through which state prisoners were led
                    from the river, over which was another gate, with a portcullis, called the
                    Bloody Gate, as few that entered ever left it alive, in the early times of our
                    history, when the name was given to it. The Tower was first encompassed with
                    walls by Longchamp, bishop of Ely, who was chancellor of England in the reign of
                    Richard I. He also constructed the ditch, to which water was introduced from the
                    Thames. Different princes afterwards added other works, and thus, in process of
                    time, enclosed a little more than twelve acres of ground, the circuit on the
                    outside of the ditch of which is 1052 feet.</p>
                <p>The borough of Finsbury, which follows next to that of the Tower Hamlets, is very
                    extensive, and filled with inhabitants of a higher class in general; though in
                    some parts <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208404" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8404-0537"/>'re
                    to be found the worst population of the metropolis, finsbury Square is a
                    handsome quadrangular range of build-pgs, surrounding a spacious garden. The
                    houses are lofty, nd well built in the modern style, having been gradually
                    &gt;rected for the most part about forty-five years. Near to <hi
                    rend="superscript"> l</hi> is a spacious piece of ground, belonging to a
                    voluntary Tilitary society, called the London Artillery Company, /here is a good
                    house within the enclosure, where the arms ire deposited. In ancient times it
                    was used for archers p practise in shooting arrows against butts. From this lace
                    Lnnardi sent up the first balloon which had been cx-ibited in London, in 1783.
                    Near this is the chief ceme- ∣cry of the Protestant dissenters, known by the
                    name of punhill Fields. It was first intended for the burial, at the iitie of
                    the plague in 1665, of those for whom room could Lot be made in the churchyards,
                    but afterwards was taken &gt;y a Dr Tindal, by whom it was converted to the
                    present ∣urpose. The remains of the most eminent men amongst he dissenting
                    clergy repose in this crowded ground. Of hese, the most remarkable are Neale,
                    the historian; Watts, he poet and divine; Lardner, the author of the
                    Credibility; 1)r Guise; Dr Price; Dr Kippis; and Dr Rees. It is at-ended by a
                    clergyman of the established church, who per- &gt;nns divine service; or the
                    devotional forms of any of the Lets may be used by their own ministers. Near to
                    this ce-jnetery are the two chapels of the respective sects of the Mer hodists,
                    which may be considered as their mother churches. The one, belonging to the
                    Wesleyans, is called the Foundry; the other, belonging to the followers of
                    Whitfield, is I -ailed the Tabernacle. They have both respectable and numerous
                    auditors, and the preachers are constantly changed, io as to gratify the taste
                    for variety, which is said to be prevalent among both divisions of that
                    religious sect. In [lie parish of Clerkenwell, within this borough, is the
                    prison already noticed, for the county of Middlesex; and not .ιr from it is
                    Hicks’s Hall, the court of justice where cri-liinals for light offences are
                    tried. The old hall having become ruinous, was taken down, and the present
                    building ∣rected in 1780. It is of stone, with a rustic basement, over which are
                    four Ionic pillars, and two pilasters, supporting an architrave, frize, and
                    cornice, with a pediment. ∣The interior is divided into the court, the room for
                    magistrates, for the grand jury, and the hall. In one of the rooms ∣ 5 a
                    portrait of the builder of the old hall, Sir Benjamin licks. Within the borough

                    its limits extend up Holborn, so as to inclose he liberty of the rolls, within
                    which some of them are si-! uated.</p>
                <p>I The borough of Marylebone next comes under consideration. It consists of the
                    three parishes of Paneras, Mary- ⅛bone, and Paddington, with (in 1831) 240,294
                    inhabitants. ∣, The parish of Paneras, now so jo’ned to London as to con-titnte
                    a part of the metropolis, is very extensive. It is <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>
                    ∣ounded by Islington and Hornsey, and, in one direction, y Finchley, in which
                    one-third of Highgate is comprised, )ne of its hamlets is Kentish Town, and two
                    modern towns ailed Somers Town and Camden Town, form a part of it. the whole
                    parish contains an area of 2700 acres. The I ouses are in general of moderate
                    size, and not much occu-I ied by the fashionable part of society. Within its
                    boun-I aries is the fine seat of the Earl of Mansfield, Caen or ∣Cenwood. The
                    great lawyer, the first Lord, lived there, aving purchased it of Lord Bute. The
                    library in this house a very fine apartment, ornamented with paintings by
                    Zuc-hi, and adorned with many valuable busts and portraits, the gardens and
                    woods are very delightful, and have some ne cedars, said to have been planted by
                    the celebrated hief justice. The mother church of Paneras is an ancient gilding,
                    piobably of the fourteenth century; but the adjoining churchyard has long been
                    remarkable for the great number of Roman Catholics that have been interred
                    within it. Most of the tombstones have a cross and the initials R. I. P. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Requiescat</hi><hi rend="italic">in pace)</hi> are observable on
                    many of them. A reason has been given for this preference, which is, that, at a
                    church in the south of France, dedicated to the same saint, masses were said for
                    the souls of the deceased interred at St Paneras in England. As already noticed,
                    a new and magnificent church has been recently built. A chapel of ease has been
                    erected in Camden Town, within the last few years. At Battlebridge is the
                    Small-Pox Hospital, opened in 1767, and recently used for vaccination, in which
                    more than 100,000 persons have been vaccinated. Part of it is now used as a
                    fever-ward for those who have typhus or scarlet fevers.</p>
                <p>Within this part are some fine squares deserving of mention. Brunswick Square is
                    built but on three sides of a quadrangle; the eastern side being occupied by the
                    garden wall of the Foundling Hospital. It consists of about forty comfortable,
                    not very large houses, chiefly occupied by families connected with some branch
                    of the law. It is connected by Bernard’s Street with Russell Square, a much
                    larger quadrangle, with an elegant garden in the centre. Many of the houses are
                    very large, and a few of moderate size, but none small. It contains, on the
                    whole, about sixty-eight houses, filled by most respectable families. The
                    following squares are connected with each other by streets of modern built
                    houses, of competent breadth, well furnished with carriage and foot ways, and
                    kept remarkably clean at all times, viz. Mecklenberg Square, with about
                    forty-seven houses; Bedford Square, with fifty-two; Easton Square, with
                    seventy-two; Woburn Square, with forty-two; Tavistock Square, with fifty-five;
                    Torrington Square, with seventy-one; and Burton Crescent, with forty-three; to
                    which may be added Fitzroy Square, which is not far distant, and has forty
                    houses.</p>
                <p>This part of the metropolis, which, within the memory of many, was wholly open
                    fields, without a house of any kind, is more remarkable for the respectability
                    and comfort of its inhabitants, than for their splendour, taste, or
                    magnificence. They comprise those who live on incomes already accumulated, or
                    drawn from their professions, chiefly that of the law, or that class of traders
                    who can afford to leave the bustle of the city, for the quiet and greater
                    neatness of such residences. It may be estimated, that the expenditure of the
                    families in these squares, and the streets connecting them, range, according to
                    the size of their dwellings, and the extent of their establishments, from L.800
                    to L.2500 per annum.</p>
                <p>There are few public buildings in the part which we are now considering, that
                    deserve especial notice, excepting the churches, to which attention has already
                    been directed, and two objects, which are not indeed within the boundaries of
                    Paneras, but may be appropriately mentioned in this place.</p>
                <p>The first is the Foundling Hospital, forming a side of Brunswick Square, opposite
                    to the end of Lamb’s Conduit Street. This beneficent institution owes its origin
                    ’ to a Captain Coram, who had been master of a vessel trading to the American
                    colonies, and whose continued exertions for many years at length obtained a
                    charter, when he began the building in 1739« The charity is not strictly for
                    foundlings; nor are they, as in many continental cities, admitted spontaneously.
                    The desertion of the father, and the prudent demeanour of the mother, are the
                    best recommendation; but all applications are carefully examined by the
                    governors, and decided on with the greatest judgment and impartiality. There are
                    about 150 boys and the same number of girls in the house, and some of the
                    younger at nurse, making together about 400. They are taken in during their
                    first year, and are provided with education and all necessaries till their
                    dismission from the establishment. On their de <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193208417" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8417-0538"/>parture they are provided
                    with money or necessaries to the value of L. 10; and, in whatever walk of life
                    they enter, they are sure, as long as they, conduct themselves well, to find
                    friends to assist them in the institution. Some of the boys are bound
                    apprentices to the sea, and some to trades. The girls are taught needlework,
                    laundry business, and fitted to become servants, and are generally provided with
                    good places at fourteen years of age. There is a handsome chapel, where divine
                    service is performed twice every Sunday, when a collection is made in aid of the
                    funds, which produces liberally. The whole income is about L. 13,000.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">British Museum</hi> is one of those institutions which
                    reflect honour on the national character. It has been established for nearly a
                    century; the house in which it is deposited having been obtained in 1753. It had
                    belonged to the family of the Dukes of Montague, which name it bore. Sir Robert
                    Cotton had bequeathed to the public his valuable collections earlier, but Sir
                    Hans Sloane, who had made large and valuable collections at the expense of more
                    than L. 50,000, offered them to the public at less than half the money he had
                    expended. The purchase having been completed, the two collections, consisting of
                    various kinds of curiosities in animals, vegetables, fossils, minerals,
                    sculptures, inscriptions, books, manuscripts, and many other objects, were
                    united, and begun to be arranged in the magnificent pile of building still
                    occupied by it, but recently much extended. The building, when first obtained,
                    was situated at the very northern extremity of London, with its back close to
                    fields, which were so solitary, that they were usually selected as the place for
                    deciding what were called affairs of honour. It has now, however, by the
                    extension beyond it of houses of elegant form and of capacious size, become
                    almost a central and very accessible spot.</p>
                <p>On entering the gate from Great Russell Street, a spacious quadrangle presents
                    itself to the eye, with an Ionic colonnade on the south side, and the main
                    building 216 feet long and 57 feet high on the north, the two wings being
                    allotted for the residences of the officers. The architect, Peter Puget, a
                    native of Marseilles, was sent over from Paris by Ralph, first Duke of Montague,
                    solely for the purpose of constructing this splendid mansion. Capacious as this
                    building was deemed at the time, it has been found incompetent to contain and
                    exhibit, properly arranged, the numerous objects which have been added to the
                    original collections. A new edifice has therefore been constructed in the
                    garden, and is now nearly completed from designs by Mr Smirke; it forms a
                    quadrangle 500 feet long and of just proportions, and which will, when
                    completed, be the noblest pile in the metropolis.</p>
                <p>From the limits to which this article is restricted, it is difficult to give even
                    an abridgment of the valuable contents of this Museum, the synopsis of which
                    alone fills near two hundred printed pages, and the descriptions of various
                    departments, with the catalogues, occupy more than twenty quarto volumes. But
                    the progress of the collection, even in an abridged form, is sufficiently
                    interesting to deserve being sketched in this place. After the Cotton and the
                    Sloane collections were obtained, the Harleian library and the noble
                    acquisitions of Sir Simon d’Ewes were added, containing valuable Saxon
                    manuscripts and other documents, with the possessions of Stowe the celebrated
                    antiquarian. In 1767, the trustees were empowered to sell any duplicates of
                    books, medals, or coins, and supplied with the amount to purchase others. In
                    1772, the Parliament voted L. 8410 for purchasing some antiquities brought from
                    Italy, and, in 1804, L. 16,000 for building additional galleries and apartments
                    for Egyptian and other articles; and a curious collection of antiquities from
                    that country was bequeathed by Colonel Lethiculier. The widow of Maddox the
                    historiographer, bequeathed the valuable collectionof manuscripts which had been
                    made by her husband. Major Edwards bequeathed many books and L.7000 to purchase
                    others, when the collections of Dr Birch were purchased; and, about the same
                    time, Mr Da Costa presented many Hebrew manuscripts and several books, and Dr
                    Cracherode a collection of the best Greek and Latin classics. Since that,
                    additions have been made of the Greek coins of Mr R. Payne Knight, and presents
                    of architectural and other casts from the Royal Academy. The valuable mineral
                    collection of the Honourable C. Fulke Greville was purchased by the public, and
                    also the rare classical library of Dr Burney. The Elgin marbles, collected
                    during Lord Elgin’s diplomatic residence in Constantinople, have been purchased
                    for L. 35,000, and casts from them have been made and liberally presented to
                    several public institutions in foreign countries. The Townley marbles have been
                    a valuable addition, as well as the manuscripts of classical and other ancient
                    authors, which belonged to that gentleman. Another addition has been made of a
                    series of newspapers from 1603 to the present time, which form more than 7000
                    volumes; and also a collection of 300 or 400 volumes in quarto, forming
                    materials for the history of the stage, and of actors and authors from the year
                    1600 to the present time. The most considerable accession made to the books was
                    the library of his Majesty George HI, presented to the institution by his son
                    George IV. on his succeeding to the throne. It is highly valuable, as well for
                    the number as for the rarity of the works, but especially of the maps. The whole
                    is preserved in one of the magnificent rooms in the newly erected part of the
                    building. See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Libraries.</hi></p>
                <p>The trustees, who have the management of this invaluable institution, are of
                    three descriptions. The first are official trustees, consisting of the heads of
                    the several departments of the government, of the law, of the church, and the
                    presidents of the Royal Society, of the College of Physicians, of the
                    Antiquarian Society, and of the Royal Academy. The second class, called family
                    trustees, are two representatives of the Cotton family, two of the Harley
                    family, and one each of the family of Townley, of that of Elgin, and that of
                    Knight. The third class are called elected trustees, being chosen by the others,
                    and include twelve names, the most distinguished in the kingdom for rank and
                    talents.</p>
                <p>The Museum is open to the inspection of the public from ten o’clock till four,
                    except on Sundays, and on a few holidays, and during the months of August and
                    September. No other regulation is made but that the visitors shall write their
                    names and addresses in a book prepared for that purpose. A sufficient number of
                    servants attends to preserve the valuables from injury, and to give any
                    necessary information, and no money is allowed to be taken by any of them.
                    Admission to the reading room may be obtained by application, in writing,
                    specifying the name, abode, and profession of the applicant, which the librarian
                    lays before the board at the next meeting, and if it be a person known a
                    temporary ticket is immediately given; others must give a reference, or their
                    application receives no attention. The tickets secure admission for six months,
                    and must then be renewed. In the reading-rooms are convenient tables, furnished
                    with writing materials and catalogues of the books. Any person who wishes to
                    consult any work has only to write its title and his own name, and it is brought
                    to him by the servant to whom the note is given (of whom there are abundance
                    attending), with a dispatch that is not known in any other institution of the
                    kind in Europe. Students who wish to make drawings in the galleries are admitted
                    upon application in the same manner, but must produce a recommendation from a
                    trustee, or from an officer of the institution, or from one of the professors of
                    the Royal Academy. The number of visitors to the Museum, in 1834, was 237,000;
                    the number of those who had tickets of admission to read was 70,200.</p>

                <p>The decorations on the grand staircase and on the ceiling above it are worthy of

                    the new part the dng’s library'is finished in the most chaste and appropriate

                <p>At the beginning of the last century Marybone or Mary-ebone was a small village
                    nearly a mile distant from any &gt;art of the metropolis. In the year 1715a plan
                    was formed or building Cavendish Square, and several other streets on he north
                    side of the Tyburn Road. In the year 1717 or 718 the ground was laid out, and a
                    circle on the centre hen enclosed. The Duke of Chandos then took the whole
                    ιorthern side, intending to build a magnificent mansion, of fliich the two
                    existing houses were to form the wings,, ord Harcourt and Lord Bingley took
                    ground on the east nd west sides, and the remainder was let to builders; but he
                    calamities which were caused by the South Sea bubble .ended to retard the
                    progress of the operations till 1726. ,?he row of houses on the north side of
                    the road to Tyburn Ìas completed in 1729, and the name of Oxford Street given i
                    it, and soon afterwards most of the streets leading to avendish Square and
                    Oxford market were laid out. Mait-ìndsays, that in 1739 there were 577 houses in
                    the parish ∣f Marylebone, and 35 families who kept their coaches; ut there still
                    remained a considerable void between the ew buildings and the village, which
                    consisted of pasture elds. Portman Square was begun about 1764, when the orthern
                    side was built, but it was nearly twenty years beLl&gt;re the whole was
                    finished. In 1770, the continuation of larley Street commenced, and also
                    Mansfield Street, the ítter in a place where there was once a basin of water,
                    ortland Place and the streets near it were built soon after- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ι</hi> ards, and Stafford Place, in 1774, on a piece of
                    ground be-nging to the city, on which the Lord Mayor’s banquetingibuse had
                    formerly stood. Cumberland Place was begun pout the same time. During the war
                    with America the inte of augmentation was very languid. But in 1786 a ∣ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> i</hi> ew start was made, and Manchester Square, which had I
                    ben commenced a few years before, was completed in 1788. Since that time the
                    advance has been much greater ∣ful recently more rapid. The first step was to
                    build over nhat was formerly the manor of Lilestone, but is now called ^!isson
                    Green, to the north-west of the other buildings, "here several streets and some
                    squares were filled with lbuses, which, though upon a small scale, were for the
                    nost ornamental and comfortable. From thence the houses [ere carried on farther
                    in the same direction to what was ∣liown as St John’s Wood, but is now called
                    Portland Town, lbm the title of the noble proprietor of the land. It is in Lis
                    part that the magnificent rail-road from London to Biringham has begun to be
                    formed. Lofty mounds have been &gt;jected over valleys, and deep cuttings have
                    been made l∣rough hills. The present appearance of the work, in lfi36, excites
                    surprise in the beholder, and the completion ∣ it will become a very attractive
                    object.</p>
                <p>I The most striking improvement which has been made in Ä is quarter has been
                    recently accomplished by covering ∣th elegant rows of buildings, villas, and
                    other edifices, a ⅛ιing piece of ground between the New Road and Hamp-IBad. This
                    land had been let on long leases by the crown, pich expired in 1814, when it was
                    planned out for build-ïg by that eminent artist, Mr Nash, and under his direc-
                    ⅞lbn accomplished in a few years. The whole has received ⅛ name of the Regent’s
                    Park. It is nearly a circle of <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi> ∣0 acres, laid
                    out with shrubberies, adorned by a fine piece ⅛ water, and intersected by roads,
                    which are adapted for . ljpmenades, or for carriages. In the enclosures there
                    are “me villas, and the greater part is surrounded with noble ∏nges of
                    buildings. To the south of the New Road is the remarkable pile of Park Crescent,
                    a circular range of thirty elegant houses, in the centre of which Portland Place
                    terminates. Across the New Road the first mass of erections is a neat
                    quadrangular assemblage of twenty-four houses, called Park Square, on the east
                    side of which is the adult orphan institution. To the eastward of this stands
                    the Diorama, an object which has excited great curiosity and exquisite delight.
                    The interior resembles that of a small theatre, the part allotted to spectators
                    being boxes elevated three or four feet above the amphitheatre or pit. Above is
                    a circular ceiling ornamented with transparent devices, and surrounded with
                    medallions of eminent sculptors and painters. The whole is moveable, and is made
                    to revolve with the spectators at intervals of a quarter of an hour, so that as
                    one picture recedes, the other comes gradually into view. The effect produced by
                    the disposition of the building, and by the various modifications of shade and
                    light, renders the optical deception complete, and almost persuades the
                    spectator that he is not contemplating a work of art. This striking production
                    of art and of machinery was first opened in September 1823.</p>
                <p>Near to this is the Colosseum, a name applied in consequence of the vastness of
                    the buildings. It was erected in 1828 by Decimus Burton, and is one of the
                    noblest edifices of the metropolis. It presents a Greek Doric porticoof six
                    columns, and is surmounted by a dome 120 feet in diameter, of which 75 feet are
                    wholly of glass. Its form is that of a polygon with 16 faces, each of 25 feet,
                    and the circumference of the whole building is 400 feet. The height of the walls
                    on the outside is 64 feet, and on the inside 79 feet, whilst the sky-light of
                    the dome is 112 feet from the ground. Beyond the entrance are vestibules, one of
                    which leads to a saloon for the exhibition of works of art, and the other to the
                    various galleries from which the panorama is to be viewed. There is also, in the
                    centre of the building, a curious contrivance, by means of which visitors are
                    raised at once to a level with the panorama, and saved the trouble of ascending
                    the staircase. The panorama of London, which is here exhibited, far surpasses,
                    in extent and accuracy, every thing of the kind that had before been attempted.
                    Some idea of its size may be formed from its occupying 40,000 square feet, or
                    nearly an acre of canvass. The various objects are depicted as seen from the top
                    of St Paul’s, where the original sketches were made, at the time when the ball
                    and cross were being replaced. The gardens surrounding the building are laid out
                    so as to appeal’ much more extensive than they really are. They comprise
                    conservatories. waterfalls, a Swiss cottage, and other interesting objects.</p>
                <p>The next group beyond these public exhibitions is the smallest in the park, named
                    Cambridge Terrace, consisting of ten houses, though the front appears as one
                    building with a centre and two wings having portico of the Roman or Pseudo-Doric
                    order. Chester Terrace follows next, a grand and commanding range of buildings,
                    consisting of forty houses; they are of the Corinthian order, and at each end of
                    the terrace is an arch connecting them with the pavilion-shaped mansions. One of
                    the finest ranges of buildings erected by Mr Nurse is considerably elevated
                    above the road, and separated from it by a garden, round which is a sweep
                    commanding a fine view of the park. It is named Cumberland Terrace, consisting
                    of thirty-three houses, with a front in harmony with the whole. It has a centre
                    and wings connected by two arches. The groundstory is rusticated, and, in the
                    end, in the principal masses of the building, serves as a base for Doric
                    columns, surmounted by a balustrade, on which are placed allegorical figures of
                    the seasons, the arts and sciences, and other subjects. The central portion
                    consists of a splendid colonnade of twelve columns, surmounted by a pediment
                    containing sculpture, which represents Britannia crowned by <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193208443" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8443-0540"/>fame, seated on a throne, at
                    the base of which are figures representing valour and wisdom, and some similar
                    emblematic subjects.</p>
                <p>The next object, to the north, but still on the eastern side, is St Catherine’s
                    Hospital, founded by the queen of that name, the consort of Henry VIII. It was
                    originally built near the Tower, but, upon the erection of the new docks, it
                    was, in 1826, removed to the Regent’s Park. The institution consists of a
                    master, three brethren chaplains, three sisters, and ten poor women, who are
                    maintained by funds provided by that queen, and increased since by other
                    benefactions. The building is in the pointed style of architecture, and consists
                    of two ranges, each forming three houses. In the centre is the collegiate
                    church, elegantly fitted up within, and with a corresponding front, surmounted
                    by two pinnacles. On the opposite side of the road is the house of the master, a
                    handsome building surrounded by two acres of ornamental garden.</p>
                <p>After passing Gloucester Gate, a neat structure, of the Doric order, consisting
                    of four fluted columns, flanked by stone lodges, which leads to the great north
                    road, the next object of attraction is the Zoological Garden. This
                    establishment, consisting of the Gardens and the Menagerie, stands at the
                    north-east corner of the Park. It was founded by a society of men of science in
                    1826, and this spot opened to the public two years after. The Gardens form a
                    most agreeable promenade, and the collection preserved in appropriate <hi
                    rend="superscript"> x</hi> dens, aviaries, and paddocks, is already large and
                    constantly increasing. It is much frequented by visitors, 142,000 persons having
                    been admitted in a year. It has been much enlarged in 1835 and 1836, and the
                    arrival of four giraffes has drawn to it astonishing crowds.</p>
                <p>The Regent’s Canal crosses the park on the northern boundary, and over it is
                    Macclesfield Bridge, a most elegant structure, consisting of three arches,
                    supported by cast-iron pillars of the Doric order. On the next, or northwest
                    side, are some elegant detached villas; that of the Marquis of Hertford is
                    particularly an object of admiration. Hanover Terrace, on the west side,
                    consists of nine teen houses, built by Mr Nash, forming an .apparent continuous
                    building. It consists of a centre and two wings of the Doric order, crowned with
                    pediments surmounted by statues of the muses. In the central pediment is a group
                    of figures in <hi rend="italic">relievo,</hi> representing medicine, chemistry,
                    architecture, sculpture, poetry, peace, justice, agriculture, plenty, music,
                    history, and navigation.</p>
                <p>Opposite this pile is a small gate, opening into the enclosed part, of the park
                    by a footpath, which winds into a serpentine form to a gate opposite to Sussex
                    Place, and terminates at another gate fronting York Terrace. Sussex Place is
                    rather a whimsical range of buildings, composed of twenty-four houses,
                    consisting of a centre flanked by octagonal towers and wings with four similar
                    towers, the whole being disposed in a semicircular form, with a garden in front.
                    The towers arc finished with cupola tops and minarets, which produce a singular
                    effect. Near to Sussex Place is Clarence Terrace, a group of twelve houses,
                    being the smallest in the park. It consists of two wings and a centre, of the
                    Corinthian order, connected by colonnades of the Ionic order. Cornwall Terrace
                    was one of the earliest ranges of building in the park, consisting of twenty-one
                    houses. The basement is rusticated, and the upper part is adorned with fluted
                    columns and pilasters, with well-proportioned capitals. This also is after the
                    design of Decimus Burton. York Terrace is the largest, and one of the most
                    splendid masses of building in the park, containing sixty-one dwelling houses,
                    on a plan designed by Nash. The ground-story presents a range of
                    semicircular-headed windows and rusticated piers, above which is a continued
                    pedestal, divided between the columns into balustrades, in front of the windows
                    of the principal story, to which they form balconies. This terrace appears more
                    like'a single palace than a row of separate dwellings, from all the doors being
                    at the back of the buildings, and from the gardens in the front having no
                    divisions. In the centre of the pile is York Gate, forming, with the two rows of
                    mansions which flank it, a noble entrance to the park. Ulster Terrace,
                    comprising seven houses at the western corner of Park Square, is a plain and
                    simple range, adorned at the basement story with a colonnade of the Ionic
                    order.</p>
                <p>It has appeared desirable to give a more detailed description of the buildings in
                    this part than can be allotted to similar objects in other parts of London,
                    because it is unique in its plan, elegant in its execution, and, as a whole,
                    presents a spectacle unrivalled either in Great Britain or in any of the cities
                    of the continent.</p>
                <p>The handsomest assemblage of houses in this district is Portland Place,
                    terminating towards the north in an elegant circus, open to the Regent’s Park.
                    The houses are lofty, elegant, and regular, but differ somewhat in size, though
                    none of them is small. They may be calculated for families whose expenses amount
                    to from L.3000 to L.6000 per annum. Portland Place is about a furlong or eighth
                    of a mile in length, and 126 feet in breadth, with a proportional breadth of
                    foot pavement. It contains seventy-four large houses. The crescent, in which it
                    terminates, has thirty elegant houses, and in it is a fine bronze statue of the
                    late Duke of Kent, the work of Mr Gahagan, seven feet two inches in height, and
                    weighing two tons.</p>
                <p>Baker Street, which runs nearly parallel to Portland Place, is a fine street,
                    about two-fifths of a mile in length, and containing ninety houses, besides
                    fifty in the continuation of it, called Upper Baker Street. The houses vary much
                    in size, but from the breadth of the street, the whole has a fine appearance.
                    The intermediate streets between Baker Street and Portland Place, consist of
                    neat but small houses, tolerably uniform in appearance, and are let at rents
                    varying from L.80 to L.150 per annum. In Gloucester Place, and Upper Gloucester
                    Place, to the west of Baker Street, are good assemblages of uniform houses,
                    containing together 140 mansions, occupied by respectable families.</p>
                <p>In this district are some of those fine squares which are the peculiar ornament
                    of London, and are not to be seen in equal extent or elegance of building in any
                    of the cities of the continent. Cavendish Square, the oldest of them, is adorned
                    by a statue of William Duke of Cumberland. It contains several magnificent
                    mansions, and a few of inferior extent. The total number of houses is
                    thirty-seven, ln the centre is a garden surrounded with iron palisades. Portman
                    Square, with numerous streets around it, is built upon the estate of the
                    Dorsetshire gentleman whose name it bears, and the value of it will be
                    prodigious, when the present leases of the houses shall expire. The square
                    contains forty first-rate houses, with a neat garden, of an oval shape, in the
                    centre. Manchester Square, though of smaller extent than the others, and with
                    houses of not quite so expensive a rate, is well built and neat. The north side
                    is nearly occupied with the magnificent mansion of the Spanish Embassy, and near
                    it is a handsome Roman Catholic chapel, very fully attended. It contains,
                    besides the Spanish house, twenty-six others. Grosvenor Square is one of the
                    oldest and most distinguished of the metropolis, as well for the size and the
                    architecture of the houses, as for the number of the highest ranks of the
                    nobility who reside in it, and the taste displayed in laying out the garden and
                    shrubbery in its centre. It was built in 1726, by Sir R. Grosvenor. It contains
                    six acres of land, and forty-four magnificent houses. In the centre is a gilt
                    equestrian statue of King George I., executed by Van Nost.</p>
                <p>The village of Paddington was about one mile from Tyburn, but by the great
                    increase of houses of late years, it is <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208456"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-8456-0541"/>aow an undistinguishable portion of London. It,
                    however, pxtends to the westward, and includes within its parochial boundaries
                    the hamlet of Bays Water, and the part called Craven Hill. The parish was in
                    ancient times a portion of he estate of the Abbot of Westminster, and the
                    present church was then a chapel of ease to the church of St Margaret’s,
                    Westminster. The parish church in the "entre of the green was consecrated
                    in’1791. It is a handsome building upon a Grecian model, with a porticoof the
                    Doric order, and towards the south end a cupola on the top.</p>
                <p>&gt; The general increase of inhabitants in this parish from J 800 to upwards of
                    15,000, has been in a great measure .nving∣o the completion of the Grand
                    Junction Canal, the company having constructed a capacious basin with wharfs ιnd
                    warehouses, in which a vast deal of business is transacted. The situation is
                    very favourable to the extension of ∣good houses, and accordingly many of those
                    have been erected within the few last years in the different squares, ltreets,
                    and places which have been constructed. Bryan-l&gt;tone, Dorset, and Montague
                    squares are neat assemblages U houses, letting from L.160 to L.260 per annum.
                    Cumberland Street, and others near it, present very elegant puddings, as do
                    Connaught Terrace and Place, looking into Iyde Park. One portion is filled with
                    villas, upon a small <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> cale, in gardens known as
                    Alpha Cottages, whilst beyond I hem, in what was called St John’s Wood, and now
                    destined o bear the name of Portland Town, new streets are laid put, which will
                    probably, in a few years, be filled with hand- 1 oine houses, and with numerous
                    inhabitants.</p>
                <p>i The Clergy’s Orphan School is now established in St John’s, Wood-road. It is an
                    old institution, established in * 749, but of late greatly increased, and
                    incorporated in I 809, for the clothing, maintaining, and educating the orI han
                    children of the clergy of the Established Church. A ,ine building has been
                    erected, which is an ornament to he spot, and the institution is well and
                    economically conducted.</p>
                <p>I One of the most striking objects in this new part of the Lnetropolis is the
                    Roman Catholic Church, newly erected I ιpon a spot said to have been formerly
                    occupied by the Knights of St John of Jerusalem. It has been built and índowed
                    with funds for its maintenance by two pious sisters of the name of Galini. It is
                    built in the style of the Jointed architecture of the thirteenth century. The
                    front H deemed one of the best modern adaptations of the materials furnished by
                    our ancient ecclesiastical architecture hat London presents; and, whilst the
                    style is strictly adhered to, the composition is original, though the materials
                    (I re taken from existing examples. The length of the church .ithin the nave is
                    110 feet, that of the aisles 99 feet; the readth of the body of the church is 44
                    feet, and the height ∣'4 feet.</p>
                <p>The basin of the Grand Junction Canal, the new market Lrmed near it, and the
                    large warehouses, have brought a I rcat degree of trade to this quarter; whilst
                    the Regent’s <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> anal, which communicates with it,
                    renders the convey- ¶ nce of coal and other heavy substances cheaper than for-
                    ,. ιerly.</p>
                <p>One part of Paddington approaches near to the Royal hardens and the Palace of
                    Kensington. Kensington Palace, ∣ ,b called from its vicinity to the village of
                    that name, stands Il ∙i thin the parish of St Margaret’s, Westminster. It was B
                    riginally built by Sir Heneage Finch, afterwards Earl of Nottingham, and Lord
                    Chancellor. His son, the second I iarl, sold it to King William III. soon after
                    his accession i 1.1 the throne. ’ This palace has been successively inhabit-ĭ d
                    and improved by Queen Anne, and the two first Georges I f the present dynasty.
                    King William, Queen Anne, her ∣∣onsort George Prince of Denmark, and George II.
                    here !xpired. During the first part of the reign of George III. none of the
                    royal family made it their residence; but of later apartments have been assigned
                    in it to the Duke of Sussex, who still occupies them, and since that time,
                    another considerable part has been, and still is, occupied by the Duchess of
                    Kent and her daughter the Princess Victoria, heiress-presumptive to the throne.
                    The palace is a large irregular edifice, built at various times of red brick.
                    The principal entrance is on the west side, and leads to some elegant and
                    spacious apartments, one of which, called the cube-room, is 37 feet square.
                    There are two fine galleries, one called the King’s, 94 feet by 21; and the
                    other called the Queen’s, 84 feet by 21. The palace contains some pictures by
                    the old masters, and many portraits. The great staircase, and the several
                    ceilings, painted by the artist Kant, are much admired. The charm of this palace
                    consists in the gardens in which it is placed, and which form a most refreshing
                    resource to the inhabitants of London. They are more than three miles in
                    circuit, and have, in addition to pure air, that variety of lawn, shade, and
                    water, which make them a most delightful promenade; in summer a band of good
                    music plays, and it is altogether one of the most agreeable, as well as most
                    frequented, promenades in the vicinity of the metropolis.</p>
                <p>In the way from this to London, but a little to the south, is the large and
                    populous village of Chelsea. Chelsea College was originally built in the reign
                    of King James I., and was intended to be maintained as a polemical school of
                    divinity. It was incorporated for that purpose in 1610, and consisted of a
                    provost and twenty fellows, of whom eighteen were required to be in holy orders,
                    and the other two, who might be either laymen or divines, were to be employed in
                    writing annals of the times. Dr Sutcliffe was the first provost, and Camden and
                    Haywood the first historians. Sutcliffe, who had counted upon voluntary
                    supplies, and also on the effect of the king’s letter, was to a great extent
                    disappointed, and having proceeded far in the undertaking, was reduced to ruin.
                    In consequence of a chancery suit the unfinished building fell to the crown, and
                    in the civil war to ruins. After the Restoration, Charles II., in 1669, granted
                    the site and the ruins to the Royal Society, at that time incorporated; but,
                    having no funds to build with, it was again sold to the crown in 1682 for
                    L.1300. It was then determined to erect an hospital for the reception and
                    maintenance of maimed and superannuated soldiers. Sir Christopher Wren was the
                    architect, and the work was completed in the year 1690, at the cost of L.
                    150,000. Many of the nobility and clergy contributed largely, and donations have
                    ever since been continually flowing in from various quarters. It is a fine
                    building, with a front of 790 feet, and the gardens and ground are forty acres
                    in extent. It is three sides of ajjuadrangle, in the centre of which is a bronze
                    statue of the king who founded it. The east and west sides are occupied by the
                    pensioners, who amount to upwards of 400 men, and are well clothed, lodged, and
                    fed. The centre is on one side occupied by the chapel, and on the other by the
                    halls; the former has a fine altar-piece, and the latter an historical painting
                    by Sterrio, and also Ward’s picture of the Battle of Waterloo. The governor has
                    a spacious house with a state-room, containing portraits of Charles I. and II.,
                    of William III. and his consort, and of George II. and George III. Adjoining to
                    it is an appropriate infirmary for the diseased.</p>
                <p>Near to the hospital is the Royal Military Asylum, an institution for the
                    maintenance of the orphan children of soldiers. It is an extensive and handsome
                    building, forming three sides of a quadrangle. The principal part, which is on
                    the west side, has a noble porticoof four Doric pillars, supporting a pediment
                    with the imperial arms. The centre consists of dining and school-rooms, and a
                    dormitory. On the top is the telegraph, which communicates between the Admiralty
                    and Portsmouth and Plymouth. This establishment<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193208469" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8469-0542"/> at one time was a refuge for
                    700 boys and 300 girls, but has of late, from economical motives, been much
                    reduced.</p>
                <p>The new church at Chelsea, dedicated to St Luke, has already been noticed; and
                    the old church of St Luke is now by law made a chapel of ease to the new
                    building. In it, and the burial-ground surrounding it, there are many old and
                    curious monuments to distinguished persons who have been interred there. This
                    large parish, containing 35,000 inhabitants, has, by act of parliament, been
                    divided into Upper and Lower Chelsea, as far as regards ecclesiastical matters,
                    and a new church for the former has been erected in Sloane Street. It is a neat
                    building, with two spires, and is capable of accommodating 1200 persons. It is
                    dedicated to the Holy Trinity.</p>
                <p>A small brook, now covered with an archway, divides Chelsea from the city of
                    Westminster. A part of the parish of St George’s, Hanover Square, is the first
                    place which is entered on that side. A few years ago it was a large piece of
                    swampy land belonging to Lord Grosvenor, since created Marquis of Westminster.
                    It has been recently built upon, and already exhibits by far the best squares
                    and streets of the metropolis, whilst engagements are entered into, and
                    proceeding towards completion, which will in a few years render this a most
                    striking mass of splendid houses.</p>
                <p>Belgrave Square is completed, and is the most admired part of the undertaking. It
                    is 684 feet long, and 617 wide; each of the fronts inward are uniform, and is
                    adorned with columns of the Corinthian order. The centre houses are very
                    magnificent; those on both sides of them are similar, but not so large, and all
                    are finished in the most elegant manner. The latter have been sold for about L.
                    10,000 or L. 12,000 each, when finished. Eaton Square, which is not yet
                    completed on the south side, will form a parallelogram of 1637 feet by 371, with
                    elegant gardens in the centre, and the beautiful porticoof the new church of St
                    Peter at the end. The streets leading from Belgrave Square, or near to it, are
                    all new, and the houses are elegantly constructed. Wilton Crescent and Street
                    have a tasteful appearance, and near them a new square is about to be built, to
                    be called Lownd’s Square, connected with Knightsbridge. On the south, between
                    Eaton Square and the Thames, it is proposed to construct a new pile of
                    buildings, to be called Chester Square. The whole of this district has been much
                    favoured by a new access to that part of Westminster, where the two Houses of
                    Parliament and the courts of law are situated, through the Birdcage Walk in St
                    James’s Park.</p>
                <p>One of the most prominent objects in this district is the King’s Palace in St
                    James’s Park, heretofore distinguished by the name of Buckingham House, from the
                    noble proprietor John Sheffield, Duke of Buckingham, who erected a residence in
                    what was then called the Mulberry Garden, in 1720. On the marriage of Queen
                    Charlotte, the mother of his majesty William IV, this house was settled upon
                    her; she continued her occupation of it many years, when it obtained the name of
                    the Queen’s Palace, and all her children were born there, with the exception of
                    the oldest, afterwards George IV.</p>
                <p>With a view to reparation, as was at first announced, money was voted by
                    Parliament; but by some change of plan, instead of repairing the ancient
                    building, a new one has been erected at the expense of nearly L. 700,000,
                    exclusive of what may be required to finish and furnish it in a manner suitable
                    for a royal residence. It is expected to be habitable by the end of the year
                    1836. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>This great work was designed by the late Mr Nash, but, before his death, it was
                    superintended by Mr Blore, who made considerable alterations in the plan of his
                    predecessor. The grand entrance of the palace looks on the canal in the park,
                    and the view terminates with the building of the Horse Guards. It is through an
                    arch of white marble, in imitation of that of Constantine in Rome, and is
                    ornamented with sculpture, by Westmacottand Bailey. Asemi-cular railing,
                    ornamented with mosaic gold, extends to the two wings. The body of the palace is
                    a parallelogram, from each end of which a wing is extended, thus forming three
                    sides of a square. At the termination of the left wing are placed fine statues
                    of History, Geography, and Astronomy, and on the right wing of Painting, Music,
                    and Architecture. The pediment in the centre contains the royal arms, above
                    which are statues of Neptune, Commerce, and Navigation. Around the whole of the
                    building, and above the windows, is a frize, combining in a scroll the Rose, the
                    Thistle, and the Shamrock.</p>
                <p>The entrance hall, though low, is very splendid. It is paved with variegated
                    marble, bordered with a scroll of sienna, and centered with puce-coloured
                    rosettes. The walls are of seagliola, and the ceiling is supported by forty-four
                    white marble pillars, decorated with Corinthian capitals of mosaic gold. Behind
                    the hall is a vestibule of considerable length, against the sides of which are
                    thirty-two columns, similar to those in the entrance-hall. In the centre of the
                    vestibule is the door of the library, a handsome suite of three rooms looking
                    into the garden; to the right are the apartments of the Queen, and the private
                    staircase leading to them; and to the left are the King’s study, and apartments
                    for secretaries and attendants. Returning to the hall, the grand staircase is on
                    the left, the steps of which are solid blocks of white marble, whilst the rail
                    is richly formed of mosaic gold and mahogany. This staircase ascends on either
                    side, and leads to the state rooms, which are very splendid. The three
                    drawing-rooms are decorated with blue and red imitation marble columns,
                    surmounted by gilt capitals; the floor of the ante-room is richly inlaid with
                    holly and satin wood. The throne-room is richly gilt, the ceiling embossed with
                    magnificence, and the frize contains bas-reliefs by Bayley, after designs by
                    Stothard, representing the wars of York and Lancaster. The imperial throne is
                    placed in an alcove at the end of the apartment. From this splendid room a door
                    leads into the picture gallery, a noble saloon running the whole length of the
                    palace, being 164 feet by 24. It is lighted by three parallel ranges of
                    sky-lights, decorated with tracery and oriental pendants, presenting a very
                    pleasing appearance. Over the mantle-pieces are carved heads of the celebrated
                    artists of antiquity, and the floor is formed of pannelled oak. The dining-room
                    is richly adorned, but by some is deemed of insufficient capacity for royal
                    banquets.</p>
                <p>The front of this palace, which is the most pleasing, is that from the garden. It
                    is chaste and simple. A sheet of water and a shrubbery have been formed before
                    it, and the entrance this way is through the magnificent triumphal arch,
                    designed by Nash. This arch is of the Corinthian order. Towards Hyde Park are
                    four columns, two at each side of the arch supporting a portico The arch itself
                    is adorned with six Corinthian pilasters. The front towards the garden is
                    exactly similar. The vaulted part in the centre is divided into compartments,
                    richly sculptured. A small doorway on each side leads to the porter’s apartment,
                    within which are stairs leading to the top. Along the entablature are placed G.
                    R. and the imperial crown. The gates, of bronzed iron-work, are beautiful, and
                    adorned with the royal arms.</p>
                <p>Hyde Park is entered by a fine triumphal gate, opposite to that which leads to
                    the garden front of the royal palace. This gate, designed by Decimus Burton, and
                    executed in 1826, consists of a screen of fluted Ionic pillars, with three
                    archways for carriages, two for foot-passengers, and a lodge. The whole frontage
                    is 107 feet. The central gatewayis adorned with four columns, supporting the
                    entablature, above which is a frize running round the four sides of the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193208482" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8482-0543"/> ⅛ructure. This
                    frize represents a naval and military tumphal procession. The side gateways
                    present two inflated Ionic columns, flanked by antae. The gates are ⅛autiful
                    specimens of bronzed iron-work, and the whole prie has a most magnificent
                    effect. The park consists of i∙5 acres in extent, and is a most valuable
                    appendage to ie metropolis, by the advantageous means of recreation wich it
                    affords both to pedestrians and equestrians. At the &lt;trance from Piccadilly
                    is the colossal statue of Achilles, iibronze, executed by Westmacott, cast from
                    cannon taken h the Duke of Wellington, to whom it is dedicated, at fclamanca,
                    Vittoria, Toulouse, and Waterloo. It stands α a base of granite, is eighteen
                    feet in height, and is said tweigh thirty tons. One part of this park is used
                    for r∕iewing troops, and another part is covered with the Ser-pntine River,
                    which, when frozen, affords very great gral. cation to the practitioners and
                    admirers of skating.</p>
                <p>h The finest entrance to London is by Hyde Park corner iuo Piccadilly. The street
                    is nearly a mile in length ()80 yards), but, from inequalities, can nowhere be
                    seen a.one view. It terminates at the other end, in the elegant ecus, where the
                    two parts of Regent Street meet, which s et is exactly a mile long. At its lower
                    end, in Water-l&lt;∣ Place, is the Duke of York’s Column. A colossal bι∣nze
                    statue of that prince, executed by Westmacott, has b∙. ’ n placed on a podium
                    rising out of the summit of this o≈umn. It is a fine bold composition, with full
                    drapery fining down the back of the figure, and giving it breadth ai l
                    importance. The figure looks towards the parade gjuιnd of the Horse Guards, and
                    the back consequently is p&lt;sented to the view from Regent Street, and the
                    United •vice, Athenaeum, and other club-houses. The column k&lt;∣f pale red
                    granite, 150 feet in height, and may be as-Cíi ded by a spiral staircase within.
                    At its foot is a fine fliht of steps leading into St James’s Park.</p>
                <p>“tecent alterations have much improved the adjoining spot, 0BWhich Carlton Palace
                    stood. Besides a stately range ofl⅛gant buildings upon the site of the palace, a
                    handsome s¢are has been formed. The front towards St James’s R,k consists of
                    sixteen houses, which are disposed in two rages, raised on a substructure, which
                    contains the kit-elf&lt;ιs and domestic offices, forming a terrace about fifty
                    fe∣ wide, adorned with Paestum Doric pillars, surmounted bτι balustrade. The
                    superstructure consists of three stork, ornamented with Corinthian columns. On
                    descending the steps into St James’s Park, the view of that pleas-ih∣ ground is
                    fine, shewing the course of the water, the i≡nds in it, with the shrubberies and
                    the gravel walks, as w»l as the road from the royal palace to the Horse Guards,
                    bwhich the King passes in state to the parliament-house. ⅛Ιιe parade place for
                    the Guards is a fine opening, and at cao side are placed trophies of war,
                    particularly two prodigi-oupieces of artillery, whilst the esplanade terminates
                    with th j strong and handsome stone building, in which the tr¢ps in immediate
                    attendance on the King are quartered, tw of whom, on horseback, act as
                    sentinels, in two lodges if iiont of Whitehall. In this building is the office
                    of the cβmander-in-chief of the army.</p>
                <p>bn emerging from the gate of the Horse Guards, the celbrated banqueting-house,
                    built by Inigo Jones, presents it⅛f. It is an elegant and magnificent structure
                    of hewn stae, adorned with an upper and lower range of pillars, of thelonic and
                    composite order. The capitals, and the space bel∕cen the columns of the windows,
                    are enriched with fru and foliage. It is surrounded with a balustrade, and
                    thíwhole exterior has been put in a complete state of repair The interior
                    consists chiefly of one apartment, of an ob lng form, about forty feet in
                    height. The ceiling was paited by Rubens, and represents the apotheosis of James
                    I. It ∣i now an elegant chapel, in which divine public worship is performed
                    every Sunday. It is adorned with the eagles and other trophies taken from the
                    French in Spain, which were deposited here with great military ceremony in May
                    1811. Charles I. was led from this building, through a window in the front of
                    it, to the scaffold, where he was executed on the 30th January 1649. In the
                    gardens between this building and the river, there are some dwellings of persons
                    of the highest rank; and in one part a public building has been given up by the
                    government, to form the museum of the United Services. A valuable collection has
                    been formed, by the zeal of the officers of the army and navy, and is receiving
                    daily augmentations. It already contains many valuable and curious objects, not
                    only such as are connected with those professions, but also in natural history,
                    and in articles illustrative of the customs and manners of the distant countries
                    explored "by our adventurous countrymen.</p>
                <p>Between the Horse Guards and Charing Cross is the Office of the Paymaster of the
                    Forces, which, though conveniently arranged for its intended purpose, has no
                    peculiar claim to attention from its architecture; but, adjoining to it, is that
                    fine pile, the Admiralty Office, built on the site of Wallingford House, and
                    celebrated for the councils held there by Oliver Cromwell and his officers. The
                    front has two deep wings, and a lofty portico supported by four large stone
                    pillars of the Ionic order. There is a screen in front of the court, richly
                    ornamented with naval emblems. The entrance of the main building is a spacious
                    hall, from which are passages leading to staircases, by which the numerous
                    offices are reached. There is a fine board-room, and within the building are
                    numerous residences for the junior lords. On the top of it is the telegraph,
                    which maintains the correspondence with the great ports where there are naval
                    arsenals.</p>
                <p>In Whitehall, next below the Horse Guards, is the entrance, by a gateway common
                    to both, and whose Gothic architecture is much admired, to the Office of the
                    Secretary of State for the Home Department, and the Treasury Office. The first
                    has some of its apartments looking on the street, but that part is more
                    remarkable for its antique than its beautiful architecture. The interior is
                    arranged very appropriately, but it is rather too small for the increased
                    business to be transacted. The Treasury is a fine large stone building, with its
                    front towards the Parade. It is a portion of the old palace erected by Cardinal
                    Wolsey, and altered at subsequent periods, but chiefly in the reign of Charles
                    II. It displays in its front the Tuscan, Doric, and Ionic order of architecture,
                    and the whole is surrounded by a pediment. The board-room is a fine apartment;
                    but all the other parts are too much crowded, for the number of clerks that are
                    necessary. From this office there is a communication with the official residence
                    of the First Lord of the Treasury.</p>
                <p>The building next to these in Whitehall, is the elegant recently-erected Office
                    of the Privy Council and of the Board of Trade, finished in 1826, from the
                    design of Sir John Sloane. Upon the left hand, or western side, are the offices
                    for the clerks of the privy council, and their subordinates, whence
                    proclamations are issued, and patents are prepared. Upon the first floor is the
                    beautiful court where the privy council sit as a court of law, to decide on
                    appeals from the colonial courts, or on other business referred to them by the
                    king. The interior is simply, yet beautifully finished, and around it are rooms
                    for the president, and others for the advocates and agents. The right side of
                    the building is occupied by the committee of privy council for affairs of trade.
                    The several rooms for the president, vice-president, secretaries, and clerks,
                    are on both sides of a gallery, which extends the whole length of the building.
                    In the construction of this part, the architect has preserved the old
                    board-room, erected in the reign of William III., in order to retain the
                    beautifully carved ceiling then placed <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208495"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-8495-0544"/>there. A communication, by a gallery, is
                    maintained between these offices and that of die Home Secretary and die
                    Treasury.</p>
                <p>In Downing Street, of which the council-office formsone corner, is, on the right
                    hand side, the house for the residence of the First Lord of the Treasury, a
                    noble mansion, with its best apartments looking into St James’s Park; and,
                    adjoining to it, another upon a smaller scale, occupied by the Chancellor of the
                    Exchequer, when that office and that of First Lord of the Treasury are not
                    filled by the same individual, but otherwise by one of the secretaries of the
                    treasury.</p>
                <p>At the bottom of the same narrow street, but with its best front towards the
                    Park, is the office of the Secretary of State for the Colonies and for War. The
                    building has nothing in its exterior to engage attention, but it contains some
                    fine apartments, and others very conveniently arranged for the despatch of
                    business, and has been of late years extended by the addition of the house which
                    was formerly the office of the Judge Advocate.</p>
                <p>In the same street, touching the Colonial Office, and forming a right angle with
                    it, is the office of the Secretary of State for foreign affairs. It has been
                    formed out of several houses in addition to the old building, and presents to
                    view neidιer regularity nor architectural beauty; in its appearance it is
                    unworthy the dignified business there transacted, where the representatives of
                    all the states of the civilized world have constant occasion to repair, and
                    where the cabinet councils are most commonly held. It is, however, if not
                    imposing, very appropriately fitted up in the interior, with noble apartments
                    for die chief and under secretaries, where they receive the foreign
                    diplomatists; and of late years the part occupied as a dwelling has been
                    repaired, beautified, and elegantly furnished, and as such was first used as a
                    residence by Mr Canning for a very short time before his death.</p>
                <p>In Duke Street, Westminster, near to Downing Street, ⅛nd looking on the Park, a
                    new and noble building has just been finished as a State Paper Office. It has a
                    handsome front, secured against any accident by fire, and well arranged for the
                    purpose of preserving and rendering easily accessible the valuable documents
                    which were removed to it from the old building in George Street. These papers
                    can only be examined by a special order from the Secretary of State for the Home
                    Department, which is generally granted on application, when asked, for any
                    purely historical purpose, and every inquirer for such objects finds all the
                    assistance he can desire upon the part of the officers of the establishment.</p>
                <p>Westminster Hall has already been noticed; but the two Houses of Parliament were
                    so much injured by the fire which accidentally broke out there in November 1834,
                    as to render it necessary to make use of such apartments as could be most
                    speedily converted to the purpose, for the accommodation of the two legislative
                    bodies. A variety of suggestions have been offered for repairing or building
                    anew the parts which were injured; but no decisive plan has been adopted, and
                    for the present the House of Lords assembles in an apartment not very
                    appropriate, and the House of Commons holds their sittings in what was the House
                    of Lords, with such temporary repairs as the short time allowed for the purpose
                    would admit. Sec the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Westminster.</hi></p>
                <p>Near to the parliament houses, in Cannon Bow, is a neat and elegant building, but
                    little seen at present, which is occupied by the Board of Controul for Indian
                    affairs. It was built during the war for the Transport Board, which was
                    abolished at the peace, and since that time it has been applied to its present
                    use. It is a handsome building, with a fine porticoof the Ionic order, its back
                    front towards die Thames, and with apartments appropriately laid out.</p>
                <p>Some of the greatest improvements made in the metro polis of late years have been
                    projected or completed in the vicinity of Charing Cross, and along' the Strand.
                    All the old buildings at Charing Cross opposite to Northumberland House,
                    including the western side of St Martin’s Lane, have been removed. The new
                    Golden Cross Inn has been completed, and the houses forming the east side of
                    what is called Trafalgar Square are occupied. On the northern side of that
                    square the new national gallery of painting, sculpture, and architecture has
                    considerably advanced. It is being erected on the spot formerly occupied by the
                    king’s mews, but removed farther back, in order to give a better view from Pall
                    Mall of the fine porticoof St Martin’s church. The part of the gallery towards
                    the east has its front nearly finished, but before its completion it would be
                    unfair to criticise the architecture. The gallery is intended to be about 500
                    feet in length, and will consist of a central porticoof eight Corinthian columns
                    in front and two in depth, ascended by steps at each end at an elevation of
                    eight feet from the ground. Between the centre and the wings will be two
                    entrances, composed of four Corinthian columns, one leading to Castle Street,
                    and the other to the barracks. It is designed to have windows in the lower story
                    for lighting those apartments, and in the upper story there are to be niches for
                    statues. The porticowill be surmounted by an ornamental dome, and the whole
                    range of building by a balustrade. The part upon the right side of the portico
                    will be devoted to the Royal Academy, and that to die left will comprise the
                    galleries for the works of art; these being connected by the grand staircase and
                    vestibule dividing the building into two parts.</p>
                <p>The beautiful equestrian statue of Charles I. remains on the ancient spot, and it
                    has been suggested that between it and the gallery some object should be placed
                    which might do credit to the taste of the age.</p>
                <p>The widening of the Strand, by removing Exeter Change, and many other
                    obstructions, has made the West Strand a noble street; whilst the beautiful
                    streets, called Adelaide Street and King William Street, have together
                    contributed with the elegant Lowther Arcade, the Ophthalmic Hospital, the
                    Charingcross Hospital, and many private houses, to change the character of that
                    part of the town; especially by removing some hundreds of wretched houses, (in
                    courts and alleys), which were the haunts of the most depraved portion of the
                    population.</p>
                <p>The new Hungerford Market already noticed, has now a good approach from the
                    Strand nearly completed, which forms an additional improvement to the appearance
                    of the western part of that street.</p>
                <p>Somerset House, or rather, Somerset Palace, is a pile of building standing on the
                    site of a number of edifices, which were most tyrannically destroyed by the Duke
                    of Somerset, who was protector in the reign of Edward VI., and ultimately the
                    victim of his ambition and treason. The palace was begun in the year 1549, and
                    the architect was one John of Padua, who was appointed in the reign of Henry
                    VIII., under the title of Devisor of his Majesty’s buildings. The architecture
                    was that mixture of Grecian and Gothic, which had been introduced into England
                    in the preceding reign. It was a spacious and magnificent edifice, and as by
                    death it devolved on the crown, it was made use of as a residence for some
                    members of the royal family. Queen Elizabeth resided here with her kinsman Lord
                    Hunsdon. A chapel was begun by Inigo Jones, who had built the back, front, and
                    the water gate. It was intended for the use of the Catholic Infanta of Spain,
                    who was expected to become the wife of Charles I., when Prince of Wales; and
                    though that match did not take place, it was used by the professors of the
                    Catholic religion, and amongst others by the Queen Henrietta Maria. It was also
                    the residence of the queen of Charles 11., who was thereby removed from the
                    observation of her royal consort’s gallantries. It was at that time that it
                    becanae <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208508" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8508-0545"/>lie
                    theatre of an irritating plot, probably founded on fic- ⅝on, but which produced
                    national agitation. Whether Sir ‘ĭdmonbury Godfrey was murdered or destroyed
                    himself, vas, and must ever remain, a matter of doubt.</p>
                <p>' The present building is after a design of the late Sir Villiam Chambers, and
                    was begun in 1775. It occupies space about 800 feet wide and 300 deep, and forms
                    a ∣uadrangle, with a spacious court in the centre. The front (awards the street
                    consists of a rustic basement of nine ∣rches, supporting Corinthian columns,
                    surmounted in the entre by an attic, and, at the extremities, by a ballustrade.
                    ’he key-stones of the arches are adorned with colossal ιasks in alto relievo,
                    emblematical of the Ocean, and the light principal rivers of England. On the
                    three central ∣ indows of the first floor are medallions of George III., his
                    lucen, and the Prince of Wales. The attic is divided into i ιree parts, by four
                    statues, representing Justice, Truth, <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> alour, and
                    Moderation, with the appropriate emblems of .ιe scales, the mirror, the sword,
                    and the bridle in one hand, ∣rid the fasces in the other. The whole is
                    surmounted by lie British arms, supported by Fame, and the genius of Ingland.
                    The front towards the river is a spacious terrace, his river front has now two
                    wings, built uniformly; that ι the east side is a part of King’s College, at the
                    expense I; which it has been recently completed, after having been ' ft for
                    nearly sixty years a vacant and disgraceful spot.</p>
                <p>The front part of the pile is occupied by the Royal Acal;n&gt;, who have in it
                    their annual exhibitions of painting, ∣ulpturc, and architecture. The other
                    part, the Royal lóciety, the Antiquarian Society, and the Geological So-ιety at
                    present occupy. The three other sides of the nadrangle arc destined to the use
                    of the Navy Board, the ’ reasurer of which has an official residence looking on
                    the (ver; and some other houses in the same wing are occu-I ed by Officers under
                    the Admiralty. The Board of Taxes, !∣ith its Secretary, have the use of a large
                    portion; and the ∣mainder is under the Board of Stamps, where the mal',finery is
                    worked in their operations.</p>
                <p>In this part of the town are a few objects which deserve ⅛θtice, and which may
                    here, as appropriately as in any other [,^rt, receive it. Covent Garden has
                    already been noticed „ a market for fruit, vegetables, and flowers. It occupies
                    Urec acres of land, covered with more elegant buildings Ian are usually to be
                    seen in market-places; and it is, on the -prthern, and a part of the eastern
                    side, bounded by a range if handsome buildings, planned by Inigo Jones, on
                    arches, ’ rith a good walk or piazza under them. The greater part these houses
                    are used as taverns or coffee-houses. The )⅛urch of St Paul, at the west end,
                    has a fine portico un- ∣lr which the elections of members of parliament for the
                    ¼y of Westminster are held. This place was, in former ⅛ιes, the garden of the
                    convent of St Paul’s, and was, on 'ie suppression of those institutions, given
                    to the family of ∣ιssell, whose successor, the Duke of Bedford, is the pre-eat
                    possessor, and has rebuilt the centre, from plans by Mr J&gt;wler, in 1829 and
                    1830.</p>
                <p>⅛ Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields is one of the largest squares in the lĭtropolis; but the
                    appearance is not favourable. The &lt;rstern side has no other building but the
                    wall ofLincoln’s- l⅛ι Garden. The north side consists of small, and mostly
                    ħinely houses; but on the south and west sides are several table mansions of
                    considerable age, some used as offices b∣ public boards, and others let out in
                    chambers, like those the Inns of Court. These houses have been inhabited ♭ some
                    of the most distinguished statesmen and lawyers 'c&lt;the country. Within the
                    few last years Sir John Soane lι⅛ presented to the public his house on the north
                    side of tl square, with the valuable collection of curiosities, which, i¢the
                    course of a long life, he has been able to draw from vtvious sources.</p>
                <p>‘^Leicester Square, like Lincoln’s-Inn, is more remarkable for its extent than
                    for its beauty. The greater part of the houses are upon a small scale, and not
                    distinguished by any architectural taste. On the north side were once some
                    distinguished edifices, particularly one the residence of Frederick Prince of
                    Wales, father of George III., which was afterwards used for the exhibition of
                    Sir Ashton Lever’s museum. This square was the residence of Sir Joshua Reynolds,
                    and of Hogarth, and Woollet, celebrated artists; and of John Hunter, the
                    celebrated anatomist and surgeon. In the centre is a fine bronze equestrian
                    statue of King George I.</p>
                <p>In proceeding westward from Leicester Square, that singular pile of buildings,
                    called from its form the Quadrant, is entered. It is a break in Regent Street,
                    extending from Piccadilly to Glasshouse Street. This circular mass is ornamented
                    by colonnades, with a good walk under a gallery surrounding the whole, which is
                    supported by cast-iron pillars. The outward effect is fine, but the houses arc
                    not admired as residences, and have not been very advantageously occupied.</p>
                <p>Between the Quadrant and Bond Street is Hanover Square, which was built in honour
                    of the present royal family, soon after their accession to the throne. It
                    occupies about two acres, has some noble houses but not in the best style, and
                    is chiefly remarkable for a handsome suite of apartments, fitted up in the most
                    splendid manner, and let out for the performance of concerts, or other public
                    purposes. On the eastern side is a bronze colossal statue of William Pitt,
                    executed by Chantrey. It is twelve feet in height, and stands on a pedestal of
                    granite, fifteen feet high. The resemblance is very striking.</p>
                <p>To the westward of Bond Street, Berkeley Square presents itself. There are only
                    houses on three sides of it, as the wall of the noble mansion of the Marquis of
                    Lansdowne, occupies the whole of the south side. The garden in the centre of the
                    Square contains about three acres. There are in the whole, including Lansdowne
                    House, fifty-four dwellings, several of them of the first class, but on the east
                    side some of them are of a much lower description.</p>
                <p>By crossing Piccadilly, St James’s Square is arrived at. It has much celebrity,
                    as well from the magnificence of several houses, and the eminent men who have
                    lived in them, as from its being one of the oldest of the larger squares, and
                    that which led to the practice of forming such places upon an extensive scale.
                    On the south side, the back of some of the houses of Pall Mall, mixed with some
                    small dwelling-houses, intrude on the view; but the other three sides are
                    occupied by mansions of the very first class. The whole number of these is only
                    twenty-four. The centre is a neat garden, laid out with shrubs, and, in the
                    middle of it, there is a sheet of water, from which there rises a pedestal
                    surmounted by a statue of King William III. The largest of the houses, are
                    London House, belonging to the Bishop of London; and those of the Duke of
                    Norfolk, Marquis of Bristol, Earl de Grey, Duke of Cleveland, Earl of Hardwicke,
                    Bishop of Winchester, Earl of Dartmouth, Earl of Litchfield, Lord Rosslyn, Sir
                    Watkin Williams Wynn, and Mr Hudson Gurney.</p>
                <p>The Royal Palace of St James, in Pall-Mall, has so long been treated as an object
                    of consideration, by all the diplomatists of Europe, as to deserve a particular
                    description. This palace was originally an hospital dedicated to St James,
                    founded by some pious citizens before the Norman conquest. It was designed to
                    receive fourteen lepers, to whom were afterwards added eight brethren, who were
                    to perform divine service. It was rebuilt in the time of Henry III. The custody
                    of it was conferred on Eton College, by a grant of the twenty-eighth year of
                    Henry VI.; but it is reported, that the living of Chattesham in Suffolk was
                    given in exchange for it, the college, on this consideration, having resigned it
                    to Henry VIII. At that time the revenue was <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208521"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-8521-0546"/>estimated at L. 100 per annum. The present
                    building was erected by that monarch soon after the transaction, which took
                    place in the year 1531, and was desenbed by the historian Stowe, as “a goodly
                    manor.” The same king also enclosed the park, which became subservient to the
                    amusement of this and the other palace of Whitehall. Charles II. who was
                    particularly fond of it, planted the avenues, and formed the canal, and the
                    aviary adjacent to the Bird-cage Walk, which took its name from the cages which
                    were hung on the trees. The king, according to Cibber, was often seen here,
                    amidst crowds of spectators, feeding his ducks, and playing with his dogs, and
                    passing his idle time in conversation with the meanest of his subjects, which
                    made him be adored by the common people. There exists no proof that this palace
                    was regularly inhabited by any of our monarchs till after the fire in 1695, by
                    which the palace of Whitehall was destroyed. James I. presented it to his
                    promising son, Prince Henry, who resided in it until his death in 1612. Charles
                    I. was brought to it from Windsor, on the 19th of January, by the power of the
                    army, which had determined on his death, and his apartment was hastily furnished
                    by his own servant, Mr Kinnersley of the wardrobe. Of the eleven days which he
                    was permitted to live, some were spent in Westminster Hall, and the nights were
                    passed in the house of Sir Robert Cotton, near the place of his trial. On the
                    27th he was earned back to St James’s, where he passed his three last days in
                    the exercise of exemplary piety. On the 30th he was brought to the place of
                    execution; and walked, unmoved by every insult, with a firm and quick pace,
                    supported by the most lively sentiments of religion. His son, the bigoted James,
                    sent to the Prince of Orange, when he had approached in force near to the
                    capital, an invitation to take up his lodging in this palace. The prince
                    accepted it; but, at the same time, hinted to the frightened king, that he must
                    leave Whitehall. It was customary to mount guard at both the palaces. The old
                    hero, Lord Craven, was upon duty at the time when the Dutch guards were moving
                    through the Park, to relieve those at Whitehall, by order of their master. From
                    a point of honour, he determined not to quit his post, and was preparing to
                    maintain it; but, receiving the commands of his sovereign, he reluetantly
                    withdrew his party, and marched away with sullen dignity.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>James, the son of James II, who so long made
                    pretensions to the British throne, was born in the room now called the old
                    bed-chamber, at present the antichamber to the levee room. The bed stood close
                    to the door of a back stair which descends to an inner court. It certainly eras
                    very convenient to carry on any secret design, and might favour the silly
                    warming-pan story, had not the bed been surrounded by twenty of the
                    privy-council, four other men of rank, and twenty ladies, besides other
                    attendants. James, with imprudent pride, neglected to disprove the tale, and it
                    was adopted by a party, and perhaps believed by some credulous
                    zealots.</p></note></p>
                <p>During the reign of King William, this palace was fitted up for the residence of
                    the Princess Anne, afterwards queen, and her husband Prince George of Denmark;
                    and from that time to the present it has been regularly the court of the
                    successive monarchs. Pennant, who described it about fifty years ago, and from
                    whom a part of the preceding account is extracted, says, “Uncreditable as the
                    outside of St James’s Palace may look, it is said to be the most commodious for
                    regal parade of any palace in Europe. The furniture of this palace is unbecoming
                    the place.” In this last respect very great improvements have been effected
                    since that author took his interesting walks through London. It is still an
                    irregular brick building of no external beauty, the front of a small part of
                    which, in the form of a gateway, alone appears from the street, but the state
                    apartments look towards the park. These arc but one story in height, and appear
                    tolerably regular, though somewhat mean. The south-east wing, in which were the
                    apartments of the maids of honour, was destroyed by an accidental fire in 1809,
                    and has not since been rebuilt. Between 1821 and 1824 the whole of the state
                    apartments have been completely repaired and newly furnished, and thus put in
                    the state now to be described.</p>
                <p>These apartments are entered by a passage and staircase of great simplicity. The
                    walls are distempered, of a dead stone colour, and are lighted by Grecian bronze
                    lights, with moon shades placed on plain granite pedestals, which have an air of
                    quakerly neatness, quite in unison with this part of the edifice. The exterior
                    walls are sprinkled with black, in imitation of granite. On ascending is seen a
                    sort of gallery or guard-room, converted into an armoury, the walls of which are
                    decorated with daggers, swords, and musquets, in various devices. When a
                    drawing-room is held, this apartment is occupied by the yeomen of the guard in
                    full costume, with their battle-axes in their hands. The next room is a small
                    chamber covered with tapestry, in fine preservation, from the ceiling of which
                    an elegant chandelier depends. When a drawing-room is held, a person attends
                    here to receive the cards containing the names of the parties to be presented,
                    with the circumstances under which the presentation takes place. A duplicate of
                    the card is subsequently handed to the lord in waiting, in order to prevent the
                    introduction of improper persons. The next is the first of a succession of
                    apartments, the last of which is the Presence Chamber. It is fitted up in a
                    style of magnificent splendour. The walls are covered with crimson damask, and
                    the window curtains are of the same material. The cornices and basements are
                    formed of broad carved and gilt moulding, and extend to every part of the room.
                    On entering, the eye of the spectator is first attracted by a looking-glass of
                    unusual magnitude, which reaches completely from the ceiling to the floor. At
                    the east end of the room is a painting of George II. in his parliamentary robes,
                    and on the other walls hang two large pictures of Tournay and of Lisle. The
                    furniture consists of sofas, ottomans, and stools, covered with crimson velvet
                    trimmed with gold lace. From the ceiling hangs a superb or-molu lustre,
                    containing two rows of lights of three branches each; and at each end of the
                    apartment are two splendid candelabras elegantly gilt, calculated to receive
                    twelve lights each.</p>
                <p>The next room is fitted up in the same style of decoration, and contains an
                    excellent full-length portrait of George III. in the robes of his order. On each
                    side of these are two paintings of the celebrated sea-fights of Lord Howe on the
                    first June, and of Lord Nelson at Trafalgar. The brilliant effect of the whole
                    is considerably heightened by the addition of three magnificent pier-glasses,
                    reaching from the floor to the ceiling. From the middle of the ceiling also
                    hangs a delicately chased Grecian lustre.</p>
                <p>The third and last room is the Presence Chamber, in which the king holds his
                    drawing-rooms. This, in point of gorgeous decoration, far exceeds that of the
                    preceding apartments, although the style is somewhat similar. The throne is
                    splendid, and, in point of size and magnificence of effect, far exceeds that in
                    the House of Lords. It is composed of rich Genoa velvet, thickly covered with
                    gold lace, and is surmounted by a canopy of the same material, on the inside of
                    which is a star embroidered in gold. There are three steps for his Majesty to
                    ascend, which lead to a state chair of exquisite workmanship; close to which is
                    a footstool to correspond. Over the fire-place is a full-length portrait of
                    George IV. in his coronation robes, by Sir Thomas Lawrence. Upon each side of
                    this picture are paintings of the battles of Vittoria and Waterloo. The piers of
                    the room <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208534" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8534-0547"/>are
                    entirely fitted up with plate-glass, before which are some beautiful marble
                    slabs. The window curtains are of crimson satin, trimmed with gold-coloured
                    fringe and lace. The cornices, mouldings, &amp;c. are richly gilt, and the other
                    embellishments and furniture, of corresponding elegance, present a coup d’oeil
                    in every way suited to the dignity and splendour of the British court.</p>
                <p>4 Behind the Presence Chamber is 'his Majesty’s closet, in i which he gives
                    audience and receives the members of his ,own family, foreign ambassadors,
                    cabinet ministers, and officers of state. It contains a state chair and
                    footstool; an elegant writing-table with a buhl inkstand, and other use- <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ι</hi> ful furniture. The king’s dressing or private room is
                    beyond this. The dining-room belongs to another suite of apartments, and is
                    admirably fitted up and furnished. Many of the sleeping-rooms are in the house
                    built by William IV. when Duke of Clarence, which has been united by a gallery
                    with the palace. Some members of the royal family have suites of apartments
                    within the palace, as well as the great officers of the household and the guards
                    on duty. There is a chapel for the household and also a German chapel, where
                    divine service is performed after the Lutheran J form in the German
                    language.</p>
                <p>I In passing by Westminster Bridge to the right bank of ’ the Thames, we reach
                    the newly erected borough of Lambeth, where the palace belonging to the
                    Archiepiscopal sec of Canterbury is well entitled to notice.</p>
                <p>I Lambeth, in the earliest period of which there are any accounts, was a royal
                    manor, and had a palace, in which King Hardycanute died, after a feast, in 804,
                    and where Harold is said to have seized the crown, and placed it upon his own
                    head. It was then a part of the estate of Goda, who became successively the wife
                    of Walter Earl of Mantis, and of Eustace Earl of Boulogne; she presented it to
                    the church of Rochester, but reserved to herself the ecclesiastical patronage.
                    It became, in 1197, the property of the see of Canterbury, by exchange with
                    Rochester; but the bishop of the latter preserved a small piece of land, on
                    which a house was built for the residence of the bishops, when they were
                    attending on parliament, called Rochester Place. One of the bishops, John de
                    Shepy, in 1357, built Stangate Stairs, to accommodate himself and his retinue,
                    when he had occasion to cross the river to Westminster.</p>
                <p>The palace had been built by Bishop Boniface near two centuries before, but,
                    between ,1414 and 1443, was much improved by the munificent Bishop Chichley. He
                    founded [he Lollards’ Tower, which was a prison for those suspected of heresy,
                    in which are still to be seen rings, to which t is said the followers of
                    Wickliffe were fastened when tor-ured. Hilsley and Fisher occupied this palace
                    when it fell nto the hands of Henry VIII., who exchanged it with the 3ishop of
                    Carlisle for some houses in the Strand, and it vas then known by the name of
                    Carlisle House.</p>
                <p>During the civil wars in tire reign of Charles I., Lam- &gt;eth, like other
                    ecclesiastical property, suffered severely. The fine works of art, and the
                    sacred memorials of the ∣lead, were in most cases sacrificed to puritanical
                    barbarism; ∣o that when, after the restoration, Juxon was appointed to he see,
                    he found it a heap of ruins. During his short privacy, he did much to restore it
                    to its former condition, and I uilt a noble apartment, which was afterwards
                    converted I ιto a library.</p>
                <p>The founder of the library was Archbishop Bancroft, ho left to it all his books,
                    as did his successor Abbot; and i has been increased by the several eminent
                    prelates who ave since filled the see, so that at present the collection ontains
                    more than twenty-five thousand volumes, besides ιany valuable manuscripts.
                    (Seethe Article <hi rend="smallcaps">Libraries.)</hi> Vhen the long parliament
                    had abolished episcopacy, and ιe palace was delivered to one of their party, the
                    regicide cott, this valuable library was preserved from destruction, or at least
                    from dispersion, by the discreet and dexterous management of the celebrated
                    Selden. It appears by the bequest of Bancroft, that, in the event of his
                    successors failing to give bond to deliver the books entire from one to the
                    other, they should be given up to Chelsea Hospital. Two years after the
                    execution of Archbishop Laud, the books still remained at Lambeth, when Selden,
                    alarmed for their safety, suggested to the University of Cambridge their right
                    to them. On the claim being made, it was acquiesced in, and the whole were
                    removed to Cambridge. Juxon made application to have the books restored to the
                    original repository, and, though not immediately surrendered, they were so soon
                    afterwards, when Archbishop Sheldon filled the see. That prelate, as well as
                    Tennison, Secker, and Cornwallis, made several additions of considerable value
                    to the library; and almost every one who has held the dignity has been a
                    contributor to the store. This noble collection of books, now exceeding 25,000
                    volumes, is placed in Juxon’s hall, a fine apartment, forming part of the
                    ancient palace. There is a chapel and a vestry adjoining, in which are many
                    portraits of several prelates, and in the banqueting-hall are portraits of all
                    the archbishops from Laud to the present dignitary. By the magnificence and
                    taste of the present archbishop, the domestic part of the palace has been
                    greatly enlarged; a new Gothic wing of great beauty, designed by Mr Blore,
                    having been erected at an expense of more than L.52,000. The whole of the
                    interior is fitted up in a style of simple beauty, oak pannelling pervading the
                    edifice, and contrasting finely with the fretted ceilings and ornaments. The
                    study of the archbishop is a noble apartment, forty feet by twenty; the
                    drawing-room is also of fine proportions, commanding, from the ample bay-window,
                    a pleasing prospect of the gardens, and a peep at the abbey and the bridge
                    through the foliage.</p>
                <p>Not far from Lambeth is the Surrey Zoological Garden, in which there is a
                    collection of various animals, with a den and pole for bears, a cottage for the
                    wapiti and camel, a ruin for eagles, folds for deer, and a variety of sheds,
                    &amp;c. for various beasts and birds. There is a fine piece of water, and an
                    elegant circular glass-house surrounding the cages of the animals. The whole is
                    laid out with much taste, and excites great delight in the visitors.</p>
                <p>Though the government of the far greater portion of the metropolis is under the
                    immediate direction of the Secretary of State for the Home Department, and is
                    administered by means of the magistrates and the police; yet that part which is
                    usually denominated the city, and which is in the strictest sense London, is
                    under the superintendence of an ancient corporation, which possesses great power
                    and extensive property, and is therefore entitled to a somewhat minute
                    description.</p>
                <p>The rise of the corporation has already been traced, in the historical view at
                    the commencement of this article. In its frame it bears a strong resemblance to
                    the British constitution. It is composed of three grades; of a Lord Mayor, the
                    executive officer, of a permanent body, the court of aldermen, and an
                    annually-appointed body, the court of common-council In the latter body the
                    aldermen have seats and votes, and therein it differs from the relation that
                    exists between the Lords and Commons. All of these are chosen by the citizens by
                    a majority of votes, when the choice is not determined by the show of hands. The
                    Lord Mayor is chosen annually, but is capable of being re-elected. The right of
                    voting for this dignity is restricted to those freemen who have been admitted
                    into the livery of their respective companies. The restrictions on the choice
                    are, that the person proposed to fill it must be an alderman, must have
                    previously served the office of sheriff, and must be one of two chosen by the
                    livery, and returned to the court of aldermen, who finally determine which of
                    the two shall be invested with the dignity. The aldermen are appointed<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193208547" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8547-0548"/> during life. They
                    are chosen for a particular division of the city, called the ward, and in the
                    election all resident freemen are entitled to a vote, whether they have been
                    admitted into the livery of their companies or not. After the election, however,
                    the court of aldermen has the power of rejecting the individual as a member of
                    their body, in which ease the election is declared void, and another must be
                    made choice of. If, at the second election, the same person have a majority of
                    votes, those votes are considered as null, and the next on the poll is invested
                    with the dignity. From this choice an appeal may be made to the Court of King’s
                    Bench, when the reason for the rejection must be made out to the satisfaction of
                    that tribunal, as happened in the only instance which occurred in modern times.
                    The city is divided into twenty-six wards, each of which has its alderman, and a
                    deputy appointed by him. One of these wards, called the Bridge Without, which
                    was composed of the houses standing on London Bridge, has long ceased to contain
                    any habitations, and the senior alderman is always removed from the ward which
                    chose him, and is installed as alderman of the Bridge ward, and his former place
                    filled by a new choice.</p>
                <p>The whole of the common council is chosen on St Thomas’s day for the succeeding
                    year; but the former members may be, and for the most part are, reehosen. As the
                    extent of the several wards differs very materially, so does the number, but not
                    in exact proportion, of their representatives in the court of common council.
                    The wards of Bassishaw and Lime Street have four each; Portsoken has five;
                    Aldgate, Coleman Street, Cornhill, and Queenhithe, have six each; Aldersgate,
                    Candlewick, Cordwainers, Dowgate, and Walbrook, have eight each; Vintry has
                    nine; Broad Street, Castle&lt;Baynard, Billingsgate, and Langbourn, have ten
                    each; Bread Street, Cheap, and Tower, have twelve each; Bishopsgate has
                    fourteen; Bridge Within, fifteen; Cripplegate and Farringdon Without, sixteen;
                    and Farringdon Within, seventeen. The ward of Bridge Without can elect none, now
                    that it has no inhabitants. Thus the whole number is two hundred and forty, with
                    which are combined the twenty-six aldermen, making a deliberative assembly of
                    two hundred and sixty-six members, of which the Lord Mayor is always president.
                    They meet in a commodious apartment at Guildhall, where the aldermen have an
                    elevated row of seats at one end; but their votes are counted with those of the
                    common council, who are seated on the floor. The proceedings of this assembly
                    are conducted with regularity, the business of each day being announced to the
                    members by printed notices. Order is maintained by the power of the Lord Mayor,
                    who, if the debate should become intemperate, can, of his own will, close the
                    sitting, by ordering the mace to be removed. The law-officers of the
                    corporation, the Recorder and Common Sergeant, have seats in the court, but no
                    votes, though they mingle in the proceedings, as far as these are connected with
                    legal subjects.</p>
                <p>Besides these bodies, two important offices are filled by persons who may or may
                    not be members of the corporation. They are the two sheriffs,who are the
                    executive officers, not only of the city of London, but of the county of
                    Middlesex. To them all writs are directed, and they have the eustody of all
                    prisoners, and the painful duty of superintending the execution of all penal
                    laws. It is an honourable office, but an expensive one, unless (which is said to
                    be no uncommon practice of late) the profits of the office of under sheriff are
                    divided between that officer and the high sheriff, who appoints him. The
                    sheriffs are chosen exclusively by the livery, from amongst the freemen. It is
                    customary, on a fixed festival, for the Lord Mayor to drink to the health of a
                    number of gentlemen, which is supposed to be a recommendation of them to the
                    office of sheriff, and such persons frequently compound by a sum of money for
                    not being called upon to serve it. It is not, however, requisite that the health
                    of a person should be drank in this way, as any liveryman, without notice, may
                    propose a sheriff, and he may be chosen, by having a party of his supporters
                    collected in the Guildhall on the day of election, when very few persons attend,
                    if no previous expectation of a contest exists. In this way improper persons
                    have sometimes been chosen, who would not have been elected, if any opposition,
                    followed by a poll, had been previously arranged. In such eases, the character
                    of the other sheriff, and the ancient practice of the city, counteract any bad
                    influence or effect which might arise from such an appointment.</p>
                <p>The principal legal officer of the corporation is the Re-eorder, commonly a
                    barrister of eminence. He is chosen by the court of aldermen alone, and for
                    life. He had a salary of L.2500, and besides, might practise as an advocate at
                    the assizes in the counties; but recently, on account of the increase of
                    business, by the act including parts of Kent, Surrey, and Essex within the city
                    criminal court, the salary has been increased to L.3500, and he is not now
                    allowed to practise as an advocate. Next to him is the common Serjeant, who is
                    also a barrister. He is chosen by the common council, and has a salary of L.
                    1500 per annum. Both of these officers sit as judges in the trial of criminal
                    offences committed either within the city of London, or the county of Middlesex,
                    or in those parts of Surrey, Kent, and Essex, which, by the law, have been
                    brought within the limits of the jurisdiction of the court held in the Old
                    Bailey. The chamberlain is an officer of high dignity and ample emolument. He is
                    chosen by the livery at large, and only for one year, but is most commonly
                    reehosen each year, and in regard to long practice, it may be considered as an
                    office for life. He has the care of the money of the corporation, for which he
                    gives sufficient security. All freemen are admitted by him to their freedom upon
                    taking the prescribed oaths; and he has the settlement of all disputes between
                    masters and apprentices. Besides these offices are those of the city
                    remembrancer, the city solicitor, the town-clerk, and the city comptroller,
                    which are important and lucrative, and many inferior officers, most of whom, as
                    vacancies occur, are chosen by the court of common council by ballot.</p>
                <p>The dignity and power of the first city officer, the Lord Mayor, is very great.
                    He becomes, when sworn in, the king’s representative in the civil government of
                    the city; the chief commissioner of the lieutenancy; perpetual coroner and
                    eseheator within the city and liberties of the city and borough of Southwark;
                    chief justice of oyer and terminer, and gaol delivery of Newgate; judge of the
                    courts of Wardmote at the election of aldermen; conservator of the rivers Thames
                    and Medway; chief commissioner in all affairs relating to the river Lea; and
                    chief butler to the king at the coronation, for which, as a fee, he is entitled
                    to a gold cup, with a cover and a ewer of gold.</p>
                <p>The office is one of the most constant attendance, and such are the restraints of
                    its duties during the year, that whoever undertakes it, usually arranges his
                    commercial affairs so as to be able to withdraw his attention from them
                    altogether, and devote his whole time to the public service. A salary, in some
                    measure appropriate to the dignity of the office, is annually allowed by the
                    corporation, amounting to L. 8000, besides the use of the magnificent
                    mansion-house as a residence, and the splendid furniture and carriages which
                    have been provided. In the ease of liberal and hospitable Lord Mayors this sum
                    has been considerably below the actual expenditure, but with some it has been
                    found sufficient, and a few have been so parsimonious, that they have not nearly
                    expended the amount voted for the support of the office.</p>
                <p>One of the greatest occasions of expense consists in the annual procession by
                    land and water, on what is called the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208560"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-8560-0549"/>Lord Mayor’s Day, the 9th of November, when he
                    enters fnto office. On that occasion the new Lord Mayor meets he aldermen,
                    sheriffs, recorder, and other great officers, It an early hour at the Guildhall,
                    whence, in the state car-jiage, attended by them in their respective carriages,
                    he proceeds to London Bridge, where they embark in the city itate barge, and,
                    accompanied by the barges of the city ' ompanies, proceed up the river, and land
                    at Westminster Bridge. The party walk to Westminster Hall, where his uordship,
                    after some ancient ceremonies, takes the pre-cribed oaths before the Barons of
                    the Exchequer. He <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> hen passes with the recorder to
                    each of the courts in the ∣ιall, and invites the several judges.to dinner on
                    that day, then he again embarks, and the procession descends the iverto
                    Blackfriars Bridge and there lands. From thence us Lordship is preceded by the
                    artillery company, next o which march the company of which he is a member, and
                    hen the other city companies in their regular order, with ∣lιeir distinguishing
                    banners and bands of music; amongst he rest, the armourers have usually persons
                    on horseback, ∙ompletely equipped in various kinds of ancient armour. To these
                    succeed the domestics and servants of the Lord Mayor, and then the state coach,
                    finely ornamented with ’bundance of gilding, and so large as to contain between
                    he seats two stools, on one of which, facing the door, sits he sword-bearer with
                    the sword of state, and on the other he mace-bearer carrying the city macc. The
                    train is clos-d by the carriages of the retired Lord Mayor, of the alder-nan,
                    the recorder, the sheriffs, the chamberlain, the common erjcant, the town-clerk,
                    and other great officers, and the ∣roccssion returns to the Guildhall. This
                    annual proces-ion excites great interest both on land and water, and ex-liibits
                    an extraordinary display of municipal splendour. The lay closes at Guildhall by
                    an entertainment of appropriate nagnificence, at which it is common to see
                    members of the oyal family, the most distinguished public characters, and i∙ften
                    the ambassadors of foreign courts. About a thousand ndividuals take their seats
                    at this dinner, to which they ire admitted by tickets from the Lord Mayor and
                    Sheriffs, who, in fixed proportions, bear their share of the expense, which
                    generally amounts to about L. 3000.</p>
                <p>Under the corporation of London criminal justice is extensively administered. At
                    the sessions the Lord Mayor is supposed to preside even when the judges are
                    trying prisoners, and the presence of at least one alderman is deemed necessary.
                    The Lord Mayor sits daily at the Mansionhouse for the examination of offenders,
                    and the committal of prisoners for trial; and an alderman, on fixed days in each
                    week, attends for the same purpose at Guildhall, the aldermen being all <hi
                    rend="italic">ex officio</hi> justices of the peace. There are inferior courts
                    for the recovery of small debts, and some for the determination of civil causes,
                    such as the Lord Mayor’s Court, the Court of Hustings, the Sheriffs’ courts, and
                    some others.</p>
                <p>The management of the great estates and other property belonging to the
                    corporation require much attention. The care devolves on the court of common
                    council, which, for this purpose, is divided into committees, that regulate
                    whatever relates to the several divisions into which the property is classed,
                    but under the ultimate direction of the general court. Each of these committees
                    has one or more aldermen nominated as members of it, and the other members are
                    appointed by the court in regular rotation. The committees which have the most
                    business to transact are those of the Irish estates, of the city lands, and of
                    the bridge estates; but there are several others, some of them permanent, and
                    others only appointed as occasions require their formation.</p>
                <p>This sketch of the corporation of London might have been fuller and more minute
                    if the report of the Commissioners of Municipal Corporation inquiry had been
                    printed. It may be proper, however, to notice the general apprehension, that all
                    corporate bodies will, in a few years, present a different appearance from that
                    which they have hitherto done; and that London, though the last, will certainly
                    undergo a renovation, which may render any greater extension of this branch of
                    our subject an unnecessary and uninteresting enlargement.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">London,</hi><hi rend="italic">New,</hi> a city and port of
                    entry in the United States of North America, in New London county, Connecticut.
                    It is situated on the western bank of the river Thames, three miles from its
                    mouth, and thirteen miles south of Norwich. The town is irregularly laid out,
                    but has convenient public buildings, and churches for Congregationalists,
                    Episcopalians, Baptists, and Methodists. New London harbour is the best in the
                    state; and packets and steam-boats ply regularly between the port and New York.
                    It is defended by Fort Trumbull on the west side of the river, and by Fort
                    Griswold on the east side. There is likewise a lighthouse, which has been
                    erected on a point projecting pretty far into the sound. A considerable commerce
                    is carried on, both in the coasting trade with the southern states, and in
                    foreign trade with the West Indies. The population amounted in 1821 to 3330, and
                    in 1831 to 4356. Long. 72. 9. W. Lat. 4L 22. N.</p>
