                    of eminent talents and learning, and of the most exalted piety, was born in the
                    year 1611. His father, Alexander Leighton, a descendant of the ancient family of
                    Ulyshaven in Forfarshire, commenced his academical studies at St Andrews, and
                    afterwards rep&gt;aired to Leyden, where he took the degree of Μ. D. That he
                    ever took the degree of D. D∙ seems to be asserted without sufficient evidence:
                    as he became a clergyman, it was apparently taken for granted that he must have
                    proceeded in the theological faculty. That he never was a professor of
                    philosophy in the university of Edinburgh, is still more certain. Dr Leighton
                    fixed his residence in London, where he betook himself to the practice of
                    physic, but met with strong opposition from the college of physicians. He was
                    however doomed to encounter persecution in a more appalling form. His
                    indignation was violently moved by the lordly pretensions and popish practices
                    of the bishops of those days; and he was induced to prepare an elaborate volume,
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Sions</hi><hi rend="italic">Plea against
                    the Prelacies</hi> in which his indignation was very strongly expressed. With
                    the view of conducting his work through the press, he retired to Holland; and we
                    find that the year 1629 he became minister of the English church at Utrecht. But
                    his conscientious scruples respecting the observance of the appointed festival
                    days, which he doubtless regarded as a remnant of superstition, induced him to
                    resign his charge within the space of a few months.<note anchored="true"

                    and it was immediately perceived that the author had treated the bishops with
                    uncompromising severity, describing them as men of blood, and maintainers of
                    superstitious worship and antichristian government. This last position was
                    verified by the inhuman treatment to which he was himself subjected. He was soon
                    afterwards arrested by two pursuivants of the high commission, and was first
                    conducted to the house of Dr Laud, who was then bishop of London, and who may
                    with sufficient propriety be described as the inquisitor general of England. On
                    the bishop’s warrant he was committed to a dark, cold, and loathsome dungeon in
                    Newgate, to a place not fit for the reception of a Christian’s dog, and there he
                    was kept, without meat or drink, from Tuesday night to Thursday at noon. It was
                    only after a dismal interval of fifteen weeks that the inquisitors would permit
                    even his wife to visit him. Four days after his commitment, she had been treated
                    with the most barbarous inhumanity and indecency by a pursuivant and other
                    ruffians, who were sent to ransack his house, under the pretext of searching for
                    Jesuits books. They presented a pistol to the breast of a boy five years of age,
                    threatening to shoot him if he did not inform them where the books were to be
                    found; “and so affrighted the poor child, that he never recovered it all his
                    days.” They not only carried off books and manuscripts, but robbed the house of
                    arms, clothes, and furniture. His wife had sufficient courage to remind them
                    that a day of reckoning might yet come; and come it did, in a signal manner, to
                    the chief authors and abettors of such flagitious proceedings. Some of Laud’s
                    emissaries infested him in Newgate; and, by means of flattering and deceitful
                    promises, one of them prevailed upon him to confess that he was the writer of
                    the book in question. During a subsequent visit, he offered to procure him
                    pardon and favour, on condition of his disclosing the names of those who had
                    encouraged him to write; but although nearly five hundred individuals had, by
                    their subscriptions, testified their approbation of Sions Plea, he had too much
                    magnanimity to betray anyone of his friends and adherents. After this refusal,
                    he was brought before the court of Star-Chamber, and required to answer a long
                    information, setting forth his many and grievous offences. He admitted that he
                    was the author of the book, but denied all criminality of intention. No counsel
                    dared to plead his cause, and he returned to prison in order to await his doom.
                    It was the opinion of four physicians that poison had been administered to him
                    in Newgate. He had been seized with a violent distemper, which was accompanied
                    with loathsome symptoms, and his strength was so completely exhausted that he
                    could not be produced before this atrocious court. In his absence the following
                    sentence was unanimously pronounced on the 4th of June 1630: that Dr Leighton
                    should pay a fine of L. 10,000; that the high commission should degrade him from
                    his ministry; that he should be brought to the pillory at Westminster during the
                    sitting of the court, and should there be whipped; that after whipping he should
                    be set upon the pillory for a convenient time, should have one of his ears cut
                    off, one side of his nose slit, and his face branded with the letters S. S.
                    denoting a Sower of Sedition; that he should then be carried back to prison,
                    and, after an interval of a few days, should again be pilloried at Cheapside,
                    should then likewise be whipped, have his other ear cut off, and the other side
                    of his nose slit; and should then be detained in close custody in the
                    Fleet-prison for the remainder of his life. When this sentence was pronounced,
                    it has been stated that Laud pulled off his cap, and gave thanks to the God of
                    mercy; nor does such an act appear to be in any respect inconsistent with the
                    general character of the ferocious and unrelenting bigot to whom it is
                    imputed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Even in the
                    solitude of his prison, Laud seems to have entertained a deliberate opinion that
                    Dr Leighton’s punishment had fallen short of his deserts. “In which book of
                    his,” he remarks very coolly, “were many things, <hi rend="italic">which in some
                    times mi&lt;dit have cost him dearer.”</hi> (Hist, of the Troubles and Tryal of
                    Laud, vol. i. p. 198.) The archiepiscopal palace was converted into a state
                    prison, of which Leighton was appointed keeper; and this amiable prelate felt it
                    as a great trial of his patience, that a person who had thus “been censured in
                    the Star-Chamber,” should come with a warrant from the House of Commons to
                    demand the keys. See likewise p. 203, and Dr Nalson’s Collection, vol. i. p.

                    the high-churchmen of our own times describe as an excellent prelate. Between
                    the passing and the execution of the sentence, Leighton made his escape from
                    prison; and two of his countrymen, named Anderson and Elphinstone, were each
                    fined L.500 for aiding and abetting him in his flight. He was however retaken in
                    Bedfordshire; and, before the expiration of a fortnight, having again been
                    committed to the Fleet, he endured the first part of his punishment on the 26th
                    of November: it was inflicted with the most unrelenting severity; the second
                    part followed after a short interval; and his bodily frame having thus been
                    miserably shattered, he lingered in prison for the tedious space of nearly ten
                    years.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>- Rushworth’s

                    Edinburgh, and became one of its brightest ornaments. He “was accounted a saint
                    from his youth up ;” but he seems originally to have had, what the readers of
                    his works could not easily have supposed, some slight propensity to satire. He

                    college for writing this epigram; but if the statement is correct, he must
                    speedily have been re-admitted. Among Wodrow’s MSS. in the Advocates Library
                    (Rob. III. 6. 14), a copy of the epigram is followed by an <hi rend="italic"

                    That he made uncommon progress in his studies, is sufficiently evident from his
                    works. He took the degree of A. Μ. in the year 1631. After he left the
                    university, his father, who was then, groaning under the rod of the oppressor,
                    sent him to travel on the continent, and he thus enlarged his knowledge of men
                    and manners. Among other places, he visited Douay, where some of his relations
                    were then residing. In France he spent several years, and learned to speak the
                    language like a native. Returning to the land of his fathers, he became a
                    clergyman of the presbyterian church, having on the 16th of December 1641 been
                    ordained minister of Newbattle, a parish within seven miles of Edinburgh. He had
                    now attained the age of thirty, and was qualified by his natural endowments, as
                    well as by his acquired knowledge, to appear with singular advantage in his
                    public capacity. “His preaching,” says Bishop Burnet, “had a sublimity both of
                    thought and expression in it. The grace and gravity of his pronunciation was
                    such, that few heard him without a very sensible emotion: I am sure Į never did.
                    It was so different from all others, and indeed from every thing that one could
                    hope to rise up to, that it gave a man an indignation at himself and all others.
                    It was a very sensible humiliation to me, and, for some time after I heard him,
                    I could not bear the thought of my own performances, and was out of countenance
                    when I was forced to think of preaching. His style was rather too fine; but
                    there was a majesty and beauty in it that left so deep an impression, that I
                    cannot yet forget the sermons I heard him preach thirty years ago. And yet with
                    this he seemed to look on himself as so ordinary a preacher, that while he had a
                    cure, he was ready to employ all others, and when he was a bishop, he chose to
                    preach to small auditories, and would never give notice beforehand: he had
                    indeed a very low voice, and could not be heard by a great crowd.”<note

                <p>The leading clergy of that period were men of fervent zeal, and several of them
                    possessed no mean share of learning; but in various instances the heat of their
                    zeal seems to have dried up the sources of their Christian charity; nor did they
                    think it lawful, not to say expedient, to tolerate any differences of religious
                    opinion. The sinfulness of toleration was a topic too frequently inculcated. It
                    must at the same time be recollected that there was no existing church from
                    which the principles of toleration could then be learned. The bishop proceeds to
                    state that Leighton “soon came to see into the follies of the presbyterians, and
                    to dislike their covenant; particularly the imposing it, and their fury against
                    all who differed from them. He found they were not capable of large thoughts:
                    theirs were narrow, as their tempers were sour. So he grew weary with mixing
                    with them. He scarce ever went to their meetings, and lived in great retirement,
                    minding only the care of his own parish at Newbottle near Edenborough. Yet all
                    the opposition that he made to them was, that he preached up a more exact rule
                    of life than seemed to them consistent with human nature: but his own practice
                    did even outshine his doctrine.” Let it in the mean time be remembered that the
                    follies of the episcopalians were at least equally conspicuous, and that they
                    took a more bloody direction. The presbyterians did not let loose a ferocious
                    band of ruffians to cut the throats of men and women, if they merely refused to
                    pray as they were directed.</p>
                <p>In the year 1648 Leighton declared in favour of the engagement for the king, and
                    thus exposed himself to the hazard of being subjected to heavy penalties. When
                    some of his parishioners who had been concerned in the unfortunate expedition to
                    England, were enjoined to make a public profession of their repentance, he
                    studiously avoided all mention of the grounds of the war, but admonished them
                    that “they had been in an expedition, in which, he believed, they had neglected
                    their duty to God, and had been guilty of injustice and violence, of
                    drunkenness, and other immoralities, and he charged them to repent of these very
                    seriously.” The earl of Lothian, who resided in his parish, and entertained a
                    high esteem for his character, had sufficient influence to protect him from any
                    serious annoyance. It is however evident that he found himself placed in a very
                    uncomfortable situation; and his uneasiness must in no small degree have been
                    encreased by the differences which unhappily ensued between the resolutioners
                    and protesters. He was at length induced to resign the pastoral charge of
                    Newbattle. This resignation took place in the year 1652; and, under the date of
                    May 24, 1653, we find the subsequent record of a conversation with Brodie, one
                    of the judges. “I spoke with Mr Leighton. He did shew me that the composing of
                    our differences was not a harder task than the finding out the Lord’s mind by
                    them, both the procuring and final cause. He thought holiness, the love of God
                    and our brethren, was the chief duty God was calling us unto, and sobriety and
                    forbearance to one another. He knew not if it were not from his natural temper,
                    or something of the English air; but he thought it was the safest to incline <hi

                    >partem.</hi> Much persecution was there upon our imposing upon one another, as
                    if we were infallible, allowing none that differed from ourselves in the least
                    measure. He thought the Lord would break that which we would’so f⅛in hold up,
                    our judicatories: he had observed so much of our own spirit in them these many
                    years past, that he had lothed them for the most part, and wearied of
                    them.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Diary of

                <p>The office of principal of the university of Edinburgh became vacant by the death
                    of John Adamson in the year 1652. He was a man of learning and reputation, nor
                    did the electors fail to look for a worthy successor. Their first choice fell
                    upon William Colville, minister of the English church atUtrecht; but some
                    difficulties, whether political or ecclesiastical, having been interposed,
                    Leighton was elected on the 17th of January 1653, and was persuaded to accept of
                    an office for which be was so eminently qualified by his character, his talents,
                    and his attainments. With the office of principal is conjoined that of primarius
                    professor of divinity. The other professor of divinity was David Dickson, who
                    published several theological works, and was a man of high consideration with
                    his own party. Some of Dr Leighton’s academical prelections, as well as his
                    addresses to the students, have been preserved, and they exhibit the author in
                    the most favourable light. He continued several years in that post, says Burnet,
                    “and was a great blessing in it; for he talked so to all the youth of any
                    capacity or distinction, that it had great effect on many of them. He preached
                    often to them; and if crowds broke in, which they were apt to do, he would have
                    gone on in his sermon in Latin, with a purity and life that charmed all who
                    understood it. Thus he had lived above twenty years in Scotland, in the highest
                    reputation that any man in my time ever had in that kingdom.”</p>
                <p>During the vacations, he made occasional excursions to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193204174" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4174-0213"/>England, and even to
                    Flanders. He had an opportunity of observing the character of the eminent men
                    who frequented the protector’s court; but, according to the account which he
                    gave to his friend, “he could never see any thing among them that pleased him.
                    They were men of unquiet and meddling tempers; and their discourses and sermons
                    were dry and unsavoury, full of airy cant, or of bombastic swellings. Sometimes
                    he went over to Flanders, to see what he could find in the several orders of the
                    church of Rome. There he found some of Jansenius’s followers, who seemed to be
                    men <hi rend="italic">of</hi> extraordinary tempers, and studied to bring
                    things, if possible, to the purity and simplicity of the primitive ages; on
                    which all his thoughts were much set.” The restoration of a heartless and
                    profligate monarch, who had derived no wisdom from experience, introduced a
                    material and fatal change in the state of ecclesiastical affairs in Scotland.
                    The great body of the people were firmly and zealously attached to the
                    presbyterian polity and form of worship, which Charles had solemnly promised to
                    maintain: but episcopacy was considered as more favourable to those maxims of
                    government which he and some of his councillors were inclined to propose; and
                    the resolution, equally iniquitous and impolitic, was finally adopted of forcing
                    upon his northern subjects an ecclesiastical establishment, which the most
                    honest and devout portion of them regarded as but one small degree removed from
                    popery. The undaunted opposition to the innovations of the late unfortunate
                    reign, seems to have been utterly erased from the memory of those who now
                    devised the restoration of episcopacy in Scotland. It was doubtless thought a
                    wise and dexterous measure to place at the head of this new establishment a very
                    conspicuous proselyte from the presbyterian cause, James Sharp, who had recently
                    been appointed professor of divinity at St Andrews,<note anchored="true"

                    accredited agent of the Scotish clergy. He was a person of address and of
                    talents for business; but being at the same time aspiring and unscrupulous, he
                    could not resist the temptation which was now presented to him; and in an evil
                    hour he entered upon a career of ambition which he pursued with great violence,
                    and which was at length brought to a very tragical termination. Sharp was
                    nominated to the archbishopric of St Andrews, Fairfowl to that of Glasgow;
                    Sydserf, who had been bishop of Brechin and Galloway, and who was the sole
                    survivor of the ancient bench, to the see of Orkney; and Hamilton, a brother of
                    Lord Belhaven, to that of Galloway. Leighton, who was then in London, on his
                    return from Bath, where he had been residing for the benefit of his health, was
                    persuaded to accept of a bishopric, and he selected that of Dunblane, a small
                    diocese, as well as a small revenue. He had previously cultivated an
                    acquaintance with several episcopalians, and, among others, with the father of
                    Bishop Burnet. He was a man of so much primitive piety, and was so
                    uncontaminated with worldly ambition, that no person of ordinary candour can
                    impute his change to any unworthy motive. He evidently considered church
                    government as a matter not determined by any positive injunctions, but open to
                    the adjustment of bodies of men varying in their opinions, and placed in a
                    variety of circumstances. In the mere name of a bishop there is nothing
                    pernicious; but that the office may be rendered highly pernicious, the history
                    of the church has too clearly evinced. According to Dr Paley, “the appointment
                    of various orders in the church, may be considered as the stationing of
                    ministers of religion in the various ranks of civil life. The distinctions of
                    the clergy ought, in some measure, to. correspond with the distinctions of
                    lay-society, in order to supply each class of the people with a clergy <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> their own level and description, with whom they may live
                    and associate upon terms of equality.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    office, the English curate is reduced to the condition of the labouring poor,
                    and the archbishop is raised to the level of the first nobility. All this is
                    frequently described as very apostolical: but we are not aware that the apostles
                    recommended their successors to a seat in the house of lords; nor have they
                    clearly taught us to infer that the prosperity of the church of Christ has any
                    necessary connexion with such splendour. We recollect the appropriate remark of
                    a writer eminently distinguished by his acuteness and candour of mind.
                    “Exorbitant wealth annexed to offices,” says Dr Campbell, “may be said
                    universally to produce two effects. These two effects are, arrogance and
                    laziness.” And on this subject what were the sentiments of Dr Leighton? “It is
                    true,” he remarks, <hi rend="superscript"> ςς</hi> that penury and want of
                    competency in temporals, in those who bring an eternal treasure, argues base
                    ingratitude, and is most unworthy of well-constituted churches. But where the
                    remedy exceeds too tar, it becomes worse than the disease, being compounded of
                    carnal prudence and ambition, both of which are enmity to God.” Ecclesiastics
                    raised to great and superfluous wealth, may in some instances be fully as much
                    inclined to imitate the folly as to improve the piety of their fashionable
                    associates. We are very far from wishing to reduce the order to a primitive
                    state <hi rend="italic">of</hi> poverty; but we are not prepared to acquiesce in
                    the opinion, that the personal respectability, or the spiritual influence, of a
                    clergyman, is more effectually secured by five thousand than by five hundred
                    pounds a year.</p>
                <p>The nomination of the other bishops was chiefly left to Dr Sharp; but the
                    promotion of Dr Leighton, who was not such a person as he would have been
                    inclined to select, was solely imputed to his brother Sir Ellis Leighton, who
                    was at that period secretary to the duke of York. In his face, as well as in the
                    vivacity of his talents, he resembled the bishop of Dunblane, but in other
                    respects no two individuals could be more unlike each other. The knight was as
                    unprincipled as the other courtiers of that time and place. In order to favour
                    his schemes of ambition, he had embraced the Romish faith, and the general tenor
                    of his conduct exhibited a great laxity of moral feeling. But, in such a foul
                    atmosphere, who could be free from contamination? He was intimately acquainted
                    with Lord Aubigny, a brother of the duke of Richmond’s, who had not only changed
                    his religion, but had even entered into holy orders. It was perhaps one
                    recommendation to the king’s favour, that he led a very vicious life; and as he
                    was in the secret of his majesty’s religion, and' was acquainted with his
                    private schemes for the advancement of popery, he enjoyed an ample share of his
                    confidence. Sir Ellis impressed this nobleman with a very high opinion of his
                    brother’s qualifications: he did not overlook his celibacy and his ascetic mode
                    of life, as being conformable to the popish notions of piety; nor did he scruple
                    to aver, what was very remote from the truth, that he was persuaded of his being
                    secretly inclined to their own faith. Through this polluted channel did the
                    learned and pious Leighton arrive at his high station in the church; for at the
                    suggestion of Aubigny, the king nominated him to a bishopric, and thus excited
                    the suspicion of Sharp, who did not wish for a coadjutor of his spiritual habits
                    and superior character. It was not without<pb break="no" facs="nls:193204187"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-4187-0214"/> the utmost reluctance that he was induced to
                    accept of this preferment. Of the four bishops-elect, only two had received
                    episcopal ordination; but before the consecration of the other two, Sharp and
                    Leighton, it was considered as absolutely necessary to ordain them deacons and
                    priests. The same necessity was not recognized at the consecration of Scotish
                    bishops in the year 1610; for when Bishop Andrews maintained that they must
                    first be ordained presbyters, as having received no episcopal ordination,
                    Archbishop Bancroft replied that “there was no necessity, seeing where bishops
                    could not be had, the ordination given by the presbyters must be esteemed
                    lawful; otherwise that it might be doubted if there were any lawful vocation in
                    most of the reformed churches.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    opinion was likewise maintained by the founders of the English reformation; and
                    Cranmer has unequivocally stated that “a bishop may make a priest by the
                    Scriptures, and so may princes and governors alsoe, and that by the auctority of
                    God committed to them, and the people alsoe by their election.” Archbishop
                    Whitgift declares that no form of government is by the Scriptures prescribed to
                    the church of God; and the mutability of ecclesiastical government is asserted
                    by Hooker, and other distinguished writers of that period. This indeed appears
                    to have been a prevalent opinion, till the pontificate of the unhappy Laud, who
                    was but too anxious to complete the assimilation of the English with the Romish
                    hierarchy, and whose mind was deeply tinctured with the most abject
                    superstition. The divine right of episcopacy was not however maintained by some
                    of the most eminent divines of the succeeding age. Bishop Stillingfleet, in a
                    very learned and able work, <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> has completely
                    demonstrated that bishop and presbyter were originally different appellations of
                    the same office-bearers; that the apostles have nowhere enjoined any particular
                    form of ecclesiastical polity; and that “a mere 'apostolical practice being
                    supposed, is not sufficient of itself tor the founding an unalterable and
                    perpetual right for that form of government in the church, which is supposed to
                    be founded on that practice.” And as to what is called the perpetual succession
                    in the church, <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> he has distinctly averred, that
                    “this personal succession, so much spoken of, is sometimes attributed to
                    presbyters, even after the. distinction came into use between bishops and
                    them.”—To this idle or arrogant ceremony of reordination, Sharp, who “had
                    swallowed down greater matters,” submitted with no small reluctance; but, as Dr
                    Mitchell has remarked, “Leighton submitted easily to this, not because he was
                    eager to put on a mitre, but because he had good sense enough, and a sufficient
                    acquaintance with Scripture, and the writings of early antiquity, to know that
                    it was a matter of no consequence, whether he submitted to it or not.” These two
                    were privately ordained deacons'-ųmd priests; and on the 15th of December 1661,
                    all the four were publicly consecrated in Westminster Abbey. The good bishop of
                    Dunblane was scandalized at the feasting and jollity which followed this
                    religious ceremony. They travelled towards Scotland in one coach; and Leighton
                    stated to Burnet that he believed his associates were weary of him, for he was
                    very weary of them. When he found that they intended to enter the metropolis
                    with some degree of pomp, he left them at Morpeth, and reached Edinburgh a few
                    days before them. The other bishops made a kind of triumphal entry; the lord
                    chancellor, with the nobility and privy counsellors, as well as the city
                    magistrates, having joined in a procession, and met them in due form. Soon after
                    their arrival, other six bishops were consecrated; but they were not subjected
                    to the previous ceremonial of being ordained deacons and priests. Parliament
                    assembled in the month of April 1662, and most of the bishops immediately took
                    their seats: Leighton did not however appear among them, and he adhered to the
                    practice of only attending in his place when he expected some discussion
                    concerning religion or the church. He did not permit his friends to give him the
                    title of lord, nor did he willingly acquiesce in its being given to him by
                    others; for he evidently had not unlearned the presbyterian lesson, that Christ
                    has no lords in his house.</p>
                <p>He speedily found that his new associates were for the most part men from whom
                    the cause of religion could derive very slender aid, and that the affairs of the
                    church were managed with as little wisdom as moderation. Sharp, though a man of
                    talents, was artful and insincere. Of the other prelates, very few were
                    eminently distinguished by either learning or piety, and the parochial clergy
                    were in all respects greatly inferior to those whom they had supplanted. “By
                    these means,” says Bishop Burnet, “Leigh-toun quickly lost all heart and hope;
                    and said often to me upon it, that in the whole progress of that affair there
                    appeared such cross characters of an angry providence, that, lww fully soever he
                    was satisfied in his own mind as to episcopacy itself, yet it seemed that God
                    was against them, and that they were not like to be the men that should build up
                    his church; so that the struggling against 'it seemed to him like a fighting
                    against God. He who had the greatest hand in it proceeded with so much
                    dissimulation; and the rest of the order were so mean and selfish; and the earl
                    of Middleton, with the other secular men that conducted it, were so openly
                    impious and vicious, that it did cast a reproach on every thing relating to
                    religion, to see it managed by such instruments.” He governed his own diocese
                    like a truly Christian bishop, labouring very assiduously in his vocation, and
                    uniformly pursuing measures of gentleness and conciliation. But the
                    ecclesiastical, as well as the civil rulers, were generally inclined to pursue
                    measures of so opposite a nature, that he at length adopted the resolution of
                    resigning his bishopric. This resolution he announced to the clergy of Dunblane
                    in the year 1665, and afterwards proceeded to London, for the purpose of
                    communicating it to the king. He gave his majesty a true account of the
                    proceedings in Scotland, “which, he said, were so violent, that he could not
                    concur in the planting the Christian religion itself in such a manner, much less
                    a form of government. He therefore begged leave to quit his bishopric, and to
                    retire; for he thought he was in some sort accessory to the violences done by
                    others, since he was one of them, and all was pretended to be done to establish
                    them and their order.” The king appeared to be somewhat moved at the good
                    bishop’s recital; and having spoken of the primate with severe reprehension, he
                    promised to enforce a more lenient method of proceeding with the nonconformists.
                    He thus prevailed upon Leighton to retain his bishopric; and he so far fulfilled
                    his promise as to suspend the functions of the ecclesiastical commission. But
                    most of his Scotish ministers were so utterly destitute of all principle and
                    humanity, that no material improvements ensued. The presbyterians were subjected
                    to such intolerable grievances, that at length, in the year 1666, they had
                    recourse to arms, but their military proceedings were <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193204200" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4200-0215"/>very speedily terminated at
                    the battle of Pentland-hills.' The atrocious murders committed among a
                    conscientious and resolute people, were committed under the sanction of a king
                    who had once professed the same religion with themselves, and who was now
                    consigning them to the sword and halter, because they refused to adopt the rites
                    of a church whose creed he had secretly renounced. If every other action of his
                    life had been free from reproach, this cold-blooded and unrelenting villany
                    would alone have been sufficient to ensure the execration of all posterity. What
                    a lamentable picture of human depravity was exhibited in the two monarchs of
                    Britain and France; men immersed in the most debasing sensuality, surrounded by
                    the most profligate of both sexes, and, from the polluted atmosphere in which
                    they daily breathed, sending forth mandates to their subjects to shape their
                    religious creed and ritual according to the pattern which their majesties were
                    graciously pleased to prescribe. To this point, the matter only seems capable of
                    exciting derision; but a very different sentiment arises in the mind when we
                    recollect that both Charles and Louis were prepared to carry havoc and
                    devastation where other means of conversion had been found ineffectual. In the
                    French king there might be a certain species of consistency when he cut the
                    throats of his protestant subjects, because they refused to embrace popery: but
                    in the English king there was manifestly none when he cut the throats of his
                    presbyterian subjects, because they refused to embrace episcopacy; unless we can
                    discover some consistency in the mere consideration, that those converted to
                    episcopacy were brought one step nearer to his own faith.</p>
                <p>In the midst of these direful scenes of persecution, the gentle spirit of
                    Leighton must have been heavily afflicted. He opposed all the violent methods of
                    producing a formal compliance with the established mode of worship; and to the
                    nonconformists of his own diocese he granted a liberty of conscience which the
                    laws of those flagitious times did not acknowledge. Not satisfied with this
                    limited indulgence, he made great exertions to secure a more general and
                    permanent toleration. With this view he repaired to court in the year 1669, and
                    had two audiences of the king. One of those who seconded his endeavours was Dr
                    Wilkins, bishop of Chester. The king at length addressed a letter to the privy
                    council, commanding them to indulge such of the presbyterian clergy as were
                    peaceable and loyal, so far as to suffer them to serve in vacant churches,
                    though they did not submit to the present establishment. But this indulgence was
                    not attended with any beneficial effects: the presbyterians and episcopalians
                    were alike dissatisfied, and the country long continued in a state of the most
                    unhappy agitation. It was violently opposed by the clergy of the diocese of
                    Glasgow; and the archbishop, Dr Alexander Burnet, gave so much offence to
                    Lauderdale by his zeal against it, that he found it expedient to retire to a
                    private station, with the provision of an annual pension. It was not without
                    much reluctance that Leighton was induced to accept of the vacant office. As his
                    translation was attended with some informalities, he became, according to the
                    strictness of the ecclesiastical law, not archbishop, but administrator of the
                    archbishopric.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Keith’s

                    course of the preceding year his friend Dr Gilbert Burnet had been elected
                    professor of divinity in that university. They appear to have lived upon terms
                    of great cordiality; and to Burnet, who became bishop of Salisbury, we are
                    indebted for a copious and most interesting record of his evangelical
                    virtues.</p>
                <p>Soon after his translation, he held a synod of his clergy, who uttered many
                    complaints of being deserted and ill-treated by the people. In his public and
                    private discourses, he exhorted them to consider themselves as ministers of the
                    cross of Christ, to lay aside all desire of revenge, and to humble themselves
                    before God. “This was a new strain to the clergy. They had nothing to say
                    against it; but it was a comfortless doctrine to them, and they had not been
                    accustomed to it. No speedy ways were proposed for forcing the people to come to
                    church, nor for sending soldiers among them, or raising the fines to which they
                    were liable. So they went home, as little edified with their new bishop as he
                    was with them.” Accompanied by the professor of divinity, he afterwards visited
                    some of the most eminent of the indulged ministers in different districts, with
                    the view of persuading them to listen to terms of accommodation. Although his
                    overtures were but coldly received, he was unwilling to abandon all hope of
                    conciliation. In the presence of the earls of Lauderdale, Rothes, Tweeddale, and
                    Kincardine, he held a conference at Edinburgh with six of the presbyterian
                    clergy. He spoke for nearly half an hour, with much gravity and force, but his
                    arguments in favour of episcopacy produced no effect upon those to whom they
                    were addressed, nor was a second conference attended with a different result. He
                    sent to the western counties six episcopal clergymen, Burnet, Charteris, Nairne,
                    Aird, Cook, and Paterson, who were commissioned to preach in vacant churches,
                    and to argue with the people on the grounds of conformity and accommodation.
                    “The people of the country,” says Burnet, “came generally to hear us, though not
                    in great crowds. We were indeed amazed to see a poor commonalty so capable to
                    argue upon points of government, and on the bounds to be set to the power of
                    princes in matters of religion: upon all these topics they had texts of
                    Scripture at hand; and were ready with their answers to any thing that was said
                    to them. This measure of knowledge was spread even among the meanest of them,
                    their cottagers, and their servants. They were indeed vain of their knowledge,
                    much conceited of themselves, and were full of a most entangled scrupulosity; so
                    that they found, or made, difficulties in everything that could be laid before
                    them. We staid ahout three months in the country; and in that time there was a
                    stand in the frequency of conventicles.” Against these conventicles two acts had
                    recently been passed. In reference to one of them, Leighton declared to the earl
                    of Tweeddale, that the entire tenor of it was so contrary to the common rules of
                    humanity, not to say Christianity, that he was ashamed to participate in the
                    councils of those who could frame and pass such laws. Nor must it be forgotten
                    that these atrocious laws were not suffered to continue a dead letter. At
                    Paisley the archbishop had another meeting with the presbyterians, to the number
                    of about thirty; and their conferences came to a final close in the month of
                    January 1671, when, at a meeting in the earl of Rothes’s house in Edinburgh,
                    Hutcheson declared, in the name of his party, that “they had considered the
                    propositions made to them, but were not satisfied in their consciences to accept
                    of them.”</p>
                <p>In the course of one year, four bishoprics became vacant, and the choice of them
                    was offered to Dr Burnet. Leighton was authorized to recommend such individuals
                    as he tíiought most worthy of promotion; but neither Burnet, Charteris, nor
                    Nairne, could be induced to undertake the episcopal office in the church, as it
                    was then constituted; and as they were among the most learned and respectable of
                    the episcopal clergy, he thus found himself beset with new discouragements. He
                    had failed in his endeavours to conciliate the presbyterians, and was suspected
                    and hated by the episcopalians. In utter despair of securing any benefit to
                    others or satisfaction to himself, he adopted the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193204213" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4213-0216"/>resolution of resigning his
                    preferment, and retiring from all public employment. He accordingly repaired to
                    London in 1672, and, not without considerable difficulty, obtained the king’s
                    permission to resign after an interval of one year. He however retained the
                    archbishopric till the year 1674, and Alexander Burnet was then restored to his
                    former dignity. Leighton now returned to Edinburgh, and for some time lived
                    within the precincts of the university; where the chair which he had occupied
                    was not unworthily filled by William Colville, who had been put in nomination at
                    the time of his own election. He afterwards retired to England, and spent the
                    remainder of his life with his sister Sapphira, the wife and finally the widow
                    of Mr Lightwater of Broadhurst, a demesne in the parish of Horsted Keynes and
                    county of Sussex. He had another sister married to a Mr Rathband, of whom we
                    find no further mention. His time was chiefly spent in devout seclusion, but he
                    frequently officiated in the parish church, and in some others of that vicinity.
                    In the year 1679, an attempt was made to draw him from his retreat: at the
                    suggestion of the duke of Monmouth, the king was induced to request that he
                    would again fix his residence in Scotland, and use his endeavours in reconciling
                    the ecclesiastical animosities which still prevailed in that country. “I desire
                    you may go down to Scotland with your first conveniency, and take all possible
                    pains for persuading all you can, of both opinions, to as much mutual
                    correspondence and concord as may be; and send me, from time to time, characters
                    both of men and things. In order to this design, I shall send you a precept for
                    two hundred pounds sterling upon my exchequer, till you resolve to serve me in a
                    stated employment.” But the duke soon afterwards ceased to have any influence in
                    the affairs of either kingdom, and this negociation seems to have made no
                    further progress.</p>
                <p>In the year 1684 Leighton was urged by Dr Burnet to make a journey to London, for
                    the purpose of meeting the earl of Perth, chancellor of Scotland, who had
                    expressed an earnest wish to see him; and his friend entertained a hope that
                    this “angelical man might have awakened in him some of those good principles
                    which he seemed once to have, and which were now totally extinguished in him.”
                    When he reached the metropolis, Burnet was surprised to see him look so fresh
                    and active at his advanced period of life: his hair was still black, and he
                    retained much of his former vivacity, with the same quickness of conception and
                    strength of memory. He however spoke of his work and journey being nearly
                    finished at the same time: he was next day seized with a pleurisy; on that which
                    ensued, he suddenly fell into a state of insensibility, which continued for
                    about twelve hours, and he then expired without pangs or convulsions. He was
                    constantly attended by that friend whose zeal had prevailed upon him to
                    undertake this fatal journey. He died on the 25th of June 1684, in the
                    seventy-fourth year of his age, ten years after he had ceased to be archbishop
                    of Glasgow. He closed his earthly pilgrimage at an inn in Warwick-lane, and his
                    remains were deposited at Horsted Keynes. A great portion of his income had been
                    devoted to deeds of charity and benevolence; and by a will, dated on the 17th of
                    February, he had destined the residue of his property to charitable uses.<note

                    Lightwater of Broadhurst, he only left a small token of grateful acknowledgement
                    of the great kindness with which they had treated him while he was their guest.
                    His library he bequeathed to the cathedral of Dunblane, for the use of the
                    clergy of that diocese; and although the fashion of a cathedral and diocese has
                    there passed away, the library is still preserved in the same place.</p>
                <p>The character of Leighton has been drawn by Bishop Burnet in very striking
                    colours. “He had great quickness of parts, a lively apprehension, with a
                    charming vivacity of thought and expression. He had the greatest command of the
                    purest Latin that ever I knew in any man. He was a master both of Greek and
                    Hebrew, and of the whole compass of theological learning, chiefly in the study
                    of the Scriptures. But that which exalted all the rest was, he was possessed
                    with the highest and noblest sense of divine things that I ever saw in any man.
                    He had no regard to his person, unless it was to mortify it by a constant low
                    diet, that was like a perpetual fast. He had a contempt both of wealth and
                    reputation. He seemed to have the lowest thoughts of himself possible, and to
                    desire that all other persons should think as meanly of him as he did himself:
                    he bore all sorts of ill usage and reproach, like a man that took pleasure in
                    it. He had so subdued the natural heat of his temper, that in a great variety of
                    accidents, and in a course of twenty-two years’ intimate conversation with him,
                    I never observed the least sign of passion, but upon one single occasion. He
                    brought himself into so composed a gravity, that I never saw him laugh, and but
                    seldom smile. And he kept himself in such a constant recollection, that I do not
                    remember that ever I heard him say one idle word. There was a visible tendency
                    in all he said to raise his own mind, and those he conversed with, to serious
                    reflections. He seemed to be in a perpetual meditation. And, though the whole
                    course of his life was strict and ascetical, yet he had nothing of the sourness
                    of temper that generally possesses men of that sort.”<note anchored="true"

                    commendation. “I have now laid together with great simplicity what has been the
                    chief subject of my thoughts for above thirty years. I was formed to them by a
                    bishop that had the greatest elevation of soul, the largest coinpass of
                    knowledge, the most mortified and most heavenly disposition, that I ever yet saw
                    in mortal; that had the greatest parts as well as virtues, with the perfectest
                    humility that I ever saw in man; and had a sublime strain of preaching, with so
                    grave a gesture, and with such a majesty both of thought, of language, of
                    pronunciation, that I never once saw a wandering eye where he preached, and have
                    seen whole assemblies often melt in tears before him; and of whom I can say with
                    great truth, that in a free, and frequent conversation with him for above two
                    and twenty years, I never knew him say an idle word, that had not a direct
                    tendency to edification: and I never once saw him in any other temper but that
                    which I wished to be in, in the last minutes of my life. For that pattern which
                    I saw in him, and for that conversation which I had with him, I know how much I
                    have to answer to God: and though my reflecting on that which I knew in him,
                    gives me just cause of being deeply humbled in my self, and before God, yet I
                    feel no more sensible pleasure in any thing, than in going over in my thoughts
                    all that I saw and observed in him.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Of his indifference to literary reputation we have a sufficient proof in the fact
                    of his never having committed any of his works to the press. For their

                    of the university of Glasgow, and, having vacated his office at the Revolution,
                    was collated to the precentorship of the cathedral of York.<note anchored="true"

                    of Queensberry’s in London.” (Vol. ii. p. 24.) Professor Scholefield apparently
                    considered him as some very obscure person: “edente quodam Jacobo

                    “Sermons; published at the desire of his friends after his death, from his
                    papers written with his own hand.” Lond. 1692, 8vo. This was followed by his
                    “Praelectiones Theologicae, in Auditorio Publico Academiae Edinburgenae (dum
                    Professoris Primarii munere ibi fungeretur) habitae: una cum Paraenesibus in
                    Comitiis Academicis ad Gradus Magistralis in Artibus Candidatos. Quibus
                    adjiciuntur Meditationes ethicocriticae in Psalmos iv. xxxii. cxxx. Ex Authoris
                    autographo fideliter editae.” Lond. 1693, 4to. Of a very recent date, there is a
                    more correct edition, published under the title of “Roberti Leighton, S. T. P.
                    Archiepiscopi Glasgnensis, Praelectiones Theologicae; Paraeneses; et
                    Meditationes in Psalmos iv. xxxii. cxxx. ethicocriticae. Editio nova, recensente

                    nuper Socio.” Cantabrigiae, 1828, 8vo. An English translation of the prelections
                    and exhortations had been published with the title of “Theological Lectures,
                    read in the Publick Hall of the University of Edinburgh; togetherwith
                    Exhortations to the Candidates for the Degree of Master of Arts: translated from
                    the original Latin.” Lond. 1763, 8vo. Mr Pearson is evidently mistaken in
                    supposing that these compositions had been translated by Dr Fall. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Meditationes</hi> were translated under the inspection of Dr
                    Doddridge, and inserted in his edition of the author’s works. Dr Fall next
                    edited “A practical Commentary upon the first Epistle General of St Peter.” York
                    and Lond. 1693 -4, 2 vols. 4to. The first volume was printed at York, and the
                    second at London. “Perhaps,” says the late Mr Orme, “there is no expository work
                    in the English language equal altogether to the exposition of Peter. It is rich
                    in evangelical sentiment and exalted devotion. The meaning is seldom missed, and
                    often admirably illustrated. There is learning without its parade, theology
                    divested of systematic stiffness, and eloquence in a beautiful flow of
                    unaffected language and appropriate imagery.”<note anchored="true"

                    commentary was followed by “An Exposition of the Creed, Lord’s Prayer, and ten
                    Commandments; with two Discourses, on St Matth, xxii. 37, 38, 39, and Heb. viii.
                    10; to which is annext a short Catechism.” Lond. 1701, 8vo. The volume contains
                    a portrait of the author, engraved by R. White. Of his works edited by Dr Fall,
                    the last is a small collection of Tracts. Lond. 1708, 12mo. It includes the
                    Rules for a Holy Life, a Sermon, and the Catechism. After a considerable
                    interval appeared “Select Works of Archbishop Leighton, some of which were never
                    before printed. To which is prefixed an account of the author’s life and
                    character.” Edinb. 1746, 8vo. This publication was soon followed by “The
                    Expository Works and other Remains of Archbishop Leighton, some of which were
                    never before printed. Revised by P. Doddridge, D. D. with a preface by the
                    doctor.” Edinb. 1748, 2 vols. 8vo. There are many other editions of a subsequent
                    date, but among these we shall only specify that of Lond. 1825, 4 vols. 8vo. To
                    this collective edition, which has been more than once reprinted, the Rev. John
                    Norman Pearson has prefixed a copious life of the author, and has made some
                    important additions to the old stock of biographical materials. (x.)</p>
