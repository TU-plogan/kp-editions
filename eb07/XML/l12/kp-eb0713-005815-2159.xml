                    poet and miscellaneous writer, was born at Kirkby-Steven, Westmoreland, in March
                    1735. He received the rudiments of his education, first at Winton, and
                    afterwards at Appleby, where he early distinguished himself by his assiduity and
                    proficiency. He left school in his eighteenth year, and, having no means of
                    defraying the expense of an university education, engaged himself as private
                    tutor to a family near Ripon. His next occupation was that of assistant in the
                    free school of Wakefield, then superintended by Mr Clarke. Whilst in this
                    situation he took deacon’s orders, and, it is said, became a popular preacher.
                    In the year 1759, Mr Clarke recommended him as preceptor to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193202172" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2172-0059"/>the sons of Mr Robert
                    Cracroft of Hackthorn, near Lincoln, who were no fewer than nine in number.
                    During his residence at Hackthorn, he published a volume of poems, which
                    attracted but little notice; and he also wrote some critical pieces, which were
                    rather more fortunate. In 1760, he entered his name at Clare-Hall, Cambridge, in
                    order to take the degree of bachelor of divinity: but as his name does not
                    appear in the list of the Cambridge graduates, it is more than probable that he
                    did not succeed in his object. About this time he became enamoured of one of Mr
                    Cracroft’s daughters, and having met with a refusal from the young lady,
                    immediately left his situation. In 1761, he officiated as curate at Dagenham,
                    where he produced a great variety of pieces, some of which he published. His
                    Letters on Religious Retirement were dedicated to Warburton, who returned him a
                    complimentary acknowledgment, in which he advised Langhorne to make some attempt
                    in the cause of religion. In 1764, having obtained the curacy and lectureship of
                    St John’s, Clerkenwell, he was enabled to reside in London, the great and ready
                    mart for literary talents. About this time he engaged with Mr Griffiths as a
                    writer in the <hi rend="italic">Monthly Peview,</hi> in which situation he
                    continued until about the year 1769, when his connection with the Review is
                    supposed to have ceased, in consequence of some dispute with the editor. His
                    employment as a critic procured him the acquaintance of many literary men,
                    whilst the vein of ridicule, which he occasionally indulged with more freedom
                    than discretion, made him many enemies, amongst whom were Churchill, Kelly, and
                    Kenrick, libellers by profession. In 1765, he produced a number of pieces,
                    besides publishing an edition of the poems of Collins, with a memoir and
                    critical notes. He replied to Churchill’s Prophecy of Famine, a libel against
                    the Scottish nation, in a poem entitled Genius and Valour, which obtained the
                    approbation of Dr Robertson the historian, and procured for him the degree of
                    doctor in divinity, which was conferred on him by the university of Edinburgh.
                    In 1767, Dr Langhorne married Miss Cracroft, the lady to whom he had so long
                    been attached, and with whom he had never ceased to correspond. But his
                    happiness was of short duration, as Mrs Langhorne died in childbirth, on the 4th
                    of March 1768. Not long after his wife’s death, he went to reside at Folkestone,
                    in Kent, where his brother officiated as perpetual curate. During his residence
                    at this place, the brothers occupied themselves in preparing a new translation
                    of Plutarch’s Lives, which appeared in 1770, and soon became a very popular
                    book. In the year 1772, Dr Langhorne paid a visit to his native country, where
                    he married a second wife, the daughter of a magistrate near Brough, and then set
                    out on a tour through part of France and the Netherlands, the scenery of which
                    afforded new themes for his industrious muse. In 1776 he lost his second wife,
                    who, like the former, died in childbed, leaving him a daughter. In 1777, at the
                    request of the Beuverie family, by whom he was much respected, he was presented
                    by the bishop, Dr Moss, with a prebend in the cathedral of Wells. But his career
                    was now approaching its close. He died on the 1st of April 1779, in the
                    forty-fifth year of his age. In 1804, his son published an edition of his poems
                    in two vols. 12mo, with a memoir of the author, to which we beg to refer our
                    readers for more ample details. Dr Langhorne was a man of an amiable disposition
                    and inoffensive manners, social in his habits, and possessed of a considerable
                    fund of wit, which he never abused or misapplied. The leading characteristics of
                    bis poetry are ease, fluency, and a considerable share of tenderness, without
                    much invention or originality. His prose writings are sufficiently varied to
                    satisfy us that he was a laborious and indefatigable writer. <hi
