                <p><label type="entry">LEIBNITZ, <hi rend="smallcaps">Godfrey William, Baron
                    de</hi></label>, a philosopher and mathematician of the first order, and the
                    most universal scholar of modern times, was born at Leipsig on the third of July
                    1646. At the age of six he lost his father, Frederick Leibnitz, professor of
                    law, and secretary to the university. After this event his mother placed him in
                    the school of St Nicoas at Leipsig. Here he learned the principles of the Greek
                    and Latin languages; but soon breaking through a routine ill suited to his
                    precocious disposition, he applied himself to the study of the classic writers
                    of both languages. Titus Livius and Virgil became his favourite authors; and in
                    his old age he could still repeat entire cantos of the Roman poet. Early
                    distinguished by a rare facility in performing his tasks, he often assisted such
                    of his companions as dulness or idleness prevented from completing their own;
                    and he himself informs us, that when scarcely fourteen, he composed in this way
                    three hundred Latin verses in one day, without any elisions; but he takes care
                    to add, “Credo a lectore non quaeri quam cito, sed quam bene.” At fifteen he
                    entered on his academical career in the university of Leipsig, and, under the
                    direction of Thomasius, devoted himself to the study of philosophy and the
                    mathematics. He then passed a year at Iena, and returned to Leipsig, where he
                    occupied himself with law and philosophy. Having soon mastered the details of
                    the philosophical and mathematical sciences, the genius of Leibnitz now took a
                    grander flight, directing him to the writings of Plato and of Aristotle. These
                    he not only read and thoroughly comprehended, but used to pass entire days in a
                    wood near Leipsig, endeavouring to reconcile the doctrines of the Academy with
                    those of the Lyceum. He was scarcely twenty when he wished to be received as
                    doctor of laws; but although some <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> petty jealousies
                    prevented his want of the requisite standing or age being dispensed with at
                    Leipsig, this favour was granted him without difficulty by the university of
                    Altorf, which at the same time offered him the situation of extraordinary
                    professor of law.</p>
                <p>This, however, he declined; and leaving Altorf, he proceeded to Nuremberg, where
                    a considerable number of men of science and learning were then assembled. At
                    that time a society of chemists in that city occupied themselves with
                    researches, the object of which was to discover the philosopher’s stone.
                    Tormented with a continual desire of acquiring something new, Leibnitz hoped to
                    find, even in the reveries of these visionaries, some aliment for his mind. With
                    this view he wrote to the society soliciting admission, and craving to be
                    initiated into their mysteries. This letter, which was full of abstruse terms
                    extracted from books of chemistry, and so conformable to the style of these
                    mystics that he himself did not understand it, had prodigious success. Leibnitz
                    was admitted a member of the society, and immediately appointed secretary
                    thereto. His duty in this capacity consisted in registering their processes and
                    experiments, and in extracting from the books of the chemists such things as
                    might be of use to his associates in prosecuting their researches.</p>
                <p>But happily for himself and the sciences, Leibnitz, whilst at Nuremberg, chanced
                    to make the acquaintance of the Baron de Boineburg, chancellor to the elector of
                    Mayence, who, being struck with his merit, and conceiving a high opinion of his
                    talents and learning, recommended to him to apply himself particularly to
                    history and jurisprudence, and expressed a desire to see him established at
                    Frankfort, at the same time promising to obtain him some employment under his
                    sovereign. Leibnitz followed the judicious counsel thus given him; and from this
                    epoch, 1667, may be dated the real commencement of his literary career. It was
                    at Frankfort that he brought out his <hi rend="italic">Nova</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Methodus</hi><hi rend="italic">discendae docendoeque</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Jurisprudentiam.</hi> This little volume contained a <hi
                    rend="italic">tableau</hi><hi rend="italic">raisonne</hi> of the objects
                    necessary for the double purpose expressed in the title; and in it he already
                    displayed that practical spirit which enabled him to produce so much that is
                    really useful. But that which placed its author in the first rank of
                    philosophical writers, was the new manner in which he treated his subject, and
                    the profound and ingenious views which he presented in regard to a science so
                    long abandoned to routine and pedantry. The order, the clearness, the precision
                    of the ideas, and the style which makes books live, contributed to give great
                    popularity to this production, which, at a subsequent period, the author himself
                    judged with impartiality.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Leibnitii <hi rend="italic">Opera Omnia,</hi> tom. iv. p. 4. Geneva, Dutens,
                    I7C8.</p></note> We may also mention here a treatise published in 1669 in favour
                    of the Prince of Neuburg, whom Leibnitz endeavoured to recommend to the Poles,
                    as uniting, in a higher degree than all his competitors, the qualities they
                    required in their king. This piece, which is somewhat lengthy, is written in
                    Latin, and consists of sixty propositions, proved by a rigorous series of
                    axioms, supported sometimes by expositions full of erudition, amongst which
                    maybe mentioned that under the head, <hi rend="italic">Eligendus Catholicus
                    esto.</hi> These propositions do not always follow in a necessary order; some of
                    them are superfluous; and the form is a little fatiguing, especially since the
                    interest of the subject has altogether ceased. The Prince of Neuburg was not
                    elected king. But the work of Leibnitz did not on that account make a less
                    sensation, and may, in fact, be regarded as a sort of <hi rend="italic">tour de
                    force.</hi> Boineburg, at whose request it had been composed, observing <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193204044" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4044-0203"/> with satisfaction
                    that Leibnitz justified the idea which he had conceived of his talents, attached
                    him to the service of the elector, by causing him to be appointed counsellor of
                    the chamber of revision in the chancery of the electorate of Mayence.</p>
                <p>The material occupations of this office, however, could not shackle a genius so
                    vast and so active as that of Leibnitz. He held it during three years; and it
                    was in this interval that he conceived the design of re-easting or new-modelling
                    the Encyclopaedia of Alstedius. It is not well known what his ideas then were
                    respecting this project; but in some subsequent writings he explains himself in
                    a manner sufficiently spécific. He defines the Eneyelopaedia to be the “system
                    of all the true and useful propositions then known.” He thinks that, to be
                    complete, it should contain definitions of all words; explanations of every
                    fundamental and useful process in the liberal and mechanie arts; and, lastly, a
                    summary of universal history. He then enumerates the different branches of human
                    knowledge; indicates, as models to be followed in each, the principal existing
                    works, amongst which he cites some of his own, and points out what remains to be
                    done; and, finally, he recommends the order of the materials or subjects, in
                    preference to the order of the alphabet.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Opera Omnia,</hi> tom. v. pp. 181-185;
                    also tom. v. p. 405.</p></note> In another passage he recommends subjoining to
                    the treatise on each science a succinct account of its origin and progress,
                    together with a list of the authors who have treated of it in detail. This was
                    one of the predominant ideas of his life, one to which he appeared to attach
                    great importance, and which occupied his mind as long as he lived.</p>
                <p>Leibnitz now began to evince a mastery in almost all the sciences. He already
                    enjoyed a great reputation as jurisconsult and philosopher; and he m⅛de himself
                    known in physics by the publication of two treatises, viz. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thearia</hi><hi rend="italic">Motus abstracti</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theoria Motus concreti,</hi> which appeared in 1671. These theories were not
                    admitted by philosophers, and did not deserve to be so; but they nevertheless
                    excited astonishment by the boldness and originality of genius displayed in the
                    coneeption of them. The year following he brought out, at the request of
                    Boineburg, a small treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">Sacrosancta
                    Trinitas</hi><hi rend="italic">per nova</hi><hi rend="italic">argumenta logica
                    defensa.</hi> In this work, intended to refute the attacks of a Pole named
                    Wissowatius against the doctrine of the Trinity, the author endeavours to show
                    that sound logie is not contrary to orthodoxy. Thus each year Leibnitz produced
                    some work, which served as a new title of distinction, and enabled him to rank
                    successively amongst the masters in the different sciences.</p>
                <p>He had long entertained a desire to visit Paris. France then fixed the attention
                    of the learned world, and extorted the admiration of Europe by the victories and
                    the influence of the great monarch to whom she also owed an extraordinary
                    development of military and literary glory. Leibnitz felt the importance of
                    forming a connection with the learned men of that country; and Boineburg
                    procured him the means of attaining this object, by proposing to him to
                    accompany bis son, whom he was then sending to Paris. Delighted with the
                    proposal, and at the same time anxious to testify his gratitude to so zealous a
                    patron, Leibnitz gladly accepted the offer, and set out for Paris in 1672.
                    Placed amongst the illustrious men of that capital, and already worthy of them,
                    he felt that ardour which leads to the distinction conferred by useful
                    discoveries burn with redoubled force in his bosom. He now applied himself more
                    especially to the mathematics, in which he had not as yet made any considerable
                    progress; and this choice, in the midst of distractions of every kind in a new
                    society, and of studies apparently much more attractive, is not one of the least
                    proofs of the force and energy of his character. He found at Paris the
                    illustrious Huygens; and he afterwards confessed, with that ingenuousness which
                    is so becoming in great men, his obligations to the work <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Horologio</hi><hi rend="italic">Oscillatoriο,</hi>
                    which had just appeared, and which, of all modern works, after those of Galileo
                    and Descartes, proved the most useful to Leibnitz. The learned men whose society
                    he frequented soon recognized his superior genius; and he confirmed this liigh
                    estimate of his powers by the exposition of his ideas on the reform of the
                    arithmetical machine of Paseal, or rather by the invention of a new machine,
                    which he has described in the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanea
                    Be-rolinensia.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    <hi rend="italic">Miiccll. Bcrolin.</hi> i. xxxi. and fig. 73. In 1763 he had
                    exhibited this machine to the Royal Society of London; and, in fact, it appears
                    to have occupied his attention at intervals during the whole of his life. It is
                    still preserved in the Museum of Göttingen, and is thought superior to other
                    machines of the same kind. (Gersten, xvii. 232.)</p></note> He obtained the
                    suffrages of the Academy of Seienees, the members of which signified to him that
                    he might be admitted into that illustrious body as pensionary, provided he chose
                    to embrace the Catholic religion; but although the proposition was equally
                    honourable to Leibnitz, as a proof of the estimation in which his talents were
                    held, and to the Academy, which knew how to appreciate them, he did not think it
                    proper or right for him to accept the offer.</p>
                <p>His protector Boineburg died in 1673; and having no longer any business to detain
                    him at Paris, he passed over into England, where he was received with the same
                    distinction as in France. He had the satisfaction of making the acquaintance and
                    enjoying the society of Boyle, Oldenburg, Collins, and other celebrated men, who
                    disputed the palm in several of the sciences with the philosophers of the
                    Continent; and it was from Collins that he received some hints concerning the
                    invention of the method of fluxions, which had been discovered by Newton as
                    early as the year 1664 or 1665, and by him communicated to Dr Barrow in 1669.
                    But he had not been long in England when he received intelligence of the death
                    of the elector ofMayence, by which he lost his pension. As this event made an
                    entire change in his position, he resolved to communicate his embarrassments to
                    the Duke of Brunswick-Lunenburg. This prince, who had always testified much
                    regard for him, availed himself of the opportunity thus afforded him to assure
                    Leibnitz of his favour, and to offer him the situation of counsellor, with a
                    salary, at the same time granting him permission to prolong at pleasure his stay
                    abroad. Overjoyed with this reply, ’ which removed all cause of uneasiness as to
                    his circumstances, Leibnitz returned to Paris, where he remained fifteen months
                    buried in the depths of geometry. He quitted Paris in 1674, revisited England
                    where he spent fifteen days, and proceeded by way of Holland to join his new
                    benefactor. Leibnitz was still under thirty. At an age when great men are in
                    general only beginning to distinguish themselves, each in his respective career,
                    he had entered upon almost all in succession; had received, in the three
                    countries which he had visited, testimonies of the highest esteem; and had
                    established, with a great number of learned men, literary connections, which
                    proved very advantageous to the sciences. We shall soon see him attain a still
                    more commanding eminence, and at length arrive at that species of supremacy
                    which he acquired over his age by the universality of his genius and
                    talents.</p>
                <p>Soon after his arrival at Hanover, he published his treatise on the Right of
                    Sovereignty and of Embassy claimed by the Princes of Germany, who demanded the
                    same privilege<pb break="no" facs="nls:193204057" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4057-0204"/>
                    as the electors, namely, those enjoyed by kings. This work, which appeared under
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Coesarinus Eurstnerius,</hi> and maintains that
                    the emperor is the temporal head of the states of the West, as the pope is the
                    spiritual head, possesses little interest at the present day; but it displays a
                    profound knowledge of public law and of history, gives minute details of titles
                    and ceremonial, and is written in that decorous and measured style which
                    distinguishes all the writings of Leibnitz. He continued to cultivate all the
                    sciences. He likewise supported, by every means in his power, the project -of
                    publishing the <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi rend="italic">Eruditorum,</hi> the
                    first volume of which appeared at Leipsig in the year 1682. The celebrity which
                    this journal acquired from its very commencement was in a great measure owing to
                    Leibnitz, who enriched it with a great variety of curious pieces, from extracts

                <p>The Duke of Brunswick died in 1679; but his successor, Ernest Augustus,
                    afterwards George I. of England, inheriting the same esteem for Leibnitz,
                    extended to him the same favour, and engaged him to write the history of the
                    house of Brunswick. Leibnitz, anxious to obey this honourable call, resolved to
                    visit the south of Germany and Italy, that in these countries he might make the
                    necessary researches, and collect materials for the work. He devoted no less
                    than three years to these journeys, consulting learned men, exploring libraries
                    and archives, perusing old charters and manuscripts, and examining other
                    monuments.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It was in one
                    of these expeditions that, finding himself overtaken by a tempest in the
                    Adriatic Sea, whilst passing from Venice to Mesola, he heard the pilot of the
                    bark, who did not imagine he was understood by the stranger, propose to the crew
                    to throw into the sea the German heretic, whose presence on board was, he
                    conceived, the sole cause of the squall <hi rend="italic">(bourasque).</hi>
                    Leibnitz, without appearing to have heard anything, or betraying the slightest
                    emotion, drew from his pocket a chaplet or rosary, and commenced telling the
                    beads with great seeming devotion. This quiet artifice saved him; one of the
                    crew observing to the pilot, that as the man was not a heretic, it would be of
                    no use to throw him into the sea.</p></note> The fruit of so many researches was
                    a prodigious collection of materials of all kinds. Besides the documents
                    necessary for his history, it comprehended an immense multitude of political and
                    diplomatic acts, as declarations of war, manifestoes, contracts of marriage,
                    treaties of peace, bulls, and other public pieces. Leibnitz put these materials
                    in order, and with their aid produced a work altogether different from, and
                    independent of, the principal, and indeed one of much greater importance,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Codex Juris Gentium Diplomatìcus,</hi> the first
                    volume of which appeared in 1693, and the second in 1700, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Mantissa</hi><hi rend="italic">Codicis.</hi> This collection
                    contains a great number of acts which had never before appeared, and many others
                    which, though previously published, had become very scarce. Read with
                    discernment, it exhibits great knowledge, not only of history, but also of the
                    genius of nations and languages, as well as of other subjects of inferior
                    interest and importance. In other respects, any methodical mind might have been
                    capable of a similar effort. What the genius of Leibnitz could alone produce is
                    the preface to the work, in which, ascending to the principles of natural law
                    and the law of nations, he expounds his ideas on both with great depth and
                    originality. But that which distinguishes this book, and the preceding ones
                    published by him on the same subjects, particularly his project for compiling a
                    new body of law,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    same epoch, is the tendency towards that reasonable reform of jurisprudence
                    which was afterwards effected, in a great measure owing to the influence of
                    Leibnitz, by whom its necessity was first pointed out; and likewise the union,
                    recommended throughout, of the study of jurisprudence with that of religion and
                    philosophy, which he regarded as the most solid basis of human happiness.<note

                <p>In the midst of labours so various, he did not lose sight of the principal object
                    of his recent travels, and occupied himself diligently in collecting the
                    historians of Brunswick. He even composed for that house several writings, one
                    of which, intended to establish its connection with the house of Este, procured
                    for him the place of privy councillor of justice; a sinecure appointment
                    destined to recompense his zeal without withdrawing him from his ordinary
                    labours, amongst which the history, with its collateral branches, occupied an
                    important place. The immense researches Leibnitz had made for the history of
                    Brunswick, however, furnished him with materials for other works of a secondary
                    kind. Thus in 1698 he published a new collection under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Accessiones</hi><hi rend="italic">Historicae</hi> (in two vols.
                    4to), containing a great number of rare and curious pieces, which had escaped
                    the observation of his predecessors. But nothing attests so much the extent of
                    his views as what he did for the history he had undertaken. He commenced by
                    collecting all the writers who had spoken of the house of Brunswick. The first
                    volume appeared in 1707, the second in 1710, and the third in 1711; and
                    subjoined were extracts from all the ancient authors relative to the tribes
                    inhabiting the banks of the Elbe and the Weser, with notes explanatory of
                    obscure passages. This collection, therefore, like those of Muratori, Duchesne,
                    and others, had a merit independent of the object for which it had been
                    compiled. But it was still, so to speak, only a preliminary work. The history
                    even of Brunswick has not appeared. The learned Eckhard found amongst the papers
                    of Leibnitz only the plan of it, which he published in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acta</hi><hi rend="italic">Eruditorum</hi> of 1717. This history was to have
                    been preceded by a dissertation on the primitive state of the globe, and
                    particularly of Germany. A curious monument of the ideas of Leibnitz on this
                    subject is contained in his <hi rend="italic">Protogaea,</hi> a sort of essay,
                    which, in 1693, he caused to be inserted in the Leipsig journal, and which was
                    afterwards published separately by Scheidius (Göttingen, 1749, in 4to). In this
                    production he attempts to explain the formation of the earth, and of the
                    different substances which it includes. He admits a conflagration of the globe,
                    then a general submersion, which, independently of the testimony of Scripture,
                    is sufficiently established by the animal and vegetable remains that are
                    frequently met with, and at different heights. This double hypothesis enables
                    him to assign to the solid bodies <hi rend="italic">(corpora firma)</hi> a
                    double origin, that is, cooling after the fusion, and consolidation after the
                    subsiding and evaporation of the waters; and in these ideas he finds the germ of
                    a new science, which he calls <hi rend="italic">Natural Geography.</hi> He
                    enters into some details on minerals, and speaks of crystals, which he considers
                    as the geometry of inanimate nature. Further, Leibnitz thought it incumbent on
                    him to prove that animal and vegetable petrifactions were not a freak or sport
                    of nature <hi rend="italic">(jeu</hi><hi rend="italic">de lα nature),</hi> and
                    also to rebut forcibly the opinion as to the productive power of matter. This
                    short exposition will suffice to give an idea of the immensity of the plan of
                    Leibnitz, and of the prodigious variety of subjects which it embraces; a plan in
                    many respects similar to that which has been followed by Herder and some other
                    authors posterior to Leibnitz. It is much to be regretted that this design was
                    not carried into execution, seeing it would probably <pb break="no"

                <p>We must here take particular notice of one of those works which he continually
                    let drop from his hands, and which were, so to speak, merely his pastimes; we

                    originally from the shores of the Baltic Sea. He founds his opinion on the
                    authority of the anonymous writer of Ravenna, and of Ermoldus Nigellus, a French
                    poet of the ninth century, and on passages in several authors; alleging,
                    moreover, that some of the ancients have confounded the Palus Maeotis with the
                    Baltic Sea. This opinion was attacked by Father Tournemine, who combated it with
                    much urbanity, saying, amongst other things, that, even in espousing a contrary
                    hypothesis, the French did not disclaim being the countrymen of Leibnitz, since
                    he appeared to have proved that the Franks had occupied the countries situated
                    between the right bank of the Rhine and the Ocean. Gundling also published a
                    refutation of the assertions of Leibnitz. The latter, who did not hold himself
                    beaten, replied to both his antagonists; but, far from pretending to decide in
                    the last resort, he appealed to the judgment of several learned men of his time,
                    and, amongst others, to that of Huet and Montfaucon, whom he highly respected on
                    account of their learning.</p>
                <p>This seems the proper place to speak of the correspondence which Leibnitz for a
                    long time maintained with Bossuet, in regard to the project for the re-union of
                    the Protestants with the Catholics; a project which had for some time been
                    pushed with activity, and which gave Leibnitz occasion to display attainments in
                    theology which no one could ever have suspected in a mathematician of the first
                    order. The details may be seen in the History of Bossuet by Μ. Bausset.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Histoire de
                    Bossuet,</hi> torn· iv. p. 144, 2d edit.</p></note> It is sufficient to state
                    that this negociation, in which Leibnitz did not take part till the year 1692,
                    was carried on with a degree of good faith very rare indeed in affairs of this
                    description; that at one time it encouraged the hope of a successful and happy
                    termination; and that it ultimately failed, owing to circumstances altogether
                    independent of the matters which had formed the subjects of discussion. Amongst
                    these may be reckoned the new political situation in which the elector of
                    Hanover, to whom Leibnitz was altogether devoted, found himself placed in the
                    year 1701. This prince saw reason to apprehend, that were he to labour longer in
                    endeavouring to effect a reconciliation between die two communions, he might
                    alienate the English people, who then manifested the greatest aversion to
                    Catholicism, and might even bar his accession to the throne of England, to which
                    he saw himself eventually called. From the <hi rend="italic">Syntagma</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Theologicum</hi> of Leibnitz, however, it is clear that this
                    philosopher had personally little disinclination to the doctrines of the
                    Catholic church. To effect the re-union desired, he had reckoned much upon the
                    influence of Louis XIV.; and it is curious to observe how this prince is judged
                    by a man as independent of France as Leibnitz then was.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Having been admitted a member of the Royal Society of London during his second
                    visit to England in 1674, and associated to the Academy of Sciences at Paris
                    since 1699, Leibnitz too well appreciated the advantages which academies owe to
                    this combination of labours directed towards a common centre, not to second, by
                    all the means in his power, the project for establishing a Royal Academy at
                    Berlin, formed in 1700 by the elector of Brandenburg, who, the following year,
                    assumed the title of king of Prussia. This prince had solicited the advice and
                    assistance of Leibnitz. The reply of the latter is equally remarkable for the
                    excellence and wisdom of its views, and the great simplicity by which it is
                    throughout distinguished. “The object,” says he, “ought to be to advance the
                    happiness of men, which consists principally in wisdom and in virtue, and next
                    in health and the comrbrts of life.” He points out, as the first object, “the
                    good education of youth, which includes also the regulation of studies; nothing
                    being more important than to give a good cast to the mind as well as to the
                    body.” He then indicates summarily the plan of study which the Academy ought to
                    recommend, and which is in the main that presently followed in the universities
                    of Germany. The elector, as may well be supposed, adopted the views of Leibnitz.
                    But he did more; he appointed him president of the new society, with the most
                    unlimited powers, and without any restraint as to residence, or requiring that
                    he should quit the service of the elector of Brunswick. The patent by which this
                    office was conferred forms one of the most honourable titles ever bestowed on a
                    man of learning and science.</p>
                <p>Eleven years later, Leibnitz received marked proofs of confidence on the part of
                    Peter I. of Russia, who, during his travels in Saxony, consulted him as to the
                    execution of his vast projects relative to the civilization of his empire, and
                    to whom Leibnitz in his turn communicated views with which that monarch
                    expressed hi nself highly satisfied. In reward of this service he received the
                    title of privy councillor. Lastly, the king of Prussia having died in 1713,
                    Leibnitz, who foresaw the fall of the Academy of Berlin under his successor,
                    repaired to Vienna to propose to the Emperor Charles VI. the institution of a
                    similar body, wherein the sciences, which were about to be banished from Berlin,
                    might find an asylum. Owing to several circumstances unconnected with Leibnitz,
                    this project did not succeed; but every mark of consideration was lavished on
                    the author. The emperor had already named him an aulic councillor; to this he
                    now added a pension of two thousand florins, and employed every means to induce
                    him to enter the imperial service. But Leibnitz, having declined these offers,
                    went to fix his abode at Hanover, the elector of which had just been called to
                    the throne of England.</p>
                <p>In 1710 there appeared a volume of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanea
                    Eerolinensia,</hi> in which Leibnitz amply acquitted his debt as founder and
                    president, and showed himself under forms so varied, that this volume alone
                    would have been sufficient to insure him the reputation of universal genius. In
                    proof of what is here said, it is only necessary to refer to his Essay on the
                    Origin of Nations. This production exhibits the principal points of his system,
                    a complete know ledge of which may be obtained by the perusal of his voluminous
                    correspondence. By the aid of etymologies, and by means of analysis, Leibnitz
                    endeavours to distinguish, through the successive alterations of languages, the
                    origins of different nations, whom he divides into two great principal
                    races,—that of the North and that of the South; then, by way of synthesis, he
                    attempts to recompose the primitive language; and, finally, by means of this
                    last operation, he labours to discover the relations between the signs of
                    language and the ideas expressed by them. A great part of his labours had for
                    their object to obtain these different results; he had himself plunged into the
                    chaos before which almost all those who are more occupied with ideas than with
                    words usuallyrecoil: it formed one of the principal objects of his
                    correspondence with the learned, as well as with travellers and missionaries;
                    and new views on the language of the Copts or the Hottentots afforded him as
                    much pleasure as the demonstration of a metaphysical truth, or the solution<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193204083" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4083-0206"/> of an important
                    problem in geometry. He is not always of the same mind with other learned men,
                    and often contradicts received opinions. Like all etymologists, he has placed
                    too much reliance upon fanciful coincidences and strained derivations; but, as
                    he himself observed, errors are often useful to truth, and the search after the
                    three great chimeras <hi rend="italic">(tria magna inania),</hi> the
                    philosopher’s stone, the perpetual motion, and the quadrature of the circle,
                    materially contributed to enrich the sciences.<note anchored="true"

                <p>We have seen that Leibnitz succeeded in stamping the impression of his genius
                    upon almost all kinds of knowledge. Natural history alone did not specially
                    occupy his attention. His <hi rend="italic">Protogaea</hi> is the only essay
                    which he published on the subject; but in his works we often meet with proofs of
                    the interest with which that science had inspired him; and it is not forgotten
                    either in his general plans of education, or in his encyclopedical schemes. He
                    was even a poet, and wrote verses in both the languages which he habitually
                    employed; but it is right to add, that he acquired no illustration by his
                    poetry, particularly his French verses, which are below mediocrity. Leibnitz is
                    justly obnoxious to the literary reproach of having neglected his mother-tongue.
                    But few of his writings appeared in German; and, what is not a little singular,
                    the object of one of these pieces, which is very ill written, but exceedingly
                    curious, is to recommend the study, practice, and improvement of the German
                    language.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See some
                    remarks prefixed to his <hi rend="italic">Collectanea</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    651.</p></note> It is the more to be regretted that he did not himself labour in
                    the execution of the plan which he proposed for attaining this object, as he
                    might, by his influence, have effected that which was not accomplished until
                    half a century afterwards, by the united efforts of the poets and literary men
                    who distinguished that epoch. Besides, although he attaches great importance to
                    that language, he does not appear to have understood its resources or its
                    flexibility; for, in citing French Sapphic verses, he adds, that he does not
                    believe a similar attempt would succeed equally well in German, although he had
                    himself composed German anapests, in imitation of those of Seneca. In
                    justification of Leibnitz, however, it is proper to add, that, being in
                    correspondence with men of all nations, he naturally adopted the two languages,
                    Latin and French, which were then in general and almost exclusive use.</p>
                <p>His Latin style is neither elegant nor agreeable. Sometimes, however, he rises
                    with his subject, and assumes a certain degree of majesty; but what may appear
                    singular is, that we frequently meet with Gallicisms in his Latin compositions.
                    We are less surprised to find Germanisms in his French prose; but these,
                    however, are of rare occurrence. What strikes us most in his general style, is
                    that grand and noble simplicity which distinguishes the French writers of the
                    same period, and which is equally suited to pure reason and to sublime
                    conceptions. In his works, as in his correspondence, there is an almost total
                    absence of ornament. The most simple literary correspondence of the present day
                    would exhibit more brilliancy and point than that of this great man; but, on the
                    other hand, there is not one of his letters which does not contain the germ, the
                    expression, or the development of some great or useful idea. Those of greatest
                    extent commonly exhibit a sort of abridged or epitomized encyclopedical view of
                    the state of the sciences, or the labours of the learned. But what we are never
                    weary of admiring is his constant urbanity towards his correspondents, as well
                    as the moderation and propriety exhibited in the expression of his judgments,
                    whatever may be their occasional severity. No personal predilection, no national
                    prejudice, ever disturbs the impartiality of that genius which viewed every
                    thing as it were from on high. Embracing, so to speak, entire humanity, he
                    incessantly recommends sending European missionaries into foreign countries, for
                    the triple purpose of augmenting the amount and variety of our knowledge,
                    establishing new commercial relations, and, above all, propagating the faith and
                    the doctrine of Christianity. “Peu lui importe,” says his French biographer,
                    “que cette doctrine soit enseignée aux étrangers avec moins de pureté (on ne
                    doit pas oublier que c’est un Luthérien qui parle), pourvu qu’elle se répande;
                    et pour le succès des missions aux Malabar, entre autres, il conseille d’amener
                    en Europe des habitants de cette côte, qui puissent y enseigner leur langue à
                    des missionnaires Européens.”</p>
                <p>Leibnitz had a sweet expression of countenance, blended with a studious air; he
                    possessed considerable gaiety, and his conversation was equally easy and
                    instructive. His temper was naturally choleric; but, like most passionate men,
                    he soon recovered his equanimity. Affable and communicative, he conversed freely
                    with all who came in his way, and even carried his complaisance so far as,
                    according to Fontenelle, to read a multitude of worthless books, out of
                    politeness to their authors. He was never married. At the age of fifty he had
                    some thoughts of forming a matrimonial connection; but as the lady he wished to
                    espouse desired time to consider his proposal, Leibnitz also made his own
                    reflections on the subject, and unluckily came to the conclusion that, though
                    marriage is a good thing, a wise man ought to consider of it all his life. Much
                    has been said of his avarice, but apparently without any sufficient reason.
                    There is no doubt that his expenditure was exceedingly frugal; but he had no
                    expensive passions or tastes to satisfy, and it is probable that his money
                    accumulated without his being aware of it. The reproach of not having attended
                    the service of his religion appears to be better founded. Nevertheless, he was
                    equally attached to the forms and the substance of religion; and though he may
                    have been wanting in punctuality of attendance, there is no ground whatever for
                    questioning the sincerity of his sentiments. De Murr, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal of Nuremberg,</hi> of the 1lth March 1779, gives entire the Memoir of
                    Eckhard, from which Fontenelle has derived most of the particulars inserted in
                    his Eloge de Leibnitz. It is there stated, that Leibnitz was of a middle
                    stature, and had black hair, a large head (which early became bald), and small
                    eyes. He was short-sighted, but his vision continued excellent even until his
                    last moments. He read the smallest characters, and his hand-writing was very
                    minute. He had on the crown of his head an excrescence of the size of a pigeon’s
                    egg; and he always walked stooping, with his head projected, which gave him the
                    appearance of being hunch-backed. He was of a thin habit, but of a vigorous
                    temperament; he drank little, supped plentifully, and went to rest immediately
                    after. He remained in bed only a few hours; sometimes he contented himself with
                    sleeping in a chair, and, awaking about six or seven in the morning, instantly
                    resumed his labours. When deeply immersed in study, he was known to have
                    scarcely quitted his chair for weeks. But, however strong his constitution might
                    be, it could not, in the long run, escape being undermined by a life so
                    sedentary; in fact, the result was an ulcer in one of his legs. He was, besides,
                    subject to the gout, the attacks of which became more frequent and painful tow
                    ards the close of his life. He consulted few physicians; and his death appears
                    to have been occasioned by blindly using a remedy which he had received from one
                    of his friends, and which, producing violent spasms, terminated his existence in
                    little more than an hour after he had swallowed it. He died on the 14th of
                    November 1716, at the age of seventy. His <pb break="no" facs="nls:193204096"

                    temple, at the extremity of the great alley leading to the gates of Hanover,
                    bears the simple inscription, <hi rend="italic">Ossa Leibnitii.</hi></p>
                <p>This extraordinary man is, beyond contradiction, one of those who have most
                    highly exalted and ennobled the human understanding. But if he has merited our
                    admiration by the astonishing variety of his labours, he is still more deserving
                    of our gratitude on account of that practical activity which had always for its
                    object the good of his fellow-creatures. Along with his most profound
                    meditations, are presented the means which indicate their utility, and
                    facilitate their application. His letters to Madame Brinon, his judgments on
                    Shaftesbury, the whole of his correspondence, and a thousand passages in his
                    writings, attest his profound respect for religion and morality; and he crowned
                    his glorious life by giving, in his <hi rend="italic">Theodicaea,</hi> the
                    support of his influence to ideas at once the most sublime and the most
                    necessary to the welfare of humanity. None of his labours was without glory to
                    himself, or without advantage to society. His reputation would perhaps have been
                    more solid and permanent had he less ambitiously grasped the whole circle of
                    human science; yet it is difficult to name any department of human knowledge
                    which has not profited by his labours, or received fresh illustration from his
                    genius. As a theologian, he successively contended with the sceptics who
                    believed too little, and with the Catholics, who, in his opinion, believed too
                    much; with the heretics, who believed otherwise than was inculcated by the
                    confession of Augsburg; and with the Arminians, who contended for the liberty of
                    indifference. Yet the philosopher betrayed his love of union and toleration. In
                    conjunction with the illustrious Bossuet, he laboured zealously to effect a
                    reconciliation between the Catholic and Protestant churches; and if he failed in
                    this truly Christian enterprise, his sincerity and good faith remain
                    unimpeach-cd; for, whatever may be thought of the selfish and worldly policy of
                    the elector of Hanover, there can scarcely be but one opinion as to the purity
                    of the motives which actuated Leibnitz. In an intolerant age, however, his
                    orthodoxy did not escape suspicion; and the moderation which reflects so much
                    honour on his memory was construed as indifference. His faith in revelation
                    itself was accused, because he attempted to prove the doctrine of the Trinity by
                    the principles of logic; and in the defence of the attributes and providence of
                    the Deity, he was suspected of a secret correspondence with his adversary Bayle.
                    As a metaphysician, he expatiated in regions too elevated ever to be explored by
                    human genius and intellect. His pre-established harmony of the soul and body, if
                    an untenable, is at least a sublime conception, and, as such, might have excited
                    the jealousy of Plato himsclt’; whilst his optimism, or the best of all possible
                    worlds, seems an idea too vast for a mortal mind, and too beneficent for the
                    actual condition of humanity. He was a natural philosopher, in the large and
                    genuine acceptation of the term; and if, like some others, he amused himself
                    with endcavouring to penetrate the mysteries of cosmogony, his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protogaea,</hi> or primitive earth, has not been useless to Buffon, and those
                    who have succeeded him, in investigating the changes which have taken place in
                    the constitution of the globe, and tracing the causes or agents to which these
                    are to be attributed.</p>
                <p>“I am not worthy,” says Gibbon, “to praise the mathematician; but his name is
                    mingled in all the problems and discoveries of the times; the masters of the art
                    were his rivals or disciples; and if he borrowed from Sir Isaac Newton the
                    sublime method of fluxions, Leibnitz was at least the Prometheus who imparted to
                    mankind the sacred fire which he had stolen from the gods. His curiosity
                    extended to every branch of chemistry, mechanics, and the arts; and the thirst
                    of knowledge was always accompanied with the spirit of improvement. The vigour
                    of his youth had been exercised in the schools of jurisprudence; and while he
                    taught, he aspired to reform the laws of nature and nations, of Rome and
                    Germany. The annals of Brunswick, and of the empire, of the ancient and modern
                    world, were presented to the mind of the historian; and he could turn from the
                    solution of a problem to the dusty parchments and barbarous style of the records
                    of the middle age. His genius was more nobly directed to investigate the origin
                    of languages and nations; nor could he assume the character of a grammarian
                    without forming the project of an universal idiom and alphabet. These various
                    studies were often interrupted by the occasional politics of the times, and his
                    pen was always ready in the cause of the princes and patrons to whose service he
                    was attached; many hours were consumed in a learned correspondence with all
                    Europe; and the philosopher amused his leisure with the composition of French
                    and Latin poetry. Such an example may display the extent and powers of the human
                    understanding, but even <hi rend="italic">his</hi> powers were dissipated by the
                    multiplicity of his pursuits. He attempted more than he could-finish; he
                    designed more than he could execute: his imagination was too easily satisfied
                    with a bold and rapid glance on the subject, which he was impatient to leave;
                    and Leibnitz may be compared to those heroes, whose empire has been lost in the
                    ambition of universal conquest.”</p>
                <p>Variety in unity, or unity varied, the expressive sign of every masterpiece of
                    nature and of art, characterizes happily enough the productions of the genius of
                    Leibnitz: extreme variety in the number and the species of the ideas with which
                    he enriched the intellectual world, of the truths which he discovered or
                    demonstrated, and of the elements of every order which he combined: absolute
                    unity of principle, of method, of plan, and of object or aim, in this great and
                    beautiful system, which connects and harmonizes the two worlds, spiritual and
                    material, by subjecting them to the unity of a monarchy constituted under the
                    government of the greatest and best of sovereigns. If we consider the <hi
                    rend="italic">form</hi> under which the different productions of this fertile
                    genius present themselves, as detached pieces, or as fragments disseminated in
                    vast collections, the mind is at first struck with their prodigious variety; and
                    it is in this point of view that they most commonly appear, not only to
                    biographers, but frequently to the historians of philosophy. But he who regards
                    them in this light alone, will absolutely fail to discover the total and
                    harmonious effect of this grand and beautiful scenography, or will only obtain
                    partial views, and glimpses without any sequence or connection. The
                    philosophical works of Leibnitz form a body of <hi rend="italic">doctrine,</hi>
                    the parts of which, whatever be their number or diversity, are nevertheless
                    intimately connected, and all referrible to the same principles, as well as
                    animated by the same spirit. This spirit, diffused throughout each of his
                    numerous productions, pervades equally the works of the jurisconsult, the
                    historian, the theologian, the natural philosopher, and the mathematician.<note

                <p>In like manner, with reference to the mathematical labours of Leibnitz, and more
                    particularly his claim to the discovery of the differential calculus, it is only
                    necessary for us to direct the reader to the Third Preliminary Dissertation
                    (part second, sect. i. p. 517, et seq.) where the subject generally is treated
                    with profound science and consummate ability, and the claims of Leibnitz to the
                    discovery in question are weighed and judged with that perfect candour and
                    judicious discrimination, which ought ever to guide such decisions. In recent
                    times, however, a new competitor for the honour of this discovery has been
                    brought forward by no less distinguished a personage than Laplace. “Il parait,”
                    says he, in his <hi rend="italic">Essai Philosophique sur les Probabilités,
                    “</hi> que Fermat, <hi rend="italic">le véritable inventeur du calcul
                    différentiel,</hi> a considéré ce calcul comme one dérivation de celui des
                    différences finies.” Against this affirmation, however, Professor Playfair, in
                    his review of Laplace’s <hi rend="italic">Essai,</hi> enters a strong and solemn
                    protestation. “The age in which that discovery was made,” says he, “has been
                    unanimous in ascribing the honour of either to Newton or Leibnitz; or, as seems
                    to us much the fairest and most probable opinion, <hi rend="italic">to
                    both</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that is, to each independently of the other,
                    the priority in respect of time being somewhat on the side of the English
                    mathematician. The writers of the history of the mathematical sciences have
                    given their suffrages to the same effect;— Montucla, for instance, who has
                    treated the subject with great impartiality, and Bossut, with no prejudices
                    certainly in favour of the English philosopher. In the great controversy to
                    which this gave rise, all the claims were likely to be well considered; and the
                    ultimate and fair decision, in which all sides seem to have acquiesced, is that
                    which has just been mentioned. It ought to be on good grounds, that a decision
                    passed by such competent judges, and that has now been in force for a hundred
                    years, should all at once be reversed.” He then proceeds to show that there are
                    no such grounds, and concludes by observing, “Great as is the merit of Fermat,
                    which nobody can be more willing than ourselves to acknowledge, and near as he
                    was to the greatest invention of modern times, we cannot admit that his property
                    in it is to be put on a footing with that of Newton or of Leibnitz ;—we should
                    fear that, in doing so, we were violating or* of the most sacred and august
                    monuments that posterity ever raised in honour of the dead.”<note

                <p>For the most extensive collection of the works of Leibnitz, we are indebted to
                    Louis Dutens, who in 1768 published at Geneva, <hi rend="italic">Go. Gul.
                    Leibnitii Opera Omnia,</hi> in six vols. 4to. The first volume contains the <hi
                    rend="italic">Opera</hi><hi rend="italic">Theologica,</hi> amongst which are the
                    <hi rend="italic">Theodiccea</hi> in the Latin translation, and the tracts in
                    controversy with Bossuet; the second includes the writings relative to logic,
                    metaphysics, general physics, chemistry, medicine, botany, natural history, the
                    arts,&amp;c. particularly the <hi rend="italic">Meditationes,</hi> the treatise

                    Correspondence with Dr Clarke; the third is devoted to mathematics; and the
                    three remaining volumes contain the writings of Leibnitz on history,
                    antiquities, jurisprudence, philology, etymology, the Chinese, &amp;c. Dutens,
                    however, excluded from his collection all that had been published by Rud. Eric.
                    Raspe at Amsterdam in 1765, 4to, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres

                    that has appeared from the pen of Leibnitz, must add to these two collections,
                    I. Essais de Théodicée, sur la bonté de Dieu, la liberté de Thomme, et l’origine
                    du mal, Amsterdam, 1716; 2. Epistolae ad diversos, cum notis Kor-tholti,
                    Leipsig, 1734-1742, in four vols. 8vo; 3. Jo. Dan. Gruberi Commercium
                    Epistolicum Leibnitzianum, Hanover, 1745, in two vols. 8vo; 4. Leibnitzii et J.
                    Bernoullii Commercium Philosophicum et Mathematicum, editum a Cramer, Geneva, in
                    two vols. 4to; 5. His Correspondence with Jablonski, published by Professor
                    Kappe, Leipsig, 1745, in 8vo; 6. Epistolae ad Schmidium, theologum
                    Helmstadiensem, quas evulgavit Wesenmeyer, 1788; 7. Lettres choisies de la
                    Correspondance de Leibnitz, publiées pour la première fois par G. H. Feder,
                    Hanover, 1805, in 8vo; and, 8. A kind of <hi rend="italic">Leibnitziana</hi> in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Otium</hi><hi rend="italic">Hanoveranum,</hi> 1718, in
                    8vo. The historical collections published by Leibnitz during his life were, 1.
                    Codex Juris Gentium diplomaticus, Hanover, 1693, in folio; 2. Mantissa Codicis
                    Juris Gentium diplomat, ibid. 1700, in folio; 3. Scriptores Rerum
                    Brunsvicensium, ibid. 1707-1711, in three vols. folio; 4. Accessiones
                    Historicae, Leipsig, 16981700, in two vols. The number of works that have been
                    published in relation to or in connection with Leibnitz, is immense, and
                    therefore precludes any attempt at enumerating them. <hi rend="smallcaps"
