                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">LAUGHTER</label>, an affection peculiar to mankind,
                    occasioned by something that tickles the fancy.</p>
                <p>In laughter the eye-brows are raised about the middle, and drawn down next the
                    nose; the eyes are almost shut'; the mouth opens and shows the teeth, the
                    corners of the mouth being drawn back and raised up; the cheeks seem puffed up,
                    and almost hide the eyes; the face is usually red; the nostrils are open; and
                    the eyes are moistened.</p>
                <p>Authors attribute laughter to the fifth pair of nerves, which, sending branches
                    to the eye, ear, lips, tongue, palate, and muscles of the cheek, part of the
                    mouth, praecordia, &amp;c. there hence arises a sympathy, or consent, between
                    all these parts; so that when one of them is acted upon, the others are
                    proportionally affected. Hence a savoury thing seen or smelt affects the glands
                    and part of the mouth; a thing seen or heard that is shameful, affects the
                    cheeks with blushes; on the contrary, if it please and tickle the fancy, it
                    affects the praecordia and muscles of the mouth and face with laughter; if it
                    cause sadness and melancholy, it likewise affects the praecordia, and
                    demonstrates itself by causing the glands of the eyes to emit tears. Dr Willis
                    accounts for the pleasure of kissing from the same cause; the branches of this
                    fifth pair being ‘spread to the lips, the praecordia, and the genital parts,
                    hence arises a sympathy between these parts.</p>
                <p>The affection of the mind by which laughter is produced is seemingly so very
                    different from the other passions with which we are endowed, that it has engaged
                    the attention of very eminent persons to discover it. Aristotle, in the fifth
                    chapter of his Poetics, observes of comedy, that “it imitates those vices or
                    meannesses only which partake of the ridiculous ;” but “the ridiculous,” says
                    he, “consists of some fault or turpitude not attended with great pain, and not
                    destructive.” “The passion of laughter,” says Hobbes, “is nothing else but
                    sudden glory arising from some sudden conception of some eminency in ourselves,
                    by comparison with the infirmity of others, or with our own formerly. For men,”
                    continues he “laugh at the follies of themselves past, when they come suddenly
                    to remembrance, except when they bring with them any sudden dishonour.”
                    Akenside, in the third book of his poem, treats of ridicule at considerable
                    length. He gives a detail of ridiculous characters; ignorant pretenders to
                    learning, boastful soldiers, and lying travellers; hypocritical churchmen,
                    conceited politicians, and old women that talk of their charms and virtue;
                    ragged philosophers who rail at riches, virtuosi intent upon trifles, romantic
                    lovers, wits wantonly satirical, fops that out of vanity appear to be diseased
                    and profligate, dastards who are ashamed or afraid without reason, and fools who
                    are ignorant of what they ought to know. Having finished the detail of
                    characters, he makes some general remarks on the cause of ridicule, and explains
                    himself more fully in a definition in prose, illustrated by examples. “That
                    which makes objects ridiculous,” he observes, “is some grōund of admiration or
                    esteem connected with other more general circumstances comparatively worthless
                    or deformed: or it is some circumstance of turpitude or deformity connected with
                    what is in general excellent or beautiful; the inconsistent properties existing
                    either in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193202991" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2991-0122"/>the
                    objects themselves, or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate,
                    belonging always to the same order or class of being, implying sentiment and
                    design, and exciting no acute or vehement commotion of the heart.” Hutcheson has
                    given another account of the ludicrous quality, and seems to think that it is
                    the contrast or opposition of dignity and meanness which occasions laughter.</p>
                <p>But all these opinions are combated, by Dr Beattie in his <hi rend="italic">Essay
                    on Laughter and Ludicrous Composition.</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> To provoke
                    laughter,” says he, “is not essential either to wit or humour. For though that
                    unexpected discovery of resemblance between ideas supposed dissimilar, which is
                    called <hi rend="italic">wit,</hi> and that comic exhibition of singular
                    characters, sentiments, and imagery, which is denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >humour,</hi> do frequently raise laughter, they do not raise it always.
                    Addison’s poem to Sir Godfrey Kneller, in which the British kings are likened to
                    heathen gods, is exquisitely witty, and yet not laughable. Pope’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay on Man</hi> abounds in serious wit; and examples of serious
                    humour are not uncommon in Fielding’s <hi rend="italic">History of Parson
                    Adams,</hi> and in Addison’s account of Sir Roger de Coverley. Wit, when the
                    subject is grave, and the allusions sublime, raises admiration instead of
                    laughter; and if the comic singularities of a good man appear in circumstances
                    of real distress, the imitation of these singularities in the epic or dramatic
                    comedy will form a species of humour, which, if it should force a smile, will
                    draw forth a tear at the same time. An inquiry, therefore, into the
                    distinguishing characters of wit and humour has no necessary connection with the
                    present subject.</p>
                <p>“Some authors have treated of ridicule, without marking the distinction between
                    <hi rend="italic">ridiculous</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ludicrous</hi> ideas.
                    But I presume the natural order of proceeding in this inquiry, is to begin with
                    ascertaining the nature of what is <hi rend="italic">purely ludicrous.</hi>
                    Things <hi rend="italic">ludicrous</hi> and things <hi rend="italic"
                    >ridiculous</hi> have this in common, that both excite laughter; but the former
                    excite pure laughter, the latter excite laughter mixed with disapprobation and
                    contempt. My design is to analyze and explain that quality in things or ideas
                    which makes them provoke <hi rend="italic">pure laughter,</hi> and entitles them
                    to the name of <hi rend="italic">ludicrous</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >laughable.</hi> “When certain objects,. qualities, or ideas, occur to our
                    senses, memory, or imagination, we smile or laugh at them, and expect that other
                    men should do the same. To smile on certain occasions is not less natural than
                    to weep at the sight of distress, or cry out when we feel pain.</p>
                <p>“There are different kinds of laughter. As a boy, passing by night through a
                    churchyard, sings or whistles in order to conceal his fear, even from himself;
                    so there are men who, by forcing a smile, endeavour sometimes to hide from
                    others, and from themselves too, perhaps, their malevolence or envy. Such
                    laughter is unnatural. The sound of it offends the ear; the features distorted
                    by it seem horrible to the eye. A mixture of hypocrisy, malice, and cruel joy,
                    thus displayed on the countenance, is one of the most hateful sights in nature,
                    and transforms the <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> human face divine’ into the
                    visage of a fiend. Similar to this is the smile of a wicked person pleasing
                    himself with the hope of accomplishing his evil purposes. Milton gives a
                    striking picture of it in that well-known passage:</p>
                <p>He ceas’d; for both seem’d highly pleas’d; and Death Grinn’d horrible a ghastly
                    smile, to hear</p>
                <p>His famine should be fill’d, and blest his maw Destin’d to that good hour.</p>
                <p>But enough of this. Laughter that makes a man a fiend or a monster I have no
                    inclination to analyze. My inquiries are confined to that species of laughter
                    which is at once natural and innocent.</p>
                <p>“Of this there are two sorts. The laughter occasioned by tickling or gladness is
                    different from that which arises on reading the <hi rend="italic">Tate of a
                    Tub.</hi> The former may □e called <hi rend="italic">animal laughter,</hi> the
                    latter, if it were lawful to adopt a new word which has become very common, I
                    should term <hi rend="italic">sentimental.</hi> Smiles admit of similar
                    divisions. Not to mention the scornful, the envious, the malevolent smile, I
                    would only remark, that of the innocent and agreeable smile there are two sorts.
                    The one proceeds from the risible emotion, and has a tendency to break out into
                    laughter. The other is the effect of good humour, complacency, and tender
                    affection. This last sort of smile renders a countenance amiable in the highest
                    degree. Homer ascribes it to Venus in an epithet <hi rend="italic"
                    >(fikομμM)ης)</hi> which Dryden and Pope, after Waller, improperly translate <hi
                    rend="italic">laughter-loving</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> an idea that accords
                    better with the character of a romp or hoyden than with the goddess of love and
                    beauty.</p>
                <p>“Animal laugnter admits of various degrees; from the gentle impulse excited in a
                    child by moderate joy, to that terrifying and even mortal convulsion which has
                    been known to accompany a change of fortune. This passion may, as well as joy
                    and sorrow, be communicated by sympathy; and I know not whether the
                    entertainment we receive from the playful tricks of kittens and other young
                    animals, may not in part be resolved into something like a fellow-feeling of
                    their vivacity. Animal and sentimental laughter are frequently blended; but it
                    is easy to distinguish them. The former is often excessive; the latter never,
                    unless heightened by the other. The latter is always pleasing, both in itself
                    and in its cause; the former may be painful in both. But their principal
                    difference is this: The one always proceeds from a sentiment or emotion exited
                    in the mind, in consequence of certain ideas or objects being presented to it,
                    of which emotion we may be conscious, even when we suppress laughter; the other
                    arises not from any sentiment or perception of ludicrous ideas, but from some
                    bodily feeling or sudden impulse on what is called the <hi rend="italic">animal
                    spirits,</hi> proceeding, or seeming to proceed, from the operation of causes
                    purely material. The present inquiry regards that species that is here
                    distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic">sentimental laughter.</hi></p>
                <p>“The pleasing emotion, arising from the view of ludicrous ideas, is known to
                    every one by experience; but, being a simple feeling, admits not of definition.
                    It is to be distinguished from the laughter that generally attends it, as sorrow
                    is to be distinguished from tears; for it is often felt in a high degree by
                    those who are remarkable for gravity of countenance. Swift seldom laughed,
                    notwithstanding his uncommon talents in wit and humour, and the extraordinary
                    delight he seems to have had in surveying the ridiculous side of things. Why
                    this agreeable emotion should be accompanied with laughter as its outward sign,
                    or sorrow express itself by tears, or fear by trembling or paleness, I cannot
                    ultimately explain, otherwise than by saying, that such is the appointment of
                    the Author of nature. All I mean by this inquiry is to determine, What is
                    peculiar to those things which produce laughter, or, rather, which raise in the
                    mind that pleasing sentiment or emotion whereof laughter is the external
                    sign.</p>
                <p>‘(Philosophers have differed in their opinions concerning this matter. In
                    Aristotle’s definition, quoted above, it is clear that he means to characterize,
                    not laughable qualities in general (as some have thought), but the objects of
                    comic ridicule only; and in this view the definition is just, however it may
                    have been overlooked or despised by comic writers. Crimes and misfortunes are
                    often in modern plays, and were sometimes in the ancient, held up as objects of
                    public merriment; but if poets had that reverence for nature which they ought to
                    have, they would not shock the common sense of mankind by so absurd a
                    representation. The definition from Aristotle does <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193203004" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3004-0123"/>not, however, suit the
                    general nature of ludicrous ideas; for it will appear by and by, that men laugh
                    at that in which there is neither fault nor turpitude of any kind.</p>
                <p>« The theory of Mr Hobbes would hardly have deserved notice, if Addison had not
                    spoken of it with approbation in the 47th paper of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spectator.</hi> He justly observes, after quoting the words of Mr Hobbes
                    formerly mentioned, that, <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> according to this
                    account, when we hear a man laugh excessively, instead of saying that he is very
                    merry, we ought to tell him that he is very proud.’ It is strange that the
                    elegant author should be aware of this consequence, and yet admit the theory;
                    for so good a judge of human nature could not be ignorant, that laughter is not
                    considered as a sign of pride; persons of singular gravity being often suspected
                    of that vice, but great laughers seldom or never. When we see a man attentive to
                    the innocent humours of a merry company, and yet maintain a fixed solemnity of
                    countenance, is it natural for us to think that he is the humblest, and the only
                    humble person in the circle?</p>
                <p>“Another writer in the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> (No. 249), remarks, in
                    confirmation of this theory, that the <hi rend="italic">vainest</hi> part of
                    mankind are most addicted to the passion of laughter. Now, how can this be, if
                    the <hi rend="italic">proudest</hi> part of mankind are also most addicted to
                    it, unless we suppose vanity and pride to be the same thing? But they certainly
                    are different passions. The proud man despises other men, and derives his chief
                    pleasure from the contemplation of his own importance; the vain man stands in
                    need of the applause of others, and cannot be happy without it. Pride is apt to
                    be reserved and sullen; vanity is often affable, and officiously obliging. The
                    proud man is so confident of his merit, and thinks it so obvious to all the
                    world, that he will scarcely give himself the trouble to inform you of it; the
                    vain man, to raise your admiration, scruples not to tell you, not only the whole
                    truth, but even a great deal more. In the same person, these two passions may,
                    no doubt, be united; but some men are too proud to be vain, and some vain men
                    are too conscious of their own weakness to be proud. Be all this, however, as it
                    will, we have not as yet made any discovery of the cause of laughter; in regard
                    to which, I apprehend, that the vain are not more intemperate than other people;
                    and I am sure that the proud are much less so.</p>
                <p>Hutcheson’s account of the origin of laughter is equally unsatisfactory. Granting
                    what he says to be true, I would observe, in the first place, what the ingenious
                    author seems to have been aware of, that there maybe a mixture of meanness and
                    dignity where there is nothing ludicrous. A city, considered as a collection of
                    low and lofty houses, is no laughable object. Nor was that person either
                    ludicrous or ridiculous, whom Pope so justly characterizes,</p>
                <p>The greatest, wisest, meanest of mankind.</p>
                <p>But, secondly, cases might be mentioned, of laughter arising from a group of
                    ideas or objects, wherein there is no discernible opposition of meanness or
                    dignity. We are told of the dagger of Hudibras, that</p>
                <p>It could scrape trenchers, or chip bread, Toast cheese or bacon, though it were
                    To bait a mouse trap, ’ twou ’ d not care; ’ Twou'd make clean shoes, or in the
                    earth Set leeks and onions, and so forth.</p>
                <p>The humour of the passage cannot arise from the meanness <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> these offices compared with the dignity of the dagger, nor from any
                    opposition of meanness and dignity in the offices themselves, they being all
                    equally mean; and must therefore be owing to some peculiarity in the
                    description. We laugh when a droll mimics the solemnity of a grave person; here
                    dignity and meanness are indeed united; but we laugh also (though not so
                    heartily perhaps) tvhen he mimics the peculiarities of a fellow as insignificant
                    as himself, and displays no opposition of dignity and meanness. The levities of
                    Sancho Pança, opposed to the solemnity of his master, and compared with his own
                    schemes of preferment, form an entertaining contrast; but some of the vagaries
                    of that renowned squire are truly laughable, even when his preferment and his
                    master are out of the question. Men laugh at puns; the wisest and wittiest of
                    our species have laughed at them; Queen Elizabeth, Cicero, and Shakspeare,
                    laughed at them; clowns and children laugh at them; and most men, at one time or
                    other, are inclined to do the same; but in this sort of low wit, is it an
                    opposition of meanness and dignity that entertains us? Is it not rather a
                    mixture of sameness and diversity; sameness in the sound, and diversity in the
                    signification?</p>
                <p>“In the characters mentioned by Akenside, the author does not distinguish between
                    what is <hi rend="italic">laughable</hi> and what is <hi rend="italic"
                    >contemptible;</hi> so that we have no reason to think that he meant to specify
                    the qualities peculiar to those things which provoke <hi rend="italic">pure
                    laughter</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and whatever account we may make of his
                    definition, which to those who acquiesce in the foregoing reasonings may appear
                    not quite satisfactory, there is in the poem a passage that deserves particular
                    notice, as it seems to contain a more exact account of the ludicrous quality
                    than is to be found in any of the theories above mentioned. This passage we
                    shall soon have occasion to quote.”</p>
                <p>Dr Beattie then proceeds to give his own theory concerning the origin of
                    laughter, which he supposes to arise from the view of things incongruous united
                    in the same assemblage, “However imperfect,” says he, “the above-mentioned
                    theories may appear, there is none of them destitute of merit; and indeed the
                    most fanciful philosopher seldom frames a theory without consulting nature in
                    some of her more obvious appearances. Laughter very frequently arises from the
                    view of dignity and meanness united in the same object; sometimes, no doubt,
                    from the appearance of assumed inferiority, as well as of small faults and
                    unimportant turpitudes; and sometimes, perhaps, though rarely, from that sort of
                    pride which is described in the passage already quoted from Hobbes.</p>
                <p>“All these accounts agree in this, that the cause of laughter is something
                    compounded; or something that disposes the mind to form a comparison, by passing
                    from one object or idea to another. That this is in fact the case, cannot be
                    proved <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but this holds in
                    all the examples hitherto given, and will be found to hold in all that are given
                    hereafter. May it not then be laid down as a principle, that laughter arises
                    from the view of two or more objects or ideas disposing the mind to form a
                    comparison? According to the theory of Hobbes, this comparison would be between
                    the ludicrous object and ourselves; according to those writers who misapply
                    Aristotle’s definition, it would seem to be formed between the ludicrous object
                    and things or persons in general; and if we incline to Hutcheson’s theory, which
                    is the best of the three, we shall think that there is a comparison of the parts
                    of the ludicrous object, first with one another, and secondly with ideas or
                    things extraneous.</p>
                <p>“Further, every appearance that is made up of parts, or that leads the mind of
                    the beholder to form a comparison, is not ludicrous. The body of a man or woman,
                    of a horse, a fish, or a bird, is not ludicrous, though it consists of many
                    parts; and it may be compared to many other things without raising laughter; but
                    the picture described in the beginning of the epistle to the Pisoes, with a
                    man’s head, a horse’s neck, feathers of different birds, limbs of different
                    beasts, and the tail of a fish, would have been thought ludicrous 1800 years
                    ago, if we believe Horace, and in certain circumstances would no doubt be so at
                    this day. It would seem, then, that <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> the parts <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193203017" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3017-0124"/> of a laughable
                    assemblage must be in some degree unsuitable and heterogeneous.’</p>
                <p>“Moreover, any one of the parts of the Horatian monster, a human head, a horse’s
                    neck, the tail of a fish, or the plumage of a fowl, is not ludicrous in itself;
                    nor would those several pieces be ludicrous if attended to in succession,
                    without any view to their union. For, to see them disposed on the different
                    shelves of a museum, or even on the same shelf, nobody would laugh, except,
                    perhaps, the thought of uniting them were to occur to his fancy, or the passage
                    of Horace to his memory. It seems to follow, that ‘ the incongruous parts of a
                    laughable idea or object must either be combined so as to form an assemblage, or
                    must be supposed to be so combined.’</p>
                <p>“May we not then conclude, ‘ that laughter arises from the view of two or more
                    inconsistent, unsuitable, or incongruous parts or circumstances, considered as
                    unitedin one complex object or assemblage, or as acquiring a sort of mutual
                    relation, from the peculiar manner in which the mind takes notice of them?’ The
                    lines from Akenside formerly referred to, seem to point at the same
                    doctrine:</p>
                <p>Where’er the powr of ridicule displays Her quaint-ey’d visage, <hi rend="italic"
                    >some incongruous form, Some stubborn dissonance of things combin'd,</hi>
                    Strikes on the quick observer.</p>
                <p>And to the same purpose, the learned and ingenious Dr Gerard, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay on Taste</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> ‘ The sense of
                    ridicule is gratified by an inconsistence and dissonance of circumstances in the
                    same object, or in objects nearly related in the main; or by a similitude or a
                    relation unexpected between things on the whole opposite and unlike.’</p>
                <p>“And therefore, instead of saying with Hutcheson, that the cause or object of
                    laughter is an ‘ opposition to dignity and meanness,’ I would say, in more
                    general terms, that it is ‘ an opposition to suitableness or unsuitableness, or
                    of relation and the want of relation, united, or supposed to be united, in the
                    same assemblage.’ Thus the offices ascribed to the dagger of Hudibras seem quite
                    heterogeneous; but we discover a bond of connection among them, when we are told
                    that the same weapon could occasionally perform them all. Thus, even in that
                    mimicry which displays no opposition of dignity and meanness, we perceive the
                    actions of one man joined to the features and body of another; that is, a
                    mixture of unsuitableness, or want of relation, arising from the difference of
                    persons, with congruity and similitude, arising from the sameness of the
                    actions. And here let it be observed in general, that the greater number of
                    incongruities that are blended in the same assemblage, the more ludicrous it
                    will probably be. If, as in Butler’s resemblance of the morning to a boiled
                    lobster, there is a mixture of dignity and meanness, as well as of likeness and
                    dissimilitude, the effect of the contrast will be more powerful than if only one
                    of these oppositions had occurred in the ludicrous idea. The sublimity of Don
                    Quixote’s mind, contrasted and connected with his miserable equipage, forms a
                    very comical exhibition; but when all this is still further connected and
                    contrasted with Sancho Pança, the ridicule is heightened exceedingly. Had the
                    knight of the lions been better mounted and accoutred, he would not have made us
                    smile so often; because, the hero’s mind and circumstances being more adequately
                    matched, the whole group would have united fewer inconsistencies, and reconciled
                    fewer incongruities. Butler has combined a still greater variety of uncouth and
                    jarring circumstances in Ralpho and Hudibras; but the picture, though more
                    elaborate, is less natural. Yet this argues no defect of judgment. His design
                    was, to make his hero not only ludicrous, but contemptible; and therefore he
                    jumbles together, in his ’equipage and person, a number of mean and disgusting
                    qualities, pedantry, ignorance, nastiness, and extreme deformity. But the knight
                    of La Mancha, though a ludicrous, was never intended for a contemptible
                    personage. He often moves our pity, he never forfeits our esteem; and his
                    adventures and sentiments are generally interesting; which could not have been
                    the case if his story had not been natural, and himself been endowed with great
                    as well as good qualities. To have given him such a shape, and such weapons,
                    arguments, boots, and breeches, as Butler has bestowed on his champion, would
                    have destroyed that solemnity which is so striking a feature in Don Quixote; and
                    Hudibras, with the manners and person of the Spanish hero, would not have been
                    that paltry figure which the English poet meant to hold up to the laughter and
                    contempt of his countrymen. Sir Launcelot Greaves is of Don Quixote’s kindred,
                    but a different character. Smollett’s design was not to expose him to ridicule,
                    but rather to recommend him to our pity and admiration. He has therefore given
                    him youth, strength, and beauty, as well as courage and dignity of mind; has
                    mounted him on a generous steed, and arrayed him in an elegant suit of armour.
                    Yet, that the history might have a comic air, he has been careful to contrast
                    and connect Sir Launcelot with a squire and other associates of very dissimilar
                    tempers and circumstances.</p>
                <p>“What has been said of the cause of laughter does not amount to an exact
                    description, far less to a logical definition; there being innumerable
                    combinations of congruity and inconsistency, of relation and contrariety, of
                    likeness and dissimilitude, which are not ludicrous at all. If we could
                    ascertain the peculiarities of these, we should be able to characterize with
                    more accuracy the general nature of ludicrous combination. But before we proceed
                    to this, it would be proper to evince, that of the present theory thus much at
                    least is true, that though every incongruous combination is not ludicrous, every
                    ludicrous combination is incongruous.</p>
                <p>“It is only by a detail of facts or examples that any theory of this sort can be
                    either established or overthrown. By such a detail, the foregoing theories have
                    been, or may be, shown to be ill founded, or not sufficiently comprehensive. A
                    single instance of a laughable object, which neither unites, nor is supposed to
                    unite, incongruous ideas, would likewise show the insufficiency of the present;
                    nor will I undertake to prove (for indeed I cannot), that no such instance can
                    be given. A complete enumeration of ludicrous objects it would be in vain to
                    attempt; and therefore we can never hope to ascertain, beyond the possibility of
                    doubt, that common quality which belongs to all ludicrous ideas that are, or
                    have been, or may be, imagined. All that can be done in a case of this kind is
                    to prove, by a variety of examples, that the theory now proposed is more
                    comprehensive, and better founded, than any of the foregoing.” This our author
                    afterwards shows at full length; but as the variety of examples adduced by him
                    would take up too much room to be inserted here, and as every reader must be
                    capable of adducing numberless instances of ludicrous cases to himself, we shall
                    content ourselves with the above explanation of the different theories of
                    laughter, referring those who desire further satisfaction to the treatise
                    already quoted.</p>
