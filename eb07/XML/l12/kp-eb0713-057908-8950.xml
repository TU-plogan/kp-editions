                    learned and pious divine, born at London in 1661, was the son of an apothecary,
                    and took his degrees at Oxford. His eminent worth and learning recommended him
                    to Dr Mew, bishop of Winchester, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208963"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-8963-0580"/>who made him his chaplain, gave him two livings in
                    Hampshire, and conferred upon him a prebend in the cathedral of Winchester.
                    Although he had acquired an unusual share of critical learning, the labours of
                    Mr Lowth were strictly confined within the limits of his own province, and he
                    applied solely to the peculiar duties of his function; yet, in order that he
                    might acquit himself the better in theology, he pursued his studies with a more
                    general and extensive view. Few were more deeply versed in critical learning,
                    there being scarcely any ancient author, Greek or Latin, profane or
                    ecclesiastical, which he had not read with accuracy, constantly accompanying his
                    reading with critical and philological remarks. Of his collections in this way
                    he was upon all occasions very communicative. Hence his notes on Clemens
                    Alexandrinus, which are to be met with in Potter’s edition of that father; and
                    his remarks on Josephus, communicated to Hudson for his edition, and
                    acknowledged in the preface; as also those larger and more numerous annotations
                    upon the Ecclesiastical Historians, inserted in Reading’s edition of them at
                    Cambridge. The author of the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Biblica was</hi> indebted to him for the same kind of assistance. Chandler,
                    bishop of Durham, whilst engaged in his Defence of Christianity, from the
                    Prophecies of the Old Testament, against the Discourse of the Grounds and
                    Reasons of the Christian Religion, and in his Vindication of the Defence, in
                    answer to the Scheme of Literal Prophecy considered, held a constant
                    correspondence with Lowth, and consulted him upon many difficulties which
                    occurred in the course of that work. But the most valuable part of his character
                    was that which least appeared in the eyes of the world; the private and retired
                    part, that of the good Christian and the useful parish priest. His piety, his
                    diligence, his hospitality and beneficence, rendered his life highly exemplary,
                    and greatly enforced his public exhortations. He married Margaret, daughter of
                    Mr Robert Pitt, of Blandford, by whom he had two sons and three daughters; and
                    died in 1732, when, by his own orders, he was buried in the churchyard of
                    Buriton. He published, 1. A Vindication of the Divine Authority and Inspiration
                    of the Old and New Testaments; 2. Directions for the profitable reading of the
                    Holy Scriptures; 3. Commentaries on the Prophets; and some other works.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lowth,</hi><hi rend="italic">Dr Fobert,</hi> second son of
                    the preceding Dr William Lowth, and successively bishop of St David’s, Oxford,
                    and London, was born on the 29th of November 1710, probably at Buriton, in the
                    county of Hants. He received the rudiments of his education at Winchester
                    College, where his school exercises were distinguished by uncommon elegance; and
                    having resided the requisite number of years in that seminary, he in 1730
                    succeeded to a place on the foundation at New College, Oxford. He took the
                    degree of master of arts on the 8th of June 1737. Though his abilities must have
                    been known to those with whom he was connected, he was not forward to appear
                    before the world as a writer. At Oxford he continued many years improving his
                    talents, with little notice from the great, and with so small preferment that,
                    at this time, he escaped the distinct recollection of some of his
                    contemporaries.</p>
                <p>He was not, however, suffered to languish for ever in obscurity. His genius and
                    his learning forced themselves upon the notice of the illustrious society of
                    which he was a member; and he was placed in a station where he was eminently
                    qualified to shine. In 1741 he was elected by the university to the
                    professorship of poetry, re-elected in 1743, and, whilst he held that office, he
                    read his admirable lectures <hi rend="italic">De Sacra</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Poesi</hi><hi rend="italic">Hebraeorum.</hi> In 1744 Bishop Hoadly collated him
                    to the rectory of Ovington in the county of Hants; added to it, nine years
                    afterwards, the rectory of East Weedhay in the same county; and in the interim
                    raised him to the dignity of archdeacon of Winchester. These repeated favours he
                    some years afterwards acknowledged in the following manly and respectful terms
                    of gratitude: “This address, my lord, is not more necessary on account of the
                    subject, than it is in respect of the author. Your lordship, unsolicited and
                    unasked, called him from one of those colleges to a station of the first dignity
                    in your diocese, and took the earliest opportunity of accumulating your favour
                    upon him, and of adding to that dignity a suitable support. These obligations he
                    is now the more ready thus publicly to acknowledge, as he is removed out of the
                    reach of further favours of the like kind. And though he hath relinquished the
                    advantages so generously conferred on him, yet he shall always esteem himself
                    highly honoured in having once enjoyed the patronage of the great advocate of
                    civil and religious liberty.”</p>
                <p>On the 8th of July 1754 the university of Oxford conferred upon him the degree of
                    doctor of divinity by diploma; an honour which, as it is never granted but to
                    distinguished merit, was probably conferred on Mr Lowth in consequence of his
                    prelections on Hebrew poetry, which had then been recently published. Having in
                    1749 travelled with Lord George and Lord Frederick Cavendish, he had a claim
                    upon the patronage of their family; and in 1755 the Duke of Devonshire being
                    then lord lieutenant of Ireland, Dr Lowth went to that kingdom as his grace’s
                    first chaplain. Soon after this appointment he was offered the bishopric of
                    Limerick; but having preferred a less dignified station in his own country, he
                    exchanged it with Dr Leslie, prebendary of Durham and rector of Sedgefield, for
                    these preferments. In November 1765 he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society.
                    In June 1766 he was, on the death of Dr Squire, preferred to the bishopric of St
                    David’s, which, in the October following, he resigned for that of Oxford, vacant
                    by the translation of Bishop Hume to Salisbury. In April 1777 he was translated
                    to the see of London, vacant by the death of Bishop Terrick; and in 1783 he
                    declined the offer of the primacy of all England.</p>
                <p>Having been grievously afflicted with thê stone, and having long borne the
                    severest sufferings of pain and sickness with the most exemplary fortitude and
                    resignation, this great and good man died at Fulham on the 3d of November 1787;
                    and on the 12th his remains were privately interred in a vault at Fulham church,
                    near to those of his predecessor. He had married in 1752, Mary, the daughter of
                    Laurence Jackson of Christ Church, Hampshire, by whom he had two sons and five
                    daughters. His lady and two children only survived him.</p>
                <p>His literary character may be estimated from the value and the importance of his
                    works, in the account of which we may begin with his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prelections on Hebrew Poetry.</hi> The choice of so interesting a subject
                    naturally attracted general attention; and the work has been read with equal
                    applause abroad and at home. In these Prelections the author has acquitted
                    himself in the most masterly manner, as a poet, a critic, and a divine; and such
                    is the classical purity of his Latin style, that though we have read the work
                    with the closest attention, and with no other view than to discover, if
                    possible, Anglicisms in the composition, we found not a single phrase to which,
                    we believe, a critic of the Augustan age would have objected. This is an
                    excellence to which neither Milton nor Johnson has attained, to which indeed no
                    other English writer of Latin with whom we are acquainted has attained, unless,
                    perhaps, Bishop Atterbury be excepted. To the Prelections was subjoined a short
                    confutation of Bishop Hare’s system of Hebrew metre, which occasioned a Latin
                    letter from Dr Edwards of Clare Hall, Cambridge, to Dr Lowth, in vindication of
                    the Hare metre. To this the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208976"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-8976-0581"/>author of the Prelections replied in a larger
                    confutation, in which Bishop Hare’s system is completely overthrown, and the
                    fallacy upon which it was built accurately investigated and exposed. After much
                    attentive consideration, Bishop Lowth has pronounced the metre of the Hebrews to
                    be perfectly irrecoverable.</p>
                <p>In 1758 he published <hi rend="italic">The Life of William of Wykcham,</hi> '
                    bishop of Winchester, with a dedication to Bishop Hoadly, which involved him in
                    a dispute concerning a decision which that bishop had lately pronounced
                    respecting the wardenship of Winchester College. This controversy was on both
                    sides carried on with such ability, that, though relating to a private concern,
                    it may yet be read, if not with pleasure, at least with improvement. The life of
                    Wykeham is drawn from the most authentic sources, and affords much information
                    concerning the manners, and some of the public transactions, of the period in
                    which Wykeham lived, whilst it displays some private intelligence respecting the
                    two literary societies of which he was the founder. In these societies Dr Lowth
                    was educated, and he gratefully expresses his obligations to them.</p>
                <p>In 1762 was first published his <hi rend="italic">Short Introduction to English
                    Grammar,</hi> which has since gone through so many editions. It was originally
                    designed only for private and domestic use; but its judicious remarks being too
                    valuable to be confined to a few, the book was given to the world; and the
                    excellence of its method, which teaches what is right by showing what is wrong,
                    has insured public approbation and very general use. In 1765 Dr Lowth was
                    engaged with Bishop Warburton in a controversy, which made much noise at the
                    time, and attracted thei notice even of royalty itself. If we do not wish to
                    dwell upon; the particulars of this controversy, it is because violent literary
                    contention is an evil which, though, like other war, it may sometimes be
                    unavoidable, yet is always to be regretted; and because the characters of
                    learned, ingenious, and amiable men never appear to less advantage than under
                    the form which that state of literary hostility obliges them to assume.</p>
                <p>In 1778 Bishop Lowth published his last great work, <hi rend="italic">A
                    Translation of Isaiah.</hi> To his literary and theological abilities the
                    translator joined the most critical knowledge of the character and spirit of
                    eastern poetry; and accordingly the’ prophecies of Isaiah, which, though almost
                    always sublime or elegant, are yet sometimes obscure, were translated in a
                    manner adequate to the highest expectations of the public. Several occasional
                    discourses which the bishop, by his station, was at different times called i
                    upon to deliver, were of course published, and are all worthy of their excellent
                    author; but there is one on the kingdom of God, on the extension and progressive
                    improvement of Christ’s religion, and on the means of promoting these by the
                    advancement of religious knowledge, by freedom of inquiry, by toleration, and
                    mutual charity, which may be distinguished from the rest, as exhibiting a most
                    comprehensive view of the successive states of the Christian church, and
                    containing the truest principles of Christianity.</p>
                <p>Of the bishop’s poetical pieces* none display greater <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> merit than verses on the Genealogy of Christ, and the Choice of Hercules,
                    both composed very early in life. He wrote a spirited Imitation of an Ode of
                    Horace, applied to the alarming situation of this country in 1745; and likewise
                    some verses upon the death of Frederick, prince of Wales, with a few smaller
                    poems.</p>
                <p>Learning and taste, however, did not constitute Bishop Lowth’s highest
                    excellence. Eulogium itself can scarcely ascend to extravagance when speaking of
                    him either as a private man, or as a pastor of the church of Christ. His amiable
                    manners rendered him an ornament to his high station, whilst they endeared him
                    to all with whom he conversed; and his zeal for the interests of true religion
                    made him eager to advance to places of trust and dignity such clergymen as he
                    knew were best qualified to fill them.</p>
