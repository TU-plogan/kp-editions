                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">LEVEL</label>, an instrument which enables us to find a line
                    or surface exactly level; that is, such as shall be everywhere parallel to the
                    true horizon, or at right angles to the plumb-line or direction of gravity. It
                    also enables us to find the difference between the heights of two or more places
                    on the surface of the earth.</p>
                <p>Amongst the great variety of instruments which have been invented for these
                    purposes, and which are all guided by the agency of gravitation, the following
                    are the most important and useful.</p>
                <p>Levels in which the plummet or plumb-line forms the most essential part have been
                    constructed in many different forms, and under as many names, to suit the
                    purpose or fancies of the various artificers who employ them; such as masons,
                    bricklayers, paviors, carpenters, and others. But the general principle of the
                    construction is to attach a thread and plummet to the upper part of a board or
                    flat frame of wood or metal, in such a manner that, when the thread of this
                    plummet, hanging freely, coincides with, a fiducial line marked on the frame, it
                    is at right angles to the base of the instrument; so that when this occurs, the
                    thing to which the base is applied must obviously be level; but if the thread
                    declines from the mark, the thing is lower on one side than the other. In some
                    of these levels, the fiducial line or mark is at the middle of the base, in
                    others at or near the end. But though it is easy to see, that the longer the
                    base, and the farther down the thread the fiducial line extends, so much the
                    more accurate or sensible is the instrument likely to be; yet little or no
                    regard is generally had to this in practice. The vibrations of the lead, which
                    are troublesome in nice operations, may be in a great measure prevented by
                    having it immersed <pb break="no" facs="nls:193204764"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-4764-0257"/>in a vessel with water or other liquor. Sometimes
                    the plummet is enclosed in a glass cover to protect it from the agitation of the
                    wind, and sights or even a telescope are occasionally applied. For a telescope
                    may be added to any kind of level, by applying it upon or parallel to the base
                    of the instrument when there is occasion to take the level of remote objects.
                    One of the simplest forms of a plumb-level is shown in fig. 1, Plate CCCXXII.;
                    and the next we shall describe is another.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Artillery Foot-Level</hi> is in the form of a carpenter’s
                    square, having its two legs or branches of equal lengths; at their juncture is a
                    little hole, whence hangs a thread and plummet playing on a quadrant, which is
                    divided into twice forty-five degrees from the middle, as shown in fig. 2.</p>
                <p>By placing the feet or ends of its two branches on a plane, in such a manner that
                    the thread may play perpendicularly over the middle division of the quadrant,
                    the plane is assuredly level. To use it in gunnery, place the two ends on the
                    piece of artillery, which may be raised to any proposed height, as indicated by
                    the plummet, whose thread will give the degree above the level.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gunners Level,</hi> for levelling cannons and mortars, consists
                    of a triangular brass plate about four inches high (fig. 3), at the bottom of
                    which is a portion of a circle, divided only into forty-five degrees, as this
                    number is sufficient for the highest elevation of cannons and mortars, and for
                    giving shot the greatest range. On the centre of a segment of a circle turns a
                    piece of brass A B, which may be fixed by a screw at pleasure. Its lower end B
                    serves for a plummet and index, to show the different degrees of elevation of
                    pieces of artillery. This instrument has also a brass foot, not shown in the
                    figure, to set upon cannons or mortars; so that when those pieces are
                    horizontal, the instrument is perpendicular. The foot is to be placed on the
                    piece to be elevated, in such a manner that the point of the plummet may fall on
                    the proper degree; this they call <hi rend="italic">levelling the
                    piece.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Balance-Level</hi> is wholly suspended as a pendulum. It is
                    furnished with sights, which, when the instrument hangs at rest, show the line
                    of level, and sometimes even a telescope is applied to it. Levels of this sort
                    have been made in various forms. They have but little sensibility, and are
                    liable to be sadly disturbed by the wind.</p>
                <p>Desagulier’s level, described at considerable length in almost every treatise on
                    this subject, is essentially the same with the method of measuring heights by
                    the barometer, to which, as a mode of levelling, we therefore beg to refer.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Reflecting Level,</hi> that made by means of a pretty long
                    surface of water representing the same object inverted which we see erect by the
                    eye; so that the point where these two objects appear to meet, is on a level
                    with the place where the surface of the water is found.</p>
                <p>There is another reflecting level, consisting of a mirror of steel, or the like,
                    well polished, and placed a little before the object-glass of a telescope,
                    suspended perpendicularly. This mirror must make an angle of 45° with the
                    telescope, in which case the perpendicular line of the telescope is converted
                    into a horizontal line, which is the same with the line of level.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Water-Level,</hi> that which shows the horizontal line by means
                    of a surface of water or other liquor, founded on this principle, that a liquid
                    always places itself level.</p>
                <p>The most simple water-level is made of a long wooden trough or canal, whose sides
                    are parallel to the base; so tnat, being equally filled with water, its surface
                    shows the line of level. This is the chorobates of the ancients, described by
                    Vitruvius.</p>
                <p>It is also made with two cups fitted to the two ends of <hi rend="superscript">
                    a</hi> pipe three or four feet long/ bout an inch in diameter, by means of which
                    the water communicates from the one cup to the other; and this pipe being
                    moveable on its stand by means of a ball and socket, when the two cups become
                    equally full of water, their two surfaces mark the line of level.</p>
                <p>This instrument, instead of cups, may also be made with two short cylinders of
                    glass three or four inches long, fastened to each extreme of the pipe with wax
                    or mastic. Into the pipe is poured some common or coloured water, which shows
                    itself through the cylinders, by means of which the line of level is determined;
                    the height of the water being the same in both cylinders, whether these are
                    themselves perfectly level or not. This level, though very simple, is yet very
                    commodious for levelling at small distances. Various instruments constructed on
                    this principle with water, mercury, and other liquids, have aimed at great
                    perfection; but, as refined levels, we consider them so inferior to the
                    spirit-level, shortly to be noticed, as not to merit a particular description
                    here.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Air-Level,</hi> that which shows the line of level by means of
                    a bubble of air enclosed with some liquor in a glass tube which is slightly
                    convex upward, and has its two ends hermetically sealed. When the bubble fixes
                    itself at a certain mark in the middle of the tube, the plane or ruler whereon
                    it is fixed is level. When it is not level, the bubble will rise to one end.
                    This glass tube may be set in another of brass, or in a piece of wood, having an
                    aperture in the middle, through which the bubble of air may be observed. The
                    liquor with which the tube is filled is most commonly alcohol or spirit of wine.
                    This application of a bubble of air is said to be the invention of Dr Hooke; but
                    some ascribe it to; Thevenot.</p>
                <p>One of these instruments made with sights, is an improvement upon that last
                    described,Zand, by a little additional apparatus, becomes more commodious and
                    exact. It consists of an air-level AB (fig. 4), about eight inches long, and
                    seven or eight fines in diameter, set in a brass tube 2, with an aperture in the
                    middle C. The tubes are supported by a straight ruler a foot long, at whose end
                    are fixed two sights, 3, 3, exactly perpendicular to the tubes, and of an equal
                    height, having a square hole, subdivided by a cross of thin brass, in the middle
                    of which is drilled a very small hole, through which a point on a level with the
                    instrument is observed. The brass tube is fastened on the ruler by means of two
                    screws, one of which, marked 4, serves to raise or depress the tube at pleasure,
                    for bringing it towards a level. The top of the ball and socket is riveted to a
                    little ruler that springs, one end whereof is fastened with a screw to the great
                    ruler, and at the other end has a screw, 5, serving to raise and depress the
                    instrument when nearly level.</p>
                <p>We should consider wires greatly preferable to sights with holes, which, though
                    very small, will take in too great a space to determine the point of level
                    precisely. But the principle of the air-level is brought to an incomparably
                    greater degree of perfection in the instrument next to be described.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Spirit-Level.</hi> The most accurate levelling instrument in
                    use, and that possessed of the greatest essential advantages, is the
                    spirit-level, which was first constructed by Mr Sisson, and to which various
                    additions and improvements have been since made, particularly by Mr Ramsden. The
                    following is a description of one of the best of these levels. Fig. 5 represents
                    the instrument mounted on its staves, PQR. The telescope, AB, is made from
                    fifteen inches to two feet in length, as may be required. It is achromatic, of
                    the best kind, and shows the objects erect. By turning the screw <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> at the side of the telescope, the object-glass is moved;
                    and thus the telescope is exactly adapted to the eye. In the focus of the
                    eyeglasses are exceedingly fine cross wires, the intersection of which should be
                    so perfectly in the axis of the tube, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193204777"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-4777-0258"/>that by turning it round on its two supporters D,
                    E, and looking through the telescope, the intersection of the wires may
                    constantly cut the same part of the object viewed. They are easily adjusted to
                    this state by means of the four screws <hi rend="italic">bbbb</hi> placed on the
                    telescope, near the end for the eye. These screws act in directions
                    perpendicular to one another, so that, by unscrewing one and tightening the
                    opposite one, the wire perpendicular to them may be moved either way at
                    pleasure; and in this manner the other wire may be moved, and thus the
                    intersection of the wires is brought exactly into the axis of the tube.</p>
                <p>To the telescope is fixed, by two small screws, the level tube <hi rend="italic"
                    >cd</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> containing the spirits, with a small
                    bubble of air: this bubble, when the instrument is well adjusted, will settle
                    exactly in the same place, in or near the middle of its tube, whether the
                    telescope be reversed or not on the supporters, which in this case are kept
                    unmoved. To render the level truly parallel to the telescope, the screw at <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> adjusts it vertically, and that at <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    horizontally. The two supporters D, E, on which the level rests and turns, are
                    shaped like the letter Y. The telescope rests within the upper part of them; and
                    the inner sides of each of these Y’s are tangents to the cyiindric tube of the
                    telescope, which is turned to a true cylinder, and each side touches it only at
                    one place. The telescope can be confined in the Y’s by means of two jointed
                    arches or rims, <hi rend="italic">ff</hi> which fasten with pins, <hi
                    rend="italic">g g,</hi> as shown in the figure.</p>
                <p>The lower ends of these supporters are inserted into a strong brass bar F G, so
                    as to stand perpendicularly on it. To one of these is applied a fine threaded
                    screw, H, to adjust the tube, when on its supporters, to a true level; and to
                    the same supporter D is sometimes applied a line of tangents as far as ten
                    degrees, in order to take an angle of depression or elevation to that extent.
                    Between the supporters is also sometimes fixed a compass-box I, divided into
                    360°, and again into four times 90°, having a centre pin and needle, and trigger
                    to throw off the needle from the centre when not used; so as to constitute a
                    perfect circumferentor, connected with all the foregoing improvements. This
                    plate is fixed on a conical brass ferrule, which is adapted to the axis or
                    bell-metal frustum of a cone at top of the brass head of the staves, having a
                    ball and socket, with three bell-metal joints, two strong brass plates LL, four
                    screws <hi rend="italic">eeee,</hi> for adjusting the conical axis of the stand
                    to be truly vertical, a regulating screw Μ to the motion on this axis, and a
                    fastening screw N to tighten it on the cone when necessary. The fastening screw
                    N, and the regulating screw Μ, by which the whole instrument is moved steadily
                    round the vertical axis through a small <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> space, were
                    an addition of Mr Ramsden’s. It is to be observed that, since the lower of the
                    two plates LL generally partakes of the inclination of the ground, while the
                    upper should always be level, they are almost never parallel, though usually
                    called “the parallel plates.”</p>
                <p>The whole level being now placed steadily on its staves, we must gradually adjust
                    the axis of the stand to be truly vertical, if it is not so already. For this
                    purpose the telescope must be placed in a line with two of the screws e e, and
                    then levelled by these, if-necessary, till the bubble of air in the spirit-tube
                    keeps its position in the middle. It is next to be turned into a line with the
                    other two screws e <hi rend="italic">e</hi> at right angles to the former, and
                    to be also levelled in that position.</p>
                <p>The horizontal motion on the vertical axis being thus far adjusted, the rims <hi
                    rend="italic">ffoĩ</hi> the Y’s are to be opened, the telescope is to be taken
                    off and laid the contrary way upon these supporters. If the bubble of air then
                    rests exactly the same as before, the level and telescope are already adjusted
                    rightly to one another; but if the bubble does not remain the same, the end to
                    which it goes must be noticed, and its position altered; correcting the error
                    partly by the screws c, <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and H, and partly by repeating
                    the adjustments above described, upon the screws e <hi rend="italic"
                    >eee.</hi></p>
                <p>The intersection of the wires being now directed to any distant object, it may be
                    one of the vanes of the staves or poles hereafter described. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Levelling</hi><hi rend="italic">Staves.)</hi> If they continue
                    to be against it precisely, while the telescope is turned round its axis on its
                    Y’s, it proves, as before mentioned, that the axis coincides with the
                    intersection of the wires. In this easy mode of adjustment consists the
                    excellence of the instrument; for it is hereby capable of being adjusted by only
                    one station and one object, which will at the same time determine it to be in a
                    true level. If, by change of weather, accident, or other cause, the instrument
                    should have lost its level or adjustment, it may thus be readily restored and
                    re-adjusted at the first station; which is an advantage many levelling
                    instruments do not possess.</p>
                <p>Since it is often of great importance to execute levelling with accuracy, and the
                    best instrument when out of its adjustment being of little use, it is quite
                    necessary that every person using such an instrument should ∙ have it readily in
                    his power to correct it; and the above, which is Ramsden’s construction, is well
                    adapted for this purpose. There are no doubt simpler instruments, as, for
                    instance, some of Troughton’s; but none of these simple ones admit of anything
                    like such perfect adjustments as the one just described, though they may suit
                    fully as well in the hands of a person not capable of making the adjustments,
                    and of course not capable of taking a nice level at all.</p>
                <p>It is well known, that when a plummet or pendulum vibrates freely in a circular
                    arc, the tendency of gravity to bring it to the resting position is everywhere
                    as the sine of the angular distance from that position. Now, if the bubble in
                    the spirit-level moves in a circle, it is obviously acted on by a force
                    precisely similar to that which gravity exerts upon the plummet; and therefore
                    it would seem that a spirit-level should measure small angles with the same
                    accuracy as a sector whose radius is equal to that of the curvature of the glass
                    tube, or a plumb-line of the same length; but there are some causes which
                    diminish its accuracy. When the bubble of air has been brought to the middle of
                    the glass tube, and when the tube, after being deranged, is restored to the very
                    same position, we cannot be sure that the bubble of air will return to the very
                    middle of the tube. This irregularity is produced by the friction of the
                    included liquid against the sides of the tube, and depends on the magnitude of
                    the bubble and the quantity of liquid. In a good level, where the bubble moves
                    about five lines for a minute of inclination, this uncertainty does not exceed
                    half a line, which may be ascertained by pointing the telescope to any object.
                    The coincidence of a plumb-line with a particular mark will, on account of the
                    insensible oscillation of the thread, leave about double the uncertainty which
                    is left by the index of a sector, and which may be estimated at about a
                    hundredth of a line. A variety of interesting researches on this subject by Mr
                    Nixon will be found in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine</hi> for
                    April and May 1827, March 1829, and June 1831.</p>
                <p>Levels are commonly made of glass tubes in the state they are obtained at the
                    glass-house. Of these,, the straightest and most regular are selected and
                    examined, by filling them nearly with spirit of wine, and ascertaining by trial
                    that side at which the bubble moves most regularly, by equal inclinations of the
                    instrument upon a stage called the bubble trier, which is provided with a
                    micrometer screw for that purpose. The most regular side is chosen for the upper
                    part of the instrument, the others being of little consequence to its
                    perfection. Spι∙</p>

                <p>rit of wine is used, because if pure it does not freeze at natural temperatures,
                    and is more fluid than water. Sometimes, indeed, though very rarely, ether is
                    employed. The tube and the bubble must be of considerable length. The longer the
                    bubble, the more sensible it is to a small inclination. A very small bubble is
                    scarcely sensible, appears as if attached to the glass, and moves but
                    slowly.</p>
                <p>In the use of a level of this kind constructed by Langlois, it was remarked, that
                    when it was properly set in the cool of the morning, it was no longer so in the
                    middle of the day, or when the weather became hot; and that when it was again
                    rectified for the middle of the day, it became false in the evening, after the
                    heat had diminished. The bubble was much longer in cold than in hot weather, and
                    when longer it was too much so, and could not be kept in the middle of the tube,
                    but stood a little on the ope or the other side, though the inclination was
                    precisely the same. These defects were small, and such as claim the notice of
                    careful observers only; but they appeared of too much consequence not to produce
                    a wish to remedy them. It was observed that they arose from inequalities in the
                    interior surface of the tube; and by examining a great number of tubes, selected
                    for levels of the same kind, there was reason to conclude that all these levels
                    would have more or less of the same defects, because there was not one tube of a
                    regular figure within. They were at best no otherwise cylindrical than plates of
                    glass can be said to be plane before they are ground. The irregularities were
                    easily discernible.</p>
                <p>It was therefore concluded that it would be advisable to grind the inner surfaces
                    of the tubes, and give them a regular cylindrical or rather spindle form, of
                    which the two opposite sides should correspond with portions of circles of very
                    long radius. To accomplish this, a rod of iron was taken of twice the length of
                    the glass tube, and on the middle of this rod was fixed a stout tube of brass of
                    the same length as the tube of glass, and nearly filling the bore. The rod was
                    fixed between the centres of a lathe, and the glass gently rubbed on the brass
                    cylinder, with fine emery and water, causing it to move through its whole
                    length. The glass was held by the middle, that it might be equally ground, and
                    was from time to time shifted on its axis, as was also the brass cylinder, in
                    order that the wear might be everywhere alike. The operation had scarcely
                    commenced before the tube broke; and several others experienced the same
                    misfortune, though they had been well annealed. It was supposed that the emery
                    which became fixed in the brass might contribute to split the glass, each grain
                    continuing its impression with the same point, in a straight line, and in some
                    instances might be disposed to cut the glass as diamond. Yet it is curious that
                    some artists find a wooden cylinder to suit pretty well, probably because it
                    does not hold the emery so firmly as brass does. But when a cylinder of glass
                    was substituted instead of the brass, the emery, rolling on the surface of the
                    glass instead of fixing itself, had better success; so that the tube and
                    cylinder touched each other through their whole length. The same operation was
                    continued, using finer and finer emery to smooth the tube, and prepare it for
                    polishing; after which the tube and cylinder having been well washed, thin paper
                    was pasted round the cylinder, and very equally covered with a small quantity of
                    Venice tripoli. The tube was then replaced and rubbed as before, till it had
                    acquired a polish.</p>
                <p>A level thus ground may be either of the proper sensibility, or be too much or
                    too little sensible. It will be too sluggish, if, before grinding, exclusive of
                    the inequalities of the tube, its diameter in the middle of the length should
                    much exceed the diameter of the extremities; or it will be too sensible if this
                    diameter should not sufficiently exceed the other; ór, lastly, if the middle
                    diameter be smaller than that of the extremes, the bubble will be incapable of
                    continuing in the middle, but will, in every case, either run to one or the
                    other end, or be divided into two parts.</p>
                <p>To correct these defects, and to give the instrument the required degree of
                    perfection, it is proper to examine its figure before the grinding is entirely
                    finished. For this purpose, after cleaning it well, a sufficient quantity of
                    spirit of wine must be put into it, and secured by a cork at each end. The tube
                    must then be placed on the forks or Y’s of a bubble trier, and its sensibility,
                    or the magnitude and regularity of the space run over by the bubble, by equal
                    changes of the micrometer screw, must be ascertained. If the run or spaces
                    passed over be too great, they may be rendered smaller by grinding the tube on a
                    short cylinder; but if they be too short, they may, on the contrary, be
                    enlarged, by grinding on a longer cylinder. It is necessary, therefore, to be
                    provided with a number of these cylinders of the same diameter, but of different
                    lengths, which it is advisable to bring to a first figure, by grinding them in a
                    hollow half cylinder of brass. By means of these it will be easy to regulate the
                    tube of the level to any required degree of sensibility, after which the tube
                    may be very quickly smoothed and polished.</p>
                <p>A level thus ground was one foot in length, and so was the cylinder on which it
                    was first worked. When finished it was found to be too sensible. It was
                    therefore worked on another cylinder between nine and ten inches long, which
                    diminished its sensibility so far, that the bubble, which was nine inches and
                    four lines long, at the temperature of 68° Fahrenheit, was carried from the
                    middle of the tube exactly one line for every second of inclination. This
                    sensibility was thought sufficient; but if greater is required, it may be
                    obtained by the process here described. For more on this subject, we again beg
                    to refer to Mr Nixon’s papers already cited.</p>
                <p>It may be remarked, that a glass tube is very subject to be split by grinding its
                    inner surface; the same tube will not be endangered by grinding its external
                    surface, even with coarse emery; and when once the polish of the inside is
                    ground off, the danger is over, and coarser emery may be used with safety. Thick
                    glass is more subject to this misfortune than thinner. The coarsest emery used
                    in grinding the tube here spoken of was sufficiently fine to employ one minute
                    in descending three inches in water.</p>
