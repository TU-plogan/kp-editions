                <p><label type="entry">LEGISLATION</label>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> word Legislation is used in two senses; the one
                    ancient, the other comparatively modern. In its ancient and most ordinary
                    acceptation, it comprehends the science of law, as law ought to be; explaining
                    the principles from which law should be universally derived, and also the rule
                    to be observed in the application of those principles to particular countries.
                    In its much more recent and restricted sense, it is made to represent as much of
                    the contents of the municipal laws of a country, and as much only, as is created
                    immediately by the supreme authority, acting in its legislative capacity. In
                    either case, it is equally distinguished from the several meanings which have,
                    at different times, been given by the majority of writers, to the word
                    Jurisprudence. For instance, the science of legislation (or what law <hi
                    rend="italic">ought to be)</hi> is carefully separated by Mr Austin, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Province of Jurisprudence,</hi> from the science of jurisprudence
                    (or the qualities which are common to all laws,—what law therefore <hi
                    rend="italic">is, and must be),</hi> which it was the characteristic object of
                    Mr Austin’s lectures to interpret. Again, legislation, in both of the above
                    senses,— whether used as meaning the science of perfect laws, or as descriptive
                    of that portion of the body of any law which has emanated from the legislature
                    itself,—is manifestly a very different subject from the jurisprudence <hi
                    rend="italic">(prudentia</hi><hi rend="italic">juris)</hi> of the Romans. In
                    their written wisdom, jurisprudence was understood in its more primitive
                    acceptation; in the meaning, in short, which with most persons and for most
                    purposes it still retains, namely, that of a general and scientific knowledge of
                    the laws, whatever they may be. There is a third and later meaning of
                    jurisprudence, in which it is narrowed down to the usage of the courts. This
                    application of it is of French invention, having been manufactured by them, in
                    technical opposition to an equally peculiar construction which they had put upon
                    the word legislation. This was done with the view of distinguishing between the
                    positive letter of the codes (termed “legislation Française”) and judicial
                    decisions; which latter division of their laws they consequently thought fit
                    specially to characterize by the name of jurisprudence. It is plain, therefore,
                    that upon most occasions, legislation and jurisprudence will mean different
                    things. But, on comparing legislation in the first and usual sense, as above
                    mentioned, with the description of natural or universal jurisprudence, as copied
                    in a succeeding paragraph from Adam Smith, it will appear that, until we come to
                    the modifications introduced by particular legislation, these two sciences are
                    substantially the same.</p>
                <p>Man by the very constitution of his nature is social, and society supposes
                    government. Investigations into the origin of government (as, for instance,
                    whether, at its commencement, it was patriarchal or military) are amongst the
                    creditable amusements of conjectural philosophy. But they are amusements only,
                    when compared with practical criticisms on the form and the spirit of particular
                    political institutions, or with the higher reasonings by which the true
                    principles of a sound constitutional system are developed and determined. All
                    political institutions are artificial constructions, admitting of great variety.
                    But they may be brought under one or other of two comprehensive classes; since,
                    in whatever hands the supreme authority of a state is lodged, it must be founded
                    either on the partial interests of certain individuals, more or less numerous,
                    or on the general interest of the whole community. According to which of these
                    classes a government may happen to belong, there will be considerable difference
                    in the aspect and object of its legislation; but from the moment one or two are
                    gathered together into a society, their most pressing necessity is that of
                    ascertaining or making the laws upon which the social interests of its members
                    are henceforward to depend.</p>
                <p>The universal elements of the science of legislation would seem to be
                    sufficiently simple. Depending on the nature of things and of man, it may be
                    thought there could be no mistake. Unfortunately, the history of the human race
                    has not been so reasonable and so straightforward. It was late before the nature
                    and condition of man, either as an individual or as a member of society, were
                    analysed, with the view of determining the choice between opposite means of
                    happiness, or of ascertaining the rules of justice. In process of time most of
                    these questions were settled more or less rudely by the respective societies,
                    without much consultation amongst each other. It was still later before the
                    thought occurred of forming into a general system the common principles which
                    all nations might be expected to adopt. Barbarism and sophistry had had such
                    long possession, and had so confused and complicated the subject, that to
                    discover these common principles is the great, and indeed arduous object of
                    philosophical legislation.</p>
                <p>Looking at legislation with the help of philosophy and history, it is evident
                    that its uniformity has always been, and must always continue to be, disturbed
                    by two causes, to a certain degree independent of each other. These are, the
                    form of government, and the state of civilization. The contemporary tendency and
                    character of laws will vary <pb break="no" facs="nls:193203576"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-3576-0167"/>with the frame and nature of the political
                    organization which has been employed in their manufacture. Much more will they
                    vary with (as in truth the substance of them is necessarily derived from) the
                    condition physical and moral, the intelligence and the public virtue, of each
                    particular community.</p>
                <p>The rules of municipal law are “in general intended,” says Adam Smith, “to
                    coincide with those of natural justice. It does not indeed always happen that
                    they do so in every instance. Sometimes what is called the constitution of the
                    state, that is, the interest of the government, sometimes the interest of
                    particular orders of men who tyrannize the government, warps the positive laws
                    of the country from what natural justice would prescribe. In some countries the
                    rudeness and barbarism of the people hinder the natural sentiments of justice
                    from arriving at that accuracy and precision which, in more civilized nations,
                    they naturally attain to. Their laws are, like their manners, gross, and rude,
                    and undistinguishing. In other countries the unfortunate constitution of their
                    courts of judicature hinders any regular system of jurisprudence from ever
                    establishing itself among them, though the improved manners of the people may be
                    such as would admit of the most accurate. In no country do the decisions of
                    positive law coincide exactly, in every case, with the rules which the natural
                    sense of justice would dictate.” The extent to which he conceived these
                    aberrations to have proceeded appears in another passage. Speaking of the civil
                    and criminal law of particular countries, he observes, “the principles upon
                    which those rules either are or ought to be founded, are the subject of a
                    particular science, of all sciences by far the most important, but hitherto
                    perhaps the least cultivated,— that of natural jurisprudence.” Adam Smith calls
                    the work of Grotius not only the first, but “as yet the most complete,” on this
                    subject. The legislative writings of Mr Bentham (which have no necessary
                    connection with his theory of morals) will form an equal era.</p>
                <p>Robert Hall observed of Mr Bentham, that “in the particular province of his
                    speculations, the science of legislation, he had advanced the limits of reason;
                    and that if he were compelled to legislate for the world upon uninspired
                    principles, he should take Bentham, and go from state to state with as firm a
                    step as though he walked upon a pavement of adamant.” Had this eminent preacher
                    given as much attention to law as to divinity, he would have seen that some
                    further deduction should be made from this unlimited panegyric. There are
                    striking warnings scattered over Mr Bentham’s treatises upon legislation, of the
                    respect due to both the disturbing causes above mentioned. But the general
                    effect left, both by die matter and manner of his writings, upon most minds, is
                    on one important point (that of domestic legislation) inconsistent with the
                    forbearance and caution which he otherwise inculcates. For instance, an ardent
                    disciple, impregnated with his principles, might be induced to alter the laws of
                    his own country at once too suddenly and too far, and, when the alteration was
                    made, to err equally in inferring that it was made for ever. Yet Mr Bentham was
                    fully aware of the nature of the limitations and variations by which his general
                    theory ought to be accommodated to practice. An express dissertation on the
                    influence of time and place on subjects of legislation is set apart to the
                    solution of the problem, how, the best laws being given, the legislator ought to
                    modify them according to temporary and local considerations? There is nothing to
                    add to his observations and admissions on the necessary effector <hi
                    rend="italic">change of place,</hi> with reference to the propriety of
                    transplanting laws from one people to another. He saw the difficulty of English
                    lawmaking for India. But a great deal, we think, is wanting in his sketch of the
                    probable effect of <hi rend="italic">Change of time</hi> in preventing the same
                    laws from being equally suited to distant generations of the same people. He
                    restricts this effect to the constitutional code, excluding almost entirely the
                    civil and criminal codes from its operation. Montesquieu’s Spirit of Laws, and
                    the Treatise on Legislation by Μ. Comte, are excellent repertories of the
                    principal facts by which travellers have established the variety that exists
                    amongst the families of the human species scattered over the globe. The
                    differences between the extreme limits of our common nature (to which
                    differences all rational legislation will conform) are indeed immense. It was in
                    this point of view that Burke received the lessons contained in Dr Robertson’s
                    History of America, and felt their application to all who have to take part in
                    the government of man. The British statesman has acknowledged his obligations to
                    the historian of the new world, in language which those of his countrymen who
                    are bent on judging of all institutions by their own standard, and on
                    assimilating all nations to themselves, would do well to recollect. “I have
                    always thought that we possess at this time very great advantages towards the
                    knowledge of human nature. We need no longer go to history to trace it in all
                    stages and periods. History, from its comparative youth, is but a poor
                    instructor. When the Egyptians called the Greeks children in antiquities, we may
                    well call them children; and so we may call all those nations which were able to
                    trace the progress of society only within their own limits. But now the great
                    map of mankind is unrolled at once, and there is no state or gradation of
                    barbarism, and no mode of refinement, which we have not at the same moment under
                    our view: the very different civility of Europe and of China; the barbarism of
                    Persia and of Abyssinia; the erratic manners of Tartary and of Arabia; the
                    savage state of North America and of New Zealand.”</p>
                <p>All this is very true, and yet a given race may be no more a fixed quantity (the
                    proper subject of an identical legislation) than the human species itself. The
                    historian of the old world has not, owing to the effect of lapse of time, his
                    evidence as accessible as was the case with the historian of the new, in respect
                    of a removal from one hemisphere to another. It should be observed, however,
                    that it happened in the instance of the natives of America, that both the causes
                    were at work. As to the extent of the changes wrought by time in the condition
                    and character of the same nation, whilst dwelling on the same soil, nobody can
                    doubt. And the legislators of successive periods must notice and follow out
                    these changes, upon principles precisely similar to the precautions by which
                    transplanted legislation is controlled. No greater suffering can be inflicted on
                    a progressive people, than by the attempt at constructing immutable laws on the
                    supposition of this partial immutability of nature. A system of uniformity and
                    contraction which might fix for ages, as in a mould, some strangely stationary
                    races (the Jews, the Medes and Persians, or the Chinese), must have been torture
                    to the Greeks even of Sparta. If the Twelve Tables had been the perfection of
                    appropriate legislation in the age of the Decemvirs, there can be no question
                    but that Justinian’s Institute was more in harmony with the contemporaries of
                    Tribonian. It is probable that the Koran may not have been, even from the first,
                    the best possible system for the followers of Mahommed. Supposing it to have
                    been so, it is very certain that, through every change of circumstance, it could
                    not remain the best for their descendants. Instead of stipulating, like the
                    Locrians, that the man who at any time proposed a new law, should do so with a
                    halter round his neck, when Locke undertook to legislate for Carolina, it was on
                    the understanding that his laws were to be revised at the expiration of a
                    hundred <pb break="no" facs="nls:193203589" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3589-0168"/>years.
                    At the present moment, in all those moral and social qualities with which the
                    law is concerned, the Hindu is not much more remote from the European than the
                    actual generation of artificial Englishmen is separated from the Anglo-Saxon
                    hordes, whom, nevertheless, they represent, in blood, in language, and in soil.
                    Adam Smith is for putting a more extended meaning than Bentham and De Tracy will
                    allow, on the celebrated saying of Solon, that he had given the Athenians, if
                    not the best laws, the best that they could bear. We should say indeed that we
                    know of no such thing as an abstract best in positive legislation. Best for
                    them, is in their case best. To ascertain Mr Bentham’s opinion, however, on
                    this, as on other subjects, the whole body of his writings must be taken
                    together. Otherwise, on looking at his personal ambition for becoming the
                    legislator of almost every nation under heaven, and at his hypothesis, that no
                    person was likely to legislate for a country so well as a stranger, it might be
                    inferred, that he was disposed too hastily to pull down or to overleap the great
                    partition-wall of national distinctions. In the same manner, the prospect on the
                    effect of time, so narrow in the chapter alluded to, is elsewhere enlarged,
                    until it embraces every distant contingency we could desire. Mr Bentham is aware
                    that a periodical revision of its provisions will be a necessary supplement to a
                    code. He was apparently unconscious of the property of accommodation which the
                    admirers of the common law have discovered in its popular and malleable nature.
                    So, in his first letter to Mr Madison, in 1811, after observing that the common
                    law was nothing but “an ideal and shapeless mass of merely conjectural and
                    essentially uncognoscible matter,” he proceeds to complain of it as unfitted to
                    our actual wants: “Law, which being, in so far as it could be said to be made,
                    made at a multitude of successive periods, and for the use and governance of so
                    many different generations of men,—men imbued with notions, habituated to modes
                    of life, differing more or less widely from each other, as well as from those
                    which have place at present,—would, even had it been well adapted to the
                    circumstances and exigencies of the times in which its parts came respectively
                    into existence, have, to a considerable degree, been thereby rendered, not the
                    <hi rend="italic">better</hi> adapted, but by so much the <hi rend="italic"
                    >worse</hi> adapted, to the notions and manners <hi rend="italic">now</hi>
                    prevalent, to the state of things <hi rend="italic">at present</hi> in
                    existence.” Admissions more extensive than these as to the vast alterations
                    which the quiet hand of time, passing over the body of the laws and the
                    character and condition of a people, must necessarily produce, severing them
                    from each other wider and wider, even modern English law-makers, who are never
                    easy but when tinkering at an act of parliament, could not possibly require.</p>
                <p>The word law, in its proper and original sense, carries with it the notion of a
                    superior. This intimation of supremacy is the principal quality conveyed in the
                    widest definition of law, namely, “the expression of a will by a command.” In
                    this point of view the authoritative interposition of conscience enables
                    moralists who adopt the theory of conscience to speak with perfect correctness
                    of the law of morals. In their mouth it is no metaphor. What is the nature of
                    the will, or of the command which may be coupled with the law, is an entirely
                    distinct consideration. A frequent source of misconception (that of false
                    analogies) would have been avoided, if writers had more carefully separated the
                    several meanings in which the word <hi rend="italic">law</hi> is used. Above
                    all, there are two meanings, between which it is important to discriminate; one
                    in which the difference consists in the subject of the laws, the other in their
                    author. The first division is formed by the distinction between matter and the
                    mixed human constitution,—between the passiveness and uniformity of matter, and
                    the free agency and the consequent variableness of imperfect man. Hence
                    originates the complete disseveration of those laws of the material world, which
                    simply represent <hi rend="italic">what is,</hi> from the laws of the moral
                    world, which represent <hi rend="italic">what ought to be.</hi> The laws of the
                    material world are physical phenomena stated in a general proposition. The
                    occurrence of a single exception would disprove the law. The laws of ethics,
                    although really derived from and dependent upon human nature, presuppose a moral
                    assumption with which the facts are to coincide. Accordingly, they will continue
                    equally to be the laws of our moral being, even whilst they are violated every
                    day. The second division is formed by the distinction between a perfect and
                    imperfect legislator: between the legislative attributes of God and the
                    legislative attributes of man. If Montesquieu had observed the first of these
                    divisions, he probably would not have put in apposition so many different senses
                    of the word law as are used in the following sentence, nor have left his readers
                    to infer that the same word on these several occasions meant always the same
                    thing: “The Deity has his laws: the material world its laws: intelligences
                    superior to man their laws: the brutes their laws: man his laws.” Attention to
                    the second division would have protected Blackstone from quoting the description
                    given by Cicero of the law of nature or morals as synonymous with that of
                    positive or municipal law.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Blackstone, 44, 122.</p></note> Speaking of municipal law, he has made the
                    fact of law or no law depend upon its nature. According to the latter member of
                    his definition, there can be no such thing as a bad municipal law; for he
                    defines it to be “the rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme authority
                    in the state, <hi rend="italic">commanding what is right, and prohibiting what
                    is wrong?</hi> The consequence of so fallacious a proposition at the threshold,
                    has been just what might have been expected. A mischievous confusion between
                    particular and general jurisprudence pervades and perverts the whole of his
                    elementary chapter. An assertion of this kind is unfortunately contradicted at
                    once by the experience of great portions of mankind. A particular law, issuing
                    from the supreme authority of the state, does not cease to be the law within the
                    territories of that state, as long as the supreme authority is strong enough to
                    enforce it, although it should command what is wrong, and prohibit what is
                    right. Nevertheless, a lawgiver approaches to perfection only in proportion as
                    he succeeds in his attempts to realize the other attributes of God; the
                    attributes of goodness and of wisdom, as well as the coarser attribute of power.
                    Goodness is wanted in order to supply general rectitude of intention; wisdom, in
                    order to estimate the value of every specific end, and the aptitude of the
                    means. A government with good intentions will propose for its object the
                    happiness of the governed. But a government must be wise as well ,as good to
                    enable it to discover the precise measures by which this object will be most
                    effectually promoted.</p>
                <p>One of the principal provisions of what is called constitutional law is, to
                    organize such a system of electoral legislation as will return to the
                    legislature a representative body, so identified in interest with the people as
                    almost to guarantee rectitude in their intention. The wisdom of their measures
                    will be in proportion to the statesmanlike knowledge of the individual members
                    of whom the legislature is composed; their personal attainments being combined
                    with and helped out by the knowledge of the persons whom they may happen to
                    consult. It is improbable, for many reasons, that a legislature, and more
                    especially a popular legislature, should at all times, or even at <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193203602" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3602-0169"/>any time, possess a competent
                    degree of knowledge wholly within itself. But there are no limits to the
                    assistance from without which the supreme authority of a state has always at
                    command. It need not be afraid of asking for advice. The doctrine of its
                    supremacy can want no farther recognition than that it should keep the ultimate
                    sanction and revision of the laws in its own hands. In this wayit may accomplish
                    much by means of foreign assistance. But if a legislative assembly is to have
                    the full benefit of the ability of its own members, it must proceed, by a proper
                    division of legislative labour, to distribute the work which it reserves for its
                    own body, into appropriate departments. A prudent distribution of labour,
                    although indispensable for preparing and digesting the materials, will not be
                    enough. The deliberative assembly must, by well-considered regulations, secure
                    the freedom and order of its own discussions. This done, no further condition
                    regarding mere arrangements can be required, than that skilful draughtsmen
                    should be called in for the mechanical operation of putting the meaning of the
                    legislature into becoming form and language. The criminal laws of all countries,
                    and even the civil laws of some, proceed upon the hard (although, in the first
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> these cases at least, the indispensable) presumption,
                    <hi rend="italic">ignorantia legis neminem excusat.</hi> It is clearly,
                    therefore, an act of bare justice to the inhabitants of every country, first,
                    that its laws should, as far as possible, be drawn up in such a manner as to be
                    capable, with due attention on the part of sensible persons, of being correctly
                    and completely understood; and next, after being made intelligible, that by due
                    promulgation they should be made known.</p>
                <p>Amongst ourselves, the proceedings of the British parliament have forced the
                    attention of thinking men, and must, sooner or later, force the attention of the
                    public, upon these latter topics. One of our wants has been ably stated by Mr
                    Wickens, in “an argument for more of the division of labour in civil life in
                    this country.” The height to which the grievance has grown can never be more
                    strongly signified than in the extravagance of the suggestions which the late
                    Sir John Sinclair made for its redress. The truth is, that the supreme
                    legislature, or British parliament, occasionally troubles itself about many
                    things which do not properly fall within the province of government at all. For
                    the province of government has been properly defined to be “that of promoting
                    the happiness of the community associated under it, by such measures as cannot
                    be undertaken by individuals, or subordinate associations for themselves, or
                    cannot be undertaken with equal advantage.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See on this point the <hi rend="italic">Rationale of
                    Political Representation,</hi> by the author of <hi rend="italic">Essays on the
                    Formation of Opinions.</hi></p></note> But, on our present system, we employ a
                    steam-engine to crack nuts. We are frequently seen wasting the whole powers of
                    the council of the nation over questions of a partial or local nature, with
                    which (supposing them to be within the province of government) the supreme
                    legislature at all events ought not to have interfered. These are the hundred
                    minor matters which never came before the legislature until comparatively recent
                    days; and which would have been in every way infinitely better disposed of, if
                    they had been left to the discretion of subordinate jurisdictions, subject only
                    to the supremacy of the state. λVith respect to such general measures as it is
                    necessary to reserve, in the first instance, to the discretion of the supreme
                    authority itself, it is equally clear that its work would be often done with
                    incomparably greater ease and efficiency by a more prudent division and
                    application of its force.</p>
                <p>On this head, Mr Symonds, in a very judicious work entitled <hi rend="italic">The
                    Mechanics of Law-making, intended for the use of Legislators, and all other
                    persons concerned in the making</hi><hi rend="italic">and understanding of
                    English Laws,</hi> observes, that “in the progress of invention, schemers often
                    discover new principles, that are fruitless, for the want of mechanical
                    knowledge or skill to develope them in some tangible form. So our legislators
                    often dream wisely, and talk after the fashion of their dreams; but, from
                    ignorance and want of skill in the workmanship of details, which they leave to
                    the routine performance of mere artisans, they seldom succeed in giving to the
                    people a law intelligible either to themselves or the persons for whose especial
                    guidance the law was designed. The beauty of a piece of mechanism is shown in
                    the completeness of all its parts, and their combined action towards one grand
                    general result. There is nothing excessive, nothing wanting. Each part has its
                    special use, and is indispensable. Apply these principles to the English laws,
                    what are they? The clumsiest pieces of workmanship which the unskilled labour of
                    man ever made.” “Our laws are written on different methods by different persons.
                    Even those which should be, as the single act of the legislature, corresponding
                    in spirit, structure, and terms, to other acts of the same body, are often
                    antagonist to each other. The statutes of a single session contain every variety
                    of anomaly that can be embraced in that species of composition. This must be the
                    case till the legislature shall appoint persons to draw or revise all laws; to
                    couch them in an uniform expression; or, at least, to take care that there be no
                    difference in form where the substance is the same. If the time should ever
                    arrive when our legislature shall, in its wisdom, determine on the adoption of
                    such an expedient, it would be necessary that it should be preceded by a statute
                    of directions, governing the arrangement, style, and character of our acts of
                    parliament.” Many enactments, which by their subject ought to be, and might be,
                    perfectly accessible to the people at large, are made exclusive matters of
                    professional knowledge, by the want of method, and by the exuberant phraseology
                    in which the sense of almost all enactments is lost at present. Were the
                    substance of parliamentary legislation as good as possible, its value would be
                    infinitely lessened to us by the statd’ in which it is issued to the world. The
                    English statute-book is a vast jungle of technical tautology. The remonstrances
                    of the late Lord Colchester, as far back as 1797, and the improved example of
                    America, have hitherto been made in vain. Notwithstanding the criticism of Mr
                    Miller in his right-minded book on the civil law, upon the precipitancy with
                    which bills are hurried through the House; notwithstanding the suggestions and
                    the specimens towards an amendment in the plan and language of our enactments,
                    published ten years ago by Mr Uniacke and Mr Twiss; the statutory system of 1835
                    is shown to be just as bad as that of 1830. The impolicy and insufficiency of
                    the principal arrangements of our legislation can of course be satisfactorily
                    met only by corresponding changes. The following propositions are made by Mr
                    Symonds, as comprising, in his opinion, the very minimum of what is necessary
                    for any adequate reform. “There shall be some individual or individuals employed
                    in the preparation of the information connected with every proposed new law,
                    before it is formally proposed to the House; that the information so prepared
                    should be submitted to a committee, who should report on the state of the
                    matter, with a view to guide the House as to its further determination; that if
                    the law should be determined upon, it should pass the usual stages of
                    proceeding, being, however, before the second and third readings, reported upon
                    by an officer charged with the verbal revision of its terms; that the law being
                    passed, the heads of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193203615"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-3615-0170"/>the department of the executive to which it
                    relates, and other heads to be appointed specifically for the functions of
                    public instruction, the administration of the law, religion, and justice, should
                    superintend the promulgation and operation of such law; for which purpose, all
                    questions arising upon it should be reported to such chief officer, by a regular
                    body of reporters, attached to the courts of justice, and by the law officers of
                    departments, where the matter should be determined upon by petition or memorial,
                    without appeal to the courts of justice. There being a systematic report of all
                    questions arising in the courts on each branch of the law, and fixed committees
                    of the legislature to report upon such questions, the work of amendment would
                    follow as of course. It would not be safe to omit "any one of these parts of the
                    machinery. They should all exist, acting in connection with each other, not for
                    a season only, but throughout all time. The efficiency of the machine depends on
                    its wholeness and permanence.” From the absence of all counteracting provisions
                    of this description, parliamentary legislation has fallen into such disorder,
                    that the excellence of the regulations long ago adopted by the House of Commons,
                    for securing the freedom and order of its deliberations, yield comparatively
                    imperfect fruits. The wisdom of these regulations has been pointed out by Mr
                    Bentham, with his usual comprehensiveness and minuteness, in his searching
                    notice “upon the tactics of legislative assemblies.” To use a humble
                    illustration, there may be no fault to find either in the market or in the
                    kitchen; the victuals may be good and the cookery excellent; yet the dinner may
                    be spoiled by the dishing up, by the vessels into which it is put, and the
                    manner in which it is served at table.</p>
                <p>A good <hi rend="italic">redaction</hi> of laws is absolutely essential to their
                    working well. Therefore, if the above censure of the English system of
                    parliamentary legislation were only sufficiently near the truth to be even a
                    plausible account of it, it would be pretty clear that there is no necessary
                    connection between a representative government and a judicious method of framing
                    laws. But the objection, as stated, principally applies to the mode in which
                    this description of business is transacted in parliament, and to the form into
                    which the results are thrown. Will the experience of English legislation,
                    however, justify an observer in confining his criticisms within these bounds?
                    Quite the contrary. It is equally clear, from the nature of the case and from
                    experience, that a popular assembly, unless it adopt systematic arrangements for
                    its guidance (somewhat similar to those suggested by Mr Symonds), must fall as
                    far short in its competence∙to undertake the substance of some, at least, of its
                    principal duties; for instance, the greatest of all,—the civil and criminal
                    law,— with a view to their character and . their improvement. With regard to its
                    superintendence of the criminal law, the following was Blackstone’s account of
                    the matter as it stood in his day, and he was a writer not likely to exclaim
                    without provocation. “The enacting of penalties, to which a whole nation should
                    be subject, ouglrt not to be left as a matter of indifference to the passions or
                    interests of a few, who, upon temporary motives, may prefer or support such a
                    bill, but be calmly and maturely considered by persons who know what provisions
                    the laws have already made to remedy the mischief complained of, who can from
                    experience foresee the probable consequences of those which are now proposed,
                    and who will judge without passion or prejudice how adequate they are to the
                    evil. It is never usual in the House of Peers even to read a private bill which
                    may affect the property of an individual, without first referring it to some of
                    the learned judges, and hearing their report thereon. And surely equal
                    precaution is necessary when laws are to be established which may affect the
                    property, the liberty, and perhaps even the lives of thousands. Had such a
                    reference taken place, it is impossible that in the eighteenth century it could
                    ever have been made a capital crime to break down (however maliciously) the
                    mound of a fish-pond, whereby any fish shall escape, or to cut down a
                    cherry-tree in an orchard. Were even a committee appointed but once in a hundred
                    years to revise the criminal law, it could not have continued to this hour a
                    felony, without benefit of clergy, to be seen for one month in the company of
                    persons who call themselves or are called Egyptians.” “It is a melancholy truth,
                    that among the variety of actions which men are liable to commit, no less than
                    an hundred and sixty have been declared by act of parliament to be felonies
                    without benefit of clergy, or, in other words, to be worthy of instant death.”
                    Things have changed a little in this respect since Blackstone wrote. But in the
                    way in which the change has taken place, nothing has transpired to affect the
                    inference which Blackstone’s language more than intimates to his reader. The
                    inference can be nothing short of this: that a popular assembly is qualified
                    neither morally nor intellectually for the responsible office of fixing the
                    criminal law. Supposing it to be incompetent to the comparatively easy task of
                    criminal legislation, the function of settling the principles and the detail of
                    the civil law must, in the nature of things, he still further beyond the sphere
                    of its capacity. The civil laws of all countries have been, up to a certain
                    point, more early established than the criminal; they strike their roots far
                    deeper into the most intimate interests and relations of private life; they are
                    complicated with the authority of precedents and the subtlety of refinements,
                    such as do not enter at all into the plain and palpable objects of criminal
                    provisions. They are accordingly everywhere vastly more voluminous. This is the
                    spirit of the explanation given by the Chancellor d’Aguesseau, in his Mistakes
                    on Law, on the disproportion which exists both in the digest and the code,
                    between the space appropriated to private and to public law. Out of fifty books
                    of the Digest, more than forty are given up to the former. If a popular assembly
                    cannot move the lesser weight, it is not likely to intermeddle satisfactorily
                    with the greater. The consequence is, that whatever reforms of any importance
                    have taken or are taking place in England in either of these the principal
                    departments of the law, they are altogether owing to the labours either of
                    individuals or of commissions. A survey of the legal history of other countries
                    corroborates the results of our experience at home. On comparing the state of
                    the civil or criminal laws of two countries, the merit of their systems will not
                    be found to vary directly as their freedom. On many occasions the interposition
                    of a numerous assembly only retards and spoils. The operation is too scientific
                    and delicate a one for popular hands. Bentham says expressly, that he undertook
                    what is generally considered as the greatest of all his writings, that he might
                    show that the tissue of laws, easy to be torn and difficult to be repaired,
                    should not be delivered over to rash and ignorant workmen. In this point of
                    view, arbitrary rulers have considerable facilities for prompt and extensive
                    legislation; and, within the limits to which the above comparison is restricted,
                    they have no temptation to abuse their advantages. Hardly any government can be
                    conceived, in which the interest of the governors and of the governed does not
                    for the most part coincide. When the most absolute governments go wrong
                    concerning them, it is not for want of will to go right, but from the want of
                    knowing better. If this be the case, and nevertheless a far greater amount of
                    happiness be found, upon the whole, amongst free communities, of what vast
                    importance to mankind are the inspiriting questions of constitutional law, and
                    how inestimable are the health and animation breathed into a society by the very
                    air of freedom. The public have to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193203628"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-3628-0171"/>pay dearly for the pleasure which’ servile
                    politicians may derive from the foolish couplet of the poet:</p>
                <p>For forms of government let fools contest: Whate’er is best administered is
                    best.</p>
                <p>The cause of truth, however, has much to lose and nothing to gain by any
                    exaggeration. The zeal, therefore, of writers who attribute too much to the
                    influence of government, is to be not less deprecated than the sophisms of
                    others who attribute to it too little. Thus far is certain, that allowing the
                    principal sources of human happiness to be naturally independent of all
                    legislatures, and that, therefore, but little happiness can be directly
                    originated by a government, its means for doing evil are immense. A good
                    government, then, has this incalculable advantage; it protects the natural
                    sources of human happiness from the invasion of others, and abstains from
                    invading themitself. Half-truths are made whole falsehoods by precipitate
                    generalizations. A comprehensive consideration of the proper objects, and of the
                    effective capabilities of legislation, would have prevented the opposite errors;
                    that of a depreciating despondency, as well as that of extravagant expectations.
                    Living in England, Dr Johnson underrated the importance of the difference
                    between institutions and laws of one kind or another. He saw that, compared with
                    other sources of enjoyment, they were productive of but little immediate good;
                    and he appears to have consequently inferred that they could also be productive
                    but of little evil. On the other hand, Filangieri, living at Naples, was a daily
                    witness of the infinite misery arising out of mis-government. He seems to have
                    consequently supposed that legislatures had the power of creating prosperity and
                    happiness in the same proportion. This account of the matter, although probably
                    the true solution of the particular contradiction which we are noticing, stops
                    short of the point at which the principal difference between the two classes of
                    government will be most marked; their good faith in the execution of their laws.
                    Laws cannot execute themselves. Therefore, whatever may be the comparative merit
                    of two systems upon paper, it may be taken for granted that, if the one contains
                    constitutional guarantees which are wanting in the other, there will be all the
                    difference in the world in their practical results. It is certain that no
                    government can long continue to be well administered, the good administration of
                    which is not protected by guarantees. As far, therefore, as the very substance
                    of the law is concerned, political arrangements for this purpose are
                    indispensable conditions to the truth of Dr Paley’s conclusion, “that <hi
                    rend="italic">that</hi> people, government, and constitution is the <hi
                    rend="italic">freest</hi> which makes the best provision for the enacting of
                    expedient and salutary laws.”</p>
                <p>But the substance of the laws is not the only object of national legislation. A
                    thing of still greater consequence is the spirit and character of the people.
                    Civil liberty, however explained, is not sufficient of itself. There is great
                    difference amongst jurists as to the proper meaning of the expression, <hi
                    rend="italic">civil liberty.</hi> If Mackintosh (on the correction of the phrase
                    7«« <hi rend="italic">gentium</hi> for that of <hi rend="italic">jus
                    inter</hi><hi rend="italic">gentes)</hi> could reasonably doubt whether that
                    particular innovation in a scientific term was one of those which repaid us, by
                    its superior precision, for the uncertainty and confusion which the change
                    occasioned, the same doubt must apply much more strongly in the present
                    instance. It is not only important for the science of legislation, that a term
                    supposed by many to imply its principal object,—but it is important, with a view
                    to our vulgar and daily practice, that a term which is popularly used as the
                    test of good government,—should be uniformly understood. Mr Austin has latterly
                    defined civil liberty (and the language of Destutt de Tracy comes to the same
                    thing) to be, “the liberty from legal obligation which is left or granted by a
                    sovereign government to its own subjects.” <hi rend="italic">(Province
                    of</hi><hi rend="italic">Jurisprudence,</hi> p. 279.) Thus, comparing two
                    communities with each other, he would say that the degree in which they
                    respectively enjoyed civil liberty depended upon their comparative freedom from
                    legal restraint. According to this definition, it might happen that, in
                    consequence of the absence of prudent restraints, the community which enjoyed
                    the highest degree of civil liberty would on that very account be in possession
                    of the worst government. On the other hand, the definition given by Paley (which
                    agrees with that of Blackstone, and with the common understanding of the word),
                    declares civil liberty to be “the not being restrained by any law but what
                    conduces in a greater degree to the public welfare.” Here civil liberty is
                    distinguished from natural liberty, that is, from the mere absence of restraint,
                    by being considered as that portion of natural liberty which, under the supposed
                    circumstances, ought to be sanctioned by the law, and recognised by a just
                    society, as constituting the social rights of all its members. Civil liberty is
                    thus made synonymous with good government. On comparing two communities
                    together, they may be subjected to very different degrees of restraint, and
                    nevertheless may be in the equal enjoyment of civil liberty. All that, for this
                    purpose, is required, is that, in the two cases, the different degrees of
                    restraint which are respectively imposed shall conduce in the same proportion to
                    the public welfare. It is very difficult (notwithstanding the explanation by Sir
                    David Evans in his preface to the collection of the statutes) to extract a
                    consistent sense out of Justinian’s well-known definition. Blackstone, by
                    mistranslatingywí into <hi rend="italic">justice,</hi> instead of <hi
                    rend="italic">law,</hi> and by leaving out the word <hi rend="italic">vi,</hi>
                    made it the authority for the definition, which he himself gave, and of which we
                    have just been speaking. The words are, <hi rend="italic">naturalis facultas
                    ejus</hi><hi rend="italic">quod</hi><hi rend="italic">cuique facere libet, nisi
                    quid vi aut jure prohibetur.</hi> That is, according to the translation of
                    Blackstone, civil liberty consists in doing what you like, unless you are
                    hindered justly or unjustly. So far all is certain. The paragraph in the
                    Institute cannot .have been meant to coincide with that into which Blackstone
                    has tortured it. Were it not for the word <hi rend="italic">νi,</hi> it might be
                    supposed to mean the same with Mr Austin. But it appears to us, that its authors
                    have attempted to compress more into this celebrated definition than it could
                    possibly hold. Hence the dilemma. One of the conflicting words must be given up;
                    and then the species of liberty which is defined will depend upon the word which
                    is retained. If <hi rend="italic">vis</hi> is retained, it will be a definition
                    of natural liberty; <hi rend="italic">if jus, of</hi> civil. Whatever
                    construction is given to <hi rend="italic">naturalis</hi> (and the whole
                    definition is put in opposition to that of slavery imposedywre <hi rend="italic"
                    >gentium),</hi><hi rend="italic">naturalis facultas</hi> must be used in two
                    senses, and not in one, before <hi rend="italic">vis</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >jus</hi> can be equally exceptions to it. Civil liberty, in all senses in which
                    the term has ever been mentioned, is compatible with acts of <hi rend="italic"
                    >vis,</hi> or illegal violence. Accordingly, Montesquieu’s interpretation (for
                    it is apparently intended as such) of Justinian discards this alternative, and
                    admits only of the exception made by the law. “La liberté est le <hi
                    rend="italic">droit</hi> de faire tout ce que les ioix permettent” <hi
                    rend="italic">(droit</hi> ought to be <hi rend="italic">pouvoir</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">moyens,</hi> sc. <hi rend="italic">facultas).</hi> Again, “La
                    liberté est le gouvernement dont on jouit.” In the Manchester debate, Lord
                    Plunkett defended what had taken place, on the authority of a similar
                    construction of the passage in Justinian. According to this notion of civil
                    liberty, on comparing two communities together, the degree of it which they
                    respectively enjoy will not depend upon the degree in which their respective
                    freedom of action is left absolutely unrestrained, nor upon the proportion which
                    may be observed between private restraint and public advantage, but will turn On
                    the single question, which of the two governments is succeeding best in the
                    complete and faithful administration of its actual laws. Thus liberty and law
                    become the same thing, and this without any reference to the quality of the
                    laws.</p>

                <p>Of these conflicting definitions, it will be readily acknowledged that the
                    intermediate one,—that by which civil liberty and good government are
                    synonymous,—is the only one which can be properly considered as the principal
                    end of legislation. Sir James Mackintosh, in his <hi rend="italic">Discourse on
                    the Law of Nature and Nations,</hi> expresses and justifies it with his usual
                    truth of principle, and with more than his usual precision of language. The
                    security of which man in society has need, is, it must be remembered, twofold;
                    security against wrong from individuals, as well as from the government itself.
                    “The description of liberty which seems most comprehensive, is that of <hi
                    rend="italic">security against wrong.</hi> Liberty is, therefore, the object of
                    all government. Men are more free under every government, even the most
                    imperfect, than they would be if it were possible for them to exist without any
                    government at all: they are more secure from wrong, <hi rend="italic">more
                    undisturbed in the exercise of their natural powers, and therefore more free,
                    even in the most obvious and grossest sense of the word,</hi> than if they were
                    altogether unprotected against injury from one another.” Now, as all unnecessary
                    restraint imposed by government is a wrong, and as all individual restraint is
                    unnecessary, unless an equivalent is obtained by it for the general advantage of
                    society, all restraints which are unaccompanied by this advantage, are so many
                    deductions from civil liberty. But, on the other hand, a restraint, by means of
                    which we gain more in our personal freedom from the check put upon others (not
                    to say sometimes upon ourselves), than we lose from being ourselves restrained
                    to the same extent, leaves a balance of free agency in our favour, and becomes a
                    part of civil liberty properly understood.</p>
                <p>As long as political liberty is wanting, the written letter of civil liberty may
                    indeed exist, but it will exist comparatively spiritless and fruitless.
                    Experience has shown that the sense of security and of independence is no less
                    essential to the advancement of society than to the comfort of individuals.
                    Filangieri, having treated, in his Science of Legislation, of the causes of the
                    decay of Spanish greatness, anticipates a similar declension of the power of
                    England. B. Constant, commenting upon the passage in question, is far from
                    professing any very decided opinion in favour of the general superiority of
                    English legislation, But he attributes the decay of Spain to the truer reason;
                    to the perpetual pressure of a government, which ground down the national
                    intelligence, and which, in order to have nothing to fear from its subjects,
                    kept them in apathy, and paralysed their powers. B. Constant proceeds with the
                    other side of the picture. He was writing in 1822. “For the proof of this, we
                    have only to look at England. We shall find there commercial laws not less
                    absurd, not less vexatious, not less unjust. We shall see in the massacres of
                    the Catholics, especially in Ireland, and in the execrable regulations which
                    reduce all that portion of the Irish people to the condition of Helots, a
                    pendant to the persecution and almost to the banishment of the Moors; and yet
                    England has remained in the first rank among the nations. The reason is, that
                    the political institutions, the parliamentary discussions, the liberty of the
                    press, which England has uninterruptedly enjoyed for more than a hundred years,
                    have counterbalanced the vices of her laws and of her government. Her
                    inhabitants have maintained their energy of character, because they have not
                    been disinherited of their participation in the administration of public
                    affairs. This participation, although almost imaginary, gives her citizens a
                    feeling of importance, which keeps their moral life in action ,∙ and England,
                    governed, with few exceptions, since the time of Sir Robert Walpole, by
                    Machiavellian ministers, and represented by a corrupt parliament, has
                    nevertheless retained the language, the habits, and many of the advantages of
                    freedom.”</p>
                <p>It is an important object in the organic structure of the legislative authority,
                    that it should be compelled as much as possible to keep in the position, and be
                    conversant with the views of legislation only; that, having legislated, it
                    should be, as it <hi rend="italic">were, functus officio,</hi> and that the
                    interpretation and execution of its laws should thenceforth be transferred to
                    other departments of the state. In this consists one of the main advantages of a
                    mixed or constitutional government. It not only affords the opportunity,—it
                    almost creates a necessity,—for separating the exercise of the legislative,
                    judicial, and executive authorities from one another. Notwithstanding the
                    classical immortality conceded to Minos, Lycurgus, and Solon,—Mr Bentham, who
                    could have no prejudice in favour of chambers over individuals as legislators,
                    says, that he cannot discover in antiquity the traces of any true knowledge
                    concerning legislation. It seems impossible that the Greeks should have had any
                    knowledge on the subject, whether as to the organization of a legislature, or
                    the principles of law, which should not have been communicated to the Romans.
                    But what in this respect was the history of Rome throughout all the period
                    concerning which the history of Rome is usually thought to be worth reading?
                    With the genius, which the military and administrative masters of the world
                    ultimately exhibited as its law-makers, it seems quite extraordinary that the
                    personal application of their legislative intelligence to their own affairs
                    should have been so long in growing. Cicero, boasting of the perfection of the
                    Twelve Tables, and of the short time which it took to learn the Roman law, never
                    seems to have been aware that this account of it was a symptom of its
                    deficiencies, just as would be the case with a boasting Turkish cadi at the
                    present day. The few lines in which the philosophical Tacitus dismisses the mass
                    of laws which by his time had accumulated upon the practitioner and the public
                    to an unmanageable bulk, are as severe a satire as a more laboured commentary.
                    Professing to turn aside to the principles of Roman jurisprudence, and to the
                    methods by which Rome had reached its infinite multitude and variety of laws, he
                    conveys to the reader his deliberate opinion, that the Twelve Tables were the
                    <hi rend="italic">finis aequi juris,</hi> and that they comprehended whatever
                    was really just and valuable in Roman law. “The laws which followed, although
                    sometimes directed against wrong-doers, were generally passed by violence,
                    either through the dissension of the orders, or for the sake of gaining unlawful
                    honours, or in order to expel distinguished men, or for some other disgraceful
                    object.” This was no peculiar fancy taken up by Tacitus for the sake of throwing
                    one of his Caravaggio-shadows over the picture. The popular Livy, too, who loved
                    to see and to paint every thing brightly, finds equally in these ancient records
                    the fountain of public and private law. Up to the time of Cicero, what could be
                    the actual laws of Rome or the Roman world, when he appealed <hi rend="italic"
                    >(fremant</hi><hi rend="italic">licet)</hi> to these Twelve Tables as the
                    pillars of Hercules, which civil philosophy could never hope to pass? So much
                    for the legislation of the Roman Republic, and for lamentations over what the
                    world has lost in lessons of legal wisdom (at least up to the age of Tacitus) by
                    the negligence or the treachery of Tribonian. What is called the age of its
                    classical jurisprudence visited the Roman law at last. By the time of Papinian
                    and Ulpian, the various other sources from which the laws of every country must
                    always be more or less derived, had sent forth such abundant streams, that
                    Tribonian and his colleagues had nothing to do but choose amongst them from what
                    waters they should fill that imperishable reservoir at which all future
                    generations were to come and drink. Had the Roman constitution made a juster
                    arrangement of the three great political powers, it is improbable that so much
                    of its laws should have had to be sought for in these in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193203654" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3654-0173"/>direct channels. And, in that
                    case, it would have been impossible that the period of their being brought
                    together and united in one majestic body should have been deferred so long. But
                    there is another consideration, of still greater consequence to contemporary
                    generations than even the formation of a system of jurisprudence. In that case,
                    it would have been equally impossible, that a hundredth part of the injustice,
                    whether legislative, judicial, or executive, with which Roman history swarms,
                    should ever have been committed. The Romans as a nation seem to have remained
                    for ages incapable of discerning the fundamental difference between a
                    legislative and a judicial act. It is a distinction upon which the English
                    constitution is founded, and is carefully described by a great master in
                    politics. “A legislative act has no reference to any rule but these two,
                    original justice, and discretionary application. Therefore it can give rights—
                    rights where no rights existed before; and it can take away rights where they
                    were before established. For the law, which binds all others, does not, and
                    cannot, bind the law-maker; he, and he alone, is above the law. But a judge, a
                    person exercising a judicial capacity, is neither to apply to original justice,
                    nor to a discretionary application of it. He goes to justice and discretion only
                    at second hand, and through the medium of some superiors. He is to work neither
                    upon his opinion of the one nor of the other; but upon a fixed rule, of which he
                    has not the making, but singly and solely the <hi rend="italic">application</hi>
                    to the case.” (Burke, vol. X. p. 66.) He adds, addressing the House of Commons
                    on the case of Mr Wilkes, in the Middlesex election: “In our legislative
                    capacity we are in most instances esteemed a very wise body. In our judicial we
                    have no credit, no character, at all.” Μ. Comte, we perceive, admits the
                    pre-eminence of England upon questions of legislation. The authority, it is
                    true, of the English parliament as representing the public weal, has acted
                    throughout all English history like a charm. Should it be doubted whether the
                    legislative reputation of parliament stands at present quite so high with the
                    English public as Burke imagines it to have stood in 1771, there can be no doubt
                    but that its judicial reputation continues quite as low. But in this, as in
                    other cases, a disorder is half cured when its cause is known. It was the
                    misfortune of the Roman government, owing to the confusion in which the exercise
                    of all authorities was mixed up together under it, that there were not always
                    the means, in point of fact, and there was never any sound and recognised
                    principle of law to appeal to, as a test distinguishing between them.</p>
                <p>The study of the science otlegislation is the noblest of all studies. The art of
                    applying this science to the practical necessities of mankind is the noblest of
                    all professions. Nothing can more tend to fill the understanding and elevate the
                    spirit of a human being. Every legislator, to be worthy of his office, ought to
                    have a high idea of its dignity. He should think it is his duty to learn the
                    boundaries of the science, and to master the criteria which determine what is
                    contained in and what excluded from it. Its legitimate province is so immense
                    that no single intelligence can be capable of cultivating and commanding the
                    whole of it. Different individuals will be guided by appropriate considerations,
                    private and public, respecting the special departments they particularly select.
                    But whether the department be easy or laborious, one or many, the spirit and the
                    principles by which its legislation ought to be conducted will be the same. The
                    previous know-edge of the general nature of his subject, which is for this
                    purpose required of a statesman, is not to be picked up in a day. Members of
                    society, one and all, stand, with regard to the body of which they are parts, in
                    two opposite relations; and they are entitled to demand that their joint and
                    several interests in both relations should be measured and respected. It is
                    their right, on the one hand, that no restraint shall be imposed upon any
                    individual, but what will contribute in a greater degree to the public welfare.
                    It is not less their undoubted right, on the other hand, that whenever a
                    restraint will so contribute, it shall be forthwith imposed upon all. If
                    unnecessary restraints are so much wanton destruction of human happiness, the
                    omission or relaxation of necessary restraints may be no less fatal. They expose
                    to wanton injury the means of happiness, which the law ought to protect, and
                    they’compel the party injured to seek out the imperfect remedies of irregular
                    and barbarous times, and to carve out for himself the reparation which the law
                    refuses. To draw lines of this description justly, is the work of great
                    observation and profound philosophy combined. What investigations does it not
                    require on the nature of property. We need only allude to the controversy
                    between Grotius and Selden, on the famous question of the freedom of the seas;
                    and to the absence of all principle in the unsatisfactory regulations respecting
                    animals, called <hi rend="italic">ferae naturae,</hi> in the laws as well of
                    France as of England and America. What discrimination does it not require in
                    marking the subtile limits by which, in the case of a hundred rights and duties,
                    morals are separated from law. Principles and examples of this, kind are to be
                    found in abundance in the great writers upon duty and natural
                    jurisprudence.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bishop

                    England—there are many instances of some actions being made cognizable by law
                    which more properly belong to morals; and of others being left to morals, which
                    ought to be brought under the penalty of the law. A due examination into the
                    boundaries of morals and law can scarcely fail to inspire becoming caution
                    wherever there is a chance of opposite laws being brought into collision with
                    each other. Occasions may easily be conceived when a man will be called upon to
                    perform an action which shall place him within the concentric circles of the
                    several jurisdictions of the divine law, the law of morals, the law of honour,
                    the law of nations, and the law of the land. If these several laws, acting with
                    their respective sanctions, concur in the line of duty which they require of
                    him, all is well. Wo to him if they should pull in opposite directions. A
                    government is answerable for the lives and consciences of men, whenever, without
                    an absolute necessity, it drives its subjects to this terrible alternative.</p>
                <p>The following passage is taken from Burke’s tract on the Irish popery laws. No
                    argument that human wisdom can devise would prove more forcibly the wickedness
                    of legislating against the law of morals,—that is, against the paramount
                    principles of human nature,—than that a political reasoner like Burke should
                    have been so maddened by the contradiction, as to find there the legal evidence
                    by which municipal laws are annulled, instead of the moral authority by which
                    they are resisted, “The true weakness and opprobrium of our best general
                    constitutions is, that they cannot provide beneficially for every particular
                    case, and thus fill, adequately to their intentions, the circle of universal
                    justice. But where the principle is faulty, the erroneous part of the law is the
                    beneficial, and justice only finds refuge in those holes and corners which had
                    escaped the sagacity and inquisition of the legislator. The happiness or misery
                    of multitudes can never be a thing indifferent. A law against the ma-jórity<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193203667" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3667-0174"/> of the people is
                    in substance a law against the people itself: its extent determines its
                    invalidity; it even changes its character as it enlarges its operation; it is
                    not particular injustice, but general oppression; and can no longer be
                    considered as a private hardship, which might be borne, but spreads and grows up
                    into the unfortunate importance of a national calamity. Now, as a law directed
                    against the mass of the nation has not the nature of a reasonable institution,
                    so neither has it the authority; for in all forms of government the people is
                    the true legislator; and whether the immediate and instrumental cause of the law
                    be a single person or many, the remote and efficient cause is the consent of the
                    people, either actual or implied; and such consent is absolutely necessary to
                    its validity. To the solid establishment of every law two things are essentially
                    requisite; first, a proper and sufficient human power to declare and modify the
                    matter of the law; and, next, such a fit and equitable constitution as they have
                    a right to declare and render binding. With regard to the first requisite, the
                    human authority, it is their judgment they give up, not their right. The people,
                    indeed, are presumed to consent to whatever the legislature ordains for their
                    benefit; and they are to acquiesce in it, though they do not clearly see into
                    the propriety of the means by which they are conducted to that desirable end.
                    This they owe as an act of homage and just deference to a reason which the
                    necessity of government has made superior to their own. But though the means,
                    and indeed the nature, of a public advantage, may not always be evident to the
                    understanding of the subject, no one is so gross and stupid as not to
                    distinguish between a benefit and an injury. No one can imagine, then, that an
                    exclusion of a great body of men, not from favours, privileges, and trusts, but
                    from the common advantages of society, can ever be a thing intended for their
                    good, or can ever be ratified by any implied consent of theirs. If, therefore,
                    at least an implied human consent is necessary to the existence of a law, such a
                    constitution cannot in propriety be a law at all. But if we could suppose that
                    such a ratification was made, not virtually, but actually, by the people, not
                    representatively, but even collectively, <hi rend="italic">still it would be
                    null and void.</hi> They have no right to make a law prejudicial to the whole
                    community, even though the delinquents, in making such an act, should be
                    themselves the chief sufferers by it; because it <hi rend="italic">would bemade
                    against the principle of a superior law,</hi> which it is not in the power of

                    would be hard to point out any error more truly Subversive of all the order and
                    beauty, of all the peace and happiness, of human society, than the position that
                    any body of men have a right to make what laws they please; or that <hi

                    reason of state, or preservation of the constitution, can be pleaded in favour
                    of such a practice. They may indeed impeach the frame of that constitution, but
                    can never touch this immoveable principle. This seems to be indeed the doctrine
                    which Hobbes broached in the last century, and which was then so frequently and
                    so ably refuted. Cicero exclaims with the utmost indignation and contempt
                    against such a notion <hi rend="italic">(de</hi><hi rend="italic">Legibus,</hi>
                    lib. i. 15, 16); he considers it not only as unworthy of a philosopher, but of
                    an illiterate peasant; that of all things this was the most truly absurd to
                    fancy, that the rule of justice was to be taken from the constitutions of
                    commonwealths, or that laws derived their authority from the statutes of the
                    people, the edicts of princes, or the decrees of judges. If it be admitted that
                    it is not the black letter and the king’s arms that make the law, we are to look
                    for it elsewhere. In reality, there are two, and only two, foundations of law;
                    and they are <hi rend="italic">both of them conditions, without which nothing
                    can give it any force</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> I mean <hi rend="italic"
                    >equity</hi> and <hi rend="italic">utility.</hi> With respect to the former, it
                    grows out of the great rule of equality, which is grounded upon our common
                    nature, and which Philo, with equal propriety and beauty, calls the mother of
                    justice. All human laws are, properly speaking, only declaratory; they may alter
                    the mode and application, but have no power whatever over the substance, of
                    original justice. The other foundation of law, which is utility, must be
                    understood, not of partial or limited, but of general and public utility,
                    connected in the same matter with, and derived directly from, our rational
                    nature; for any other utility may be the utility of a robber, but cannot be that
                    of a citizen; the interest of the domestic enemy, and not that of a member of
                    the commonwealth. This present equality can never be the foundation of statutes,
                    which create an artificial difference between men, as the laws before us do, in
                    order to induce a consequential inequality in the distribution of justice. Law
                    is a mode of human action respecting society, and must be governed by the same
                    rules of equity which govern every private action; and so Tully considers it, in
                    his Offices, as the only utility agreeable to that nature. <hi rend="italic"

                    wonder that this kind of conflict between opposite laws of distinct authority
                    which outraged Burke, should have also misled Blackstone. Locke, <hi
                    rend="italic">On the Extent of the Legislative Power,</hi> equally denies the
                    moral right to legalize injustice; and Hooker the same; but Locke afterwards
                    (vol. ii. p. 250), in his letter on toleration, shows that he is aware that the
                    rectification of a similar abuse of power is to be sought for in the field of
                    battle, not in a court of justice. “What if the magistrate believe that he has ä
                    right to make such laws, and that they are for the public good, and his subjects
                    believe the contrary? Who shall be judge between them? 1 answer, God alone.
                    There are two sorts of contests among men, the one managed by law, the other by
                    force; and these are of that nature, that, where the one ends, the other always
                    begins.”</p>
                <p>But there is as little excuse for some of the contradictions which subsist
                    between the positive laws of different nations. Most of them might be removed by
                    a judicious comparative legislation. In this point of view, it is highly
                    desirable that the independent states, which constitute the great commonwealth
                    of the civilized world, should make a rational <hi rend="italic"
                    >concordance</hi> of those chapters of their municipal laws, in which the
                    subjects of all must, from their intercourse with each other, have a common
                    interest. Mr Justice Story has done much towards opening the way both to the end
                    and to the means, in his <hi rend="italic">Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws
                    in regard to Contracts, Hights, and Remedies, and especially in regard to
                    Marriages, Divorces, Wills, Successions, and Judgments.</hi> The state of things
                    by which a couple are married or unmarried, according as they may happen to be
                    in France, Scotland, or England, is hardly less monstrous than the contradictory
                    title which, on the doctrine of a double allegiance, England and America, for
                    instance, may set up to the obedience of the very same individual,—each being
                    ready to enforce its legal title by the extreme sanction of the law. England is
                    likely to have the honour of leading the way on one subject. Mr Justice Story
                    elsewhere observes on the predominance which the system of commercial law, as
                    established in England, is obtaining over the world; and anticipates that Europe
                    has nearly arrived at the point when the same commercial principles will form
                    part of the public law of all its sovereignties. If, in the last generation,
                    Lord Mansfield acquired this honour for <pb break="no" facs="nls:193203680"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-3680-0175"/>his country and for himself, whilst dealing with
                    and conciliating the gracious interests growing up from out of the civilizing
                    intercourse of peace, Lord Stowell has in our own time derived an equal glory
                    from out of the calamities and injuries of war. Foreigners, looking on upon the
                    just and liberal jurisprudence administered in his prize-courts, have thought it
                    not too much to call him the ornament, not of his “own age or country only, but
                    of all ages and all countries; the intrepid supporter equally of neutral and
                    belligerent rights; the pure and spotless magistrate of nations.”</p>
                <p>The mischief arising from intemperate and ignorant enactments makes it of great
                    importance to fix accurately, in every case, the true limits of prudent
                    legislation. Thus, the sphere of mischief is railed in; and thus also a
                    legislator may more easily learn the extent of the knowledge which he has to
                    acquire, and of the responsibility which he incurs. From the mode in which
                    Burke’s political maxims are scattered about in the different parts of his
                    voluminous writings, as the occasion happened to call them forth, the greater
                    and more philosophical portion of them are not so stedfastly recollected by the
                    public as must have been the case if they had been incorporated and presented in
                    a more systematic form. Having occasion to restate the principles expressed by
                    Burke, it would, however, be great injustice to the reader to express them in
                    other words. “It is,” says he, “one of the finest problems in legislation, and
                    what has often engaged my thoughts whilst I followed that profession, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> what the state ought to take upon itself to direct by
                    the public wisdom, and what it ought to leave, with as little interference as
                    possible, to individual discretion.’ Nothing, certainly, can be laid down on the
                    subject that will not admit of exceptions, many permanent, some occasional. But
                    the clearest line of distinction which I could draw, whilst I had my chalk to
                    draw any line, was this,—that the state ought to confine itself to what regards
                    the state, or the creatures of the state, namely, the exterior establishment of
                    its religion; its magistracy; its revenue; its military force by sea and land;
                    the corporations that owe their existence to its fiat; in a word, to every thing
                    that is <hi rend="italic">truly and properly</hi> public; to the public peace,
                    to the public safety, to the public order, to the public prosperity. In its
                    preventive police it ought to be sparing of its effects, and to employ means,
                    rather few, unfrequent, and strong, than many and frequent, and of course (as
                    they multiply their puny politic race, and dwindle) small and feeble. Statesmen
                    who know themselves will, with the dignity which belongs to wisdom, proceed only
                    in this, the superior orb and first mover of their duty, steadily, vigilantly,
                    severely, courageously; whatever remains will, in a manner, provide for itself.
                    But as they descend from a state to a province, from a province to a parish, and
                    from a parish to a private house, they go on, accelerated in their fall. <hi
                    rend="italic">They cannot do the lower duty</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">and in proportion as they try it, they will certainly fail in the
                    higher.</hi> They ought to know the different departments of things; what
                    belongs to laws, and what manners alone can regulate. To these, great
                    politicians may give a leaning, but they cannot give a law. Our legislature has
                    fallen into this fault, as well as other governments; all have fallen into it
                    more or less.” ’</p>
                <p>A great deal is here excluded. Much of what the Puritans legislated for instantly
                    on their arrival in New England; much of that on which the imperial parliament
                    of Great Britain is often unwisely called upon to legislate at present; for
                    example, amongst other things, for the better observation of the Sabbath. Quite
                    enough, however, is left for the most industrious and intrepid statesman. The
                    discussion of the questions which Burke reckons truly legislative, instead of
                    being disposed of in the few paragraphs of a summary, would occupy each a volume
                    by itself. Besides, whatever may be the precise subject on which a legislator
                    may be engaged, he should always remember that there is that sympathy and
                    connection between the several parts, even of the most irregular system, that he
                    can never be safe in dealing with any specialty or fragment of it unless he
                    knows something also of the rest, or knows at least the general bearings of the
                    divisions which adjoin.</p>
                <p>In a view of legislation, however cursory, it would be unpardonable to omit the
                    outline sketched by the masterly hand of one who was certainly the greatest and
                    the wisest (and we believe very far from the meanest) of mankind. What a
                    treasure for all ages, had but the outline been filled up by his weighty
                    sentences, and with his capacious views. “For the more public part of
                    government, which is laws, I think good to note only one déficience: which is,
                    that all those which have written of laws, have written either as philosophers
                    or as lawyers, and none as statesmen. As for the philosophers, they make
                    imaginary laws for imaginary commonwealths, and their discourses are as the
                    stars which give little light, because they are so high. For the lawyers, they
                    write according to the states where they live, what is received law, and not
                    what ought to be law; for the wisdom of a law-maker is one, and of a lawyer is
                    another. For there are in nature certain fountains of justice, whence all civil
                    laws are derived but as streams; and like as waters do take tinctures and tastes
                    from the soils through which they run, so do civil laws vary according to the
                    regions and governments where they are planted, though they proceed from the
                    same fountains. Again, the wisdom of a law-maker consisteth not only in a
                    platform of justice, but in the application thereof, taking into consideration
                    by what means laws may be made certain, and what are the causes and remedies of
                    the doubtfulness and uncertainty of law; by what means laws may be made apt and
                    easy to be executed, and what are the impediments and remedies in the execution
                    of laws; what influence laws touching private right of <hi rend="italic"
                    >meum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tuurn</hi> have into the public state, and how
                    they are to be made apt and agreeable; how laws are to be penned and delivered,
                    whether in texts or in acts, brief or large, with preambles or without; how they
                    are to be pruned and reformed from time to time, and what is the best means to
                    keep them from being too vast in volumes, or too full of multiplicity and
                    crossness; how they are to be expounded, when upon causes emergent, and
                    judicially discussed; and when upon responses and conferences touching general
                    points or questions, how they are to be pressed, rigorously or tenderly; how
                    they are to be mitigated by equity and good conscience; and whether discretion
                    and strict law is to be mingled in the same courts, or kept apart in several
                    courts. Again, how the practice, profession, and erudition of law is to be
                    censured and governed, and many other points touching the administration and (as
                    I may term it) animation of laws.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>We have no very great respect for what are called fundamental laws. We do not
                    share in the want of confidence which they imply in the wisdom and virtue of
                    posterity; which wisdom and virtue, when once wanting, a mere paper constitution
                    can do nothing to supply. They are, we are convinced, far more likely in most
                    cases to retard the progress of a country for the future, than to secure in
                    perpetuity, or for a day, the possession of those advantages which have already
                    been obtained. At the same time there are a few leading principles in politics
                    pretty well settled. And if bills of rights, charters, and constitutions, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193203693" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3693-0176"/> confined
                    themselves to these, as much good perhaps as harm might accompany the
                    declaration of them. But the particularity to which the constitutions of some of
                    the American states have descended is ridiculous now, and may be mischievous
                    hereafter. For this it is sufficient to refer to the commentaries of Chancellor
                    Kent. Few countries have sought to tie up the body of their civil and criminal
                    laws in leading-strings of this description. Laws of this class (except in rare
                    instances of occasional presumption) are respected as great problems, on which
                    mankind may as yet have much to learn, and which therefore had best be left open
                    for whatever improvements time and discussion may suggest. With regard to them,
                    therefore, we will premise a few very general directions. They may well claim to
                    be approached in the spirit both of a philosopher and an historian.</p>
                <p>1. On approaching the subject, a reflecting person must perceive the necessity of
                    laying out before him, in the first instance, as it were upon a map, the leading
                    principles of general jurisprudence. What these are can only be learned from a
                    patient analysis of human nature. Here Romagnosi and Comte call on him to
                    observe the powerful tendencies of mankind, of which the law ought to be the
                    express image. Here Bentham points out the anti-social passions which it is one
                    of the first offices of the law to thwart and to subdue. Here come in Destutt de
                    Tracy’s admissions, the more important in proportion as they appear reluctant
                    and extorted, on the necessity of watching and picking out our way amongst the
                    contradictions and infirmities of our imperfect nature. If it be true that the
                    laws of nature exist anterior and superior to ours, —that what is fundamentally
                    just is that which is in conformity with them, what is radically unjust is that
                    which is opposed to them; and therefore that our laws, inasmuch as they are
                    weaker and subsequent, should, in order to be good, be in harmony with these
                    natural laws of greater antiquity and strength,—it is no less true, that the
                    immediate feelings and opinions of considerable bodies of men often represent so
                    ill the interests of the actual generation (those of the next often not at alD,
                    that the real interests, even of the parties themselves, much more those of
                    mankind, including the generations that come after, will be best promoted by
                    their immediate feelings and opinions receiving a peremptory contradiction from
                    the law. All that is wanted in any case, in justification of thus much of
                    contradiction, is to suppose that the restraints are wisely placed, and that the
                    members of the community in question, at least that part of them which is not
                    incorrigible, are capable, like those of a well-regulated family, of
                    accommodating their wills to the restraints. Destutt de Tracy agrees with
                    Montesquieu, when Montesquieu is treating of the disadvantages of certain
                    climates, in considering “that bad legislators are those who favour the vices of
                    the climate; good, those who are opposed to them.” The maxim is equally true of
                    all evil tendencies, however generated. And the problem to be solved is in every
                    case the same; the cost of the opposition, and the probability of success. On
                    the one hand, you must not expect too much, and enter upon a vain contest. On
                    the other, you must not put up with miseries and scandals that a little vigour
                    would remove. Connected with this part of the subject, or rather practical parts
                    of it of the greatest nicety, are the two important questions; first, at what
                    point in any given instance the predominance of personal or local peculiarities
                    is so great as to overbalance the considerations upon which the general
                    principle had been constructed; and, next, what are the cases where observation
                    and reason can only show that it is necessary there should be <hi rend="italic"
                    >some</hi> rule, but are not able clearly to discover <hi rend="italic"
                    >what</hi> the rule should be. If man could be kept right in his body natural or
                    politic by a few universal principles, the sciences of medicine and of
                    legislation would be comparatively easy. But there is no limit to the
                    modifications which the use of the most approved specifics may require; and the
                    best statesmen are quite as well aware as the best physicians, that a knowledge
                    of the constitutions of their patients is no less necessary than a knowledge of
                    the theory of their respective arts. Before simplicity and uniformity can be
                    merits, there must be simplicity and uniformity in the subject to which they
                    relate. Now these are not among the characteristics of man. Accordingly, Bacon
                    has directed the attention of lawgivers towards the particular exceptions to
                    general jurisprudence which differences in regions and governments must always
                    be introducing into the different systems of practical law. The conquerors of
                    the East, whether ancient Greeks or modern Britons, have felt the obligation of
                    respecting usages so originating. Mr Bentham feels this so strongly that, in
                    indulgence to immemorial custom, he questions, for instance, our laws against
                    infanticide in Cutch. Nothing is more to the credit of the discretion of our
                    Indian government than the gradual measures by which they proceeded against
                    suttees; measures, where every symptom and circumstance required to be watched
                    as the experiment was going on, in order to ensure its success. A great portion
                    of the rules of property are expedients in solution of the other dilemma. On the
                    one hand, property exists everywhere; property, by law established. To ask,
                    therefore, whether there should be such a thing as private property, is, in
                    other words, to ask whether there should be such a thing as society. And if
                    utility requires property as an institution, it equally requires that the
                    conditions of it should be fixed by the only authority capable of fixing it,—the
                    municipal law of the country where the question arises. On the other hand, an
                    enumeration of the countless diversity of these conditions in different
                    countries would cover pages. Some of them certainly might be drawn nearer to
                    each other by the line of reason. But many are purely arbitrary, and must always
                    remain so. Hume, towards the conclusion of his appendix on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Farther Considerations with regard to Justice,</hi> explains (in a passage
                    which Paley has enlarged) the slight analogies to which, in cases of this
                    description, legislation must resort. “When natural reason points out no fixed
                    view of public utility by which a controversy of .property can be decided,
                    positive laws are often framed to supply its place, and direct the procedure of
                    all courts of judicature. Where these two fail, as often happens, precedents are
                    called for; and a former decision, though given itself without any sufficient
                    reason, justly becomes a sufficient reason for a new decision. If direct laws
                    and precedents be wanting, imperfect and indirect ones are brought in aid; and
                    the controverted case is ranged under them, by analogical reasonings and
                    comparisons, and similitudes and correspondences, which are often more fanciful
                    than real. In general it may safely be affirmed, that jurisprudence is, in this
                    respect, different from all the sciences; and that in many of its nicer
                    questions, there cannot properly be said to be truth or falsehood on either
                    side. If one pleader brings the case under any former law or precedent, by a
                    refined analogy or comparison, the opposite pleader is riot at a loss to find an
                    opposite analogy or comparison. And the <hi rend="italic">preference given by
                    the judge is often founded more on taste and imagination than on any solid
                    argument.</hi> Public utility is the general object of all courts of judicature;
                    and this utility, too, requires a stable rule in all controversies. But where
                    several rules, nearly equal and indifferent, present themselves, it is a very
                    slight turn of thought which fixes the decision in favour of either party.” If
                    the well-known distinction between legislation and that part of the
                    administration of justice the results of which we are learning to call
                    jurisprudence had been present to the mind of the philosopher whilst he was
                    writing the above paragraph, he would have perceived that he was de <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193203706" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3706-0177"/> scribing the
                    course of the first, and not the second. Courts of justice may be driven to such
                    resources by a necessity more or less imperative. Whenever they are so, the
                    difference in this respect between their course in adjudicating upon questions
                    which arise under the common law and those which arise upon the statute law is,
                    at the most, only a difference in degree; and, in the two cases, their
                    comparative authority was originally construed quite the reverse from what is
                    usually understood’ at present. Nevertheless, in truth, the court must be always
                    discharging, on these occasions, the office of a legislator, not a judge. In
                    another part of his works, Hume notices the very delicate question, What are the
                    degrees of relationship within which marriage ought not to be contracted? This
                    is another of those cases in which philosophical jurisprudence can do no more
                    than intimate the principle. “Love between the nearer relations is contrary to
                    reason and public utility; but the precise point where we are to stop can
                    scarcely be determined by natural reason, and is therefore a very proper subject
                    for municipal law or custom. If the Athenians went a little too far on the one
                    side, the canon law has surely pushed matters a great way into the other
                    extreme.” On taking leave of the preliminary inquiry into general jurisprudence,
                    it is no exaggeration to say that Mr Bentham was the first jurisconsult who ever
                    applied, with any thing like adequate detail, a searching analysis of human
                    nature to the elements of law. His catalogues of the pains and pleasures of
                    which man is susceptible, have acted like a blister to the former plausible and
                    superficial systems. With an analysis of this sort on their tables, an end has
                    been put to those more ancient and contradictory catalogues of the laws of
                    nature which bookish scholars so long invented at their pleasure. Had it existed
                    earlier, we should not have had, for instance, Domat and Montesquieu at issue on
                    the very principle of filial inheritance; Domat declaring that it is a law of
                    nature that children should succeed to the property of their parents;
                    Montesquieu, on the other hand, declaring that it is a law of nature that a
                    parent should exercise his discretion.</p>
                <p>2. After having settled his map of general jurisprudence on the common principles
                    of human nature, a wise legislator will proceed to examine the legislation of
                    the particular country for which he is about to legislate. This must lead him on
                    every subject to a complete and correct view of the progress and actual
                    condition of its law. Mr Bentham, in his <hi rend="italic">Theory of
                    Legislation,</hi> has treated history too much like an old Almanac. It is indeed
                    the standard defect of his writings, that he seldom looks for help from any
                    other understanding except his own. The sages of the English law, however, have
                    every reason to be content with the value which he teaches the legal reformers
                    of England to put upon their collected labours, “Traverse,” he observes, “the
                    whole Continent of Europe; ransack all the libraries belonging to the
                    jurisprudential system of the various political states; add the contents of all
                    together, and you would not be able to compose a collection of cases equal in
                    variety, in amplitude, in clearness of statement, in a word, in all points taken
                    together, in instructiveness, to that which may be seen to be afforded by the
                    collection of <hi rend="italic">English Reports of adjudged Cases,</hi> on
                    adding to them <hi rend="italic">Abridgments and Treatises,</hi> by which a sort
                    of order, such as it is, has been given to their contents.” <hi rend="italic"

                <p>3. The legislator ought in the next place to compare, on all points of
                    importance, different systems of jurisprudence with each other. The necessity of
                    this extended information on the part of the English legislature arises from
                    even a higher duty than that of enlarging the sphere of philosophical induction.
                    It is a direct necessity imposed on its members, by the fact that there is
                    scarcely a species of law existing on the face of the earth which is not within
                    the province of their immediate superintendence. “At this moment there are few
                    of the systems of legislation, either of ancient or modern times, which are not
                    in force as living law within the British empire. Menu and Mahommed decide the
                    civil rights of the Hindu and the Mogul; and an appeal from India compels our
                    privy councillors to consult the Koran and the Puranas as authorities at
                    Whitehall. Justinian is obeyed by the courts of the Ionian republic. In the
                    Norman isles, the severed portions of the domains of the conqueror, the barbaric
                    custumal framed by his justiciars still guides the grand bailiff and the
                    seneschal, who dispense the equity of Rollo, now forgotten in the hall of Rouen.
                    Canada cherishes the volumes which have been cast forth from the palace of
                    justice; and the legitimate representatives of the proud and learned presidents
                    of the parliament of Paris, are found in the court-house of a colonial town.
                    Banished from the flowery meadows of the Seine, the ordinances expounded by
                    Saint Louis beneath the oak-tree at Vincennes constitute the tenures of lands on
                    the Gulf of St Lawrence; and, whilst every vestige of feudality has been blotted
                    out of the title-deeds of the European continent, it remains in full vigour in
                    the wilds and wastes of the New World. In the opposite hemisphere, we bestow an
                    equal protection on the codes of Napoleon; and it is possible that, in future
                    ages, the speck of land, the Mauritius, in which they are now in force, may
                    alone preserve the vestiges of the jurisprudence of the Great Empire. Our
                    sovereign appoints his alcades and his corregidors in the Indies of Columbus;
                    whilst his landrosts in Southern Africa are guided by the placets of the
                    states-general of the departed republic of the Netherlands. The laws of king
                    Christian of Denmark are administered by British authority in the torrid zone.
                    And the deemsters assembled on the Tynwald of Man have not abandoned the polity
                    of the sea-kings of Scandinavia. It is difficult to question the policy which
                    first induced England to soothe her stranger subjects, by thus indulging them
                    with the exercise of the laws which habit had rendered dear to them. But our
                    legislators should now begin, slowly and cautiously, to assimilate the
                    institutions of the dependencies to those of the mother country.”<note

                    events, particular institutions, or of any other description.</p>
                <p>There is no difference of opinion as to the reality of most of the variations
                    just mentioned, or their causes. Those which it is the most important to dwell
                    upon, because, being the most insensible, they run the greatest risk of being
                    overlooked or underrated, are the changes by which, in the course of
                    generations, the moral and intellectual identity of almost every nation is
                    necessarily destroyed. In this manner the gradual amendment of the laws of a
                    country should be the best part of the history of its progressive civilization.
                    It ought to be consequent upon it, and to be the surest sign of it. Strangely
                    opposite theories upon the transitiveness or stationariness of laws have been
                    put forward in the discussions on codification. The fact, thus asserted on one
                    side and denied on the other, seems to be regarded by some of the disputants as
                    decisive of that particular controversy. This we conceive to be a most
                    imprudent, and, what is more to the purpose, a most erroneous admission upon the
                    part of the advocates of a code. The extent to which the fact of a gradual, and
                    thus at last <pb break="no" facs="nls:193203719" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3719-0178"
                    />an almost total, change in the moral and intellectual identity of a people,
                    affects the value of a code, is a matter only of degree. The fact, if true, will
                    certainly prevent a code from being framed, once and for ever. But it by no
                    means follows that a code may not after all be a desirable compromise in the
                    alternative of difficulties which the question of code or no code necessarily
                    presents. It will only follow that it must be put up in moveable types, not in
                    stereotype. If our extract from Savigny should be thought an exaggerated
                    statement of the necessarily flexible and fluent character of nations, and of
                    their laws, this statement is, in our opinion, much nearer the truth than any
                    notion of immutability, even than that of an immutability liable to be broken in
                    upon only by great occasions, such as Meyer apparently insinuates rather than
                    positively affirms. “In the earliest times to which authentic history extends,
                    the law will be found,” says Savigny, “to have already attained a fixed
                    character, peculiar to the people, like their language, manners, and
                    constitution. Nay, these phenomena have no separate existence; they are but the
                    particular faculties and tendencies of an individual people, inseparably united
                    in nature, and only wearing the semblance of distinct attributes to our view.
                    That which binds them into one whole is the common conviction of the people, the
                    kindred consciousness of an inward necessity, excluding all notion of an
                    accidental and arbitrary origin. But these moral faculties require some bodily
                    existence to fix them. Such, for language, is its constant uninterrupted
                    use,—such, for the constitution, are palpable and public powers; but what
                    supplies its place with regard to the law? In our times it is supplied by rules
                    communicated by writing and word of mouth. This mode of fixation, however,
                    presupposes a high degree of abstraction, and is therefore not practicable in
                    early times. On the contrary, we then find symbolical acts universally employed
                    where rights and duties were to be created or extinguished. These formal acts
                    may be considered as the true grammar of law in this period. But this organic
                    connection of law with the being and the character of the people, is also
                    manifested in the progress of the times; and here again it may be compared with
                    language. For law, as for language, there is no moment of absolute cessation; it
                    is subject to the same movement and development as every other popular tendency;
                    and this very development remains under the same law of inward necessity, as in
                    its earliest stages. Law grows with the growth and strengthens with the strength
                    of the people, and finally dies away as the nation loses its nationality. The
                    sum, therefore, of this theory is, that all law is originally formed in the
                    manner in which, in ordinary but not quite correct language, customary law is
                    said to have been formed; that is, it is first developed by custom and popular
                    faith, next by jurisprudence; everywhere therefore by internal, silently
                    operating powers, not by the arbitrary will of a lawgiver.”<note anchored="true"

                    hand, from the way in which he expresses himself, gives his readers to
                    understand, that the elements of internal change in the habits of a people, to
                    the degree even in which they influence its customary law, are nothing more than
                    occasional exceptions. “Supposing,” says he, “all law to be introduced by usage,
                    it would ensue that it was susceptible of variation when the difference of
                    circumstances in which a nation finds itself, introduces a notable change in its
                    necessities, that is, in its manner of existence. But there is no reason to
                    conclude that a change of this kind is the necessary and immediate consequence
                    of the ordinary alterations naturally resulting from the lapse of time.
                    According to our manner of considering the subject, law, whether it is regarded
                    as an emanation of human wisdom applied to given facts, or is looked upon as the
                    result of the necessary combinations which a state of society introduces, must
                    be unalterable, unless by <hi rend="italic">reason of some important event,</hi>
                    sufficient either to displace the facts to which the theory has been applied, or
                    to destroy the usage. Custom is unalterable, or it would not be custom; resting
                    on a series of similar facts, it excludes all idea of variation and constant
                    flux. Beginning from the point at which uncertainty ceases, whatever remains
                    stable (notwithstanding slight variations in the species which present
                    themselves) is alone that which can be considered to constitute usage; just as
                    the height of water is calculated by the line which it constantly draws, though
                    one wave may rise above, and another may fall below. The main notion of a law
                    always in movement, always in a course of improvement, and adapting itself to
                    the demands of the moment, and which consequently can never be stationary or
                    regarded from a settled point, is one of those vague conceptions which can only
                    arise in minds pre-occupied by fallacious systems. Law, even customary law, is
                    by its nature invariable and fixed, though capable of being changed when
                    circumstances imperatively require it. But these changes, so far from being of
                    the essence of law and custom, are, on the contrary, altogether exceptions; and
                    it is impossible to have a precise idea of floating laws.”<note anchored="true"

                    very unguarded language, quite unworthy of the author of the <hi rend="italic"

                    learning which characterize the work in which it appears. Of course, every
                    effect, in the case of laws, as of other things, must have its cause, and that a
                    sufficient one, although not always equally assignable; or it would not have
                    taken place. As far, therefore, as man is unchangeable, such laws as have been
                    once put in harmony with his nature, may be expected to be also unchangeable.
                    But even the class of laws properly belonging to human nature is affected by
                    many causes which produce little or no change in the visible^ wants and aspect
                    of society; whilst the numerous other laws which follow the bidding of a
                    government, or the temporary tendencies of juridical learning, must change as
                    they change, and often from causes slight enough.</p>
                <p>Foreign jurists, when most favourably disposed to English law, are nevertheless
                    marvellously struck by the poverty and narrowness of most English law-books. Few
                    of our legal writers have thought of any thing further than of compiling and
                    classifying books of practice. Practising lawyers, for the most part, therefore,
                    it may be taken for granted, will consider as quite superfluous almost all and
                    every portion of the labour which we have above required of the makers of the
                    law. Partisans of the historical school in Germany and elsewhere will take their
                    own share of antiquarian doctrine, but be disposed to pay too little attention
                    to the general philosophy of human nature. On the other hand, many of the strict
                    followers of Mr Bentham, too confident in the expanded views opened to them by
                    their master, will think it beneath them to descend from their mountain top, and
                    shut themselves up, as it were, within the paltry bounds of one or two private
                    schools. Now, the several classes thus, enumerated are disqualified for the task
                    of legislation, just in the proportion that they are exclusive. Their favourite
                    views are all highly valuable, and the more so because they are to a
                    considerable degree independent of each other. The greater part of all positive
                    systems of jurisprudence were originally built up by means of customs,
                    incidental text-books, and the decisions of courts of justice upon particular
                    cases. After being thus constructed, they were subsequently taught synthetically
                    only as sciences, without having the aid and correction of any real <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193203732" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3732-0179"/> analysis applied
                    to them. Little, therefore, having been ever derived directly from this source,
                    we believe that, in making or amending laws, a philosophical analysis of human
                    nature is of such paramount importance, that without it nothing new and really
                    great will ever be introduced. In this "manner alone can a statesman hope to
                    learn what is the standard to which every reform in legislation, except as
                    controlled by special circumstances, should be directed; and by these means
                    alone can he learn how this standard is to be approached. On the other hand,
                    comparative law is a science as well worth studying, and, <hi rend="italic"
                    >mutatis</hi><hi rend="italic">mutandis,</hi> ought to· be studied for the same
                    purpose, as comparative anatomy. Religion is the only other subject which has
                    occupied half the same amount of understanding. Besides, no human genius is
                    competent to think out unas-sistedly a system of law. The legislative and
                    judicial records of mankind are amongst the very highest subsidiary authority
                    for discovering the true principles of human nature upon the questions to which
                    they relate. But, independently of this consideration, the immediate influence
                    exercised by their laws and institutions upon a people, and the way in which all
                    laws and institutions of any standing lean upon and penetrate each other, are
                    practical points of the greatest nicety and weight. An accurate knowledge of
                    them, both of their past history and present condition, in relation to the
                    particular country to which the new legislation is to be adapted, is at least as
                    indispensable as any illumination which the. most consummate generalizations of
                    universal jurisprudence can afford. Fortunately, the two methods may be
                    combined. Otherwise, on the supposition that law reforms were to be intrusted to
                    a single jurist, and that accordingly we were obliged to choose our legislator,
                    pure and unadulterated, out of one or other of these opposite schools, we should
                    think ourselves safer among the precedents of the legal antiquarian, than among
                    the speculations of the juridical metaphysician. The precedents have been a part
                    of the real business of life at one time. That is certain. Whether the
                    particular speculations ever will become so, may be a very doubtful matter.</p>
                <p>A union of theory and practice can alone secure tolerable legislation. Whether
                    the above schools actherein separately or conjointly, the work, if it is to
                    approximate to the form of reasonable laws, must be the work of a well-practised
                    theorist. The observations of Carmignani upon the mode in which a legislator
                    ought to proceed in getting at his general and subordinate principles, if true
                    of criminal law, must be true with respect to law of all kinds. In the working
                    them out, however, it is clear that the great (perhaps the greater) part of the
                    rules of jurisprudence will have been anticipated and ascertained in what is
                    here supposed the earlier process of investigating the principles of
                    legislation. “If every notion belonging to criminal laws proceeds, as it ought
                    to proceed, from an examination of the qualities of the object out of which it
                    arises, verifying them by observation and experience (and this is the main
                    difficulty), what, it may be asked, is the nature of the principle which such an
                    examination will establish? It will be the most general rule that the human mind
                    can conceive for providing for the wants of that particular object. Will the
                    principle be theoretical or practical? It will be both one and the other:
                    practical because it proceeds from the experience of facts; theoretical because
                    the result of this experience is here converted into a general rule. What, then,
                    shall this principle be called? <hi rend="italic">A principle of
                    criminal</hi><hi rend="italic">législation,.</hi> But how shall this principle
                    be made to descend from the elevated generalization in which it consists, and be
                    so applied as, in every possible case, to provide for the wants of the object
                    out of which it has first arisen? By observing how best to apply it to the
                    several cases, by considering whether it embraces them all, and how it embraces
                    them, and by fixing the nature and number of subaltern principles which are
                    wanted for facilitating and securing this application. Now, what will be these
                    subaltern principles? theoretical or practical? They will be theoretical, in as
                    much as they are, as it were, a filiation from the first general principle: they
                    will be practical, inasmuch as they are intended to provide for practical cases.
                    How then shall these principles be called? <hi rend="italic">PRuls of criminal
                    jurisprudence.</hi> In criminal matters, therefore, there is not one part
                    theoretical, another practical. There is the science of legislation, or that of
                    establishing criminal law; and there is <hi rend="italic">jurisprudence,</hi> or
                    the science of the application of the criminal law which has been, thus
                    established. Nor can these two branches of knowledge be properly disjoined, the
                    first being a filiation from the second; nor can a proper value be put on this
                    filiation, but by means of analysis.”</p>
                <p>Whatever mode of legislation is adopted, in case law is ever to be a rational
                    science, it can only be made so by the application of powers and processes, both
                    of observation and generalization, similar to those by which other intelligible
                    sciences have been made. There can be no “high <hi rend="italic">priori</hi>
                    road;” no assumption, without evidence, of certain general principles or maxims,
                    from and by means of which all doctrines are to be afterwards synthetically
                    propounded. By a philosophical abstraction, what is common in <hi rend="italic"
                    >individual</hi><hi rend="italic">v&amp;ses,,</hi> must be separated and
                    classed, in order to form the <hi rend="italic">species</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and then the same must be done with what is common to the <hi
                    rend="italic">species,</hi> in order to form the <hi rend="italic">genus.</hi> A
                    marked advancement has taken place in legislation at certain periods. But the
                    greater part of this has in all periods been directly owing to an improved
                    analysis of some of the principal facts which enter into legal constitutions,
                    and by a better exposition and understanding of their causes and effects.’^ In
                    this manner alone can the advantages and disadvantages of existing laws be
                    faithfully ascertained. It is thus, to mention two or three instances only, that
                    the legal maxims of former times on heresy and witchcraft, on secret tribunals,
                    torture, extreme or barbarous punishments, have been, one after the other,
                    successively exploded. It has been truly said that “Beccaria would not have
                    produced a^revolution in criminal legislation, if, instead of exposing the
                    consequences of sundry mischievous laws, he had restricted himself to an
                    eloquent development of his principles on the <hi rend="italic">right to
                    punish</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and that the discussions which during the
                    last century arose out of certain celebrated trials, contributed more to the
                    progress of legal science than the <hi rend="italic">social contract of</hi>
                    Rousseau.” Nor is this method the only one really and permanently available for
                    the getting rid of bad laws. It is equally necessary for the framing of good
                    ones. In no other manner can a proper use be made of the materials of existing
                    laws, with a view to the construction of an improved system. This latter
                    enterprise certainly requires a combination of great qualities and attainments.
                    In order to duly correct the English system, for instance, what different
                    capacities must be put in requisition for the task. There will be wanted the
                    learning of Serjeant Hill to collect the materials of a purely professional kind
                    (the most important materials after alD,—the philosophical genius of Lord
                    Mansfield to deduce from them liberal and comprehensive rules,—the logic and the
                    caution of Lord Eldon to trace the consequences of the rules to their remotest
                    fibres, and to fix, in one of his exact parentheses, the limits and the
                    exceptions by which particular rules ought to be guarded. The difficulties to be
                    overcome in legislation are great, but not altogether insuperable. It is no
                    answer to a proposition for a thorough sifting into the state of the laws of any
                    country, that any extensive improvement of laws is a difficult undertaking. It
                    is an equally insufficient objection to say, that the best possible system of
                    legislation must, after all, be to a certain degree imperfect. The English
                    nation has inherited a system of laws founded on the force of habit, the
                    authority of prescription, the learning of text writers, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193203745" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3745-0180"/>the discretion of judges. Its
                    government must (supposing it to be otherwise competent to the performance of
                    the high trust with which it is invested) be capable of determining whether it
                    has, in point of fact, sufficient means at its command for the introduction of a
                    better system, either in substance, by a substitution, in certain cases, of more
                    reasonable principles; or in form, by the aid either of a general consolidation,
                    or of special codes.</p>
                <p>A careful perusal of an excellent chapter by Dugald Stewart, in the first volume
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of the Human Mind,</hi> on “the use and
                    abuse of general principles in politics,” ought to satisfy a statesman, that any
                    pains which he may take in this investigation are not likely to be thrown away,
                    at the period which society has at present reached. Reading it, he will the
                    better understand by what causes the science of legislation has hitherto been
                    principally retarded, by what means its successful cultivation may be most
                    effectually promoted, and on what grounds and to what extent we may reasonably
                    hope that the future will consisÊ of something better thana patchwork repetition
                    of the past. The simplifying of legislation means something more than weeding
                    the trash out of a lawyer’s library. A single paragraph (we shall give no more
                    from a book which everybody ought to be presumed to know) will serve to show the
                    spirit of his opinions: “In order to lay a solid foundation for the science of
                    politics, the first step ought to be, to ascertain that form of society which is
                    perfectly agreeable to nature and to justice, and what are the principles of
                    legislation necessary for maintaining it. Nor is the inquiry so difficult as
                    might at first be apprehended; for it might be easily shown, that the greater
                    part of the political disorders which exist among mankind, do not arise from a
                    want of foresight in politicians, which has rendered their laws too general, but
                    from their having trusted too little to the operation of those simple
                    institutions which nature and justice recommend; and, of consequence, that, as
                    society advances to its perfection, the number of laws may be expected to
                    diminish, instead of increasing, and the science of legislation to be gradually
                    simplified.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Codification.</hi> Codification is one of the many polysyllabic
                    terms which Mr Bentham constructed in order to express in single sonorous words
                    the growing wants of legal science. Μ. Dumont made it French, and by so doing
                    has made it European. It signifies either the science or the operation of making
                    codes. Modern usage has disregarded the technical nomenclature of the Roman law,
                    wherein the code represented the compilation of that particular portion which
                    was derived from the imperial constitutions. Most persons understand by the word
                    at present no more than an authoritative consolidation, either of the entire
                    body of national law, or of some particular division of it; and this, without
                    distinguishing between the materials used or the form adopted. Five codes on law
                    and procedure, collected from various sources, and arranged systematically in
                    separate paragraphs, constitute the Code Napoleon. In case it is attempted to
                    reduce the English laws to something of a system, the common law and the statute
                    law may be incorporated or kept distinct ;—the form may be that of enumerated
                    articles, or of a continuous digest,—the digest may be framed upon either the
                    historical or scientific principle; and yet, in these several cases, the enacted
                    volume would be called, and with equal propriety, a code. Each of these courses
                    has found able advocates. But there is a previous question to determine,—one on
                    which much learning, argument, and passion, have been of late exhausted,—that
                    is, whether, on general principles, a code is of any real advantage to a nation.
                    To know this, it is necessary to know the several characteristics of written and
                    unwritten, or, to speak more correctly, of enacted and unenacted laws. The
                    comparative merits of these two sys tems will perhaps be better (at least more
                    practically and popularly) stated, by a narrative of the circumstances and the
                    method in which different nations have attempted to solve the problem, and by an
                    examination into the discussions which have taken place in consequence, than by
                    an analysis conducted in a more formal manner.</p>
                <p>Municipal law is a rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme authority of
                    the state. The legal rule ought in all cases to have the character of a rule.
                    But it may exist, and in point of fact has existed, under very different
                    formalities and presumptions in different countries. It begins in barbarous
                    countries orally, and is necessarily continued in them by oral tradition. It is,
                    however, everywhere committed to the custody of writing, as soon as writing
                    becomes common. By some nations, as soon as it is put in writing, it is embodied
                    into digests; by others it is separated into articulate propositions. Under some
                    systems it is to be got at out of special precedents, by means only of
                    comparison and analogy; under others it is understood to be contained, as matter
                    of necessary inference, in a certain number of definitions and general
                    principles. In the same manner, the rule expressive of the will of society must
                    everywhere be supposed to be invested, first or last, with the sanction of
                    society, speaking by the voice of its supreme authority, that is, by the voice
                    of the legislature. But this sanction may be implied as well as expressed. It
                    exists, although indirectly, in behalf of rules which, if they are made by
                    others, the legislature nevertheless adopts, just as completely as it exists in
                    behalf of those which the legislature has itself originated, and on which,
                    therefore, it set its seal from the beginning. The prudence of an arrangement,
                    by which an intelligent community consents to the surrender of the initiative by
                    its legislature, thus countenancing a wanton confusion of judicial and
                    legislative action, and leaving the law, as it were, all of a heap,
                    comparatively inaccessible and unknown, is a different question. This may, in
                    some cases, have been the least of two evils. But the exigencies of one state of
                    society need not be made the deliberate choice of another. In the mean time, the
                    various laws, pouring in from these different sources, though not equally open
                    to the inspection of the public, are equally recognised by its members, as
                    possessing the authority of law. The abuse, if any, is not transacted in a
                    corner. There are popular usages, transmitted orally from generation to
                    generation by the common report of neighbours, or, as in the city of London,
                    certified by the mouth of the recorder: there are judicial principles, whether
                    laid down by the praetor in general terms, or extracted from the decisions of
                    courts in particular cases: there are the private opinions of learned text
                    writers, such as the jurisconsults at Rome, or as Littleton, Coke, and Fearne in
                    England: there is the uniform understanding of the profession, the <hi
                    rend="italic">usus fori,</hi> acknowledged even unto the practice of
                    conveyancers. Whilst so many concurrent streams are notoriously feeding and
                    filling the channels of the law, the silence of the legislature is equivalent to
                    its assent. This, most of the advocates of a code are reasonable enough to
                    admit. But it is the legal obligation which is thus impressed upon laws of this
                    description, that constitutes the very ground of their complaint. They insist,
                    that laws so diversified as often to clash, and so latent as often to remain
                    unknown, can never adequately fulfil the characteristic conditions of a
                    legislative rule. They propose, accordingly, that there should be only one form
                    of law,—that of writing; and only one source of law,—that of express legislative
                    enactment.</p>
                <p>A complete code, of course, embraces the whole field of law, indeed every subject
                    competent to be raised in a court of justice. Partial codes embrace only legal
                    rights and obligations of a particular description. We shall look at the subject
                    historically in the first instance. If its very principle and <hi rend="italic"
                    >rationale</hi> have been left to be settled almost to our <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193203758" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3758-0181"/>own times, this does not
                    arise from a lack of early precedents; whilst it is to the credit of modern
                    civilization that the argumentative statements latterly advanced on both sides
                    of the case contain the greater part, if not all, of what philosophy can have to
                    say about it. There have been codes of one sort or another in the world from the
                    earliest ages. The title of a legislator was in great request with antiquity. It
                    was an honour of the same order as that of the founder or restorer of a state.
                    We must not, however, be the slaves of splendid names. It is difficult to
                    believe that, on the formation of a semi-barbarous government, it could have the
                    means or the desire of constructing an entire system of positive legislation;
                    still less that it would think of admitting, in the course of its future
                    progress, no laws to pass current but what were either originally produced in
                    that mould, or what were as soon as possible thrown into it, in order that they
                    might be reproduced under its stamp and fashion. This is one of the wants and
                    achievements of wiser times. These ancient codes, instead of being born, like
                    our first father, full grown, were diminutive, feeble births, and left
                    outstanding a much greater mass of customary law. They extended to some few
                    principal subjects only, and were probably not always the sole and exclusive
                    authority even upon them. The proportion between the written law, thus enacted
                    by the legislature, and the remainder of the law, which was derived from other
                    sources, must have varied in different countries at the very commencement of
                    their several societies. The proportion, unequal at first, must have gone on
                    varying still more from age to age. If we should suppose the Twelve Tables, the
                    capitularies of Charlemagne, the code of Alfred, to have constituted nearly the
                    whole of the municipal law of their respective periods, this could not long
                    remain so. The shape which their subsequent legislation might assume would, even
                    in the same state, depend on very different considerations, at different stages
                    of its history; whilst the course which might have been most judicious in one
                    country might be most imprudent in another. Codes then, it is clear, have always
                    existed more or less, of one sort or another, from time immemorial. The
                    advantages and disadvantages also of this species of legislation vary from
                    country to country, and from age to age. In most eases the experiment has been
                    tried, concurrently with other kinds of legislation. This is the state of things
                    which history from time to time necessarily presents. Accordingly a period must
                    arrive in all civilized communities for subjecting the opposite pretensions of
                    contrasted systems to the test of a philosophical and historical discussion. The
                    general question, in “what form laws are best authenticated, communicated, and
                    preserved,—the particular question of code or no code in a given country,—are
                    questions which (in whatever way they may be ultimately decided) must sooner or
                    later come to be debated. Of course, we speak of countries where man is in
                    movement, and where the population is sufficiently orderly and prosperous for
                    the laws to spread out and accumulate to their natural extent.</p>
                <p>Some persons seem determined to presume every thing in behalf of classical
                    antiquity. It may be suggested therefore, that the evidence of its legislative
                    deliberations upon this subject may have been lost; otherwise the silence of the
                    most celebrated amongst the ancient states is a very suspicious circumstance. If
                    they were never made aware of the necessity of meeting the question, they can
                    have had little or no law on many important subjects. If they were too ignorant
                    or indifferent to make serious provision for a satisfactory determination of it,
                    they must have left their law in an imperfect, incoherent, desultory condition.
                    There is no evidence come down to us from antiquity, that the demand for
                    reducing the whole body of national law to principle and method was ever raised,
                    except at Rome; nor at Rome, for practical purposes, by any body except by
                    Caesar and Justinian. On this point Cicero gives us the first and almost the
                    only information we possess. His own views are so excellent, that, supposing
                    them to have originated with himself, he must have created a school of law
                    reformers. It is clear that Cicero regarded the writings of the Greeks upon
                    politics and law as purely literary compositions. Under this conviction, he took
                    great credit to himself for writing on law as a statesman. He looked at the laws
                    and the commonwealth in connection with each other; and in all his observations
                    had the Roman institutions principally in his mind. If the legal literature of
                    Greece was too abstract to work with, in what relation stood their judicial
                    jurisprudence? The Greek bar, if it was not of a kind to much embarrass Athenian
                    reformers, must have been still more incapable of assisting to settle the law
                    upon new and improved foundations. Nor is this the extent of the loss. Wherever
                    lawyers are not a distinct and respectable profession, it may be taken for
                    granted that there is little or no law. The jurisconsults of Rome, in the
                    comparative infancy of Roman law, had already become more powerful by their
                    authority than even by their talents. On the other hand, what could be expected
                    of Greek lawyers, such as Cicero describes them by .way of contrast: <hi
                    rend="italic">Infimi</hi><hi rend="italic">homines apud Groecos</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mercedula addicti</hi><hi rend="italic">gui</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ministros se</hi><hi rend="italic">proebent in</hi><hi rend="italic">judiciis
                    oratoribus?</hi> Whilst jurists and judges apparently did but little for the
                    cultivation of municipal law in Greece, was the deficiency really supplied from
                    other sources—by popular usages or positive legislation? Cicero has not in this
                    respect a word to say for the nursery of philosophy, literature, and the arts.
                    On the contrary, Rome was in his opinion the only substantial home of virtue,
                    dignity, and empire in all the world. The most vulgar lawyer, admiring his own
                    little manual of practice, and despising the institutions of every other people,
                    could not throw out a more scornful challenge than the comparison he puts into
                    the mouth of Crassus, between the Roman laws and the laws of Draco, Solon, and
                    Lycurgus. <hi rend="italic">Incredibile est, quam</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sit</hi><hi rend="italic">omne</hi><hi rend="italic">jus civile proeter hoc

                    rend="italic">omnibus maxime Grescis antepono!</hi> Nevertheless, all the praise
                    to which the civil law in the time of Cicero seemed entitled, was by comparison
                    only. The black-letter wisdom of the Twelve Tables was losing its interest,
                    except with antiquarians and moralists. In his childhood it had been taught as a
                    sort of catechism to young people. He himself had learned it <hi rend="italic"
                    >(carmen necessarium),</hi> in the way that their constitutional code is a
                    prescribed lesson in the schools of some of the United States; but the practice
                    had gone out of fashion during his lifetime <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Legibus,</hi> 25). Its old-fashioned authority was just then in
                    the course of being displaced by the successive edicts of the praetors. <hi
                    rend="italic">Non ergo a proctons</hi><hi rend="italic">edicto</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">utplerique nunc</hi><hi rend="italic">neque a duodecim tabulis ut
                    superiores sed penitus ex intima philosophia hauriendam juris disciplinam
                    putant.</hi> The annual code of the praetor could, however, at this period cover
                    but a small corner of the field of law. The rest, such as it was, must have been
                    given over into the hands of the jurisconsult. But the juridical learning of
                    Rome, which was afterwards destined to acquire the character of written wisdom,
                    and become the arbiter of the civilized world, was at that time in a state
                    hardly removed from childhood. Cicero himself, in the oration for Muraena,
                    treats it with the utmost contempt. <hi rend="italic">Primum dignitas</hi><hi

                    for oratorical effect. In the treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Legibus</hi> he speaks of the learning of the profession quite as
                    slightingly; and declares that it consists but of mean things, <hi rend="italic"
                    >quae</hi><hi rend="italic">et scripta</hi><hi rend="italic">sunt</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">De Oratore,</hi> he states that their writings <hi rend="italic"

                    boasted superiority of the Roman law to that of all other nations, to what must
                    the boast be in truth reduced? The foundation consisted of the Twelve Tables,
                    whatever they might be worth. But almost the entire fabric was raised up by
                    means of the annual edict of an annual unprofessional officer, professing to
                    make his laws for the year, and to administer them upon the latitudinarian
                    principles of a court of honour or of conscience." On certain subjects, the
                    additional element of that occasional, partial, and conflicting legislation
                    described by Tacitus, embroiled the fray. These new laws would raise up the
                    debateable examination which Cicero mentions, into the old ones, whether, for
                    instance, they are to be supposed <hi rend="italic">ipsa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sua vetustate consenuisse aut novis legibus esse sublatas.</hi> Now this was
                    the state of the Roman law when Caesar is understood to have aspired to the
                    character of a legal reformer. The last-mentioned materials, produced by
                    extensive and arbitrary legislation, at the passion and in the interest of
                    opposite authorities, appear, in their complication, their contradiction, and
                    their evil spirit, to have been the greatest grievance. What evidence have we of
                    the measures which he contemplated? Gibbon’s imagination seems to have taken
                    wing without authority, when he anticipates on this occasion the avatar of a
                    more than Roman Bentham. According to the rhetorical historian, if Caesar had
                    achieved the reformation of the Roman law, his creative genius, enlightened by
                    reflection and study, would have given to the world “a pure and original system
                    of jurisprudence.” Suetonius is so far from supporting this conjecture, that he
                    expressly restricts the intended amendment of thejws <hi rend="italic"
                    >civile</hi> to the reduction of it within a moderate compass, and to the making
                    out of its immense quantity of laws, a small compilation of those only which
                    were best and most needful; <hi rend="italic">optima quoeque</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et necessaria</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >paucissimos conferre libros.</hi> If we suppose Caesar to have meditated
                    something more than this, it would probably have been an attempt to carry into
                    his legislative digest that logical arrangement, by which Servius Sulpicius had
                    perfected his practice, and by the aid of which Cicero insinuates that he
                    himself had at one time thought of writing a didactic treatise on the civil law.
                    Ought we to conjecture that this intention was really executed in the last books
                    of the treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Legibus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">?</hi> In that case there is, more than ever, reason to lament
                    their loss. The world would then have known what kind of a code the Roman
                    republic had really the means of making. The passages in which Cicero intimates
                    his views are therefore extremely valuable, as forming part of the history of
                    the progress towards codification. The execution of these ideas would of course
                    have had its own difficulties. But the conception of them places the universal
                    genius of their author in a remarkable light. They afford ample proof of the
                    spirit in which the only Roman philosopher and statesman that we ever read of
                    was preparing the way for the legislative authority of the victorious dictator.
                    Speaking of Servius Sulpicius, in the <hi rend="italic">Erutus,</hi> he says,
                    <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Existimo,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    notice of the design, which he attributes to Crassus in the treatise <hi

                    obscuram.</hi> More than five hundred years were allowed to pass before this
                    conception was partially executed by Justinian. We say partially; for
                    Justinian’s plan falls far short of that of Cicero, although perhaps not more so
                    than the plan of Caesar would have done, when it came to be reduced to practice.
                    The long interval which intervened, a period equal to theentire duration of some
                    commonwealths, did notof itself render a change in the plan necessary, supposing
                    that Tribonian had felt himself to be equal to the execution. But it brought
                    along with it a necessary change in the materials. There had arisen in the
                    interim a bright age of jurisprudence. The earlier legal authorities were thrown
                    into the shade. The Pandects contain but three names which belong to the
                    republic. Accordingly, the jurist finds as little of the civil policy of
                    republican Rome in the imperial laws which pass under her name, as the
                    antiquarian discovers of the ancient city within the modern walls. The new
                    learning, whatever facilities it might create in one way, added to the
                    difficulties in another. The intermediate five hundred years had been years of
                    legislative despair. Justinian has boasted in his code that he had accomplished
                    that <hi rend="italic">quod nemo principum, ante nostrum imperium, aut
                    in</hi><hi rend="italic">mentem induci</hi><hi rend="italic">posse</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aut humano ingenio possibile</hi><hi rend="italic">esse</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">existimavit.</hi> On the whole, therefore, modern law-reformers
                    must not look for much light, either as to the principles or the method of
                    legislation, from the practice and opinion of antiquity. It affects to offer no
                    information of any value except in the instance of Rome. In that instance, the
                    only comprehensive view of which we are in possession was that of Cicero.

                    rend="italic">;</hi> he was led on to a similar doctrine in the case of
                    universal law. Universal law is with him a <hi rend="italic">recta ratio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">imperandi atque prohibendi,</hi> of which it is the very essence
                    that it must be a <hi rend="italic">lex natures</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >congruens,</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">illam antiquissimam

                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Legibus</hi> had, by good fortune, come
                    down to us, we should have known the degree to which Cicero, in setting down on
                    paper the detail of his several codes, had ventured to approach to the execution
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193203784" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3784-0183"/>of a scheme of
                    natural jurisprudence. From the ridicule with which he describes the narrowness
                    of all preceding Roman lawyers, even of the Scaevolas, he certainly would not
                    have blindly put himself into the same trammels, nor have committed the error of
                    the school divines,“in pounding the crystal into dust by infinite subdivisions.

                    Besides, his particular declarations still remain to us. The course he was about
                    to pursue was to exemplify his creed, that the laws and the government ought
                    always to be in harmony with each other. Regarding the old Roman commonwealth as
                    the best, and intending to give it appropriate laws, he adds, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ergo adeo expectate leges, quae genus</hi><hi rend="italic">illud</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">optimum reipublicae</hi><hi rend="italic">contineant</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">lex,</hi><hi rend="italic">valebat.</hi> But, more than this, his
                    specimens of codification on the two great heads of ecclesiastical and
                    constitutional law have come down to us in the second and third book <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Legibus.</hi> It is evident from these
                    that he was extremely conservative of the ancient faith on these two important
                    points, and was thus far at least resolved to deviate as little as possible from
                    the beaten track of prescriptive authority into the open and debateable domain
                    of reason. Mfr Bentham, we think, could not have been induced to make similar
                    concessions to national vanity or supposed expediency. There would have been
                    some difficulty in persuading him into an apparent belief that he could make the
                    standard of universal jurisprudence in matters of church and state happily fall
                    in with the laws of Alfred and the Saxon code. But Cicero’s legislation is Roman
                    throughout. His idea of nature for this occasion, was nature as it existed
                    within the walls and policy of the eternal city; consequently the interest of
                    the work, so far from being universal, is principally the interest which
                    attaches to every thing belonging to Rome, and composed by Cicero. Nor is the
                    treatise calculated to be of greater use, as a precedent, to a codifier, from
                    any advantages of method. And Cicero having disappointed us in the execution of
                    his plan, can we expect the practical official law-reformers to be more
                    philosophical? If the philosopher by profession, when he came to apply his
                    theories, bowed before the <hi rend="italic">mos majorum,</hi> in obedience to
                    the strict and statesmanlike reserve of his nation, Caesar and Justinian were
                    not likely to have dreamed of being more latitudinarian. As masters of the
                    world, they did not enter on the subject from any concern about the philosophy
                    of legislation, but in the hope of lessening the burden of the obscure and
                    conflicting laws which they were called upon to administer.</p>
                <p>From this brief sketch, two things are evident in the case of the Roman law:
                    first, what required to be done; next, the difficulty of doing it. Its evil
                    condition had become not only perceptible, but so flagrant as to demand a
                    remedy, as early as the time of Caesar. Suetonius declares that the mischief
                    consisted principally in the <hi rend="italic">immensa diffusa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">legum</hi><hi rend="italic">copia.</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">In</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Vit.</hi><hi rend="italic">Caesar.</hi> c. 44.</p></note> Livy also and Tacitus
                    repeat it. The complaint had become proverbial. It is admitted, moreover, that
                    no remedy was applied till the melancholy crisis of the sixth century. At this
                    extreme period, another, and soon indeed the only question, had arisen. It was
                    this: Whether civilization should be left to linger out a few more decrepit
                    years in impotent decline, or should come to a violent end at the hands of the
                    barbarians? Whatever may be the imperfections in the legal production of
                    Justinian— whether incident to the age or to the persons—it is acknowledged, not
                    only that the older works on Roman law would hardly have been preserved at all,
                    except for the different compilations of the many contemporary codes of this
                    late season, “but, that it would scarcely have found entrance into modern
                    Europe, had not Justinian’s works been among them, in which alone the spirit of
                    the Roman law is discernible.” This is the statement of Savigny, generally
                    regarded as the ablest opponent of codification in general, and certainly far
                    from being an indulgent critic to the Justinian specimen in particular. Upon
                    Savigny’s own statement, therefore, posterity at least is under great
                    obligations to Justinian for having rescued the floating materials from
                    destruction. Nor can we see that there is any reason for supposing that the
                    desirableness of presenting the materials in an accessible form was not
                    acknowledged even at the time, by his contemporaries. True, there is no existing
                    trace of any experiment towards a code having been made by Papinian, Ulpian, and
                    Paulus, who were not only the three most celebrated jurists, but were also <hi
                    rend="italic">proefecti praetorio.</hi> But, to infer, that therefore they
                    considered a code as neither necessary nor advantageous, seems a very rash
                    conclusion. Their wishes may have been practically thwarted by a hundred causes,
                    and the evidence of their wishes may have perished a hundred times over. Such
                    is, in truth, the legal history of many countries upon this very point. Savigny
                    admits that, in the time of the classical jurists, “there would have been no
                    difficulty in forming an excellent code.” But this being so, it is surely very
                    much to be lamented that the middle period,—that between the infancy and the
                    decline of Rome,—which, for this particular purpose, Savigny accounts the summit
                    of appropriate civilization, was not taken advantage of. The actual generation
                    might not itself be so much in want of a code as the generations that were to
                    follow. But the highest duties of a statesman are partly prospective, in regard
                    to affairs of this description. The opposite doctrine is poor indeed. The
                    immediate generation itself, however, would probably have also been the better
                    for it. Long before this middle period, the learned or technical element must
                    have overgrown the natural or political one. The original confidence supposed to
                    be possessed by a people in their common law must have disappeared. Accordingly,
                    the only remaining problem—that which peculiarly belongs to an advanced stage of
                    society—had already arrived: Ought artificial jurisprudence to be left at large,
                    in all the varieties into which it branches out, or would it best perform its
                    office by being from time to time consolidated, arranged, and authenticated in
                    the shape of positive legislation?</p>
                <p>In modern times, this arduous experiment has been tried upon the largest scale,
                    and with the most success, by France. Political circumstances facilitated the
                    legal innovation in a remarkable degree. The fury of the Revolution had made a
                    clear space for the architects of the Code Napoleon to build upon. This was a
                    great accommodation. But the necessity of a reformation, tantamount to a
                    reconstruction of their whole legal system, existed previously, and had been
                    admitted during two or three successive centuries by the most distinguished

                <p>Whatever may have been the incompetency of the French councillors of state on
                    this occasion, there is no pretence for alleging that they were not sufficiently
                    French, and that they ran wildly into foreign notions, revolutionary opinions,
                    or abstract theories of human nature and general jurisprudence. For we are
                    informed by Μ. Dupin, in his <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on the Life and
                    Writings of Pothier,</hi> that the treatises of that perspicuous and
                    trust-worthy jurist furnished three fourths of that which is by far the most
                    difficult and complex portion of law, the Code Civil. Mr Butler, in a learned
                    note on Coke upon Littleton, disposes of what has been considered by many as one
                    of the great boasts of modern civilization, in a very summary manner. After
                    saying that Μ. Bernardi thinks that the Assizes of Jerusalem (which, in its
                    present state, is a work of the thirteenth century) is superior to it, he adds,
                    “The Codes Napoleon are five, the Code Civil, the Code Criminel, the Code de
                    Commerce, the Code de Conscription, and the Code de Procedure. It is allowed
                    that the first possesses great merit, that the third is very faulty, and that
                    whatever is good in any of them is rendered almost entirely useless by the last,
                    which has completely confounded and paralysed all the judicature of the
                    country.” The practical merit or working qualities of specific laws can be only
                    properly estimated by a native lawyer. The character, therefore, of the
                    different codes, as given by Μ. Dupin in his letter to Mr Sampson of New York,
                    1826, is entitled to much greater credit than the comparatively hearsay judgment
                    of Mr Butler. Besides, it carries the evidence down to a later date. It is as
                    follows: “The civil code is the first and best of all; it is clear and
                    methodical; neither too long nor too short; the language of the legislature is
                    noble and pure; the rules are well laid down, and, with the exception of the
                    difficult subject of mortgages, it has met with nothing but approbation, more
                    especially at the present time, since the immoral law of divorce has been struck
                    out. The code of civil procedure has simplified the forms and diminished the
                    expense of lawsuits. No fault is found with it, except in the law form of
                    execution <hi rend="italic">(expropriation),</hi> the unfortunate though
                    necessary adjunct to the law of mortgage. The commercial code, which re-enacts,
                    in a great measure, the ordonnance relative to maritime affairs of 1681, and
                    that of 1673 relative to commerce, is also generally esteemed. The only
                    exception is the title of bankruptcy, which is equally complained of, both by
                    bankrupts and by their creditors. The code of criminal procedure, and the penal
                    code, are the last, and are those to which the greatest objections have been
                    raised. Despotism dictated them. In many instances state policy has made them
                    her instrument; and liberty has suffered accordingly. Their revision has
                    therefore been demanded even in the Chamber of Peers. But all these codes, such
                    as they are, have been productive of the greatest benefit; they have delivered
                    us from the chaos of our ancient law. Above all, the institution of the court of
                    cassation, which acts, as at a central power, to regulate and check the
                    decisions of all the other jurisdictions, has been of the highest benefit.” What
                    then is the result of this experiment in the instance of France? Under the
                    opposition of local prejudices and private interests, it is very possible (as Μ.
                    Dupin believes would have been the case), that, but for the Revolution, not even
                    a Solon or a Lycurgus, placed ôn the throħe of France, could have been
                    sufficiently powerful to carry an effectual reform. The reform nevertheless
                    would not have been the less wanted. It is absurd to consider the codes as
                    political measures artfully plotted by Napoleon, because they happened to be
                    digested at last under his counsel, and promulgated in his name. The <hi
                    rend="italic">projet</hi><hi rend="italic">du code civil,</hi> commenced as
                    early as 1793, proves that it was completed to a considerable extent years
                    before the name of Napoleon was heard of. It was owing to the previous
                    discussions on the original propositions of Cambacérès, that the Code Civil was
                    enabled to be brought out at the command of Napoleon, within the short period of
                    four months. The code of France may be, and doubtless is, far short of abstract
                    perfection; but, with all its faults, an immense majority of those who live
                    under it, of those who practise it, and of those who administer it, allow it to
                    have been amongst the greatest of national blessings.</p>
                <p>The desirableness of a code of laws for any particular country, at any given
                    period, is a question of fact. Royer Collard sensibly observes, that it is
                    impossible to give, on so mixed and variable a case, one uniform answer
                    applicable equally to all times and places. What may have been clearly good in
                    France may possibly leave a doubtful balance of advantage in England. On the
                    other hand, what it would have been dangerous to attempt a hundred years ago in
                    England, may perhaps be easily accomplished to-day.</p>
                <p>Before entering upon the case of England, it may be observed, that the question
                    with regard to a portion of her provincial legislation has been latterly
                    supposed to be placed beyond dispute. Whatever balance of opinion for and
                    against codification may be found to be elsewhere keeping legislation in
                    suspense, there is one part of the globe, namely, British India, in which almost
                    every body conversant with the subject appears agreed. The governorgeneral in
                    council, assistée! both by the most experienced civil servants of the company,
                    and by the judges of the supreme court, has certified that nothing short of a
                    code, however slowly or gradually proceeded in, can meet the necessities of the
                    case. The undertaking is certainly surrounded with many impediments, and will in
                    its execution require at every step consummate prudence. On framing the precise
                    provisions, some twenty different nations, now politically united under the
                    British government, must be treated as distinct nations; varying sometimes in
                    the spirit, frequently in the letter, of their laws. There is one branch,
                    however, that of the criminal law, in which the difficulties belonging to this
                    view of the subject are thought very lightly of. Yet it is the case of criminal
                    law, to which, speaking of what has been called the best code of this kind in
                    Europe, that of Bavaria, Mr Cooper has appealed as furnishing conclusive proofs
                    in favour of Savigny’s. general objections against the present capabilities of
                    Europe for framing codes. The judges of the supreme court of Calcutta are of
                    opinion that “any one intelligent English lawyer, and one of the civil servants
                    employed in the Nizamut Adawlut, with the assistance of the reports of that
                    court recently published, might jointly prepare a regulation <hi rend="italic"

                    instance of India, the nature of the specific evils to be provided for by a code
                    cannot be more powerfully stated than in the words of one who has been since
                    deputed to the high office of ascertaining and superintending the remedies to be
                    applied. The passage to which we allude is contained in a speech delivered by Mr
                    Macaulay, in the House of Commons, on the last renewal of the charter. The
                    reader will there see, to what <pb break="no" facs="nls:193203810"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-3810-0185"/>complexion unwritten law, that is, law derived
                    from other sources than the legislature, has a tendency to come. A force like
                    that of gravitation is always dragging it in this direction. “Having given to
                    the government supreme legislative power, we next propose to give to it for a
                    time the*assistance of a commission, for the purpose of digesting and reforming
                    the laws of India, so that those laws may, as soon as possible, be formed into a
                    code. Gentlemen, of whom I wish to speak with the highest respect, have
                    expressed a doubt whether India be at present in a fit state to receive a
                    benefit which is not yet enjoyed by this free and highly-civilized country. I
                    can allow to this argument very little weight beyond that which it derives from
                    the personal authority of those who use it. For, in the first place, our freedom
                    and our high civilization render this improvement, desirable as it must always
                    be, less indispensably necessary to us than to our Indian subjects; and, in the
                    next place, our freedom and civilization, I fear, render it more difficult for
                    us to obtain this benefit for ourselves than to bestow it on them. I believe
                    that no country ever stood so much in need of a code of laws as India, and I
                    believe also that there never was a country in which the want might so easily be
                    supplied. I said that there were many points of analogy between the state of
                    that country after the fall of the Mogul power, and the state of Europe after
                    the fall of the Roman empire. In one respect the analogy is very striking. As in
                    Europe then, so in India now, there arc several systems of law, widely differing
                    from each other, but co-existing and eo-equal. The indigenous population has its
                    own laws. Each of the successive races of conquerors has brought with it its own
                    peculiar jurisprudence; the Mussulman his Koran and its innumerable
                    commentators, the Englishman his statute-book and his term-reports. As there
                    were established in Italy at one and the same time, the Roman law, the Lombard
                    law, the Ripuarian law, the Bavarian law, and the Salic law; so we have now in
                    our eastern empire Hindu law, Mahommedan law, Parsee law, English law,
                    perpetually mingling with each other, and disturbing each other; varying with
                    the person, varying with the place. In one and the same cause the process and
                    pleadings arc in the fashion of one nation; the judgment is according to the
                    laws of another. An issue is evolved according to the rules of Westminster, and
                    decided according to those of Benares. The only Mahommedan book in the nature of
                    a code is the Koran; the only Hindu book the Institutes. Everybody who knows
                    those books, knows that they provide for a very small part of the cases which
                    must arise in every community. All beyond them is comment and tradition. Our
                    regulations in civil matters do not define rights; they merely establish
                    remedies. If a point of Hindu law arises, the judge calls on the Pundit for an
                    opinion. If a point of Mahommedan law arises, the judge applies to the Cauzee.
                    What the integrity of these functionaries is, we may learn from Sir William
                    Jones. That eminent man declared, that he could not answer it to his conscience
                    to decide any point of law on the faith of a Hindu expositor. Sir Thomas Strange
                    confirms this declaration. Even if there were no suspicion of corruption on the
                    part of the interpreters of the law, the science which they profess is m such a
                    state of confusion, that no reliance can be placed on their answers. Sir Francis
                    Macnaghten tells us, that it is a delusion to fancy that there is any known and
                    fixed law under which the Hindu people live; that texts may be produced on any
                    side of any question; that expositors, equal in authority, perpetually
                    contradict each other; that the obsolete law is perpetually confounded with the
                    law actually in force; and that the first lesson to be impressed on a
                    functionary who has to administer Hindu law is, that it is vain to think of
                    extracting certainty from the books of the jurists. The consequence is, that in
                    practice the decisions of the tribunals are altogether arbitrary. What is
                    administered is not law, but a kind of rude and capricious equity. I asked an
                    able and excellent judge lately returned from India, how one of our Zillah
                    courts would decide several legal questions of great importance, questions not
                    involving considerations of religion or of caste, mere questions of commercial
                    law. He told me that it was a mere lottery. He knew how he himself should decide
                    them, but he knew nothing more. I asked a most distinguished civil servant of
                    the company, with reference to the clause in this act abolishing slavery,
                    whether at present, if a dancing-girl ran away from her master, the judge would
                    force her to go back? ‘ Some judges,’</p>
                <p>he said, ‘ send a girl back; others set her at liberty. The whole is a mere
                    matter of chance. Every thing depends on the temper of the individual judge.
                    Even in this country we have had complaints of judge-made law; even in this
                    country, where the standard of morality is higher than in almost any other part
                    of the world—where, during several generations, not one depositary of our legal
                    traditions has incurred the suspicion of personal corruption—where there are
                    popular institutions—where every decision is watched by a shrewd and learned
                    audience—where there is an intelligent and observant public—where every
                    remarkable ease is fully reported in a hundred newspapers—where, in short, there
                    is every thing which can mitigate the evils of such a system. But judge-made
                    law, where there is an absolute government and a lax morality—where there is no
                    bar and no public —is a curse and a scandal not to be endured. It is time that
                    the magistrate should know what law he is to administer; that the subject should
                    know under what law he is to live. We do not mean that all the people of India
                    should live under the same law: far from it: there is not a word in the bill
                    susceptiblc of such an interpretation. We know how desirable that object is; but
                    we also know that it is unattainable. We know that respect must be paid to
                    feelings generated-by differences of religion, of nation, and of caste. Much, I
                    am persuaded, may be done to assimilate the different systems of law, without
                    wounding those feelings. But, whether we assimilate those systems or not, let us
                    ascertain them, let us digest them. We propose no rash innovation; we wish to
                    give no shock to the prejudices of any part of our subjects. Our principle is
                    simply this: uniformity where you can have it—diversity" where you must have
                    it—but in all eases certainty. As I believe that India stands more in need of a
                    code than any other country in the world, I believe also that there it no
                    country on which that great benefit can more easily be conferred. A eode is
                    almost the only blessing—perhaps it is the only blessing —which absolute
                    governments are better fitted to confer on a nation than popular governments.
                    The work of digesting a vast and artificial system of unwritten jurisprudence is
                    far more easily performed, and far better performed, by few minds than by
                    many—by a Napoleon than by a chamber of deputies and a chamber of peers—by a
                    government like that of Prussia or Denmark, than by a government like that of
                    England. A quiet knot of two or three veteran jurists is an infinitely better
                    machinery for such a purpose than a large popular assembly, divided, as such
                    assemblies almost always are, into adverse factions. This seems to me,
                    therefore, to be precisely that point of time at which the advantage of a
                    complete written code of laws may most easily be conferred on India. It is a
                    work which cannot be well performed in an age of barbarism—which cannot, without
                    great difficulty, be performed in an age of freedom. It is the work which
                    especially belongs to a government like that of India— to an enlightened and
                    paternal despotism.”</p>

                    discussions from the reign of Elizabeth down almost to the present time.</p>
                <p>On tracing the course which the English parliament has followed with regard to
                    the defects of English law, its course will be found to have hitherto been
                    marked by its habitual reluctance to great changes. Law-reformers need not
                    shrink from discussion. But, owing to the prevalence of apprehensions and
                    jealousies, and from a weak subservience to personal interests, many of our most
                    useful reforms have been hitherto introduced and passed with as little noise as
                    possible. In point of fact, therefore, English codification, whilst it has taken
                    place to a considerable extent, has only been partial. Some of its experiments
                    have been confined to a mere consolidation and amendment of concurrent or
                    conflicting statutes; others have, by adding the incorporation and revision of
                    the corresponding portion of the common law, gone the whole length of
                    codification on particular subjects. This is admitted, and even approved of,
                    both by Mr Reddie and Sir Edward Sugden; on which Mr Humphreys naturally
                    observes: “Whether the result be termed a code, or be an act, or a series of
                    acts, to amend and consolidate the laws in question, is a mere question of
                    words. Many of our present reforming and consolidating acts, for instance those
                    relating to the customs and the excise, to crimes against property, to trustees
                    and mortgagees under legal disabilities, to bankrupts, to insolvent debtors, are
                    all in effect distinct parts of a code; correcting and embodying all prior laws
                    and rules, whether statutory, judicial, or textuary, on the same subject.” The
                    necessity of such a revision, and the mode of making it, are amongst the
                    different matters submitted to the several commissions appointed of late years
                    for inquiring into the different departments of the English law. Important parts
                    of the law of real property will be shortly comprised in express legislative
                    provisions under the recommendation of the real property commission. It is true,
                    that the amendments of the criminal law, brought in under the sanction of Sir
                    Robert Peel, are chiefly examples of the process of statutory consolidation
                    only. But the present commissioners on the criminal law have closed their first
                    Report (1834, p. 35) with a strong opinion that “the combination of a digest of
                    the statute law with that of the common law, into one body of criminal law, is a
                    measure which will tend greatly to the improvement of the jurisprudence of the
                    country. In support of our views upon this subject,” they add, “we may observe,
                    that the definitions of crimes, the nature of punishments, and the forms of
                    criminal procedure, originated, for the most part, in common-law principles. But
                    most of the unwritten rules touching crimes have been modified by acts of the
                    legislature, which assume the terms and definitions of the common law. And thus
                    it happens that the language in which these acts are expressed, and the subjects
                    to which they refer, are commonly unintelligible without a knowledge of the
                    common law. The actual law in regard to any particular offence lies partly in
                    the statutes, and partly in the reports and text-books. A reference to a single
                    instance may be sufficient to illustrate our meaning. A modern statute makes it
                    essential to the statutory offence, that it does not amount to an offence at
                    common law, and thus the common-law description of the offence must be referred
                    to for the purpose of ascertaining the limits of the statutory offence. As one
                    digest, therefore, would be imperfect without the other, this seems to be a
                    sufficient reason for uniting them. But it may be further urged, that most of
                    the advantages which may be expected to be derived from a consolidation of the
                    statute law will be attained by combining the two digests into one body of
                    criminal law; and, in particular, the size of a joint digest would be much more
                    compendious than that of two separate digests, and, what is still more
                    essential, the means afforded by methodical arrangement, and by the context, for
                    construing the intention of the legislature with certainty and precision, would,
                    if the two digests were united, be greatly increased.”</p>
                <p>The above Report was accompanied by a digest of the common law of theft. It is
                    given as a specimen of what may be accomplished in the case of an offence, the
                    decisions upon which are more technical, complicated, and confused than any
                    other portion of the English criminal law. But the public and the profession
                    will soon have the means of judging with greater precision how far this
                    encouraging expectation is likely to be realized. For, on alluding to the
                    subject in the following year, in their Report on the general question of the
                    propriety of a consolidation of all the statutes, civil as well as criminal,
                    they state that they had already made considerable progress “in forming a digest
                    of the criminal law, as well unwritten as written, into one statute, with such
                    partial alterations as might be considered to be necessary or expedient for more
                    simply and completely defining crimes and punishments, and for the more
                    effectual administration of criminal justice.” The criminal digest, although it
                    will be the first executed, can only be meant to be a beginning. The example
                    will do much. But, independently of the example, their general recommendation in
                    favour of a statutory incorporation comprehends every case where statute law and
                    common law are mixed up together. It can never be intended to do any thing so
                    anomalous as stop here; as it were solely for the purpose of excluding from the
                    national code that small remainder of the common law, with which it may have
                    happened that no legislative enactments had ever interfered. They mention three
                    plans. The first suggests a mere redaction of existing statutes, by clearing
                    them of whatever in form or in substance is superfluous or obsolete. The second
                    plan proposes to go a step further, and, by consolidation and classification, to
                    bring the whole statute law into a systematic form. But the last goes further
                    still, and advises that, wherever judicial decisions have altered the natural
                    meaning of the words of an enactment, the enactment itself should be forthwith
                    verbally corrected, so as to make its apparent import cor» respond with its
                    legal effect. On this, their final recommendation, they observe that “no plan of
                    reformation short of remodelling the statute law on the third principle proposed
                    will be co-extensive with existing evils; but that whilst such a reform would be
                    highly desirable, and is in their opinion practicable, its execution would be
                    difficult, would require the greatest caution, and occupy a considerable portion
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> time.” These are vigorous resolutions; and if once
                    duly acted on, the English legislature will soon recover whatever ground it may
                    have lost.</p>
                <p>The above statement comprehends nearly all that England has yet performed in
                    parliament upon this subject. Before passing on to the next point, namely, what
                    she has projected, it is proper, in connection with this part of the case, and
                    almost as a portion of it, to notice what the American legislatures have been
                    doing. Their principal legal materials are so nearly identical with, and their
                    circumstances for this purpose so similar to our own, that the question of
                    codification is substantially the same question in both countries.</p>
                <p>America, during her short political career, has proceeded in this great
                    undertaking with a remarkable union of zeal and caution. Mr Livingstone had
                    comparatively easy work in Louisiana, which stands alone in this respect. The
                    civil law on which he had to work was already sys∙</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193203836" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3836-0187"/>
                <p>tematized; and the Code Napoleon was, <hi rend="italic">mutatis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mutandis,</hi> ready to his hand. The committee appointed to
                    revise the statutes of New York brings us on English ground. It published, as
                    early as the year 1827, an analysis of a portion of their labours. The charge
                    committed to them was limited to the statute law. But they seem to have
                    considered that they could perform this limited duty very imperfectly, unless
                    they also included in their operation the interpretations which the courts of
                    justice had put upon the statutes. This precedent appears to be precisely that
                    which the English commissioners have since adopted, as far as they have gone.
                    The following passage will explain the views taken at New York. “In attaining
                    the object prescribed to us, to collect together the various provisions on the
                    same subject, to introduce, in their proper places, the successive alterations
                    which had from time to time been made by the legislature, it was obviously
                    impossible to preserve the original language of the statute which was amended,
                    and of the amendments. Parts of sectionshave been repealed and qualified, and an
                    amendment had again been amended. Enactments are frequently contained in <hi
                    rend="italic">provisos,</hi> and, in the haste with which statutes are often
                    drawn, the language frequently does not express the precise intent, or expresses
                    more than was intended. In these cases, changes in phraseology were unavoidable.
                    In other cases it became necessary to break up sections containing provisions on
                    distinct subjects, or containing complicated and voluminous details and
                    provisos, in order to distribute them in their proper places, and to arrange
                    them in a natural order. This also unavoidably produced a change in the
                    language. Some statutes which were passed in different years in England,
                    explaining or amending others which preceded them, have been copied into our
                    volumes, with the original acts which were the subjects of amendment, in the
                    very language which had required subsequent legislation. In the same manner,
                    later statutes, which were intended to include prior acts, have been retained
                    with the acts so included. In some instances, by the omission of <hi
                    rend="italic">preambles,</hi> a different meaning was given to the statutes. In
                    these cases great changes were indispensable. We have not been able to
                    understand why the language of the written law should defy all attempt at
                    improvement, more than the language of any other science, or upon any other
                    subject. It must be susceptible of emendation, by undergoing the process which
                    improves every other production of human skill; and more especially when new
                    interests and new wants arise, which it was not originally intended to embrace.
                    Still, whenever it was practicable, and consistent with the general plan of the
                    revision, we have preferred to retain the important words of the present
                    statutes, unless they have received a settled construction, which would not at
                    once occur to an attentive reader. In these cases the language of the courts has
                    been substituted, whenever it appeared ‘ more plain and easy to be understood.’
                    In doing so, and in expressing the supposed meaning of various statutes, we have
                    been guided by the decisions of the chancellors and judges of our state, under
                    whose examination almost every statute embraced in this part has at intervals
                    been brought. Those decisions form a body of practical .construction and
                    exposition, as honourable to those who made them, as they have been useful.
                    Their utility will be consummated by transferring them into the very body of the
                    statute which they illustrate and explain. And it is one of the results of the
                    arrangement adopted, which gives us the greatest satisfaction, that it has
                    enabled us to incorporate with the law the expositions it has received, and thus
                    communicate directly to those who examine the statutes, for information and
                    government, their sense and intent, as understood by the events. For forty years
                    our statutes have been the subject of professional criticism and judicial
                    exposition. For centuries those borrowed from England have been, in like manner,
                    illustrated and expounded. If at this time a knowledge of their meaning and of
                    their defects has not been attained, it probably never can be acquired. But it
                    is believed that a meaning has been affixed to them, that their discrepancies
                    and incongruities have been ascertained, and that industry and care only are
                    necessary to comprehend that meaning, and to be apprised of those defects. It
                    will, therefore, not be a difficult task to determine whether we have or have
                    not faithfully rendered the existing law whenever we have professed to do so,
                    and whether the imperfections we have supposed to exist are not such, and
                    whether the suggested alterations are or are not necessary and expedient.” The
                    Report in the same year, 1827, of the Committee of South Carolina, in favour of
                    a code of the statute and common law, was thought so convincing, that it
                    overcame the previous scruples of their legislature, and its execution was
                    afterwards directed. Mr Wilson’s speech must have done much towards converting
                    all whom argument was calculated to convince. According to his recommendation,
                    the common law will be left in the extended form of a digest, instead of being
                    compressed into precise enactments. He sees, like Bacon, a stronger objection to
                    touching the form or language of the common law, than is felt by his
                    professional brethren, the commissioners consulted in England or in New York. It
                    cannot now be long before the two systems, as respectively proposed in New York
                    and in South Carolina, are at work. The old English system remains undisturbed
                    in the other states. Three several methods will therefore be then going on
                    together under nearly similar circumstances. In each instance their practical
                    effect must accordingly be soon observed. Considering the premeditation with
                    which the English legislature proceeds, there can be little doubt but that some
                    definite results, nearly decisive one way or the other, as to the obstacles
                    which the peculiarities of the common law are supposed by some people to
                    interpose in the way of codification, will thus have been arrived at in the
                    United States, before it can be expected that the recommendation of the English
                    commissioners shall come to be acted upon in England. The following is an
                    apposite extract from Mr Wilson’s speech: “I would, in the first place,
                    recommend a general and careful classification of the whole statute law, which
                    should be printed and put in the hands of the citizens, with a well-digested
                    index. All acts of a homogeneous nature should be reduced to one act, with
                    reference in the marginal notes to the statute from whence it is taken. The
                    verbose jargon of the acts should be reduced to precise and definite terms. The
                    division should be into chapters and sections, so that a reference to any
                    particular act, or part of an act, would be rendered easy. Immediately after the
                    acts, should be noted the decisions of our courts upon them respectively, and
                    the point ruled should be set down in plain and direct terms, and the point
                    ruled only. So much of the common law as relates to the subject of any
                    particular division, should follow in the nature of a digest. If this plan was
                    well executed, a great deal would be gained. I would require the judges, when
                    any new case arose which was not provided for by the laws, to give it the best
                    determination in their power, which decision should be the law of that case; but
                    it should be their duty to report the case to the succeeding legislature, so
                    that a law might be enacted to meet future cases of the like kind. Thus, if the
                    representatives of the people were true to their trust, they would be enabled to
                    keep the laws <hi rend="italic">in pari passu</hi> with judicial legislation. It
                    is a fact, not to be resisted, that the judges make more laws than the
                    legislature, notwithstanding the inhibition of the constitution, which specially
                    requires that the three great co-ordinate branches of the government should be
                    kept for ever distinct. I do not think it would be well, and certainly <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193203849" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3849-0188"/> very difficult,
                    to break up the common law into legislative enactments. Lord Bacon has said,
                    that the work which he propounded, ‘ tendeth to pruning and grafting the law,
                    and not to ploughing it up and planting it again: for such a remove he held,
                    indeed, for a perilous innovation.’ I agree entirely with this opinion. No
                    legislative reconstruction of the common law should be attempted, nor would it
                    be requisite. When the digest of it should be made and settled, the statutes
                    classed and purged of their verbosity, contradictions, and uncertainties, a
                    short enactment declaring the code to be the law of the land, as well with
                    respect to the common as the statute law therein contained, would be
                    all-sufficient. Thus, afterwards weeding out all the cumbrous references which,
                    however useful now, as vouchers indicating the authentic sources of the text,
                    would become useless when the text should be established as authentic in its own
                    right; after settling the disputed points, by declaratory or explanatory
                    enactments; and after constituting the digest in its own natural miscellaneous
                    style, it would be practically found to answer every useful purpose of municipal
                    law, better than the most copious enactments. Whoever undertakes the work must
                    guard against the omission of any obscure or straggling rule, enactment, or
                    decision, in any stage of the work. He should take care not only that each
                    enactment, rule, and decision, be included, but that it be inserted in <hi
                    rend="italic">every</hi> division with which it can properly be deemed to
                    connect itself. In the index, which will accompany each process of the work, the
                    reference to every topic should be registered, not <hi rend="italic">merely</hi>
                    under <hi rend="italic">one</hi> appropriate title, but under <hi rend="italic"
                    >all</hi> the titles under which it could reasonably be sought. The marginal
                    abstracts in each enactment, or other article, should be constructed in such a
                    manner as to give to each word its appropriate sense and proportionate value

                    particular article so abstracted or analysed may relate. 1 have thus briefly
                    stated my views of the plan of a code, and suggested some rules to be observed
                    in carrying the plan into effect. I hope I have satisfactorily established the
                    following points:</p>
                <p>“1. That our laws are in that crude and indigested state, that they are a mystery
                    to all but those of the profession.</p>
                <p>“2. That every nation, in its progress to civilization, has acknowledged the
                    propriety and necessity of reducing its laws to the form of a code.</p>
                <p>“3. That the practicability of doing this has been established by every people
                    that have attempted it.</p>
                <p>“4. That it is imperative upon the legislative authority to reduce the law to
                    writing, and, when so reduced to a code, to promulgate it in a way so public
                    that every inquiring citizen may know it.</p>
                <p>“5. That to punish the infraction of an unknown law, which no ordinary diligence
                    or foresight could have acquired, is against the dictates of common sense, as
                    well as revelation.</p>
                <p>“6. That much of the common law of England made of force here, partakes largely
                    of the ignorance and superstition of the age that produced it, and should be
                    abolished by legislative authority.”</p>
                <p>The next stage in the history of English law reform brings us to the schemes or
                    approximations towards a code, which have been at different periods
                    unsuccessfully debated in the English legislature. From the reign of Elizabeth
                    unto the present day, parliament has never lost sight of the necessity of an
                    amendment of the law more or less extensive. Subject to two exceptions, it,
                    however, never carried its views beyond a revision of the statutes. These
                    exceptions are the criticisms of James I. on the common law, in his speeches at
                    Whitehall in 1607 and 1609; and the directions submitted to the committees which
                    were appointed in the years 1652 and 1653, during the Commonwealth. James,
                    coming from the more liberal and scientific system which Scotland had borrowed
                    from the civilians, and, moreover, a scholar of extensive reading, was naturally
                    shocked at the pedantry, meagreness, and looseness, in which he found the legal
                    system, if it could be so called, of his new kingdom. It was his favourite wish
                    to assimilate, as much' as possible, the laws of England and Scotland; a wish
                    since indulged in by Lord Hardwicke and Lord Kames, but equally in vain. If
                    James had succeeded, the project could have been accomplished only by means of a
                    code. The first of the Commonwealth committees was instructed to report
                    generally upon the inconveniences of the law; the second, to consider of a new
                    model or body of it. The first committee, of which Sir Matthew Hale was a
                    member, reported a revised system of law to the house within the year. But it is
                    plain, from the shortness of the time taken, that it can have been nothing more
                    than asketch; perhaps detailing the general views contained both in his preface
                    to Rolle, and in his considerations touching the amendment of the law, which
                    have since been printed by Mr Hargrave. If the system thus reported had been, as
                    Mr Cooper has described it in his Letters on the Court of Chancery (p. 153,
                    note), <hi rend="italic">un</hi><hi rend="italic">livre</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >qui contenait un système complet des lois,</hi> it seems impossible that a work
                    of this importance, from the hands of Hale, Cooper, and Rushworth, should have
                    been lost. The reverence which from the first gathered around the name of Hale,
                    and which has since faithfully abidedbyit, would have prevented such a result.
                    Cromwell attributed his failure, as Ludlow has recorded, and as Mr Bentham
                    rejoices in repeating, to a conspiracy amongst the lawyers, the sons of Zeruiah.
                    But Ludlow was politician enough probably to be well aware of the real reason
                    why “a reformation of the laws was so much desired by those then in power, and,
                    on the other side, as industriously and warily <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>
                    declined and shifted off' by many good and knowing men that were respected in
                    those times.” At all events, Mr Bentham might have learned it in Hale’s fourth
                    chapter “on some things necessarily to be premised, touching the matter, the
                    manner, the persons, and the season of public undertaking for a reformation of
                    the laws.” And Mr Cooper would have found there the utmost extent to which any
                    parliamentary report or system subscribed to by Hale at that period could
                    possibly have gone. “The things desired were many of them for the matter good;
                    but the end and design, and the state and condition of things, would not allow
                    of such an undertaking. And therefore those that were solicited to undertake
                    that business rather chose to propound such things only to be done as might be
                    done by the power of courts of justice, but declined whatsoever required a new
                    law to authenticate it.” Lord Colchester, in a Report to the House of Commons on
                    temporary and expiring laws, as early as 1796, set forth at length a long array
                    of the several ineffectual attempts which had been made by parliament, year
                    after year, towards a revisal of the statutes. The narrative has been
                    subsequently copied into almost every publication directed to this object. The
                    fail* ure cannot in fairness be laid at the door of the lawyers.^ As a body,
                    they have been amongst the loudest to complain of the evil of the present
                    system. But, doing so, they would have performed this duty very imperfectly if
                    they had not equally protested against the quackery of insufficient remedies.
                    The cause of the delay which has taken place is sufficiently obvious. In the
                    successful commencement made by the professional commission at last appointed,
                    the grounds of the failure of all former schemes for consolidating the law is at
                    once explained. Parliament is really incompetent to the task. Nevertheless, it
                    would never before, except during the commonwealth, intrust the task to a
                    separate and permanent commission, capable of doing for it that which it was
                    incapable of doing <pb break="no" facs="nls:193203862"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-3862-0189"/>for itself. If James I. could have taken as wise
                    and prudent a course for the law of man as he took with the law of God (see his
                    Letter, in 1604, to the archbishop, for the naming of fifty-four learned persons
                    to translate the Bible), he might have identified his reign with another lasting
                    service to the kingdom. At all events, if the work had been so completed,
                    government would have set an example such as the public is entitled to expect
                    from its superior station. It is true, the work might have been łfterwards
                    thrown aside. This has been the case with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >reformatio</hi><hi rend="italic">legum ecclesiasticarum,</hi> the code of which
                    was prepared even at a still earlier period. The labours of Cranmer and the
                    other commissioners who were appointed under 27 Hen. VIII. and 3 Edward VI. to
                    correct the canon law, have ever since been unaccountably neglected, both in and
                    out of parliament. The consequence is, that a great division of the English law,
                    which, properly authenticated and amended by the legislature, might have lived
                    and done the state some service, has lain, for upwards of two centuries, civilly
                    dead, and covered with the dust of contempt and oblivion. The same neglect
                    cannot produce the same consequences in the case of temporal laws. But it does
                    something of the sort; much more, from the silence with which it works, than
                    most people are aware.</p>
                <p>Thus much for the puny and abortive adventures, or rather the inroads, made into
                    this unknown territory by parliament itself. English legal literature has been a
                    little more active. This literature begins with Coke and Bacon, and it opens
                    with a demand for law reforms. James I. had, amongst other things, required that
                    there should be one plain penal statute, taking care not to repeal what had been
                    profitably woven into the common law. Of this, Lord Coke promised that, “God
                    willing, somewhat in due time shall be performed.” Yet Coke left it to be begun
                    upon by his successors, and they passed it on and on downwards to Sir Robert
                    Peel. The distinction by which Coke acknowledges, that, “to reduce the penal
                    laws into method and order were an honourable, profitable, and commendable work
                    for the whole commonwealth,” yet ιdds, “for the bringing the common law into a
                    better method, I doubt much the fruits of that labour,” is a distinction we do
                    not comprehend. It is a distinction the less intelligible in the person of Lord
                    Coke; since it is admitted by a vehement opponent of codification, that Coke’s
                    great work, “under the title of Reports, is in truth a most masterly and
                    powerful redaction of each head of law to which his reported cases bring him.”
                    In other words, it was “a bringing of so much of common law into a better
                    method.” The method and the service of this compilation were so universally
                    recognised, that Bacon, notwithstanding his personal enmity, bears witness that,
                    “to give every one his due, had it not been for these Reports, the law by this
                    time had been almost like a ship without ballast.” Lord Bacon was both a
                    philosopher and a lawyer. Great weight is deservedly attributed to his name,
                    wherever it can be enlisted on either side of any argument. From the pertinacity
                    with which the rival parties in this dispute have struggled to grace themselves
                    with his sanction, it might be inferred, that, if his authority be great, his
                    obscurity is still greater. This makes it necessary to examine, with some
                    minuteness, the evidence, as it exists, concerning his opinions. It is admitted
                    by the adversaries of codes, that his Aphorisms, taken by themselves, might
                    mislead superficial readers. But audacious codifiers are remanded, for an answer
                    to them, or an explanation of them, to the proposition made by him to James I.,
                    “touching the compiling and amendment of the laws.” The precise measures there
                    recommended, it is said, conclusively control the general expressions in his
                    Aphorisms. On a closer inspection, however,.it will be found that a comparison
                    between the two leads to no alteration in either. If it did, the rule that,
                    between two contradictory opinions, the latter abrogates the former, would
                    oblige us to enlarge the practical measures of the attorney-general of the year
                    1613 into conformity with the deliberate maxims of the ex-chancellor of the year
                    1623; for the Aphorisms were the later work, and were originally published by
                    him in 1623, as a portion of the first part of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Great</hi><hi rend="italic">Instauration</hi><hi rend="italic">of the
                    Sciences.</hi> Bacon never appears to have wavered as to the necessity of
                    something very like a code. It had been one of the first objects of his legal
                    Jife, and it was evidently a favourite object with him to the last. Towards the
                    close of the reign of Elizabeth, he thanks her Majesty “for having imparted to
                    him a purpose, for these many years infused into her breast, to enter into a
                    general amendment of the state of her laws, and to reduce them to more brevity
                    and certainty.” By way of contributing to this end, he inscribes to the queen a
                    selection of twenty-five out of three hundred maxims. He had set himself upon
                    extracting out of the books the essence as it were of the law, with a general
                    view to the amendment, “in some measure, of the very nature and complexion of
                    the whole law; since particular positive learnings of laws do easily decline
                    from a good temper of justice, if they be not rectified and governed by such
                    rules.” The Aphorisms also, although published, for the first time, towards the
                    close of his life, had been amongst the cherished meditations of his early
                    years. They are in truth the self-same supplements which, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Advancement of Learning,</hi> as far back as 1605, he had
                    promised, “having begun a work of this nature to propound hereafter.” So far
                    from their being in contradiction with the practical measures recommended by him
                    when attorney-general, the measures are applications, and almost translations,
                    of the greater part of them. It is thus shown, that the principles of his
                    Aphorisms must have lain by him, carefully treasured up, as rules to proceed by,
                    for many years. There can be no falser view of the conduct of the great father
                    of experimental philosophy on this occasion, than to suppose that he was a
                    lawreformer in the abstract only; or that his theory was one thing, and his
                    practice another. The measures actually proposed by him are such as, were they
                    to be agreed upon, would bring the dispute amongst reformers within narrow
                    limits. His plan, as laid before James I. is as follows. It consists of three
                    parts, Lŕ, a reforming and recompiling of the statute-law; 2cZ, a reducing and
                    perfecting of the course of the common law as contained in the reports; and,
                    2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> the further paternal office of certain introductive
                    and auxiliary books touching the study of the law. For the sake of civilians, he
                    has added in his Aphorisms a caution which, addressing a king of England, it
                    would have been superfluous to include in the above practical arrangements. The
                    English system has never acknowledged the direct authority of text writers.
                    Bacon was, however, well aware of the encroachments by which institutional or
                    legal literature had become <hi rend="italic">authentic</hi> in the civil law,
                    and also of the degree to which both legislative and judicial authority had been
                    thus seriously undermined. Accordingly, he provided against the occurrence or
                    continuance of the evil, in his seventy-eighth Aphorism. But there is further
                    evidence that this great man separated theory from detail as little in law as in
                    philosophy. In his old age, and after his disgrace, that is, contemporaneously
                    with the first publication of the Aphorisms, he was as anxious as ever for the
                    royal permission to realise their application at home. The renewal, at this
                    mournful period, of his offer to the king of a digest of the laws of England, is
                    at once a commentary on the permanence of his opinions, and a testimony of the
                    earnestness with which he held them. “I have commended them,”he says on this
                    occasion, “for the matter, but surely they ask <hi rend="italic">much amendment
                    for the form, which to reduce</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193203875"

                    the greatest dowries that can be conferred upon this kingdom!</hi> There is an
                    air of touching and melancholy self-reproach, joined to a consciousness of the
                    importance of the proposition which he was making, in his concluding words. One
                    could almost imagine that he was looking to this occasion as a providential
                    means by which he might indemnify his country for the scandal he had brought
                    upon its justice, and might redeem in some degree his own judicial fame, “Your
                    majesty is a great master in justice and judicature, and it were pity the fruit
                    of that your virtue should not be transmitted to the ages to come. Your majesty
                    also reigneth in learned times, the more (no doubt) in regard of your own
                    perfection in learning, and your patronage thereof; and it hath been the mishap
                    of works of this nature, that the less learned time hath (sometimes) wrought
                    upon the more learned, which now will not be so. As for myself, the law was my
                    profession, to which I am a debtor; some little helps I have of other arts,
                    which may give form to matter; and I have now (by God’s merciful chastisement,
                    and by his special providence) time and leisure to my talent, or half talent, or
                    what it is, to such exchanges as may perhaps exceed the interest of an active
                    life. Therefore, as in the beginning of my troubles, I made offer to your
                    majesty to take pains in the story of <hi rend="italic">Englaiid,</hi> and in
                    compiling a method and digest of your laws, so have I performed the first (which
                    rested but upon myself) in some part; and I do in all humbleness renew the offer
                    of this latter (which will require help and assistance) to your majesty, if it
                    shall stand with your good pleasure to employ my service therein.”</p>
                <p>The importance attributed, and justly, to the opinions of so extraordinary a man,
                    must be our excuse for going a little more into particulars, in order to show
                    that there is no opposition to be reconciled. Indeed, on the contrary, the
                    Aphorisms of Lord Verulam the philosopher, and the propositions of Sir Francis
                    Bacon the attorney-general, throw light upon each other, and must have been
                    meant to do so. The statute law is divided from the common law in the Proposal.
                    The two are separated in the same manner by Aphorism 61. The Proposal divides
                    the suggestions for the reformation and recompiling of the statute law into four
                    parts. These agree with Aphorisms 54, 60, and 78. The common law he emphatically
                    calls, in the Proposal, by way of distinction from the statutes, the laws of
                    England. The way “to reduce and recompile” them, he conceives, should be laid
                    down as follows: In the first place, he requires a full examination of the
                    judicial records, that they may be set down and registered (rarely <hi
                    rend="italic">in haec verba),</hi> so as to show in order of time, not by title,
                    the antiquities of the law. This recommendation coincides with Aphorisms 76, 86.
                    In the next place, he requires that there should be prepared a complete series
                    of the year books or reports from the time of Edward I. to this day, leaving out
                    all such cases as are obsolete, and all such points as are merely idle queries;
                    of identical cases, retaining those only which are best reported and argued,
                    specially noting what cases have been so long militant, that they must be
                    brought before the exchequer chamber or parliament to be set at rest; cutting
                    off from prolix cases all tautologies and impertinencies, and rectifying errors
                    by the record. These recommendations coincide with Aphorisms 60, 72, 73, 74, 75,
                    89, 91, and 92. A note subjoined to this part of his propositions shows to how
                    late a period he was zealously watching and preparing the necessary means for
                    carrying his scheme into execution. He observes, that, in order to secure
                    competent reporters, he had obtained of the king, <hi rend="italic">when he was
                    chancellor,</hi> the appointment of two grave and sound lawyers, with a stipend
                    of L.100 a year a piece. This constitution of reporters, he vainly hoped, was
                    thus “settled for all times.” These were Bacon’s amendments of the past, and his
                    provisions for the present. They might be expected to secure the future also, as
                    far as human prudence can secure it. But Bacon was not content with this.
                    Knowing the frailty of man, and the influence of the innovator time, Aphorisms
                    55, 56, 57, and 58, recommend, that, from every three to five years, parliament
                    should revise the jurisprudence which had been forming during the interim. For
                    this purpose, special commissioners are to examine into and report upon
                    contradictory decisions, under express directions not to seek out ingenious
                    distinctions for reconciling inconsistencies, so as, <hi rend="italic"
                    >omnia,</hi><hi rend="italic">ut loquuntur, salvare.</hi> These commissioners
                    are to be vested with the power, <hi rend="italic">ex officio,</hi> of clearing
                    away all obsolete laws, against which even courts of equity are to be authorized
                    to decree. It is a sign of Bacon’s good sense in the affairs of life, that he
                    did not embarrass the former measures of immediate urgency by adding this
                    ulterior recommendation to those enumerated in the Proposal. When the law had
                    once been reformed, it might have been introduced at any future time. Bacon’s
                    third object, —the official composition of auxiliary books conducive to the
                    study and science of the law,—was a distinct consideration, with which we need
                    not trouble ourselves at present.</p>
                <p>Now, the above statement proves two things beyond dispute. It proves, first, that
                    by Bacon’s plan, the statute law and the common law were to be kept distinct;
                    that each was to preserve its own ancient speech; and that, whilst he dared not
                    advise casting the law into a new mould, yet both statute law and common law
                    were to be alike consolidated, corrected, and arranged. It proves, secondly,
                    that the entire body and substance of the law, thus consolidated, corrected, and
                    arranged, should be authenticated as law by the express sanction of the state;
                    and that the successive jurisprudence of the country should be constantly kept
                    in order and in view, by being submitted to the legislature for revision at very
                    short periods. English law reformers are contending more for a shadow than for
                    the substance, who are not satisfied with this. Bacon expressly declares, that
                    he does not mean to enter on the general question, whether text law, meaning
                    thereby the articulate propositions of a statutory enactment, is or is not the
                    most advantageous form of legislation. “It is too long a business to debate,
                    whether <hi rend="italic">lex</hi><hi rend="italic">scripta, aut</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">non</hi><hi rend="italic">scripta,</hi> a text law, or customs
                    well registered, with received and approved grounds and maxims, and acts and
                    resolutions judicial from time to time, duly entered and reported, be the better
                    form of declaring and authorizing laws.” Neither codifiers nor anti-codifiers
                    can pretend, therefore, that they have any colour for conjecturing even what was
                    the opinion of Bacon as to the <hi rend="italic">general</hi> question of code
                    or no'code. His argument, in its most universal form, is <hi rend="italic"
                    >particular,</hi> and proceeds upon the dilemmas of a supposed complicated
                    system. But two points are sufficiently clear with regard to the particular case
                    of England. On the one hand, he held the new-moulding of the whole of its common
                    law to be a perilous innovation; and, on the other hand, he contemplated a
                    thorough reconstruction of its form. The method he proposed to employ for the
                    “reducing and recompiling” of the common law, was the very method of a
                    miscellaneous digest which has been lately recommended by Mr Wilson to the
                    people of South Carolina. The difference between the two methods is a difference
                    solely of arrangement. Bacon preferred an historical digest in order of time; Mr
                    Wilson prefers a logical one according to the order of the subjects.</p>
                <p>The late Mr Park objected that Bacon’s plan, if applicable to the wants of the
                    sixteenth century, was inapplicable to the wants of the nineteenth. The two
                    grounds on which this notion is founded, are equally singular. First, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193203888" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3888-0191"/> it is surmised
                    that the state of things which made a digest desirable in the age of Bacon, and
                    even of Hale, no longer exists; namely, a want of books in which the law is
                    exhibited with scientific coherence and development. The reign of James I. he
                    observes, knew only of two abridgments, those of Brooke and Fitzherbert. He
                    surely had forgotten the protests of Bacon, Coke, and Fleetwood, against
                    abridgments, or he would not suppose that they were likely to set a high value
                    on this department of our wealth. Only eleven treatises, he adds, were then to
                    be found in a lawyer’s library; whereas we have at least two hundred treatises
                    at present, some of them by writers of the highest ability and learning; for
                    instance, Fearne and Butler, Mr Preston and Sir Edward Sugden. The extent to
                    which Bacon would have allowed this statement to be an answer to any part of his
                    recommendation, supposing the works enumerated to be as good as possible, can be
                    carried no farther than this: We may dispense with the composition by authority
                    of auxiliary books, according to his third suggestion. That is all. The poverty
                    of their legal literature, and the superfluity of ours, are considerations
                    which, as far as they apply to the other suggestions—the only ones with which we
                    are now concerned—aggravate the comparative necessity of a code at present. For,
                    what was the real object which Bacon contemplated when he required that, in a
                    system as complex as that of England, the whole law, as law, should be put under
                    legislative sanction? He expresses it in the motto to the first title of his
                    Aphorisms, “<hi rend="italic">de prima</hi><hi rend="italic">dignitate
                    legum,</hi><hi rend="italic">ut sint certae."</hi> This title was the only title
                    that he finished; and, on summing up, he adds that he gave it <hi rend="italic"
                    >αd</hi><hi rend="italic">exemplum digesti reliqui quod meditamur.</hi>
                    Uncertainty, therefore, was in his eyes the great grievance to be removed, and
                    by means of a digest from out of all laws. At the close of the reign of
                    Elizabeth, he had previously declared, that “<hi rend="italic">the uncertainty
                    of law is the principal and most just</hi><hi rend="italic">challenge</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">that is made to the laics of our nation at this timed</hi> Can it
                    be said that things are in this respect any better at present? and that it is to
                    the number of its volunteer authors on this’ subject or on that, that the law of
                    England is indebted for scientific development and coherence? In spite of its
                    two hundred treatises, the uncertainty of the law, its inglorious uncertainty,
                    still· continues to be its reproach. In case of this being denied, we answer by
                    the celebrated reply which Lord Eldon made to the representation of the bar,
                    when they requested that he would not encumber his judgments by the declaration
                    of so many doubts. Mr Park’s second objection presumes, that a digest, if
                    useful, practicable, and economical, when the reported cases lay in the compass
                    of twenty-five volumes (their number when Bacon wrote), would be useless,
                    impracticable, and ruinously costly, when they amount to somewhere about four
                    hundred, as at present. The reader will judge for himself, whether Bacon would
                    not on this very account have held that the want of a digest of the common law
                    must be so much the more felt. The necessity for a digest of the reports, and
                    for a digest of the statutes, depends on the same cause; and in both cases it
                    must of course rise precisely in the same proportion with their voluminousness.
                    The work, it is true, will require greater pains. The cost would be once only.
                    Money advanced for a saving of time, of thought, and of error, is the best money
                    that can be laid out. But this last objection, as it was already made in Bacon’s
                    time, is one which we can reject in his own words, “Sciences must lead books,
                    not books sciences.”</p>
                <p>Half a century or thereabouts intervened between the propositions of Bacon and
                    those of Hale. Burnet does not notice Hale’s service during the commonwealth, on
                    the par-iamentary law commission. It had evidently been objected to him as an
                    undue compliance with the times; but how falsely, is proved by his own account
                    of his conduct as a commissioner. He verily believed, he says, owing to the very
                    great earnestness of those who had gotten the power into their hands, “that
                    anything which prudent and knowing men would have offered, might have been then
                    passed for the reformation of things amiss in the law.” This belief imposed a
                    consequent obligation upon him. He was bound to endeavour to recover for the
                    public similar advantages, as soon as the political reasons were removed, in
                    consequence of which, according to his own narrative, he had been accessory to
                    the obstructing of the law reforms in the promotion of which he was nominally
                    engaged. Hale was remarkable for the moderation of his opinions, for the
                    superstitious extent to which he reverenced prescriptive authority in
                    government, and for the unrivalled mastery which he possessed over all the
                    mysteries of legal learning. However, notwithstanding the apparent prevarication
                    incident to the awkward position in which he was placed, he was thoroughly
                    honest; and the language which he used after the restoration, proves that he
                    felt the obligation which he had incurred. “The very name,” he observes, “of
                    reformation and of reformer has begun to be a style of contempt and obloquy, so
                    that men are as fearful to be under the imputation of a reformer of the law, as
                    they would of the name of knave or fool or hypocrite; on which account its sages
                    dare not meddle with it, but let it live as long and as well as it can in the
                    state they find it. Only, to save their credit upon such occasions, they meddle
                    with some little inconsiderable things, as they set the price upon turnip and
                    carrot seed; but nothing is dared to be done of use and importance.” He proceeds
                    to excuse the generation immediately preceding for having left all schemes of
                    legal reformation untouched. But his excuse is coupled with a warning to his
                    contemporaries and their successors. “The truth is, that for the last forty
                    years, little hath been done of this kind: the times were tumultuous and not
                    seasonable for it: and indeed there is the more need, by reason of that
                    intermission and chasm, that somewhat of this kind should be done. Indeed it may
                    justly be feared, that if <hi rend="italic">something considerable</hi> for the
                    reformation of things amiss in the law be not done by knowing and judicious
                    persons, too much may some time or other be done by some, either out of envy at
                    the professors, or mistaken apprehensions or humours.” But little of this
                    “something considerable” has been yet performed. In law reforms the authority of
                    Hale in favour of really substantial changes is not and cannot be disputed. Our
                    present question is, In the execution of his reforms, how far, and in what
                    direction, would Hale have travelled towards a code? Are there sufficient means
                    of learning? What he would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> do, is abundantly evident,
                    both by his <hi rend="italic">Considerations touching the Amendment of Law,</hi>
                    and by his preface to Rolle’s <hi rend="italic">Abridgment.</hi> He would have
                    had nothing to do with anything tending to the alteration of the government;
                    nothing that would change the foundation or integral principle of the law;
                    nothing that, by depriving the common law of its particularity, fitted to almost
                    all particular occasions, would have left it to rest in generals. On the other
                    hand, he saw that it was the very nature of the body of the laws, as in the
                    rolling of a snowball, to increase in bulk in every age, till it became utterly
                    unmanageable. “Every age did retain somewhat of what was past, and somewhat of
                    its own, and so carried over the whole product to the quotient. And this
                    produceth mistakes. A man perchance usetlì one sort of conveyance, where he
                    should have used another. It breeds uncertainty and contradiction of opinion,
                    and that begets suits and expense. It must necessarily cause ignorance in the
                    professors, and profession itself, because the volumes of the law are not easy
                    to be mastered.” From the unfinished state of the fragment which Mr Hargrave
                    published, the whole extent and precise nature of the remedies<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193203901" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3901-0192"/> here contemplated by Hale
                    cannot be clearly ascertained; but Mr Hargrave adds in a note,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hargrave’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tracts,</hi> p. 275.</p></note> that there is on this subject another
                    manuscript of Lord Hale, which contains <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">a chapter on the boohs both of the statute and common law, with a
                    view to the reduction and digest of thenιT</hi> To this extent, therefore, the
                    advocates of a code, it seems, are warranted in appealing to the authority of
                    Hale. It is just what we should have expected from a paragraph in the preface to
                    Rolle, notwithstanding the attempt that has been made to narrow down its general
                    scope to the single object expressed in the· concluding words: <hi
                    rend="superscript"> α</hi> It were to be wished,” he says, “that some complete
                    <hi rend="italic">corpus communis juris</hi> were to be extracted for the
                    contracting of the laws into a narrower compass and method, at least for
                    ordinary study.” But that Hale had in view the use of the public in courts of
                    justice, as well as that of students in a lectureroom or at a special pleader’s
                    chambers, is sufficiently clear by his reference, in the preceding paragraph, to
                    the precedents of the compilation of the laws of Rome by Justinian, and of those
                    of Wales by Edward I.</p>
                <p>Latter times ought perhaps not to be harshly judged of for allowing a question,
                    which Bacon and Hale had been unable to bring to any practical conclusion, to go
                    quietly to sleep. At all events, it is no wonder that the law partook of the
                    general incapacity by which the eighteenth century will be known in English
                    history. It was one of those comfortable periods in which, wearied with
                    excitement or satiated with food, mankind seems sunk in a dose, and indisposed
                    to trouble itself with comprehensive views, or the exercise of original powers,
                    or the engaging in vigorous enterprises. Of all departments, the law is that in
                    which the spirit of routine has ordinarily and properly the most undisputed way.
                    The repose was far too profound in England to be interrupted by the various
                    experiments towards a code which, from one end of the Continent to the other,
                    were receiving the patronage of almost every sovereign in Europe. Savigny dates
                    from the year 1746 the continuous series of Prussian legislation. It began under
                    Cocceii with the Code Frederic in 1750. This led on in 1780 to the compilation
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Landrecht.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Landrecht</hi>
                    was promulgated in 1794, and appeared in a revised edition in 1803. The same
                    authority assigns to 1753 the first germ of the new Austrian legislation. It
                    passed through the ordeal of the reigns of Maria Teresa and of Joseph II. and
                    finally issued in the present <hi rend="italic">Gesetzbuch,</hi> which was
                    promulgated in 1811. During all this time Russia was equally busy, manufacturing
                    and remanufacturing the project which had been commenced as far back even as the
                    time of the father of Peter the Great. The Empress Catherine imagined, or
                    affected to imagine, that she could construct, by means of barbarous deputations
                    from distant provinces, a national legislation. The Emperors Alexander and
                    Nicholas have condescended to take up this splendid scheme as a part of their
                    imperial inheritance. Nicholas, we learn, promises his subjects a new code as
                    the fruits of his law commission <hi rend="italic">(Introduction by Μ. Dumont to
                    the Principles of Codification,</hi> 1828; <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi

                    Naples was so much the dupe of the first volume of the legislative romance of a
                    Russian code of perfect jurisprudence, as to predict, in 1785, that all the
                    inhabitants of Europe might some day receive their laws <hi rend="italic"

                    foreign panegyric Filangieri had probably in view (as was usual with Voltaire on
                    such occasions) an object nearer home. That object was to reproach his
                    fellow-citizens for the opposition which bad stifled the Codice Carolina of
                    Tanucci. Tanncci had been obliged to content himself with a much more scanty
                    reform than what he had wished to introduce. What he hoped that he had secured,
                    is comprised in a decree <hi rend="italic">Del Raggionamento</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">delle</hi><hi rend="italic">Sentenze,</hi> published in 1774. The
                    end contemplated by the decree was, as far as possible, to compel the old
                    materials to do the office of a code. For this end it was ordered that all suits
                    should be decided according to an express text of law; that, in case of any
                    ambiguity in a particular text, the judges should interpret it in such a manner
                    that the two premises of the judicial syllogism should be founded upon express
                    laws; that, when the legal argument could not be so framed, or the law was
                    altogether silent, the judges should .apply to the supreme power of the state
                    for assistance; that the authority of the doctors should be forthwith banished
                    from the tribunals; and that every judge should publicly deliver in writing the
                    grounds on which he founded his sentence. The argument published by Filangieri
                    in defence of this decree, at the age of twenty-two,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Filangieri, t. v. p. 346.</p></note> is, all
                    things considered, fully as remarkable a production as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Science of Legislation</hi> itself.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to guess whether these continental proceedings would have ever
                    attracted attention in England, but for the French revolution. The consequences
                    of that event, and of the exciting discussions on every thing connected with law
                    and politics which it provoked, were soon visible. It is true, that, for a time,
                    reform was by most official persons, and by a great part of the public,
                    considered as only another word for rebellion. But prejudices of this kind
                    necessarily pass away with the alarm. Meanwhile the arguments and the appeals,
                    the philosophy and the personalities, of Mr Bentham, began to attract the
                    admiration of a very intelligent portion of his country, although as yet
                    inconsiderable in point of numbers. They convinced some, and familiarised all,
                    to views on legislation of a much bolder and more original character than had
                    hitherto ever been presented by an English writer to the English public. It was
                    not till 1817 that his papers on codification were first published. Within a
                    year or two afterwards, they were themselves codified into French by Μ. Dumont.
                    The principles had been sufficiently declared in his earlier works. It was not
                    Mr Bentham’s fault that the world received from him principles only. He offered
                    his services as a codifier to America, Russia, Spain, and Portugal, in
                    succession. But, in cônsequence of his specific offers having been declined,
                    there is extant no plan of a regular code prepared by him, but what is far too
                    general to be of much use beyond the purposes of an outline. Of all Mr Bentham’s
                    professional disciples, the only one who has come forward with direct
                    propositions and specimens, is the late Mr Humphreys. In applying himself to the
                    law of real property, and in undertaking to ground it anew on the three titles
                    of enjoyment, transmission, and liability, he at once tried his strength with
                    the most difficult problem in the whole English system. The approbation
                    expressed in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> by Sir Samuel Romilly,
                    of Mr Bentham’s general views on codification, and the favourable opinion
                    expressed in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> by Mr Butler, of the
                    more special measures of Mr Humphreys, compose, in point of professional
                    authority, as strong a presumption, as practical men can ever expect to have, in
                    behalf of any theory seeking to be put upon its trial. The ablest papers on the
                    question will be found in the several numbers of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jurist.</hi> Mr Hammond has laboured only in the comparatively narrow field of
                    statutory consolidation; for instance, on the masses of criminal law contained
                    under the heads of forgery and game laws. Indeed the censure on written laws,
                    which he has prefixed to Sir David Evans’s collection of the statutes, is so
                    sweeping in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193203914" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3914-0193"
                    />its principle, that he can scarcely be reckoned amongst the advocates of
                    statutory enactment, much less amongst the advocates of codes. Mr Uniacke, on
                    more than one occasion, has recommended an entire redaction of the law, after
                    the manner of Domat; and, with the assistance of Mr Harrison, he has gone so far
                    as to lay before the public one or two specimens of his method, for example, the
                    chapter of evidence. Air Twiss appears to have adopted, as he certainly
                    enforced, in his <hi rend="italic">Enquiry into the means of consolidating and
                    digesting the Laws of England,</hi> that part of Mr Uniackc’s views which
                    relates to the correction of the very defective mode, both in arrangement and
                    phraseology, in which the common law and the statute law have hitherto expressed
                    their respective rules. However, suppose Mr Twiss to have to this extent lighted
                    his taper at his predecessor’s candle, what does the illumination amount to?
                    Merely to the suggesting, first, that, on digesting the common law, the leading
                    principles and general rules on each subject must be extracted and laid down,
                    with their reasons and diversities; next, that, wherever it can conveniently be
                    done, the general rule should comprise the particular cases which it affects;
                    but, where that cannot be attained, the particular cases should be placed in
                    supplemental sentences. A similar course is recommended for adoption on
                    consolidating the statute law. Instead of throwing all the particular cases into
                    one integral and necessarily involved rule, the general rule ought to be
                    extracted in a clear phrase by itself, and then a subsequent enumeration of the
                    cases which fall under it should be adjoined. These suggestions are such as Mr
                    Symonds would admit to be very reasonable. There is nothing in them, however, so
                    ingenious or characteristic as to make them the peculiar property of any
                    individual as their inventor. An inconceivable irritability seems to attach to
                    almost all writers who have meddled with the subject, whether as friends or as
                    foes. Otherwise, Mr Uniacke might have expected to accept gratefully a more
                    lucid and elegant exposition of his argument than he had given to it himself. Mr
                    Twiss expressly disclaimed any pretence to original invention. His particular
                    object was simply to present the respective measures which better authorities
                    had recommended, in such a consecutive order and relation, that each would be
                    complete and available in itself, independently of those others which might or
                    might not be executed after it. This he has done in a business-like sketch of
                    the scheme by which it might be best managed; and, next, by pointing out what
                    would be a proper constitution of the body which was to be intrusted with the
                    work. The present law-commission may probably think that their own body is as
                    well constituted for the purpose, as either the body proposed by Lord Stanhope
                    in 1816, or the one proposed by Mr Twiss in 1826. Nevertheless, it may be well
                    worth their considering whether it would not be advisable, in the execution of
                    their task, to proceed step by step; securing, first the classification, next
                    the consolidation, and lastly the re-enactment of the statutes previously
                    consolidated; and, secondly, proceeding, first to the classification of the
                    unenacted law, then to the digesting this with the former, and lastly to the
                    imposing the legislative authentication upon the whole. In this manner, let the
                    work proceed fast or slow, stop in the middle, or advance to its termination,
                    every movement must tell, and not an iota of the labour so expended will be
                    thrown away. We cannot dismiss this catalogue of names without expressing our
                    respect for the zeal and foresight of the private lawyers, who, notwithstanding
                    public indifference and public obloquy, have not feared to anticipate their age,
                    and sow the seeds of a harvest which posterity will reap.</p>
                <p>In England nobody has taκen a part in this discussion who has not admitted in the
                    most unqualified manner the absolute necessity of very considerable amendments
                    in the English law. To the legislative alteration of .certain defective
                    principles the late Mr Park was ready to consent: further, however, he could not
                    go. Acknowledging the evil of our judicial literature, and its inevitable
                    tendency to become worse and worse, he could not bring himself to adopt any of
                    the means by which codifiers seek to counteract it. AIr Cooper does not merely
                    allow, he insists that a great deal has to be done.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Lettres sur</hi><hi

                    for supposing that he would keep out of the crucible of reform, as needing no
                    amendment, a larger portion of the common law, than the most determined codifier
                    also might exclude. His quarrel with the codifier begins with the further
                    question, What are the most appropriate measures by which these necessary
                    amendments should be effected? On this point, however, we have nothing more
                    definite from Mr Cooper or from Mr Park than their contemptuous repudiation of a
                    code. They have not divulged their secret, nor breathed a syllable, enabling us
                    to judge of the character and efficiency of the reformatory measures which they
                    propose to be substituted instead. In case no other measures are devised, or
                    none which are adequate, what alternative remains for the English nation? We
                    have to choose between the state of the law as it exists before the code, and
                    the state of the law as it will exist after it, according to the best opinion we
                    can form of an untried future. In other words, we have to choose between the
                    suffering from the actual disorder, and the suffering from the proposed
                    operation. Competent persons differ in opinion, which way the balance inclines
                    at the present moment. It is certain, however, that a burden is daily
                    accumulating in the scale which represents .our actual system; a burden heavier
                    than our fathers have borne before us, and heavier than we or than our children
                    can ever bear. The crisis in the legal history of England, foreseen by Mr
                    Hallam, “when our laws, like those of Rome, must be cast into the crucible,” is
                    at hand. It is a responsibility which her statesmen and her lawyers may well be
                    excused for regarding with apprehension; but it is one for which, when it can no
                    longer be safely avoided, it is their duty honestly to prepare. The important
                    questions are, Is the time arrived? Are we equal to the occasion? How should it
                    be done?</p>
                <p>The objections mooted by Air Cooper and by Mr Park range at a wider distance.
                    Agreeing with the partisans of codes on the nature of the present evils, they
                    persist nevertheless in declining to entertain the question of a code. This
                    appears, therefore, to be the proper place for shortly stating the grounds of
                    their respective objections. They have paid considerable attention to the
                    subject, and have written upon it with much of learning, and still more of
                    warmth. Their writings, however, do not, if we properly understand them, contain
                    the proportion of well-directed and determinate reasoning which an argument of
                    this magnitude demands. Mr Cooper can scarcely expect that persons reading for
                    information would be satisfied by general assertions of the following
                    description. A code will plunge us in uncertainties; it will multiply
                    litigation; it will lower the price of land; it will put us back to the
                    condition of an infant people. Codes, instead of being called for by the people
                    at large, or instead of having been the result of free naticnal legislation,
                    have been almost always the gifts of despotic princes; codes are not wanted
                    since the multiplication of the copies of law-books at a reasonable price by
                    means of printing; parliament could never induce the best men to abandon the
                    more profitable employment of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193203927"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-3927-0194"/>the bench and of the bar, in order to take their
                    intellectual share in so very precarious an adventure, &amp;c. These are
                    dogmatisms, which, we candidly confess, go with us for very little; yet, we
                    hope, for all that they are really worth. But some of Mr Cooper’s letters
                    contain a great deal of very valuable instruction. We allude to the parts where
                    he endeavours to distinguish between the actual condition of law and society in
                    England and that of other countries, for the purpose of showing what may be the
                    comparative exigency for, and what the probable efficiency of, an English code;
                    again, when he points out the imperfections of the principal codes which have
                    hitherto been devised; but, above all, in his endeavours to reduce within
                    reasonable bounds the extravagant representations of what any code can possibly
                    effect towards restraining law-books and lawsuits in an intelligent and
                    flourishing society. Law reformers are not a kind of people to be charmed or
                    intimidated by declamation. Nevertheless, all whom he can have intended to
                    address would have been thankful for a complete and correct analysis of the
                    advantages and disadvantages, in general, of legislating by way of codes, as
                    compared with other systems of legislation. They would attentively listen to an
                    historical statement of the advantages and disadvantages which had been
                    practically experienced by particular countries on the adoption of codes. They
                    are also fully aware of the use of judicious prospective calculations. If a
                    similar balance-sheet, adapted to the case of England, had been thoughtfully
                    prepared for them, they would have carefully studied its probable results,
                    before permitting the experiment to be tried upon the existing elements of
                    English law, and in the atmosphere which surrounds it. Towards this, Mr Cooper
                    has done something; and so far he has done wisely and well.</p>
                <p>Mr Park, in his <hi rend="italic">Contreprojet to the Humphreysiam Code, and to
                    the projects of Redaction of Messrs Hammond, Uniache, and Twiss,</hi> took up a
                    position of his own. His circle appears a wide one; but it is in fact almost a
                    single point. He abstains from entering into the general discussion for or
                    against codes. He has been informed that Savigny had settled the general
                    question in the negative. The province to which he confines himself, is that of
                    showing that, whatever may become of the argument in other countries, the law of
                    England is a law of precedents, dependent upon established maxims and rules of
                    adjudication, and framed upon some peculiar principle of its own. He calls it
                    the principle of systematic coherence and dialectic deduceableness. To this
                    character he conceives codes or redactions must be alike fatal; for they must
                    equally (as he opines) withdraw the law as a science from the mastery of its
                    practitioners, and introduce a corresponding uncertainty into the decision of
                    its judges. We fully admit the judicial origin of the greater part of the
                    English law in times past. We even believe that the most important hints, and
                    perhaps the most important materials of law and legislation, must continue for
                    the future also to come out of courts of justice. Yet the question recurs, What
                    possible good can the public derive from the above theory of assumed coherent
                    principles, which the public cannot equally possess when the actually existing
                    law is transferred into a code? Mr Tyrrell observes, that a considerable shaking
                    of precedents must occur when principles are taken up and separated from their
                    context. We agree, that upon transplanting maxims, a little time will be wanted
                    before they take root kindly in the new soil prepared for them. But that is all.
                    Besides this temporary annoyance is different, in different systems. In some, a
                    single thread cannot be loosened but the whole web is ravelled up at once. In
                    others, the system has grown up piecemeal and in the dark: it has started
                    originally from no more comprehensive principle than the circumstances of the
                    moment: it has spread by individual accretion only: it is kept together by
                    cohesion rather than coherence. In this case, whatever principles and rules are
                    hammered out at last, or rise up under the moulding influence of time, they
                    exist there in so arbitrary and conventional a state, that the percentage of
                    temporary inconvenience which may accompany their removal to a more favourable
                    position must be cheaply purchased. If there are no principles and rules to be
                    discovered, whatever precautions may be taken in dealing with a mere chaos of
                    nominal authorities, is tenderness misplaced. But granting them to be in
                    existence and in operation, it is impossible to believe that they cannot do
                    their work as effectually in a code, as whilst they are scattered up and down in
                    the floating repository of voluminous reports. Of the two presumptions, which is
                    the more probable,—that the qualities of systematic coherency and dialectic
                    deduceableness will be the natural accompaniments of a system which branches out
                    from sound general principles, however originally derived, into plain didactic
                    regulations? or that they will be the artificial consequences of a fictitious
                    system, built upon an interminable series of specialties, called precedents;
                    especially when it is considered that the very element of case-law involves so
                    many points of variation, that, on any occasion, nobody can be sure that be is
                    not exercising his logic upon a different set of precedents, or upon those
                    specialties in the self-same precedent, which, after all, the judge may not
                    consider as properly applicable to the case? There are embodied in almost every
                    precedent, opposite analogies, with sundry hanging threads attached to them, any
                    one of which a judge, who is a little capricious, may lay hold of at his
                    pleasure.</p>
                <p>In regard to the English system, Mr Park considered himself unquestionably safe
                    upon ninety-five per cent, of the advice which he gave his clients. Mr Preston
                    informed him, that upon an inspection of his opinion-books for thirty-three
                    years, an average of not above three per cent, went on to judicial litigation.
                    Here, exclaims Mr Park, are 33,000 cases intercepted in their course towards the
                    tribunals. Now, we know why it is that codified France requires 5000 judges.
                    Before any such use, to the disadvantage of the Code Napoleon, can be made of
                    this closetcalculation, we must have before us the average of error and
                    litigation incident to the consultations of French lawyers of equal eminence. Mr
                    Park appears to imagine that there are no cases disposed of in this quiet way
                    under codes, and that the French tribunals are all occupied in dispatching what
                    English practice would have anticipated out of court. In trying the merits of
                    the question—code or no code—by experiment, the judicial systems for the
                    administration of each must be taken to be equally good; and the code must be
                    something steadier than “a heaving ocean of jurisprudential ethics?” If it be
                    answered, that the supposition of this inferiority in the judges and in the code
                    is a part of the case, there is no use in continuing the discussion, except to
                    say that the supposition is a pure assumption. It is one, too, as little
                    warranted by fact or probability, as the opposite theory of Mr Bentham, whose
                    delight it was to anticipate the golden age, when codification should have
                    deprived opinionists of their bread. The statistics of litigation in different
                    countries have as yet been far too imperfectly observed, to allow of our forming
                    even a guess as to what would be the result, in this respect, of a comparison
                    between France and England. We have no reason to believe that tlíe return would
                    be unfavourable to the working of the Code Napoleon. But the advocates of
                    codification in general, still less of English codification, are not bound to
                    put their case on the issue of any single comparison. The case of England is too
                    peculiar to be governed by the success or tailure of any of the codes of modern
                    Europe. The peculiarities, as they are acknowledged to prevail up to our own
                    times, are sufficiently striking. The testimony of Mr Park’s <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193203940" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3940-0195"/>favourite authority, Mr
                    Preston, is decisive upon a subject, too, which, above all others, has exercised
                    and exhausted for ages the learning of the English bar: although it seems,
                    nevertheless, that it had been little studied as a science. “Till a recent
                    period, the knowledge of this branch of the law (that of real property) had
                    received a very moderate share of attention as a science. The rules of property
                    were scattered in books on the subject of the laws in general...The knowledge of
                    these rules was not to be acquired with ease. Much perplexity and confusion must
                    have been experienced by the student, who, out of many disagreeing opinions
                    equally specious, was to collect the one best supported by principles; on whom
                    it was incumbent, from a number of particular cases, to propose to himself, or
                    to extract, a genera! rule, and to mark the cases which were not within the
                    reason or the scope of the rule. This was to be accomplished only by
                    discriminating the very minute circumstances, by which cases within the reason
                    of the rule were to be distinguished from those cases which were beyond or
                    beside that reason.” If this were the case, till very recently, with the most
                    elaborate and systematic part of the law, assuredly the doubt which sensible
                    persons will entertain, is not so much, whether a code upon this portion of the
                    law were wanting, as whether this particular portion were in a state ripe enough
                    to be incorporated into a code. It is trifling with men, after a statement of
                    this description, to tell them that the uncertainty is not in the law, but in
                    the method of discovering it; that method being the only one you have. When a
                    precedent is overruled, how is a suitor the better off for being told by
                    Blackstone that there has been no change in the law; but that all that has taken
                    place is, that an imposition has been unmasked, and a certain amount of
                    supposititious law displaced to make way for the rightful interpretation. The
                    law is a practical science. What can be that marvellous perfection which is
                    consistent with being obscure, unmanageable, and inaccessible? What would be
                    said of a musical instrument, which, from its size and complication, required a
                    Polyphemus to play upon it? In law, as in morals, there must be a mistake
                    somewhere, when what is called the theory is one thing, whilst the practice
                    turns out to be something else. The desire of anticipating every possible
                    exercise of discretion, through the instrumentality of refinements and
                    subtleties, and by means of an enormous magazine of case-law, only opens the
                    door to discretions of another class. We have admitted that there is a certain
                    inconvenience attending the most, necessary changes. On constructing a code, a
                    short intermediate period must elapse before it settles, as builders say. During
                    this interval, however, it is some compensation, that, even from the first, the
                    decisions will keep closer and closer to the merits; and that, according as the
                    doubtful points become gradually fixed, they will be fixed on foundations which
                    will not fail us. But Mr Preston says, that the law of real property has
                    latterly acquired the character of a science. Let us take his single treatise on
                    Merger. Its author calls it elementary. But it is considered as one of the most
                    profound books in an English law library; and one must hope, for the sake of the
                    English community, whether clients, practitioners, or students, that it is
                    justly considered so (or what is to become of them under such a system of
                    jurisprudence ?) when we are told by its author that the volume “contains at
                    least 3000 propositions on subjects of every day’s occurrence.” Whoever may be
                    called upon to codify the law of Merger, will owe much to Mr Preston. Books of
                    this class represent at the present lay the writings of the jurists of the third
                    century under the Roman law. They must at last have to be put to the same
                    honourable use. Their authors are our Ulpians and Papinians, preparing the way
                    for the Tribonian who is to come. Mr Hallam has said, that it will be a disgrace
                    to the nineteenth century if it should not produce one. We pray, then, for
                    better things.</p>
                <p>Does England mean, as the master and the maker of English law, to fall back into
                    the wake of the United States? If not, we may have no great time to lose. We
                    have already shown how far New York and South Carolina are in advance. But the
                    division of opinion upon this point, which exists in some quarters amongst our
                    transatlantic coparceners in the common law, as well as amongst ourselves, seems
                    with them to be more entirely a question of time, and not of principle, than is
                    yet the case in England. In the meanwhile, the turn which it has taken there,
                    appears to be both rapid and singular. It was only the other day that Mr Madison
                    scarcely thought the offer of a code from Mr Bentham worth the trouble of
                    acknowledging. The common law was a thing too sacred and tender to be touched.
                    But that delicacy is over. Law, framed as the common law has been framed, will
                    want reforming at some time. The only doubt is, whether lawyers of the years of
                    our Lord 1823, 1836, are born too late or too early for the Herculean task. Mr
                    Sampson has great merit for having taken the lead in disabusing his countrymen
                    of their blind idolatry of the common law. He proposed, in his discourse of
                    1823, an immediate revision of it. His view would seem to be, that nothing is to
                    be got by waiting till it gets worse. On the other hand, Mr Duponceau, in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on the Nature and Extent of the Jurisdiction of
                    the Courts of the United States,</hi> only begged of reformers, the year
                    afterwards, to have a little patience. If they refrained a little longer, the
                    judges would have substituted for the still remaining errors of these old
                    Sybilline books more solid principles of jurisprudence, and we should have a
                    common law worth codifying, “It is much better that things should remain as they
                    are until the common law shall, by successive improvements, have attained its
                    highest degree of perfection, and then it will be time to reduce its principal
                    provisions to a text; for the details must always be left to the sound
                    application of the principles of the system, as it is impossible for any
                    legislator to foresee all the cases that may possibly arise. I think, however,
                    that we are sufficiently ripe for a national system of <hi rend="italic"
                    >commercial law,</hi> and therefore I have ventured to express a hope, that
                    congress will exercise the powers which the constitution has given them upon
                    that subject.” The particular question of time was submitted in 1826 to Mr
                    Dupin. His answer, although diffident in form, is positive enough in substance.
                    “As to the precise point of whether your country is ripe for such a digest, I do
                    not undertake to decide it. I confess that, if our codes had been digested in
                    the fifteenth, or even in the sixteenth century, they would not have possessed
                    by any means the qualities which now recommend them. To produce them, it was
                    necessary that the labours of jurists, the decisions of magistrates, and the
                    experience of all classes, should have brought the science, as it were, to a
                    certainty. Are you yet arrived at this point? You can answer this better than I
                    can. I admit the force of the reason given by some of your adversaries, that a
                    badly made law would tie up the judges, and prevent them from improving the
                    system by degrees. But what are these improvements which they suppose must
                    result from the liberality and the wisdom of the judges, but the exercise of
                    arbitrary power? And is not this attended with most serious inconveniences?
                    Bacon has well said, <hi rend="italic">optima lex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >est</hi><hi rend="italic">quoe minimum</hi><hi rend="italic">relinquit arbitrio
                    judicis, optimus</hi><hi rend="italic">judex</hi><hi rend="italic">qui
                    minimum</hi><hi rend="italic">sibi.</hi> And yet there are persons in your
                    country who would wish the judges in reality to be legislators. Can your nation,
                    so enlightened in matters of politics and government, be only in arrear in
                    matters of civil and criminal law?” Under these circumstances, the scruples of
                    Mr Duponceau and his friends may perhaps be already over <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193203953" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3953-0196"/>come; for he has declared
                    that he thinks “the common law is susceptible of being carried to the highest
                    degree of perfection, and that he believes the honour of producing the result is
                    reserved to the jurists of the United States.” It is impossible, therefore, to
                    tell with what rapidity this process may be taking place, and when the
                    propitious hour may happen to arrive. English jurists have nothing to wait for
                    on either of these opposite suppositions. On the argument of Mr Sampson, they
                    ought not merely to be content, but to make good speed with their actual
                    materials for legislation. The rubbish gets deeper and deeper every year.
                    According to the expectation of Mr Duponceau, they have nothing to stay for. The
                    promised contributions to the perfection of our old vernacular jurisprudence are
                    not to come from us. Unless, therefore, we mean to wait for the American
                    Tribonian, we should do well, without more delay, to set about providing
                    ourselves with a Tribonian of our own.</p>
                <p>Mr Justice Story, in his <hi rend="italic">Discourse on the Past History, Present
                    State, and Future Prospects of the Law,</hi> delivered about the same period,
                    looks on the mother country more favourably. He admits her into partnership in
                    this heroic work. We cannot, therefore, do less than quote his advice. “The mass
                    of the law is accumulating with an almost incredible rapidity, and with this
                    accumulation the labour of the students, as well as professors, is seriously
                    augmenting. It is impossible not to look without some discouragement upon the
                    ponderous volumes which the next half century will add to the groaning shelves
                    of our jurists. The habits of generalization which will be acquired and
                    perfected by the liberal studies which I have ventured to recommend, will do
                    something to avert the fearful calamity which threatens us, of being buried
                    alive, not in the catacombs, but in the labyrinths of the law. I know, indeed,
                    but of one adequate remedy, and that is, <hi rend="italic">by a gradual digest,
                    under legislative authority, of those portions of our jurisprudence which, under
                    the forming hand of the judiciary, shall from time to time acquire scientific
                    accuracy.</hi> By thus reducing to a text the exact principles of the law, we
                    shall, in a great measure, get rid of the necessity of appealing to volumes
                    which contain jarring and discordant opinions; and thus we may pave the way to a
                    general code, which will present, in its positive and authoritative text, the
                    most material rules to guide the lawyer, the statesman, and the private citizen.
                    It is obvious that such a digest can apply only to the law, as it has been
                    applied to human concerns in past times; but, by revision at distant<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bacon says <hi rend="italic"
                    >short.</hi></p></note> periods, it may be made to reflect all the light which
                    intermediate decisions may have thrown upon our jurisprudence. To attempt more
                    than this, would be a hopeless labour, if not an absurd project. We ought not to
                    permit ourselves to indulge in the theoretical extravagancies of some
                    well-meaning philosophical jurists, who believe that all human concerns for the
                    future can be provided for in a code speaking a definite language. Sufficient
                    for us will be the achievement to reduce the past to order and certainty; and
                    that this is within our reach cannot be matter of doubtful speculation. It has
                    been already accomplished, in a manner so triumphant that no cavil has been able
                    to lessen the fame of the authors. The Pandects of Justinian, imperfect as they
                    are, from the haste in which they were compiled, are a monument of imperishable
                    glory to the wisdom of the age; and they gave to Rome, and to the civilized
                    world, a system of civil maxims which have not been excelled in usefulness and
                    equity. They superseded at once the immense collections of former times, and
                    left them to perish in oblivion; so that, of all ante-Justinianian
                    jurisprudence, little more remains than a few fragments, which are now and then
                    recovered from the dust and rubbish of antiquity, i∏ the <hi rend="italic"
                    >codices</hi><hi rend="italic">rescripti</hi> of some venerable libraries. The
                    modern code of France, embracing as it does the entire elements of her
                    jurisprudence, in the rights, duties, relations, and obligations of civil life;
                    the exposition of the rules of contracts of every sort, including commercial
                    contracts; the descent, distribution, and regulation of property; the definition
                    and punishment of crimes; the ordinary and extraordinary police of the country,
                    and the enumeration of the whole detail of the civil and criminal practice and
                    process; is perhaps the most finished and methodical treatise of law that the
                    world ever saw. This code forms also the law of Holland, and, with comparatively
                    few alterations, has been solemnly adopted as its fundamental law by the state
                    of Louisiana. The materials of it were to be sought for among an almost infinite
                    variety of provincial usages and customary laws, and were far more difficult to
                    reduce into system, than any which belong to the common law. It is left to the
                    future jurists of our country and England to accomplish for the common law what
                    has thus been so successfully demonstrated to be a practical problem in the
                    jurisprudence of other nations, a task which the modest but wonderful genius of
                    Sir William Jones did not scruple to believe to be within the reach of a single
                    mind successfully to accomplish.”</p>
                <p>Marvellous pains are taken, and with marvellous success, to make people
                    misunderstand each other, to exaggerate the importance of the minor points upon
                    which they differ, and to slur over or forget the far greater matters on which
                    they are agreed. From the way in which Mr Bentham’s adversaries represent or
                    rather misrepresent his opinions, their readers would not suspect him to have
                    stated that there are three stages of legislation, of which it is the last which
                    will terminate in a code. This view, or something extremely like it, is also
                    that entertained by Savigny. In the muster-roll of names, it is repeatedly
                    mentioned, that Thibaut, Feuerbach, Pfeiffer, Almendigin, Gonner, and others,
                    have written in favour of codification; Schlosser, Hugo Schrader, and others,
                    against it. We have had no opportunity of seeing the particular works alluded
                    to. But we comfort ourselves in our ignorance of the fact, by the probability
                    that the real bearing of their debate is confined to Germany; since this is
                    true, even in the instance of Savigny’s celebrated essay upon <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Vocation of our Age for Legislation and Jurisprudence.</hi> His very title
                    significantly fixes the object of the work. It is addressed to the present age.
                    This ought to have been enough to put honest readers upon their guard against
                    drawing conclusions beyond the intention of the author. On reading it, it is
                    plain that his general observations have a positive and limited reference, as
                    much as his special criticisms. By no possibility can they be reasonably applied
                    to any country but to one which is placed by its political circumstances, by the
                    character of its laws, and even by the state of its language, as well as of its
                    legal attainments, in the particular predicament which the whole of his argument
                    assumes. Μ. Meyer has inscribed to Mr Cooper a very able essay, which we have
                    -cited before for another purpose. We agree with him in the greater part of the
                    opinions which he has expressed, and altogether in the conclusions in favour of
                    codification at which he has arrived. But in criticising Savigny, he appears to
                    us, in attacking him, to have mistaken occasionally the extent of this admirable
                    scholar’s argument, equally almost with the English writers, who, without
                    discriminating very accurately their right to claim it, have sought for shelter
                    under his name. Savigny’s essay, at <pb break="no" facs="nls:193203966"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-3966-0197"/>the time it was published, was a political
                    pamphlet against the French. Prussia had just cleared her soil of their
                    bayonets, and her tribunals of their laws. Körner’s songs are not more the burst
                    of triumph from a soldier at their military emancipation, than Savigny’s pages
                    are the exulting gratulations of an enthusiastic lawyer on the recovery of his
                    country’s legal freedom. The work did∙and does infinite credit to his
                    patriotism. His statements, too, according to our understanding of them, we can
                    have no difficulty in taking upon his own authority. The inaptitude of Prussian
                    lawyers to legislate for themselves at present may be true to the letter.
                    Trained up under the minutiae of the <hi rend="italic">landreeht,</hi> it is
                    natural to expect that this should be the case. Meyer ought to have borne these
                    circumstances in mind; in which case, he would have made more allowance for the
                    local and temporary spirit in which the argument of the Prussian jurist is not
                    only conceived, but actually expressed. There are, however, essential
                    differences in the legal principles and the habits of these two writers, and in
                    their general drift of thought. Savigny is an ardent advocate of the historical
                    school of law; Meyer of the pragmatic. Savigny looks to the traditions from
                    which laws are derived; Meyer to the express sanction by which they are imposed.
                    But when Meyer says, that if the system of the historical school be well
                    founded, not only are written codes and positive legislations chimeras and
                    impossibilities, but every attempt to arrive at them must lead to serious
                    inconveniences, and adds, that Savigny thinks so too,— the observation is much
                    too sŵeepingly worded. With the exception of a few bitter sneers at France,
                    Savigny argues the case of Germany only. The single point he makes, is its
                    incapacity at present to frame a code of any real merit, owing to the defective
                    education of its lawyers, and the insufficiency of its language. His objection
                    includes every species of legislation and jurisprudence; and only specifies
                    codes in particular, because they are more prominent and arduous than the rest.
                    Instead of saying that a good code is universally impracticable, he says just
                    the contrary. Nay, he goes the length of saying, that by means of historical
                    law-schools, well conducted, Germany itself will become qualified to frame one.
                    But whether it would be prudent or not to do so; in other words, which system
                    would be preferable, that of enacted or unenacted laws; is a further point on
                    which, like Bacon, he abstains from intimating an opinion. It is no imputation
                    on Savigny to state that the essay was written under great political excitement,
                    and with the professed object of beating up a crusade against denationalization.
                    Under these circumstances, we feel that it is not presumptuous to surmise, that
                    if he could have honestly pronounced an opinion universally unfavourable to the
                    adoption of a code, he would not have withheld it.</p>
                <p>The following are the passages in which Savigny contemplates the euthanasia of
                    the historical school. The first regards the substance of the law, as it will
                    have been created by legal talent: “Let jurisprudence be once generally diffused
                    amongst the jurists, in the manner above mentioned, and we again possess, in the
                    legal profession, a subject for living customary law, consequently for real
                    improvement; the practice of our courts of justice is but a clumsy substitute
                    for this customary law, the practice of the law-faculties the clumsiest of all.
                    The historical matter of law, which now hems us in on all sides, will then be
                    brought under subjection, and constitute our wealth. We shall then possess a
                    truly national law, and a powerful expressive language will not be wanting to
                    it. We may then give up the Roman law to history, and we shall have, not merely
                    a feeble imitation of the Roman system, but a truly national and new system of
                    our own. We shall have reached somewhat higher than to a merely sure and speedy
                    administration of justice; that state of clear perceptiveness which is
                    ordinarily peculiar to the law of young nations, will be combined with the
                    height of scientific development. Then, too, may future degenerate times be
                    provided for, and then will be the time for considering whether this be done
                    best by codes or in another form. I do not say that this state of things will
                    ever arrive; this depends upon the combination of the rarest and most fortunate
                    circumstances. What we jurists can contribute towards it, is an openness to
                    conviction, and honest hearty co-operation.” The following passage regards the
                    language in which this substance is supposed to be enshrined and communicated:
                    “It has frequently been required that the code should be popular; and Thibaut
                    also once refers to the demand. Properly understood, this demand may be complied
                    with. For language, the most effective medium by which a communication of mind
                    can take place, also checks and limits this mental intercourse in many ways. The
                    best part of thought is frequently absorbed by this medium, in consequence of
                    the incapacity either of the speaker or the hearer. But, by natural ability or
                    art, this medium may be brought under such command, that neither sort of
                    incapacity is any longer an obstacle. The thought passes over the varying
                    characters and capacities of the listeners, and hits them in the common
                    intellectual centre point. Then is it that the high are satisfied, whilst all is
                    clear even to the low; both see the thought above them, in an elevated improving
                    point of view; and it is within the reach of both. Thus, there was somewhere a
                    miraculous image of Christ, which had the property of being a hand’s breadth
                    taller than the tallest man who might place himself beside it; were it a man of
                    moderate size, or a little man, that came, the difference was still the same,
                    never greater. This simple, truly popular style, is to be seen (to speak only of
                    our native literature) in our better sort of chronicles, but it may also appear
                    in many other forms. Should we once regain it, many an excellent thing will be
                    possible; amongst others, a good historical style, and, amongst others, a
                    popular code.” Savigny plainly states the real grounds of his objections to be,
                    not to a code <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> code, but to a code made by the present
                    contemporary generation, in consequence of their incompetency. “Thibaut sees the
                    cause of the evil in the sources of the law, and believes that they could remedy
                    it by a code. I, on the other hand, find it in ourselves, and believe, for this
                    very reason, that we are not qualified to frame one.” The conditions which he
                    requires for the purposes of composing a good system of law in any shape, are,
                    according to his account, all wanting in Prussia. The first condition is unity
                    of system. “To begin with the least important particular, let any man run over
                    in his mind a number of the jurists now living, and ask himself, whether the
                    existing law could be so much as systematized by their combined labours; he
                    would soon be convinced of the utter impossibility. But that a code is a much
                    greater work, and that a higher degree of organic unity must be required of it,
                    is what no one will deny. In reality, therefore, the code, if it is not to be a
                    mere lifeless, mechanical, and, consequently, worthless composition, could not
                    be framed by such a committee, but only by an individual: the others would only
                    be able to afford a subordinate description of aid, by communicating their
                    advice and opinions on the occurrence of particular doubts, or by exerting
                    themselves to purify the work when completed, by the detection of individual
                    defects. But whoever admits this, must, as regards the present age, despair of
                    the practicability of the proposal; for, to find that same individual the true
                    lawgiver, is perfectly impossible, because, by reason of the heterogeneous
                    character of the modes of thought and knowledge of our jurists, no individual
                    can be treated as the representative of the species.” The next condition is,
                    that laws, properly grounded and combined, must consist of leading axioms.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193203979" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3979-0198"/>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> ∙ <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> To distinguish
                    these, and deduce from them the internal connection and the precise degree of
                    affinity which subsist between all juridical notions and rules, is amongst the
                    most difficult of the problems of jurisprudence. Indeed, it is peculiarly this
                    which gives our labours the scientific character. If, then, the code be formed
                    in a time which is unequal to this art, the following evils are inevitable. In
                    the attempt at material completeness, particular decisions, unnoticed by the
                    framers, will be constantly crossing and contradicting each other, which will
                    gradually come to light by practice only, and, in the case of a bad
                    administration of justice, not even by that. This result would be clearly
                    inevitable, so far as contemporaries are concerned, were an age, without being
                    fully qualified, to fix its legal notions by legislative authority in this
                    manner; but the effect of it would be no less injurious to succeeding times.”
                    The last condition provides for the form of laws, and for the art of exposition
                    and of expression, whether it be brevity or diffuseness which the occasion may
                    require. We have extracted and brought into juxtaposition the above passages,
                    with two purposes in view.</p>
                <p>The reader will now understand what are the precise qualities upon which Savigny
                    considers the faculty of making good law’s of every description to depend; there
                    being no further particularity in the case of codes, but that the difficulty
                    rises with the magnitude of the undertaking. On recapitulating the conditions,
                    the reader must determine how far the English lawyer can comply with them. We
                    cannot but think that the approximation is sufficiently close to encourage us in
                    making the attempt. According to the degree that our conclusion is correct,
                    England need not disclaim the vocation of her age to legislation and
                    jurisprudence. To begin with the last condition, language; Latin was perhaps a
                    better legislative language than even the Greek. French and Italian may have a
                    similar pre-eminence in modern times. Yet there is no reason that we know of for
                    believing that the vagueness of the English statute-book is attributable to the
                    language, and not to the compilers of it. The next condition was a perception of
                    the affinity between different juridical rules and notions. Notwithstanding the
                    extent of the English law, and the consequent dangers hanging over it from day
                    to day, its axioms, and what has been termed the science of legal judgment, have
                    not yet escaped the grasp of the profession. In their talent for analogical
                    reasoning, for seeing the proper legal relation in an individual case, and for
                    an union of theory with practice, the existing English school resembles the
                    Roman, as it existed at the best times of classical jurisprudence. It may be
                    said equally of the great men of both, “Their theory and practice are the same;
                    their theory is framed for immediate application, and their practice is
                    uniformly ennobled by scientific treatment. They see in every principle a case
                    of application,Tn every case the rule by which it is to be decided; and in the
                    ease with which they pass from generals to particulars, and back again from
                    particulars to generals, their mastery is undeniable.” But the resemblance
                    between the two in the remaining condition is still more striking. “Amongst the
                    Romans in Papinian’s time, a code was possible, because their aggregate
                    juridical literature constituted an organic whole. It might be said (to use an
                    expression of the later jurists), that at that time the individual jurists were
                    <hi rend="italic">fungible</hi> persons. In such a state of things, indeed,
                    there were many ways leading to a good code; one jurist might frame it, and the
                    others afterwards supply particular defects; which was practicable, because each
                    individual jurist was then entitled to rank as the representative of the
                    juridical cultivation of the time; or several, independently of each other,
                    might each work out the whole, and, by collating and combining their
                    productions, a new one might be formed, more complete than each taken singly,
                    but homogeneous with all.” On these grounds, taken from the tests of competency
                    laid down by Savigny himself we feel justified in submitting to his admirers,
                    that a <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi> case at least is
                    made out to this extent, viz. that the common law of England is capable, at the
                    present moment, of being converted into a code.</p>
                <p>It may be proper to remind all parties that England, on entering upon this
                    labour, has two great advantages. They are advantages, in the degree to which
                    she enjoys them, certainly peculiar to herself. The first is, the unity of her
                    present system. She has no disturbing forces arising from permanent disparities
                    of soil and of climate between different parts of her empire. She has no
                    personal laws, the inheritance of races that refuse to amalgamate with each
                    other. She has few' conflicting customs representing cherished recollections,
                    and wrought into the character of respective portions of her population. The
                    early centralization of her judicial system has prevented all this. She is saved
                    from those embarrassments which the appeal court of Montpelier so forcibly
                    depictured in their criticism on the compromise enforced by the Code Napoleon,
                    between the laws and usages of the <hi rend="italic">pays</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >du droit écrit</hi><hi rend="italic">and</hi> the <hi rend="italic">pays du
                    droit</hi><hi rend="italic">coutumier.</hi> These were the obstacles by which
                    James I. was foiled in his darling project of an union between the laws of
                    England and Scotland. He could not succeed, even with the comparatively simple
                    and flexible principles of the criminal laws. What is to be done in a case like
                    that of Canada, where the French and English settlers make it* a point of
                    national pride and national antipathy to cling the closer, each to their
                    opposite systems of jurisprudence? Extensive variances of this description,
                    whilst they constitute one of the great necessities for an uniform system of law
                    throughout our Indian empire (if we mean to govern it by Europeans, and to
                    govern it by law), also, on the other hand, constitute a great, though it is to
                    be hoped not insuperable, difficulty in the execution of the task. It is
                    unfortunate that, in this point of view, the practical difficulty of the task
                    must always rise precisely in proportion to the abstract importance that it
                    should be performed. Savigny would estimate very highly the advantage belonging
                    to the unity in our materials; and he would be disposed to do this by the
                    general policy of his historical creed. But all Prussians have been made
                    sensible of it, from the tenderness with which Prussia has been compelled to
                    humour her subjects on this very point. A government which, by breaking up the
                    estates of its landowners, has invaded, and, in the course of a few years,
                    overturned, the rights of private property; which has formed into codes at its
                    pleasure the great body of its Germanized Roman law; and which had actually
                    decreed that all provincial laws should be also turned into codes within three
                    years; was nevertheless defeated here. They were unable to succeed in this last
                    object, excepting in a single province, that of East Prussia; and they have
                    since been compelled to suspend, if not abandon, their purpose in the rest.</p>
                <p>The second advantage is scarcely an inferior one. If the remark of Sir James
                    Mackintosh be correct, “that there is but one way of forming a civil code,
                    either consistent with common sense, or that has ever been practised in any
                    country, namely, that of gradually building up the law in proportion as the
                    facts arise which it is to regulate,” too great value cannot be set on the
                    quantity and quality of the judicial materials which the history of a nation may
                    thus have collected in its course. It can be nothing but the intrinsic merit of
                    the English reports which has extorted from Mr Bentham repeated panegyrics. “A
                    library composed of the books in which these cases are thus brought to
                    view,—such a library, even though there were not so much as a single <hi
                    rend="italic">law</hi> in it, is at any rate a rich storehouse of materials for
                    legislation; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193203992" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3992-0199"
                    />such a storehouse, that without it no tolerably adequate system of laws could
                    be made. The more ample the stock, so that it be not to such a degree vast that
                    the mind is lost in it, the more effectual the provision made for this most
                    necessary and arduous of all intellectual works. The greatest quantity of wealth
                    possessed in this shape by any other nation, is penury in comparison of that
                    which has been furnished by English common law.” In the immense mass to which
                    the repertory of its adjudged cases extends, it has well acquitted itself of
                    that preliminary process on which Leibnitz set so high a value. Speaking of the
                    writers of consultations, he has said that they are “almost the only juridical
                    writers who really extend jurisprudence, and enrich it by the observation of new
                    eases.” <hi rend="italic">In his autoribus laudibile</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>There is an ancient prejudice which has been conceived against the law, both by
                    men of the world and by men of learning. It is high time that the prejudice were
                    removed. This would be done as soon as ever means were taken to do justice to
                    the good sense, the close reasoning, and just principles, at present buried
                    under its forms. The science, however, must be reconstructed by authority,
                    before the points and peculiarities of the law can, by a proper analysis and
                    synthesis, be so separated and combined as to clear away unsatisfactory
                    anomalies, and present its rules in a way which will bear examination. When Lord
                    Mansfield boasted that the English law was a law of principle,die at least saw
                    the means of making it so. He had made it so for himself. When Hald called upon
                    every student to methodize the law in his reading, telling him, that otherwise
                    he could never carry it in his memory for seven years together, or a much
                    shorter period, he could not have stopped by choice at the case of individual
                    students. He must have been prepared to call upon the legislature to take the
                    same course, for the sake of the profession who were to practise it, and the
                    public who were to obey it. The advantage of whatever method or principle can be
                    put into the law is one of those advantages which ought to be diffused as
                    widely, and put forward as prominently, as possible. These two things are so
                    nearly connected, that we must not expect to get the benefit of one without the
                    other. By the help of method, the true principles are brought to light; and
                    then, by a philosophical re-action, the principles do as much in return, or
                    more, towards assisting us to improve our methods. The perfection of both
                    terminates in a code. With this view, Bacon’s collection of legal maxipis
                    appears to have been one of his most valuable works, though only a small portion
                    of them has been preserved. He speaks of them as the <hi rend="italic">regulae
                    juris,</hi> with their differences and limitations, warranted by good
                    authorities, and set forth by discourse and deducement in a just tractate, “the
                    thing most important to the health and good institution of laws.” He had seen
                    little in this kind either in our law or in that of others which satisfied him,
                    but he was so well satisfied with the beginning which he had made himself, that
                    he had the confidence to assure his majesty, “I am in good hope, that when Sir
                    Edward Coke’s reports, and mv own rules and decisions, shall come to posterity,
                    there will be (whatsoever is now thought) question who was the greater lawyer.”
                    It will be seen, when the English law is thus put into system, whether it can,
                    equally with the Roman, deserve the commendation which Leibnitz bestowed upon
                    the Roman, when he said of it, that he knew nothing so mathematical out of the
                    mathematics.</p>
                <p>The practical question upon which the estimate of a code, or, m other words, of
                    enacted law, must depend, involves three distinct points. First, what are the
                    evils inherent in unenacted law generally? next, what are those which are
                    peculiar to the particular shape which unenacted law has assumed in England?
                    These are matters of fact. There is a further question, how far the turning of
                    unenacted into enacted law is likely to get rid of these evils. This must be
                    comparatively a matter of opinion. These points have been anticipated more or
                    less in our historical narrative. The inquirer is referred for a more particular
                    detail to Mr Bentham’s papers on Codification, and to the comment on them by Sir
                    Samuel Romilly in the fifty-seventh number of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh
                    Review.</hi> He will find there what is the nature of the unknown God from whose
                    worship it is one of the principal objects of a code to set him free. These
                    evils are reduced in malignity under the English system, and, to a considerable
                    degree, are kept out of public sight, from the manner in which common law and
                    statute law are there mixed up together. Otherwise a system of barefaced
                    judge-made law, and nothing else, would not be tolerated for a day. It is true
                    that laws, however constituted, cannot sustain the character of a people, when,
                    from more powerful independent causes, the national character is falling into
                    decay. It is true also that such a people will pull down their laws with them.
                    Still it is a presumption against the possible stability and firmness of
                    unenacted law, that all the admitted excellence of the expositions of the Roman
                    jurisconsults of the third century could not prevent the civil law from getting
                    into such a state of anarchy, that a code, put together by very inferior
                    workmen, was acknowledged, universally, of two evils to have become the
                    least.</p>
                <p>There is a proverbial saying, by which law is denominated a necessary evil. The
                    expression assumes, and assumes truly, that there are evils inseparable from
                    law. Amongst these, are particular consequences, which it has been sometimes
                    absurdly expected, or disingenuously represented, that codification would
                    remove. We must mention a few of those which wise reformers never held, and
                    which ignorant ones must instantly give up. The first of these fallacies, and
                    almost the most absurd, is the imagination of such a thing as an immutable code.
                    There is no such combination as “man and for ever.” We must leave to pretenders,
                    playing at legislation, like Frederick the Great or the Empress Catherine, the
                    fiction that a code may be a manual as cheap, short, and familiar, as a
                    catechism; and that its immediate consequence will be the enabling the world to
                    dispense with lawyers as a distinct profession. Instead of doing away with
                    judges and lawyers, professionally educated, the effect of a good system must be
                    quite the reverse. It is among the merits of a code properly made and properly
                    studied, that it will want lawyers of a higher order, and that it will help to
                    make them. The notion of doing without the profession of the law belongs to the
                    region of the legal debates during the Commonwealth, in one of which it was
                    seriously moved to burn the records. The unlearned member was of course
                    proceeding upon Knox’s principle in ecclesiastical reform, viz. to displace the
                    rooks by pulling down the rookeries. Flale had some trouble to bring the
                    fanatics to reason. If the notion of simplifying the interpretation of a code by
                    destroying the old authorities be absurd on one hand, equally so is the opposite
                    notion, that the neglect of them will be the necessary consequence of a code. It
                    is nothing to the discredit of the reforms by .Justinian (quite the contrary) to
                    admit that, in case he bad been succeeded by enlightened times, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Jurisprudentia</hi><hi rend="italic">ante-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Justinianea</hi> would not have been suffered to fall into oblivion. Is the
                    question a different one with regard to the &gt; contributions of contemporary
                    legal learning? Not at all. Yet the government of Bavaria was insane enough, in
                    publishing its new penal code in 1813, to follow it up <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193204005" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4005-0200"/>by an ordinance that no
                    public servant or lawyer should print a commentary upon it. It was the plain
                    consequence of such an order, as far as government was concerned, to abolish law
                    as a science, to deprive it of all capability of improvement, and to perpetuate
                    every existing blunder. The most appropriate and righteous censure which could
                    be passed upon such folly, was the necessity which they had to submit to, of
                    stultifying themselves by being obliged to add to this perfect work above one
                    hundred <hi rend="italic">novels</hi> within the four succeeding years. An
                    attempt to repress what the French call the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jurisprudence</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arrets,</hi> by discouraging the
                    preservation and the study of judicial decisions, under the alarm of being
                    overwhelmed by them, is even still more prejudicial. For this is to dry up at
                    its source the natural fountain, whose tributary waters, if duly analysed and
                    conducted, are, from among many subsidiary means, the best qualified of all for
                    supplying the code from time to time with whatever accessions it may require,
                    and for maintaining it on a proper level with the wants and the intelligence of
                    society. It shows the incorrigibleness of mankind, that most of these modern
                    errors are only repetitions of the very errors which were committed by
                    Tribonian.</p>
                <p>The sooner all delusive hopes are laid aside the better. We are spared
                    disappointment in quarters where nothing but disappointment is to be met with;
                    and by concentrating our efforts in the right direction, upon objects within our
                    reach, all that is attainable is more likely to be attained. Hew far is it
                    possible to reduce the causes of litigation by giving to the law what Bentham
                    has chosen to term <hi rend="italic">cognoscibility 2</hi> Every possible
                    facility to litigation, wherever rights given to a party by the law are violated
                    or withheld, is one of the most obvious, though one of the most neglected,
                    duties of society. On the other hand, that it is extremely, desirable, and also
                    to a certain extent practicable, to reduce the causes of litigation, which arise
                    from the uncertainty of the law, nobody can deny. But, on comparing their
                    respective amounts of litigation, with the view of testing thereby the merit of
                    their respective legal systems, there are unavoidable difficulties in the way of
                    a fair comparison between one country and another. Tabular returns from courts
                    of justice, in the case of countries governed respectively by enacted and
                    unenacted law, have, as was said above, never been inquired into with this
                    object. But the tables are yet to be drawn up, which a person who knew what he
                    ought to look for would be at the trouble of consulting. Tables, to be of any
                    use for this purpose, must distinguish, by appropriate classification, the
                    falling off in litigation, which is to be set down to the clearness with which a
                    government has simplified or particularized its laws, from the falling off which
                    as certainly would take place as often as a government had succeeded, by the
                    help of complication, expense, or terror, in obstructing the entrance into its
                    tribunals. Consequently we should not place much value (were they to be had) on
                    numbers given in the gross, one way or the other. But there are facts in
                    evidence which, whatever else may be their value, are fully sufficient to refute
                    the assertion that codes must necessarily increase litigation. Filangieri, for
                    example (t. v. p. 370), quotes from <hi rend="italic">Eormey s abridged
                    Exposition of the Royal Plan for the Reform of Justice,</hi> the example of
                    Pomerania. In consequence of its having been proverbially called <hi
                    rend="italic">terra</hi><hi rend="italic">litigiosa,</hi> it was the first
                    selected by Frederick the Great for his experiment. The result was, that
                    law-suits became rarer every day. After such an event as the French revolution,
                    how many causes, besides the legal novelty of the code, might explain a sudden
                    rush into courts of justice. Meyer observes, that, in the Low Countries, and in
                    Rhenish Prussia, authentic interpretations of the Code Napoleon, during the
                    short time that those countries had been subjected to its jurisdiction, had so
                    satisfactorily verified the greater part of its debateable points, that this
                    class of litigation was already sensibly on the decline. We have no reason to
                    believe that it is not the same in France. Again, although it is essential to
                    improvement in the law that juridical learning should be cultivated, and
                    adjudged cases collected and studied, yet it is as essential to one of the main
                    advantages expected from a code, that its auxiliary literature should not
                    supersede, and, as it were, swamp the precise letter of the enacted law. The
                    character of <hi rend="italic">cognoscibility</hi> would otherwise again belost.
                    The opponents of codes have strenuously maintained that juridical learning comes
                    of so progressive and masterful a stock, that a code cannot possibly escape from
                    the alternative of all or none. The proposed dilemma leaves us to choose which
                    of the evils we shall prefer. Whichever we may choose, we are asked in a
                    sarcastic tone to calculate the mighty stakes which we have won, and to answer
                    honestly, whether we find them worth the trouble which we have had in playing
                    for them. On this point also the example of France is shaken <hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi><hi rend="italic">terrorem</hi> over England and America. All who would
                    lay irreverent hands upon the ark of the common law, are solemnly and
                    perseveringly assured that the drowning of the Code Napoleon in a sea of
                    literature and jurisprudence, is already the most charac. teristic and undoubted
                    fact in the legal history of France. This, by the way, were it correct, would be
                    an ample answer to the narrowness and poverty of their legal learning, which
                    Savigny conceived must be the consequence of the adoption of a code in the
                    actual circumstances of that country. There can be no question that such a state
                    of things as that described, supposing the representation accurate, would be a
                    good <hi rend="italic">argumentum</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >hominem</hi> to any Frenchman who were to boast that <hi rend="italic">the Code
                    Napoleon had solved the problem.</hi> But it would prove nothing against
                    codification in general; unless codifiers were to admit that the Code Napoleon,
                    and the circumstances under which it had been introduced and administered, were
                    all as good as possible. What, however, are the facts? In 1822, Μ. Dupin wrote
                    his <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi><hi rend="italic">de la</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Jurisprudence des Arrets,</hi> with the view principally of remonstrating
                    against the excess to which French advocates were carrying, especially in the
                    provinces, the citation of judicial precedents in their arguments. He mentions
                    as a flagrant abuse (whatever English practitioners may think of it), an
                    instance where an advocate had cited fourteen cases. The practice, he adds,
                    sometimes passed from the bar even to the bench. This was thought to look
                    ominous. Fortunately we have the positive testimony of Μ. Dupin himself, that,
                    notwithstanding an occasional dip or so, the code keeps its head triumphantly
                    above the waters, and easily shakes off these encumbrances. In 1826, Mr Sampson
                    had been so perplexed by what he was constantly hearing of the warning to
                    codifiers, contained in the present state of French jurisprudence, that he took
                    courage and addressed Μ. Dupin personally. “We are told,” he says, “that the
                    French codes have had but the life of a day; that the civil code, the model of
                    all the others, is already almost buried by the multiplicity of laws, decrees,
                    and commentaries with which it is loaded; and that, in a short time, the law
                    will be sought for, not in the code, but in the solutions of its difficulties,
                    and in the questions to which it has given rise. What degree of credit is due to
                    the assertion ?” It was impossible to consult an oracle more above all suspicion
                    than the lawyer who, four years before, was on the alert, and had appeared to be
                    himself sounding the alarm. But nothing can be more satisfactory than Μ. Dupin’s
                    answer on the question put to him. On the other hand, he properly recognizes and
                    claims, in aid of a code, the full benefit of the just distinction between the
                    learning of the jurist and the authority of the law. “The assertion,” he
                    answers, “is not true, that the jurisprudence <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193204018" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4018-0201"/> of decided cases has
                    prevailed in any way against the text of our codes; nor are we in any way
                    threatened, even at a distance, with the danger of seeing the letter of our laws
                    disappear under the load of interpretations. In every discussion, the text of
                    the law is first looked into, and if the law has spoken, <hi rend="italic">non
                    exemplis sed legibus judicandum est.</hi> If the law has not clearly decided the
                    point in question, its silence or its error is endeavoured to be supplied. But
                    what country is there where decisions have not thus been used to supply the
                    defects of legislation ?” That this is, therefore, the fact in France, we must
                    take Μ. Dupin’s word; and we can have no difficulty in taking it. But the last
                    paragraph admits that in France judge-made law is creeping in beyond what Meyer
                    states it to have done in the Low Countries. And, though Μ. Dupin is protected
                    against the error of putting the two sources of law, the legislative and the
                    judicial, in opposition to each other, it is equally certain that inferior
                    lawyers are equally secure. He had observed, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jurisprudence des Arrets,</hi> that nothing was more common than to hear the
                    two things put in contradiction, law and jurisprudence. <hi rend="italic">Il est
                    de principe en droit que—mais la jurisprudence est contraire; d est-à-dire, les
                    arrets ont juge autrement.</hi> After such a statement, he must not be surprised
                    that strangers have been misled by his book, or that hostile readers of his
                    letter should only use it in order to quote him against himself. Taking the
                    letter by itself, all that is wanted in French legislative organization is an
                    institution charged with the duty of condensing and carrying up the rectified
                    spirit of their judicial decisions from the courts to the legislature. The
                    legislature ought to permit no department in the state to exercise legislative
                    power except itself; and it ought to be provided with the official means of duly
                    discharging its trust. The province of the court of cassation, as a central and
                    regulating power, is of infinite use. Its decisions are reported officially, but
                    its province stops short of the still higher jurisdiction of the institution
                    which is required for the present purpose. The necessity of a “council of laws”
                    of this description has been frequently established by writers on the theory of
                    legislation. It was mentioned during the discussions on the Code Napoleon, but
                    unfortunately dropped through. Without it, any system of enacted law, however
                    complete and correct, at a given moment, cannot long continue so. Jurisprudence
                    must get ahead of law. Upon these points, therefore, how does the argument
                    stand? Whatever may be the form in which laws subsist (code or no code), on
                    either supposition fresh cases will be rising up, which are fairly determinable
                    under the existing law, but only determinable by means of judicial
                    interpretation. The question is, which of the systems offers the likelihood of
                    the’fewest of these instances occurring, and, when they do occur, that a ready
                    and a rational interpretation will be at hand? Again, on either supposition,
                    fresh cases must also be rising up, which, not falling within the existing law,
                    must be provided for, directly or indirectly, by further legislation. There are
                    many reasons, in our opinion, why, upon both occasions, viz. that of a demand
                    for fresh interpretation and for fresh legislation, the work would be better
                    done under a system of enacted than of unenacted law. For the converse
                    conclusion we are aware of no reason whatsoever.</p>
                <p>On the supposition that a code is decided upon, there remain behind very
                    important considerations, which have been incidentally alluded to in former
                    parts of the present paper, but which the space that we have already occupied
                    will not allow of our formally discussing. 1. Every species of preliminary aid
                    ought to be forthcoming. By what inquiries, arrangements, and writings, shall we
                    best prepare the way for the formation of a complete and correct code, and
                    facilitate its practical introduction? 2. The best machinery for executing the
                    work ought to be procured. Is it likely to be most effectually performed by a
                    single presiding mind, as Mr Bentham proposes? or by a commission more or less
                    numerous? In the latter case, the principle on which the labour is distributed
                    amongst the persons employed will have to be well considered. At this stage,
                    too, the main question of all comes to be determined; that is, upon what
                    principle the code is to be drawn up. Are the common law and the statute law to
                    be kept distinct, or to be incorporated with each other? In either case, is the
                    form to be that of articulate propositions, or of a miscellaneous digest? If a
                    digest, is it to be arranged by title and method, or by historically following
                    the course of time? 3. A code will Avant protecting against encroachment, from
                    the moment that it is passed. Accordingly, the collateral regulations which may
                    help to secure it by a vigilant control over the judiciary, must be carefully
                    reviewed. For this end, questions of the following kind should be anticipated
                    and fixed. Ought judges to be required in every judgment to specify the
                    authority in the code'on which their judgment is founded? Ought judges in
                    pronouncing judgment, or advocates in conducting a forensic argument, to be
                    restrained to a particular class of authorities? Concurrently with the formation
                    of a code, a tribunal distinct from and raised above the ordinary courts
                    (something like the court of cassation) may be wanted, in order to keep the
                    ordinary administration of justice within the sphere to which it is one of the
                    definite objects of a code that judicial interpretation should be confined. 4.
                    Lastly, the code will want improving. This must be provided for by prospective
                    regulations; by the creation of a minister of justice, or a council of laws,
                    expressly appointed to superintend the unity and the efficiency of the entire
                    system, and specially instructed to keep open an active communication between
                    the tribunals and the legislature. Cases, either not provided for at all, or
                    provided for imperfectly, will from time to time be brought unsuccessfully
                    before the courts. The occurrence of such cases will direct the attention of the
                    officers in question to a point upon which, it is evident, by the supposition,
                    that new legislation is wanted for the purposes of justice. In other cases,
                    which nevertheless have been successfully carried through the courts to final
                    judgment, the interpretation of the courts will have wandered wider than is
                    expedient from the strict letter of the law. The occurrence of this latter class
                    of cates will point out the necessity of enlarging the provision of the'code
                    into a more explicit conformity with the judicial construction put upon them.
                    Theoretical writers, in contemplating the possibility of drawing nearer and
                    nearer towards a perfect system, have perceived, that an institution of this
                    kind is an indispensable condition. We repeat the observation here, from our
                    sense of its importance. This is the object of the permanent commission
                    recommended by Lord Bacon. And a council of laws for the absorption and
                    assimilation of occasional jurisprudence into the general body of the law, is
                    part of the political mechanism suggested in the “idea of a perfect
                    commonwealth.”</p>
                <p>We cannot dismiss this subject without referring the reader to the concluding
                    observations of the <hi rend="italic">Second Report of the Commissioners
                    appointed to inquire into the Consolidation of the Statute Law</hi> (page 29).
                    The Report bears date July 1835. The suggestions are the deliberate
                    recommendations of practical lawyers, acting under the authority of parliament.
                    On remarking how nearly they approach to the recommendation of a code (for the
                    whole principle of a code is contained in the suggestions), the thinking part of
                    the public may well feel satisfied with the quiet progress which the question is
                    making from year to year. The time is evidently approaching, perhaps more
                    rapidly than we are aware, when “a work rare enough in the memory of times to
                    show it excellent, and yet not so rare as to make it suspected for impossible,
                    inconvenient, or <pb break="no" facs="nls:193204031"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-4031-0202"/>unsafe,” must be undertaken by us. Glory and
                    gratitude to the men who shall be privileged in that day to stand in the
                    presence of their fellow-citizens, having so raised their minds, and shaped
                    their studies, as to be worthy of the “vocation” to which our age and country
                    are assuredly called. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. e. ľ. e.)</hi></p>
