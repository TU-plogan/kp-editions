                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">LANGUET, <hi rend="smallcaps">Hubert</hi></label>, one of the
                    boldest political writers of the sixteenth century, was born in 1518, at
                    Viteaux, a town in Burgundy, of which his father was governor. He early evinced
                    an inclination for study, and at the age of nine not only understood, but spoke,
                    Latin. Having completed his studies, he resolved to travel. He set out for
                    Germany, where the learned Joachim Camerarius had little difficulty in embuing
                    him with the principles of the reformers; but the tumultuous scenes of which he
                    was a daily witness determined him to pass into Italy, there to await the return
                    of tranquillity. He remained some time at Padua, where he studied civil law, and
                    took his degree of doctor in 1548. He then rapidly visited the principal cities
                    of Italy, and hastened his return to Germany, being urged by a desire to make
                    the acquaintance of Melancthon, whose works had afforded him very great
                    pleasure. He arrived at Wittemberg in the course of the year 1549; and, as long
                    as Melancthon lived, he returned annually to pass the winter at Wittemberg. From
                    1551 to 1560 he visited Sweden, Denmark, Lapland, and made two journeys into
                    Italy; the first to satisfy his curiosity on different points, and the second in
                    the suite of Adolphus Count of Nassau, who had desired to have the pleasure of
                    his society. In 1565 he entered the service of Augustus, elector of Saxony, who
                    afterwards sent him to France to congratulate Charles IX. on the
                    re-establishment of peace in his dominions. Languet then accompanied the elector
                    to the siege of Gotha, of which he has left a good account; and was deputed, in
                    1568, to attend the diet of Spires. In 1570 he assisted at the conferences of
                    Stettin, and was sent into France the same year to compliment Charles IX. on his
                    marriage, and at the ⅛ame time to engage him to cause the treaties which
                    guaranteed to the Protestants the free exercise of their religion, to be
                    observed. He was at Paris on the day of the massacre of St Bartholomew, and made
                    so many efforts to save the printer Wechel, and Duplessis*· Mornay, both his
                    intimate friends, that he drew on himself the attention of the assassins, and
                    would have fallen a victim to his humane exertions, had it not been for the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193202640" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2640-0095"/> affection of
                    Morvilliers, bishop of Orleans, who kept him concealed. Being soon afterwards
                    recalled to Saxony, he was sent to Vienna in 1574. In 1577 he passed into the
                    service of the count palatine John Cassimir, and then attached himself to the
                    Prince of Orange, who employed him usefully in different negotiations. Languet
                    died at Antwerp on the 30th of September 1581. His works are, 1. Historica
                    Descriptio susceptae a Caesarea majestate executionis Augusto Saxoniae septem
                    viro duce contra S. Romani imperii rebelles, eorumque receptatorem et captae
                    urbis Gothae, 1568, in 4to; 2. Harangue fait au Roi Charles IX. de la part des
                    Princes Protestants d’Allemagne, inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires du
                    Règne de Charles IX.</hi> (vol. i.); 3. Epistolae Politicae et Historicae ad
                    Philipp. Sydnaeum, Francfort, 1630, in 12mo; 4. Epistolacad Joachimum
                    Camerarium, et filium, Groningen, 1646, in 12mo; 5. Arcana saeculi decimi-sexti,
                    seu Epistolae secretae ad Principem suum Augustum Saxôniae Ducem, Halle, 1699,
                    in 4to; 6. 2∖p0logie ou Defence de Guillaume, prince d’Orange, contre le ban et
                    ledit du roi d’Espagne, Antwerp or Delft, 1581, in 4to; 7. Vindiciae contra

                    potestate, Basi], 1579, in 8vo. This last work, which went thr6ugh a great
                    number of editions in Germany and Holland, was published by the author under the
                    name of Junius Brutus; and was afterwards translated into French by François
                    Estienne, under the title, <hi rend="italic">De la Puissance legitime</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">du</hi><hi rend="italic">Prince</hi><hi rend="italic">sur le
                    Peuple.</hi> By a singular anomaly, the translation is now much more rare than

                    >Languet,</hi><hi rend="italic">Jolin-Eaptist-Joseph,</hi> a doctor of the
                    Sorbonne, was born at Dijon in 1675. He was received into the Sorbonne in 1698,
                    and attached himself to the community of St Sulpice, to which parish he rendered
                    important service. Μ. dc la Chétardie, the vicar, conscious of his talents,
                    chose him as his curate, in which capacity he officiated for nearly ten years,
                    and in 1714 succeeded to the vicarage. His parish church being small and <hi
                    rend="subscript"> k</hi> out of repair, he conceived the design of building a
                    church suitable to the size of the parish, which he began with the sum of a
                    hundred crowns, but soon obtained considerable donations; and the Duke of
                    Orleans, regent of the kingdom, granted him a lottery, and laid the first stone
                    of the porch in 1718. It was consecrated in 1745, Μ. Languet having spared
                    neither labour nor expense to render it one of the finest churches in the world,
                    both for architecture and ornament. Another work which did him no less honour
                    was the <hi rend="italic">Maison de l’enfant Jesus.</hi> This establishment
                    consisted of two parts; the first composed of about thirty-five poor ladies of
                    good families, and the second of more than 400 poor women and children of town
                    and country. The order and economy in this house, for the education and
                    employment of so many persons, gave Cardinal Fleury so high an idea of the vicar
                    of St Sulpice, that he proposed to make him superintendent-general of all the
                    hospitals in the kingdom; an appointment, however, which he declined. Μ. Langnet
                    was not only singular in this warm, disinterested, and benevolent conduct, but
                    also in other circumstances equally rare, namely, the refusal of several
                    bishoprics which were offered him. He even resigned his vicarage in 1748, but
                    continued to preach every Sunday at his own parish church, and to support the
                    <hi rend="italic">Maison de l’enfani Jesus,</hi> to his death, which happened in
                    1750.</p>
