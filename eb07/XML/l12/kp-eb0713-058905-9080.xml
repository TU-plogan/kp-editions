                <p><label type="entry">LUCIMETER</label>. This name has been given to an apparatus
                    employed by Bouguer for measuring the intensity of the light which proceeds from
                    different bodies.</p>
                <p>In the case of two lamps or candles burning near to each other, the intensity of
                    the light may be compared, by comparing the intensity of the shadows of an
                    adjacent body. The shadow produced by interposing the body in the stronger light
                    is darker than its shadow formed by the interposition of the body in the rays of
                    the weaker; because the first shadow is enlightened only by the light it
                    receives from the weaker light, whilst the other shadow is more strongly
                    enlightened by the light from the stronger light. But this method will not serve
                    for comparing the intensity of the light of the sun and moon, for the light of
                    the sun so greatly exceeds that of the moon, that when both are visible at the
                    same time, the light of the moon is far too weak for any shadow to be formed by
                    intercepting it.</p>
                <p>For the purpose of measuring and comparing the intensity of the light of the sun
                    and moon, Bouguer reduced the light of the sun and of the moon till the light
                    appeared to be equal to that of a candle. The eye is able to judge whether or
                    not two lights are equal; but if the lights are unequal, it is impossible to
                    estimate by inspection how much the one exceeds the other. Being able to
                    calculate how much he had reduced the light of the sun and of the moon, he was
                    enabled to say what proportion their light bore to that of the candle.</p>
                <p>For the former, Bouguer, when the sun was at an elevation of thirty-one degrees
                    above the horizon, received the light into a dark room, through a hole of one
                    twelfth of an inch in diameter. In this hole was placed a concave glass to
                    weaken the light, by making the rays diverge more than they would in passing
                    through the hole without a concave glass. He received the image formed by the
                    divergent rays at a distance of five or six feet, by interposing a screen, which
                    formed a right section of the cone of divergent rays. This right section was a
                    round image of the sun, of <hi rend="italic superscript"> λ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">fξ</hi> of an inch in diameter; therefore the light was diminished
                    by the square of that number, since the light received through a hole of one
                    line in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193209093" xml:id="kp-eb0713-9093-0590"
                    />diameter was diffused over a circle of 108 lines in diameter, and of 1164
                    times the area. This light he found to be equal to that of a candle placed at a
                    distance of sixteen feet.</p>
                <p>He employed the same concave glass to receive the light of the full moon, the
                    moon being nearly at its mean distance from the earth, and at thirty-one degrees
                    of altitude, the same altitude as the sun had in his observations of that
                    luminary. The light of the moon being weak, he received the image at eight
                    twelfths of an inch from the concave glass, and then the light of the image was
                    so weak as to be equal to the light of a candle at the distance of fifty
                    feet.</p>
                <p>Now the light of the moon was diminished in the proportion of the square of one
                    to sixty-four, which is the square of the diameter of its circular image. If the
                    light of the moon had been diminished 11,664 times, it would have been equal to
                    the light of the candle removed to a distance of 675 feet; for as eight, the
                    diameter of the image, is to fifty, the distance, so is 108, the diameter of the
                    image when the light is reduced 11,664 times, to 675 feet, the distance of the
                    candle which would produce that degree of light. Therefore the light of the sun
                    being equal to that of a candle placed at the distance of sixteen inches, and
                    the light of the moon being equal to the light of the same candle placed at the
                    distance of 675 feet, that is, 8100 inches, it follows that the light of the sun
                    is to the light of the moon as 65,610,000, the square of 8100, is to 256, the
                    square of 16. This experiment gave the light of the sun 256,289 times greater
                    than the light of the full moon. Bouguer obtained results somewhat different
                    from other experiments, and taking a mean of these results, he concludes that
                    the light of the sun is 300,000 times greater than the light of the full moon.
                    The light of the moon, when collected into a focus by a concave mirror which
                    condenses the light into a space 306 times less than the natural state of the
                    light, produces no sensible heat.</p>
                <p>Bouguer found, by a process similar to that above described, that the light of
                    the full moon when elevated 66° IP, was to the light of the full moon elevated
                    19° 16' above the horizon, as 2500, the square of 50, to 1681, the square of 4L
                    The sun at the harbour of Croisac in Bretagne, where Bouguer made his
                    experiments, has the same apparent altitudes of 66° IP, and 19° 16' at the
                    summer and winter solstices; and he concludes that the intensity of the light of
                    the sun at the summer solstice is to the intensity of its light at the winter
                    solstice, in the above-mentioned ratio of 2500 to 1651, or about three to two.
                    He found that the light of the moon, when near the horizon, and about to set,
                    was 2000 times less than the light of the moon elevated 66° IP. This difference
                    in the light of heavenly bodies when at different altitudes proceeds from the
                    want of transparence in the air; for when the heavenly body is not much elevated
                    above the horizon, the rays proceeding from it have a greater distance of
                    atmosphere to pass through than the rays from the same body at a greater
                    altitude; and the rays from a heavenly body in the zenith proceed in the
                    direction of a diameter, and therefore traverse the atmosphere by the shortest
                    path. Bouguer calculates that the mass of air passed through by the rays from a
                    heavenly body at 66° 11' is equal to a supposed mass of air of the uniform
                    density of the air at the surface of the earth, 4275 toises in thickness; and
                    that the mass of air passed through by the rays from a heavenly body 19° 16' in
                    altitude, is equal to a supposed mass of air of the density of the air at the
                    surface, and of 11,744 toises in thickness.</p>
                <p>He concludes that light is diminished 2¾⅛¾, θ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>
                    about one third, by passing through a mass of air of the uniform density of the
                    air at the surface, and 7469 toises in thickness. The rays from a heavenly body
                    near the horizon are likewise impeded by the terrestrial vapours, which vary in
                    density, and render the intensity of the light of a heavenly body at the horizon
                    various at different times. The same cause renders the quantity of the
                    refraction of the heavenly bodies at the horizon uncertain.</p>
                <p>In certain states of the air, the discs of the sun and the moon, when at the
                    horizon, appear somewhat elliptic, the apparent vertical diameter being less
                    than the horizontal. This is occasioned by the greater refraction of the air
                    through which the under limb is seen; which refraction elevates the apparent
                    place of the under limb by a quantity sensibly greater than that quantity of
                    refraction by which the upper limb is raised. This alteration of figure, and the
                    colour of the rising and setting sun and moon, indicate the greater or less
                    quantity of vapour diffused in the air, and are usefully referred to by the
                    seaman and farmer as prognostic indications of the weather.</p>
                <p>The existence of a greater or less quantity of vapour mixed with the air is also
                    indicated by the different degrees of intensity of the blue colour of the sky.
                    Some are of opinion that this colour depends on the colour of the mass of air
                    which forms the atmosphere; others maintain that it arises from the darkness of
                    space seen through the interposed atmosphere. The blue colour of the sky
                    increases in intensity from the horizon to the zenith, and is particularly
                    intense when seen from the elevated parts of the Alps, because in that situation
                    there are few terrestrial vapours mixed with the air, and it is the white colour
                    of these vapours which renders the blue less intense in lower situations. For
                    the purpose of estimating and noting its intensity, it is compared with
                    different tints of blue painted on a card, as described under the article <hi
