                <p><label type="entry">LINEN</label> (in German, <hi rend="italic">linηeη,
                    leinwand’),</hi> a species of cloth usually made of thread of flax, but
                    sometimes also of hemp. Linen seems to have been known and manufactured in Egypt
                    from the earliest times, and used, if not as an article of ordinary dress, at
                    least in swathing the bodies of the dead. But it was not worn by the Jews, the
                    Greeks, or the Romans, under tunics of a finer texture having amongst them
                    supplied the place of shirts; and hence the necessity of frequent bathing.
                    Alexander Severus was the first Roman emperor who wore linen; but the use of
                    this necessary article did not become common until long after his time.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of this commodity has been prosecuted in England for a very long
                    period, probably since the time of the Romans; but though its progress has been
                    considerable, particularly within the last twenty or thirty years, it has not
                    been so great as might have been anticipated. This is no doubt to be ascribed
                    partly to the efforts which have been made to encourage and bolster up the
                    manufacture in Ireland and Scotland, and partly to the rapid growth of the
                    cotton manufacture, the fabrics of which have to a considerable extent
                    supplanted those of linen.</p>
                <p>In 1698, both houses of parliament addressed the king, William III., representing
                    that the progress of the woollen manufacture of Ireland was such as to prejudice
                    that of England, and that it would be for the public advantage were the former
                    discouraged, and the linen manufacture established in its stead. His majesty
                    replied that he would do all that in him lay to <hi rend="italic"
                    >discourage</hi> the <hi rend="italic">woollen</hi> manufacture in Ireland, to
                    encourage the <hi rend="italic">linen</hi> manufacture, and to promote the trade
                    of England. Nothing can be more strikingly characteristic of the erroneous and
                    illiberal notions which were then entertained respecting the plainest principles
                    of public economy, than this address, and the answer made to it by the
                    sovereign. But whatever the people of Ireland might think of the king of England
                    deliberately avowing his determination to do all in his power to crush a
                    manufacture in which they had made considerable progress, government had no
                    difficulty in prevailing upon the legislature of that country to second their
                    views, by prohibiting the exportation of all woollen goods from Ireland, except
                    to England, where prohibitory duties were already imposed on the importation of
                    such goods. The parliament and government of England, however, though anxious to
                    protect the woollen manufacture of that country, never discovered any
                    backwardness to promote the linen trade of Ireland; and ever since the reign of
                    William III. it has been the object of regulation and encouragement. It may
                    indeed be doubted whether the regulations in question have always been the most
                    judicious that might have been devised, and whether Ireland has really been
                    benefited by the forced extension of the linen manufacture. Mr Young and Mr
                    Wakefield both contend that the extension of the linen manufacture has not been
                    advantageous to that country; and it seems to be sufficiently established, that
                    though the manufacture might not have been so widely diffused, it would have
                    been in a sounder and more healthy state had it been less the subject of
                    legislative interference.</p>
                <p>Besides premiums and encouragements of various kinds, bounties were granted on
                    the exportation of linen from an early period down to the year 1830. In 1829,
                    for instance, notwithstanding the bounty had then been very much reduced, it
                    amounted to about L.300,000, or nearly one-seventh of the declared value of the
                    linen exported in that year. It would be difficult to imagine a greater abuse
                    than this. Such a bounty, instead of promoting the manufacture, rendered those
                    engaged in it comparatively indifferent to improvements; and, though it had been
                    otherwise, the policy of persisting, during more than a century, in supplying
                    foreigners with linens for less than they cost, cannot possibly be defended.
                    There is no reason to doubt, that were the various sums expended in well-meant
                    but useless attempts to force this manufacture, added together with their
                    accumulations at simple interest, they would be found sufficient to yield an
                    annual revenue little if at all inferior to the entire value of the linens which
                    we now send abroad. In fact, the business never began to do any real good, or to
                    take firm root, until this manufacture ceased to be a domestic one, and was
                    carried on principally in mills, and by the aid of machinery; a change which the
                    forcing system, so long pursued, tended to counteract. The only real and
                    effective legislative encouragement which the manufacture has ever met with, has
                    been the reduction of the duties upon flax and hemp, and the relinquishment of
                    the absurd attempts made to force the growth of these raw commodities at
                    home.</p>
                <p>The following table, which it is to be regretted the parliamentary accounts do
                    not furnish the means of continuing to the present day, exhibits an account of
                    the quality and value of the linens exported from Ireland, during a period of
                    nearly thirty years, from 1800 to 1829 both inclusive.</p>

                <p>Of these exports more than twelve-thirteenths have been to Great Britain. The
                    total average exportation during the three years ending with 1825, was
                    51,947,413 yards, of which 49,031,073 were sent to this country; the exports to
                    all other parts being only 2,916,340 yards. Since 1825, the trade between
                    Ireland and Great Britain has been placed on the footing of a coasting trade, so
                    that linens are now exported and imported without any specific entry at the
                    Custom-house.</p>
                <p>In 1727, a board of trustees was established in Scotland for the superintendence
                    and improvement of the linen manufacture. It is not probable that the
                    institution of this board could of itself have been of any material service; but
                    considerable bounties and premiums being at the same time given on the
                    production and exportation of linen, the manufacture went on increasing. Still
                    it did not increase as fast as cotton and some others, which received no
                    adventitious support, until machinery began to be extensively employed in the
                    manufacture; and hence it is doubtful whether the influence of the bounty has
                    been as great as it might at first view appear to have been. The regulations as
                    to the manufacture, after having been long objected to by those concerned in it,
                    were abolished in 1822; and the bounties have in like manner ceased.</p>
                <p>Dundee is the principal seat of the Scottish linen manufacture, and its progress
                    there has latterly been extraordinary. The manufacture appears to have been
                    introduced into Dundee about the beginning of the last century; but for a long
                    period its progress was comparatively slow. In the year 1745, the quantity of
                    flax imported amounted only to seventy-four tons, without any hemp; and the
                    shipments of linen cloth, during the same year, were estimated at about
                    1,000,000 yards; but no mention is made either of sail-cloth or of bagging. In
                    1791, the imports of flax amounted to 2444 tons, and those of hemp to 299 tons;
                    whilst the exports of that year were 7,842,000 yards of linen, 280,000 yards of
                    sail-cloth, and 65,000 yards of bagging. From this period the trade began to
                    extend itself gradually. Previously to the peace of 1815, no great quantity of
                    machinery had been employed in spinning; but about this period, the trade began
                    to increase rapidly, partly in consequence of the improvement of the machinery,
                    and its extensive employment in the manufacture, and partly also from the
                    greater regularity with which supplies of raw material were obtained from the
                    northern powers. Indeed its progress has been quite astonishing; the imports of
                    flax having risen from 3000 tons in 1814, to 15,000 tons in 1830. The exports of
                    manufactured goods have increased in a corresponding ratio. During the year
                    ending on the 31st of May 1831, there were imported into Dundee 15,010 tons of
                    flax, and 3082 of hemp; and there were shipped off 366,817 pieces, being about
                    50,000,000 yards, of linen; 85,522 pieces, or about 3,500,000 yards, of
                    sail-cloth; and about 4,000,000 yards of bagging; making a total of about
                    57,500,000 yards. In the year ending on the 31st of May 1833, the imports of
                    flax amounted to 18,777 tons, besides 3380 tons of hemp. The shipments of linen,
                    sail-cloth, and bagging, increased in a corresponding ratio, and were this year
                    valued at L.1,600,000.</p>
                <p>It appears, therefore, that the shipments of linen from this single port are as
                    great as those from all Ireland; and whilst the manufacture has been tardily
                    progressive in the latter, it has advanced in Dundee with even greater rapidity
                    than the cotton manufacture at Manchester. It is not easy to account, in a
                    satisfactory manner, for this wonderful advancement. Something must be ascribed
                    to the convenient situation of the port for obtaining supplies of the raw
                    material from the north of Europe; and more, perhaps, to the manufacture having
                    been long established in the towns and villages of Strathmore, the Carse of
                    Gowrie, and the northern parts of Fife, of which Dundee is the emporium. But
                    these circumstances do not seem adequate to explain the pre-eminence which this
                    place has recently attained in the linen manufacture; a superiority which must,
                    we think, be ascribed, partly to a concurrence of fortunate accidents, and
                    partly to the increased skill, enterprise, and capital of the manufacturers.
                    From whatever causes this pre-eminence may have in the first instance arisen, it
                    is obvious, however, that, having once been attained by any place like Dundee,
                    it must be exceedingly difficult for others to come into competition <pb

                    manufacturers, who have on their side established connections, workmen of
                    superior skill and dexterity, improved machinery, and constantly accumulating
                    capital. Recently, indeed, the advantages possessed by old estab lishments have,
                    to a considerable extent, been neutralised by the prevalence of combinations
                    amongst the workmen; but it is to be hoped that means will speedily be devised
                    for obviating this formidable, and, we fear, growing evil.</p>

                    F. Μ. Eden estimated the entire value of the linen manufacture of Great Britain,
                    in 1800, atL.2,000,000; and if we assume that since that period the manufacture
                    has been tripled in value, we shall not probably be far from the truth.
                    Professor M <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> Culloch thinks that the entire
                    produce of the manufacture in the united kingdom does not exceed L.7,500,000;
                    but some very intelligent individuals, largely engaged in the trade, do not
                    estimate it at so much; and, at all events, we may feel confident that this sum,
                    if it err not in excess, is certainly by no means within the mark. If, then, we
                    set aside a third part of this sum for the value of the raw material, and
                    twenty-five per cent, for profits, wages of superintendence, wear and tear of
                    fixed capital, coals, and other charges, there will remain L.3,125,000 to be
                    divided as wages amongst those engaged in the manufacture; and, supposing every
                    individual to earn at an average L.18 a year, the total number employed in it
                    would be about 172,000. It may, perhaps, be thought that L.18 is too low an
                    estimate for wages, and such would, no doubt, be the case, if Ireland were not
                    taken into the average; but as a great many persons are there employed at very
                    low wages, it may be inferred that L.18 is not very far from the mean rate, more
                    especially as a vast number of persons in Ireland are only partly employed in
                    the manufacture, whereas by this estimate it is supposed that 172,000
                    individuals are wholly employed in it.</p>
                <p>It appears from official statements, which it is unnecessary to give in detail,
                    that in 1830 the aggregate amount of the importations into the united kingdom,
                    from various countries, of undressed hemp, flax, and tow or codilla, of hemp and
                    flax dressed or undressed, and linen yarn, is, of the first, 506,771 cwt., of
                    the second 944,096 cwt., and of the third, 19,211; the official value thereof
                    being respectively, for Great Britain, L.411,832, L.l,923,428, and L.104,559,
                    and for Ireland, L.15,926, L.18,803, and L.19,623. The official value of
                    exports, ranged under the same heads, is, respectively, L.l 1,798, L.7720, and
                    of linen yarn <hi rend="italic">nil;</hi> so that the official value of hemp,
                    flax, and linen yarn, left for consumption in the united kingdom, in 1830, was
                    L.415,960, L.l,934,511, and L.124,182. From other accounts, it further appears
                    that the consumption of foreign linens in this country is inconsiderable; in
                    fact, the real or declared value of those entered for home consumption, in 1830,
                    could scarcely exceed L.20,000.</p>
                <p>The regulations as to the linen manufacture may be shortly stated. They are as
                    follow: Ist’, Any person, native or foreigner, may, without paying any thing,
                    set up in any place, privileged or not privileged, corporate or not corporate,
                    any branch of the linen manufacture; and foreigners, practising the same, on
                    taking the oath of allegiance, &amp;c. become entitled to all the privileges of
                    natural-born subjects. 2d, Persons affixing stamps to foreign linens, in
                    imitation of the stamps affixed to those of Scotland or Ireland, forfeit L.5 for
                    each offence; and persons exposing to sale or packing up any foreign linens as
                    the manufacture of Great Britain or Ireland, forfeit the same, besides L.5 for
                    each piece of linen so exposed to sale or packed up. 3d, Any person stealing, to
                    the value of L.10, any linen, woollen, silk, or cotton goods, whilst exposed
                    during any stage of the manufacture, in any building, field, or other place,
                    shall, upon conviction, be liable, at the discretion of the court, to be
                    transported beyond seas for life, o∖∙ for any term not less than seven years, or
                    to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding four years; and, if a male, to be
                    once, twice, or thrice, publicly or privately whipped, as the court shall think
                    fit. These regulations are founded on 15 Charles II. c. 15; 17 Geo. II. c. 30;
                    and 7 and 8 Geo. IV.</p>
