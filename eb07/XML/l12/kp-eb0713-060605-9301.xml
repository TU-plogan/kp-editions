                    celebrated kingdom of Asia Minor. The ancient writers inform us, that Lydia was
                    first called <hi rend="italic">Maeonia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Meonia,</hi>
                    from Meon, king of Phrygia and Lydia; and that it was known under no other
                    denomination until the reign of Atys, when it began to be called <hi
                    rend="italic">Lydia,</hi> from his son Lydus. Bochart, finding in his learned
                    collection of Phoenician words the verb <hi rend="italic">Luz,</hi>
                    sig-pifying<pb break="no" facs="nls:193209314" xml:id="kp-eb0713-9314-0607"/>
                    “to wind,” and observing that the country we are ^peaking of is watered by the
                    Maeander, so famous for its windings, concludes that it was thence named <hi
                    rend="italic">Ludia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Lydia</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    but this, it must be obvious, is too fanciful and i ’ emote a derivation to be
                    the true one. As to the ancient name of Maeonia, he takes it to be a Greek
                    translation of the Phoenician word <hi rend="italic">lud,</hi> in which he
                    agrees in some measure with Stephanus, who derives the name of Maeonia ’ τora
                    Maeon, the ancient name of the Maeander. Some take ,the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >Maeonia</hi> to be a translation of a Hebrew word sig-ιifying metal, because,
                    according to them, that country was In former times rich above any other with
                    mines. Though Lydia and Maeonia are by most authors indifferently used nr one
                    and the same country, yet they are sometimes distinguished; that part including
                    Mount Tmolus, and watered by the Pactolus, being properly called <hi
                    rend="italic">Maeonia;</hi> and the other, situated upon the coast, <hi
                    rend="italic">Lydia.</hi> This distinction s observed by Homer, Callimachus,
                    Dionysius, and other indent writers. In after ages, when the Ionians, who had
                    &gt;lanted a colony on the coast of the Aegean Sea, began to nake some figure,
                    that part was called <hi rend="italic">Ionia,</hi> and the name “f <hi
                    rend="italic">Lydia</hi> given to the ancient Maeonia. Lydia, according to
                    Pliny, Ptolemy’, and other ancient geographers, was Sounded by Mysia Major on
                    the north, by Caria on the ιouth, by Phrygia Major on the east, and by Ionia on
                    the vest, and was situated between the thirty-seventh and ,hirty-ninth degrees
                    of north latitude. But what the an-ñents style the kingdom of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lydia</hi> was not confined within hese narrow boundaries; it extended from
                    Halys to the Egean Sea. Pliny’s description includes Aeolia, situated )etween
                    the Hermus and the Caïcus.</p>
                <p>As to the origin of the Lydians, Josephus, and after him ill the ecclesiastical
                    writers, derive them from Lud, Shem’s burth son; but this opinion has no other
                    foundation than he similitude of names. Some of the ancients conceive the
                    ^ydians to have been a mixed colony of Phrygians, Mysians, ιnd Carians; but
                    others, finding some conformity in religion and religious ceremonies between the
                    Egyptians and Tuscans, who were a Lydian colony, conclude, without further
                    evidence, that they were originally Egyptians. All ve know for certain is, that
                    the Lydians were a very annent nation; and this is manifest from their fables;
                    for pltys, Tantalus, Pelops, Niobe, and Arachne, are all said to ιave been the
                    children of Lydus. Zanthus, in his <hi rend="italic">Lydiaca,</hi> Quoted by
                    Stephanus, informs us, that the ancient city of lscalon, one of the five
                    satrapies of the Philistines, men- ,ioned in the books of Joshua and the Judges,
                    was built by me Ascalus a Lydian, whom Achiamus, king of Lydia, had ιppointed to
                    command a body of troops which he sent into syria, we know not on what occasion.
                    The Heraclidae, or dngs of Lydia descended from Hercules, began to reign ιefore
                    the Trojan war, and had been preceded by a long ine of sovereigns sprung from
                    Atys, and hence styled <hi rend="italic">Myadae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a
                    strong proof of the antiquity of that kingdom. I The Lydians began very early to
                    be governed by kings, ∣vhose authority seems to have been despotic, and the
                    brown hereditary. We read of three distinct races of kings eigning over Lydia;
                    the Atyadae, the Heraclidae, and the <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> VIermnadae/
                    The <hi rend="italic">Atyadae</hi> were so called from Atys the )on of Cotys,
                    and grandson of Manes the first Lydian king. I lut the history of this family is
                    obscure and fabulous. The ítyadae were succeeded by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heraclidae,</hi> or the descen-lants of Hercules. This hero having, by the
                    direction i &gt;f the oracle, been sold as a slave to Omphale, queen of Lydia,
                    in order to expiate the murder of Iphitus, had, by me of her slaves, during his
                    captivity, a son named Cleo-aus, whose grandson Argon was the first of the
                    Heraclidae vho ascended the throne of Lydia. This race is said to ιave reigned
                    505 years, the son succeeding the father for wenty-two generations. They began
                    to reign about the ime of the Trojan war. The last of the family was the unhappy
                    Candaules, who lost both his life and kingdom by his imprudence. Of this event
                    an account is given by Herodotus. Candaules had a wife whom he passionately
                    loved, and believed to be the most beautiful of her sex. He extolled her charms
                    to Gyges his favourite, whom he used to intrust with his most important affairs;
                    and, to convince him the more of her beauty, resolved to show her to him quite
                    undressed. He accordingly placed Gyges in the porch of the chamber where the
                    queen used to undress when she went to bed, ordering him to retire after he
                    should have seen her, and take the utmost possible care not to be observed. But
                    notwithstanding all the caution he employed, she plainly discovered him going
                    out; and though she did not doubt that it was her husband’s contrivance, yet she
                    passed that night in seeming tranquillity, suppressing her resentment till next
                    morning, when she sent for Gyges, and resolutely told him that he must either by
                    his death atone for the criminal action he had been guilty of, or put to death
                    Candaules, the contriver of it, and receive both her and the kingdom of Lydia as
                    his reward. Gyges at first earnestly begged of her that she would not drive him
                    to the necessity of such a choice; but finding that he could not prevail with
                    her, and that he must either kill his master or be killed himself, he chose the
                    former part of the alternative. Being led by the queen to the same place where
                    her husband had posted him the night before, he stabbed the king whilst he was
                    asleep, marrièd the queen, and took possession of the kingdom, in which he was
                    confirmed by the response of the oracle of Delphi. But the Lydians having taken
                    up arms to revenge the death of their prince, an agreement was made between them
                    and the followers of Gyges, that if the oracle should declare him to be lawful
                    king of Lydia, he would be permitted to reign; if not, that he should resign the
                    crown to the Heraclidae. The answer of the oracle proved favourable to Gyges,
                    and he was universally acknowledged as lawful king of Lydia. Candaules is said
                    to have purchased, for its weight in gold, a picture painted by Bularchas,
                    representing a battle of the Magnetes; a circumstance which shows how early the
                    art of painting had begun to be appreciated in that country, Candaules having
                    been contemporary with Romulus.</p>
                <p>Gyges, having thus possessed himself of the kingdom of Lydia, sent many rich and
                    valuable presents to the oracle of Delphos, amongst which were six cups of gold,
                    weighing thirty talents, and greatly esteemed for the workmanship. He made war
                    upon Miletus and Smyrna, took the city of Colophon, and subdued the whole
                    country of Troas. In his reign, and by his permission, the city of Abydus was
                    built by the Milesians. Plutarch and other writers give a different account of
                    his accession to the crown of Lydia, and inform us, without making any mention
                    of the queen, that Gyges rebelled against Candaules, and slew him in an
                    engagement. In Gyges commenced the third race called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mermnadae,</hi> who were also, properly speaking, Heraclidae, being descended
                    from a son of Hercules by Omphale.</p>
                <p>Gyges reigned thirty-eight years, and was succeeded on the throne by his son
                    Ardyes. This prince carried on the war against the Milesians which his father
                    had begun, and possessed himself of Priene, which in those days was a strong
                    city. In his reign the Cimmerians invaded and overran all Asia Minor; but what
                    battles were fought between the Lydians and these invaders, and with what
                    success, we find nowhere mentioned. Herodotus only informs us, that in the time
                    of Ardyes they possessed themselves of Sardis, the metropolis of Lydia, but that
                    they failed to reduce the castle. Ardyes reigned forty-nine years, and was
                    succeeded by his son Sadyattes, who reigned twelve years, during most part of
                    which he carried on war with the Milesians.</p>
                <p>After him came his son Alyattes, who for the space of five years continued the
                    war which his father had begun <pb break="no" facs="nls:193209327"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-9327-0608"/>against the Milesians, ravaging their country, and
                    about harvest· time carrying away all their corn yearly, in order to oblige
                    them, from want of provisions, to surrender their city, which he knew he could
                    not reduce in any other way, the Milesians being at that time masters of the
                    sea. In the twelfth year of this war the Lydians having set fire to the corn in
                    the fields, the flames were carried by a violent wind, which happened at that
                    time to blow, to the temple of Minerva at Assesus, and burned it down to the
                    ground. Not long afterwards, Alyattes falling sick, sent to consult the oracle
                    at Delphos; but the god refused to return any answer until the king should
                    rebuild the temple of Minerva at Assesus. Alyattes, thus warned, despatched
                    ambassadors to Miletus, enjoining them to conclude a truce with the Milesians
                    until the temple should be rebuilt. On the arrival of the ambassadors,
                    Thrasybulus, then king of Miletus, having commanded all the corn which was at
                    that time in the city to be brought into the market-place, ordered the citizens
                    to banquet in public, and to revel as if the city were plentifully stored with
                    all manner of provisions. This stratagem Thrasybulus practised, that the
                    ambassadors, seeing such quantities of corn, and the people everywhere diverting
                    themselves, might acquaint their master with his affluence, and thus divert him
                    from pursuing the war. As Thrasybulus had intended, so it happened. Alyattes,
                    who believed the Milesians greatly distressed for provisions, receiving a
                    different account from his ambassadors, changed the truce into a lasting peace,
                    and ever afterwards lived in amity and friendship with Thrasybulus and the
                    Milesians.</p>
                <p>After a reign of fifty-seven years, he was succeeded by his son Croesus, whose
                    uninterrupted prosperity, in the first years of his reign, far eclipsed the
                    glory of his predecessors. He was the first who made war on the Ephesians, whose
                    city he besieged and took, notwithstanding their consecrating it to Diana, and
                    fastening the walls by a rope to her temple, which was seven stadia distant from
                    the city. After the reduction of Ephesus, he under various pretences attacked
                    the Ionians and Aeolians, obliging them, and all the other Greek states of Asia,
                    to pay him an annual tribute. Having met with such extraordinary success by
                    land, the Lydian prince determined to render his power equally conspicuous by
                    sea. For this purpose he had serious thoughts of equipping a fleet, with which
                    he purposed to invade and conquer the Grecian islands directly opposite to his
                    dominions. But this design, which, considering the slow progress of maritime
                    power amongst the nations most diligent in attaining it, would probably have
                    failed of success, was prevented by the advice of a philosophical traveller,
                    conveyed in such a lively turn of wit as easily changed the resolution of the
                    king. Bias of Priene in Ionia (some say Pittacus of Mitylene in the isle of
                    Lesbos), whilst he travelled, after the Grecian custom, from curiosity and a
                    love of knowledge, was presented to Croesus at the Lydian court; and being asked
                    by that prince what news he brought from Greece, answered, with a republican
                    freedom, that the islanders had collected powerful squadrons of cavalry with an
                    intention of invading Lydia. “May the gods grant,” said Croesus, “that the
                    Greeks, who are unacquainted with horsemanship, should attack the disciplined
                    valour of the Lydian cavalry; there would speedily be an end to the contest.”
                    “In the same manner,” replied Bias, “as if the Lydians, who are totally
                    unexperienced in naval affairs, should invade the Grecians by sea.” Struck by
                    the acuteness of this unexpected observation, Croesus desisted from his intended
                    expedition against the islands; and, instead of employing new means for
                    extending his conquests, detennined peaceably to enjoy the laurels he had won,
                    and to display the grandeur he had attained. But his happiness was soon
                    afterwards allayed by the death of his favourite son Atys, who was unfortunately
                    killed in the chase of a wild boar. This loss rendered him disconsolate for two
                    years, and reduced him to a state of inaction, till the conquests of Cyrus, and
                    the growing power of the Persians, roused up his martial spirit, and diverted
                    his mind to other thoughts.</p>
                <p>Croesus apprehending that the success which had attended Cyrus in all his
                    undertakings might at last prove dangerous to himself, resolved if possible to
                    put a stop to his progress. In adopting this resolution, which might probably be
                    attended with the most important consequences, he was desirous to learn the will
                    of heaven concerning the issue of the war. The principal oracles which he
                    consulted were those of Branchis in Ionia, of Ammon in Libya, and of Delphi in
                    Greece. But, amongst these respected shrines, the oracle of Delphi maintained
                    its ascendant, as the most faithful interpreter of fate. Croesus was fully
                    persuaded of its veracity; and, generously desirous to compensate the priests of
                    Apollo for the trouble which he had already given, and still meant to give, he
                    sacrificed three thousand oxen to the god, and adorned his shrine with gifts
                    equally valuable for the workmanship and for the materials, viz. precious
                    vessels of silver, ewers of iron beautifully inlaid and enamelled; various
                    ornaments of pure gold, particularly a golden lion weighing ten talents, and a
                    female figure three cubits or near five feet in height. In return for these
                    magnificent presents, the oracle, in equivocal and ambiguous language, flattered
                    Croesus with obtaining an easy victory over his enemies, and with enjoying a
                    long life and a prosperous reign. The god at the same time enjoined him to
                    contract an alliance with the most powerful of the Grecian states.</p>
                <p>Elevated with these favourable predictions of Apollo, Croesus prepared to yield a
                    ready obedience to the only condition required on his part for the
                    accomplishment of his aspiring design. Not deeming himself sufficiently
                    acquainted with the affairs of Greece to know what particular republic was meant
                    by the oracle, he made especial inquiry of those who were best informed
                    concerning the state of Europe, and discovered, that amongst all the members of
                    the Grecian confederacy, the Athenians and Lacedaemonians were justly entitled
                    to the pre-eminence. But in order .to learn which of these communities deserved
                    the epithet of “most powerful,” it was necessary to send ambassadors into
                    Greece. The Lydians despatched on this important commission soon discovered that
                    the Athenians, having been long harassed by internal dissensions, were actually
                    governed by the tyrant Pisistratus. The Spartans, on the other hand, though
                    anciently the worst regulated of all the Grecian communities, had enjoyed
                    domestic peace and foreign prosperity ever since they had adopted the wise
                    institutions of Lycurgus. After that memorable period, they had repeatedly
                    conquered the warlike Argives, triumphed over the hardy Arcadians, and,
                    notwithstanding the heroic exploits of Aristomenes, subdued and enslaved their
                    unfortunate rivals of Messene. To the Lydian ambassadors, therefore, the Spartan
                    republic appeared to be pointed out by the oracle as the community whose
                    alliance they were enjoined to solicit. Having accordingly repaired to Sparta,
                    they were introduced not only to the kings and senate, but, as the importance of
                    the negociation required, to the general assembly of the Lacedaemonians, to whom
                    they, in few words, declared the object of their commission. “Lacedaemonians, we
                    are sent by Croesus, king of the Lydians and of many other nations, who being
                    commanded by the oracle of Apollo to seek the friendship of the most powerful
                    people of Greece, now summon you, who justly merit that epithet, to become his
                    faithful allies, in obedience to the will of the god whose authority you
                    acknowledge.” The Lacedaemonians, pleased with the alliance of a warlike king,
                    and still more with the fame of their valour, readily accepted the proposal. To
                    the strict connection of an offensive and defensive league they joined the more
                    re-φected<pb break="no" facs="nls:193209340" xml:id="kp-eb0713-9340-0609"/> ties
                    of sacred hospitality. A few years before this ransaction they had sent to
                    Sardis to purchase gold for naking a statue of Apollo, and on that occasion
                    Croesus ιad gratuitously supplied their wants. Remembering this generosity, they
                    gave the Lydian ambassadors at their de- )arture, as a present for their master,
                    a vessel of brass containing three hundred amphoras (above twelve hogsheads),
                    and beautifully carved on the outside with various òrms of animals.</p>
                <p>Croesus, having thus happily accomplished the design ecommended by the oracle,
                    was eager to set out upon his n.tended expedition. He had formerly entered into
                    alli-ιnces with Amasis king of Egypt, and Labynetus king of 3abylon; and he had
                    now obtained the friendship of the nost warlike nation of Europe. The
                    newly-raised power ∙f Cyrus and the Persians seemed incapable of resisting uch a
                    formidable confederacy. Elevated with these flat-ering ideas of his own
                    invincible greatness, Croesus wait-d not to attack the Persian dominions until
                    he had col-ected the strength of his allies. The sanguine impetuosi-y of his
                    temper, unexperienced in adversity, unfortunately ∣recipitated him into measures
                    no less daring than ruinous. Attended only by the arms of Lydia, and a numerous
                    band f mercenaries, whom his immense wealth enabled him at ny time to call into
                    his service, he marched towards the liver Halys, and, having with much
                    difficulty crossed that eep and broad stream, entered the province of Cappado-
                    ∣ia, which formed the western frontier of the Median do-hinions. That
                    unfortunate country soon experienced all pe calamities of invasion. The Pterian
                    plain, the most cautiful and fertile district of Cappadocia, was laid waste; He
                    ports of the Euxine, as well as several inland cities, ere plundered, and the
                    inoffensive inhabitants were either ut to the sword or dragged into captivity.
                    Encouraged y the unresisting softness of the natives of those parts, I'roesus
                    was eager to push forwards; and if Cyrus did not reviously meet him in the
                    field, he bad determined to probed in triumph to the mountains of Persia.
                    Against this angerous resolution he was in vain exhorted by a prudent lydian
                    named Sandanis, who, when asked his opinion of he war, declared it with that
                    freedom which the princes ∣f the East have in every age permitted, amidst all
                    the ride and caprices of despotic power, to men distinguished y the gifts of
                    nature or education. “You are preparing,” ⅛id he, “to march against a people who
                    lead a laborious E∣d a miserable life; whose daily subsistence is often deed
                    them, and is always scanty and precarious; who drink nly water, and who are
                    clothed with nothing but the skins if wild beasts. What can the Lydians gain by
                    the conquest If Persia; the Lydians, who enjoy all the advantages of! mich the
                    Persians are destitute? For my part, I deem it ìblessing of the gods that they
                    have not excited the war-ke poverty of these miserable barbarians to invade and
                    ∣⅛under the luxurious wealth of Lydia.” The moderation f this advice was
                    rejected by the fatal presumption of 'roesus; confounding the dictates of
                    experienced wisdom ∙ith the mean suggestions of pusillanimity, he dismissed ιe
                    prudent counsellor with contempt, and prepared to prolocute his fatal
                    enterprise.</p>
                <p>I Meanwhile, the approach of Cyrus, who was not of a ∣ <hi rend="superscript">
                    t</hi> mper to permit his dominions to be ravished with impurity, afforded the
                    Lydian king an opportunity of bringing fie war to a more speedy issue than by
                    his intended ex-edition into Persia. The army of Cyrus gradually augmented as he
                    advanced; the tributary princes cheerfully mtributing with their united strength
                    towards the assis-; nee of a master whose valour and generosity they ad-fired,
                    and who now took arms to protect the safety of his objects, as well as to
                    support the grandeur of his throne, inch was the rapidity of his movement,
                    especially after ting informed of the destructive ravages of the enemy in
                    Cappadocia, that he marched from the shores of the Caspian to those of the
                    Euxine Sea before the army of Croesus had provided the necessaries for their
                    advance. That prince,’ when apprized of the neighbourhood of the Persians,
                    encamped on the Pterian plain; Cyrus likewise took up a position at no great
                    distance; frequent skirmishes occurred between the light troops; and at length a
                    general engagement was fought with equal fury and perseverance, and only
                    terminated by the darkness of night. The loss on both sides prevented a renewal
                    of the battle. But the numbers as well as the courage of the Persians much
                    exceeded the expectation of Croesus; and as they discovered no intention of
                    harassing his retreat, he determined to fall back towards Sardis, in order to
                    spend the winter in the amusements of his palace, and, after summoning his
                    numerous allies to his standard, to take the field early in the spring with such
                    increase of force as would be sufficient to overpower the Persians.</p>
                <p>But this design was defeated by the watchful vigilance of Cyrus. That experienced
                    leader allowed the enemy to retire without molestation, carefully informing
                    himself of every movement they made, and of every measure they seemed determined
                    to pursue. Patiently watching the opportunity of a just revenge, he waited until
                    Croesus had re-entered his capital, and disbanded the foreign mercenaries, who
                    composed the most numerous division of his army. Cyrus then put his Persians in
                    motion; and such was his celerity, that he brought the first intelligence of his
                    own arrival in the plain of Sardis. Croesus, whose firmness might well have been
                    shaken by the imminence of this unforeseen danger, was not wanting on the
                    present occasion to the duties which he owed to his fame and the lustre of the
                    Lydian throne. Though his mercenaries were disbanded, his own subjects, who
                    served him from attachment, who had been long accustomed to victory, and who
                    were animated with a high sense of national honour, burned with a desire to
                    check the daring insolence of the invaders. Croesus indulged and encouraged this
                    generous ardour. The Lydians in that age fought on horseback, armed with long
                    spears; the strength of the Persians consisted in their infantry. The latter
                    were so little accustomed to the use of horses, that camels were almost the only
                    animals which they employed as beasts of burden. This circumstance suggested to
                    a Mede, by name Harpagus, a stratagem, which, being communicated to Cyrus, was
                    immediately adopted with the approbation of that prince. Harpagus, having
                    observed that horses had a strong aversion to the shape and smell of camels,
                    advised that the Persian army should be drawn up in the following order: All the
                    camels which had been employed to carry baggage and provisions were collected
                    into one body, and arranged in a line fronting the Lydian cavalry. The foot
                    soldiers of the Persians were posted immediately behind this line, and placed at
                    a due distance; and the Median horse, a few squadrons of which followed the
                    standard of Cyrus, formed the rear of the army. As the troops on both sides
                    approached to join battle, the Lydian cavalry, terrified at the unusual
                    appearance of the camels, mounted with men in arms, were thrown into disorder,
                    and the horses, turning their heads, endeavoured to escape from the field.
                    Croesus, who perceived the confusion, was ready to despair of his fortune; but
                    the Lydians, abandoning their horses, prepared with uncommon bravery to attack
                    the enemy on foot. Their courage deserved a better fate; but, unaccustomed as
                    they were to this mode of fighting, they were received and repelled by the
                    experienced valour of the Persian infantry, and obliged to take refuge within
                    the fortified strength of Sardis, where they imagined themselves secure. The
                    walls of that city bade defiance to the rude art of attack, as then practised by
                    the most warlike nations. If the Persian army should invest it, the Lydians <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193209353" xml:id="kp-eb0713-9353-0610"/> were provided
                    with provisions for several years; and there was reason to expect that in a few
                    months, nay even weeks, they would receive such assistance from Egypt,
                    Babylonia, and Greece, to which countries they had already sent ambassadors, as
                    would oblige the Persians to raise the siege.</p>
                <p>The Lydian ministers despatched into Greece met with great sympathy from the
                    Spartans. That people were particularly observant of the faith of treaties; and
                    whilst they punished their enemies with unexampled severity, they behaved with
                    generous compassion towards those whom they had once accepted as allies. They
                    immediately resolved therefore to send speedy and effectual relief to Croesus;
                    and for this purpose they assembled their troops, made ready their vessels, and
                    prepared every thing necessary for the expedition. The valour of the Spartans
                    might perhaps have upheld the sinking empire of Lydia; but before their armament
                    set sail, Croesus was no longer a sovereign. Notwithstanding the strength of
                    Sardis, that city had been taken by storm on the twentieth day of the siege; the
                    walls having been scaled in a quarter which, appearing altogether inaccessible,
                    was too carelessly guarded. This was effected by the enterprise of Hyreades, a
                    Mede, who accidentally observed a sentinel descend part of the rock in order to
                    recover his helmet. Hyreades was a native of the mountainous province of Mardia,
                    and, being accustomed to clamber over the dangerous precipices of his native
                    country, resolved to try his activity in passing the rock upon which he had
                    discovered the Lydian. The design was more easily accomplished than he had
                    reason to expect; emulation and success encouraged the bravest of the Persians
                    to follow his example; these were supported by great numbers of their
                    countrymen; the garrison of Sardis was surprised, the citadel stormed, and the
                    rich capital of Lower Asia subjected to the vengeful rapacity of an indignant
                    conqueror. Thus ended the ancient kingdom of Lydia, which continued subject to
                    the Persians until they in their turn were conquered by the Macedonians.</p>
