                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">LAMBIN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Denis</hi></label>, one of the
                    most learned Frenchmen of the sixteenth century, was born at Montreuil-sur-Mer,
                    in Picardy, about the year 1516. He studied at the College of Amiens, where he
                    afterwards officiated for some years as professor of belles-lettres. He then
                    accompanied Cardinal de Tournon to Rome, and profited by his stay in Italy to
                    visit the principal cities, and to form friendly connections with the learned
                    men of that country. On his return to Paris, he was appointed professor of
                    eloquence in the Royal College, through the influence of Amyot and the Cardinals
                    of Lorraine and of Tournon; and the following year he was promoted to the chair
                    of Greek. He commenced his prelections by an excellent discourse, in which he
                    traced out the course which he proposed to follow, and announced that he would
                    explain alternately the Iliad and the Philippics, the two works best calculated
                    to form poets and orators. The number of his auditors was considerable; but the
                    contagious malady which then devastated Paris soon thinned his class, and also
                    carried off a nephew to whom he was much attached, an event which drove him to
                    seek, in a distant retreat, some alleviation of the grief which overwhelmed him.
                    But his prelections were not long interrupted; and although already
                    overburthened with labour, he consented, in the year 1570, to explain Cicero to
                    some select pupils in the College of Lemoine. A witness of the civil troubles
                    which then distracted France, Lambin bewailed them in secret; the massacre of
                    the Protestants made a terrible impression on his mild and gentle spirit; and
                    whilst the sorrow thus occasioned was recent and fresh, the news of the death of
                    his friend Ramus arrived to complete his affliction. Unable to bear up under
                    such an accumulation of calamities, he sunk the victim of grief, and died
                    towards the end of September 1572, about a month after the tragedy of St
                    Bartholomew. By his marriage with a lady of the house of the Ursins he left a
                    son, who became preceptor to Arnauld and Andilly, and who also possessed much
                    erudition. Lambin, though of a mild and modest character, had nevertheless his
                    enemies. He was accused of appropriating the researches of his contemporaries
                    without due acknowledgment; but there appears to be no foundation whatever for
                    the charge. On the contrary, it was Lambin himself who had reason to complain of
                    the plagiarisms of Muretus and his disciple Giphanius. He had also a warm
                    dispute with Paulus Manutius on the orthography of the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >consumptus,</hi> from which Lambin maintained that the letter <hi rend="italic"
                    >ρ</hi> ought to be expunged; and it is even said that the disputants became so
                    warm, that, in the course of this absurd controversy, they proceeded from mutual
                    reproaches to blows. The style of Lambin is easy and pure, but diffuse and
                    somewhat heavy; and his enemies characterised it by the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lambiner,</hi> which has remained in the language. The works of this laborious
                    scholar are, 1. Latin Translations of the Select Speeches of Aeschines and
                    Demosthenes, Paris, 1565, in 4to; of the Speeches of Demosthenes on the Crown,
                    ibid. 1587, in 4to; and of the Morals and Politics of Aristotle, reprinted in
