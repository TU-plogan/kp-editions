                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">LAW</label> (says Blackstone, from whose work the following
                    observations are abridged), in its most general and comprehensive sense,
                    signifies a rule of action; and is applied indiscriminately to all kinds of
                    action, whether animate or inanimate, rational or irrational. Thus we say, the
                    laws of motion, of gravitation, of optics, of mechanics, as well as the laws of
                    nature and of nations. And it is that rule of action which is prescribed by some
                    superior, and which the inferior is bound to obey.</p>
                <p>Thus, when the <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> Supreme Being formed the universe,
                    and created matter out of nothing, he impressed certain principles upon that
                    matter, from which it can never depart, and without which it would cease to be.
                    When he put that matter into motion, he established certain laws of motion, to
                    which all moveable bodies must conform. And, to descend from the greatest
                    operations to the smallest, when a workman forms a clock or other piece of
                    mechanism, he establishes at his own pleasure certain arbitrary laws for its
                    direction, as, that the hand shall describe a given space in a given time; to
                    which law as long as the work conforms, so long it continues in perfection, and
                    answers the end of its formation.</p>
                <p>If we advance farther, from mere inactive matter to vege <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193203082" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3082-0129"/>table and animal life, we
                    shall find them still governed by laws, more numerous indeed, but equally fixed
                    and invariable. The whole progress of plants, from the seed to the root, and
                    from thence to the seed again; the method of animal nutrition, digestion,
                    secretion, and all other branches of vital economy; are not left to chance, or
                    the will of the creature itself, but are performed in a wondrous involuntary
                    manner, and guided by unerring rules laid down by the great Creator.</p>
                <p>This, then, is the general signification of law, a rule of action dictated by
                    some superior being. And, in those creatures that have neither the power to
                    think nor to will, such laws must be invariably obeyed, so long as the creature
                    itself subsists; for its existence depends on that obedience. But laws, in their
                    more confined sense, and in which it is our present business to consider them,
                    denote the rules, not of action in general, but of <hi rend="italic">human</hi>
                    action or conduct; that is, the precepts by which man, the noblest of all
                    sublunary beings, a creature endowed with both reason and free will, is
                    commanded to make use of those faculties in the general regulation of his
                    behaviour.</p>
                <p>Man, considered as a creature, must necessarily be subject to the laws of his
                    Creator, for he is entirely a dependent being. A being independent of any other
                    has no rule to pursue but such as he prescribes to himself; but a state of
                    dependence will inevitably oblige the inferior to take the will of him on whom
                    he depends as the rule of his conduct, not indeed in every particular, but in
                    all those points wherein his dependence consists. This principle, therefore, has
                    more or less extent and effect, in proportion as the superiority of the one and
                    the dependence of the other is greater or less absolute or limited. And
                    consequently, as man depends absolutely upon his Maker for every thing, it is
                    necessary that he should in all points conform to his Maker’s will.</p>
                <p>This will of his Maker is called the <hi rend="italic">law of nature.</hi> For as
                    God, when he created matter, and endued ιt <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> with a
                    principle of mobility, established certain rules for the perpetual direction of
                    that motion; so, when he created man, and endued him with free will to conduct
                    himself in all parts of life, he laid down certain immutable laws of human
                    nature, whereby that free will is in some degree regulated and restrained, and
                    gave him also the faculty of reason to discover the purport of those laws.</p>
                <p>Considering the Creator only as a being of infinite power, he was able
                    unquestionably to have prescribed whatever laws he pleased to his creature man,
                    however unjust or severe. But as he is also a Being of infinite wisdom, he has
                    laid down only such laws as were founded in those relations of justice that
                    existed in the nature of things antecedent to any positive precept. These are
                    the eternal immutable laws of good and evil, to which the Creator himself in all
                    his dispensations conforms, and which he has enabled human reason to discover,
                    so far as they are necessary for the conduct of human actions. Such, among
                    others, is the principle, that we should live honestly, hurt nobody, and render
                    to every one his due; to which three general precepts Justinian has reduced the
                    whole doctrine of law.</p>
                <p>But if the discovery of these first principles of the law of nature depended only
                    upon the due exertion of right reason, and could not otherwise be obtained than
                    by a chain of metaphysical disquisitions, mankind would have wanted some
                    inducement to have quickened their inquiries, and the greater part of the world
                    would have rested content in mental indolence, and ignorance, its inseparable
                    companion. As therefore the Creator is a being not only of infinite power and
                    wisdom, but also of infinite goodness, he has been pleased so to contrive the
                    constitution and frame of humanity, that we should want no other prompter to
                    inquire after and pursue the rule of right, but only our own self-love, that
                    universal principle of action. For he has so intimately connected, so
                    inseparably interwoven, the laws of eternal justice with the happiness of each
                    individual, that the latter cannot be attained but by observing the former; and
                    if the former be punctually obeyed, it cannot but induce the latter. In
                    consequence of which mutual connection of justice and human felicity, he has not
                    perplexed the law of nature with a multitude of abstracted rules and precepts,
                    referring merely to the fitness or unfitness of things, as some have vainly
                    surmised; but has graciously reduced the rule of obedience to this one paternal
                    precept, “that man should pursue his own happiness.” This is the foundation of
                    what we call <hi rend="italic">ethics,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">natural
                    law</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for the several articles into which it is
                    branched in our systems amount to no more than demonstrating that this or that
                    action tends to man’s real happiness, and therefore very justly concluding, that
                    the performance of it is a part of the law of nature; or, on the other hand,
                    that this or that action is destructive of man’s real happiness, and therefore
                    that the law of nature forbids it.</p>
                <p>This law of nature, being coeval with mankind, and dictated by God himself, is of
                    course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe, in
                    all countries, and at all times: no human laws are of any validity if contrary
                    to this, and such of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their
                    authority, mediately or immediately, from this original.</p>
                <p>But in order to apply this to the particular exigencies of each individual, it is
                    still necessary to have recourse to reason; whose office it is to discover, as
                    was before observed, what the law of nature directs in every circumstance of
                    life, by considering what method will tend the most effectually to our own
                    substantial happiness. And if our reason were always, as in our first ancestor
                    before his transgression, clear and perfect, unruffled by passions, unclouded by
                    prejudice, unimpaired by disease or intemperance, the task would be pleasant and
                    easy; we should need no other guide but this. But every man now finds the
                    contrary in his own experience; that his reason is corrupt, and his
                    understanding full of ignorance and error.</p>
                <p>This has given manifold occasion for the benign interposition of Divine
                    Providence; which, in compassion to the frailty, the imperfection, and the
                    blindness of human reason, hath been pleased, at sundry times and in divers
                    manners, to discover and enforce its laws by an immediate and direct revelation.
                    The doctrines thus delivered we call the <hi rend="italic">revealed</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">divine law,</hi> and they are to be found only in the Holy
                    Scriptures. These precepts, when revealed, are found upon comparison to be
                    really a part of the original law of nature, as they tend in all their
                    consequences to man’s felicity. But we are not from thence to conclude, that the
                    knowledge of these truths was attainable by reason in its present corrupted
                    state; since we find that, until they were revealed, they were hid from the
                    wisdom of ages. As then the moral precepts of this law are indeed of the same
                    original with those of the law of nature, so their intrinsic obligation is of
                    equal strength and perpetuity. Yet undoubtedly the revealed law is of infinitely
                    more authenticity than that moral system which is framed by ethical writers, and
                    denominated the <hi rend="italic">natural law</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi>
                    because the one is the law of nature, expressly declared so to be by God
                    himself; the other is only what, by the assistance of human reason, we imagine
                    to be that law. If we could be as certain of the latter as we are of the former,
                    both would have an equal authority; but till then they can never be put in any
                    competition together.</p>
                <p>Upon these two foundations, the law of nature and the law of revelation, depend
                    all human laws; that is to say, no human laws should be suffered to contradict
                    these. There are, it is true, a great number of indifferent points, in which
                    both the divine law and the natural leave a man <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193203095" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3095-0130"/>at his own liberty, but which
                    are found necessary, for the benefit of society, to be restrained within certain
                    limits. And herein it is that human laws have their greatest force and efficacy;
                    for, with regard to such points as are not indifferent, human laws are only
                    declaratory of, and act in subordination to, the former. To instance in the case
                    of murder: This is expressly forbidden by the divine, and demonstrably by the
                    natural law; and from these prohibitions arises the true unlawfulness of this
                    crime. Those human laws that annex a punishment to it do not at all increase its
                    moral guilt, or superadd any fresh obligation in <hi rend="italic">foro
                    conscientiae</hi> to abstain from its perpetration. Nay, if any human law should
                    allow or enjoin us to commit it, we are bound to transgress that human law, or
                    else we must offend both the natural and the divine. But, with regard to matters
                    that are in themselves indifferent, and are not commanded or forbidden by those
                    superior laws; such, for instance, as exporting of wool into foreign countries;
                    here the inferior legislature has scope and opportunity to interpose, and to
                    make that action unlawful which before was not so.</p>
                <p>If man were to live in a state of nature, unconnected with other individuals,
                    there would be no occasion for any other laws than the law of nature and the law
                    of God. Neither could any other law possibly exist; for a law always supposes
                    some superior who is to make it; and in a state of nature we are all equal,
                    without any other superior but him who is the Author of our being. But man was
                    formed for society; and, as is demonstrated by the writers on this subject, is
                    neither capable of living alone, nor indeed has the courage to do it. I4owever,
                    as it is impossible for the whole race of mankind to be united in one great
                    society, they must necessarily divide into many, and form separate states,
                    commonwealths, and nations, entirely independent of each other, and yet liable
                    to a mutual intercourse. Hence arises a third kind of law to regulate this
                    mutual intercourse, called <hi rend="italic">the law of nations</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> which, as none of these states will acknowledge a
                    superiority in the other, cannot be dictated by either, but depends entirely
                    upon the rules of natural law, or upon mutual compacts, treaties, leagues, and
                    agreements, between these several communities; in the construction also of which
                    compacts we have no other rule to resort to but the law of nature, being the
                    only one to which both communities are equally subject; and therefore the civil
                    law very justly observes, that <hi rend="italic">quod naturalis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ratio inter</hi><hi rend="italic">omnes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >homines</hi><hi rend="italic">constituit, vocatur</hi><hi rend="italic">jus
                    gentium.</hi> See the article on the <hi rend="smallcaps">Law of
                    Nations.</hi></p>
                <p>To the consideration, then, of the law of nature, the revealed law, and the law
                    of nations, succeeds that of the municipal or civil law; that is, the rule by
                    which particular districts, communities, or nations, are governed; being thus
                    defined by Justinian, “<hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >est</hi><hi rend="italic">quod</hi><hi rend="italic">quisque</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sibi</hi><hi rend="italic">populus constituit”</hi> We call it <hi
                    rend="italic">municipal</hi> law, in compliance with common speech; for though,
                    strictly, that expression denotes the particular customs of one single <hi
                    rend="italic">municipium</hi> or free town, yet it may with sufficient propriety
                    be applied to any one state or nation which is governed by the same laws and
                    customs. Municipal law, thus understood, is properly defined to be “a rule of
                    civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power in a state, commanding what is
                    right, and prohibiting what is wrong.” Let us endeavour to explain its several
                    properties, as they arise out of this definition.</p>
                <p>And, first, it is a rwZe; not a transient sudden order from a superior to or
                    concerning a particular person; but something permanent, uniform, and universal.
                    Therefore a particular act of the legislature to confiscate the goods of Titius,
                    or to attaint him of high treason, does not enter into the idea of a municipal
                    law; for the operation of this act is spent upon Titius only, and has no
                    relation to the community in general; it is rather a sentence than a law. But an
                    act to declare that the crime of which Titius is accused shall be deemed high
                    treason; this has permanency, uniformity, and universality, and therefore is
                    properly a <hi rend="italic">rule.</hi> It is also called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >rule,</hi> to distinguish it from <hi rend="italic">advice</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">counsel,</hi> which we are at liberty to follow or not as we see
                    proper, and to judge upon the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the thing
                    advised; whereas our obedience to the law depends not upon <hi rend="italic">our
                    approbation,</hi> but upon the <hi rend="italic">makers will.</hi> Counsel is
                    only matter of persuasion, law is matter of injunction; counsel acts only upon
                    the willing, law upon the unwilling also.</p>
                <p>It is also called a <hi rend="italic">rule,</hi> to distinguish it from a <hi
                    rend="italic">compact</hi> or <hi rend="italic">agreement</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> for a compact is a promise proceeding from us, law is a command directed
                    to us. The language of a compact is, “I will, or will not, do this that of a law
                    is, “Thou shalt, or shalt not, do it.” It is true there is an obligation which a
                    compact carries with it, equal in point of conscience to that of a law; but then
                    the original of the obligation is different. In compacts, we ourselves determine
                    and promise what shall be done, before we are obliged to do it; in laws, we are
                    obliged to act without ourselves determining or promising any thing at all. Upon
                    these accounts law is defined to be “a rule.”</p>
                <p>Municipal law is also “a rule of <hi rend="italic">civil conduct”</hi> This
                    distinguishes municipal law from the natural or revealed; the former of which is
                    the rule of moral conduct; and the latter not only the rule of moral conduct,
                    but also of faith. These regard man as a creature, and point out his duty to
                    God, to himself, and to his neighbour, considered in the light of an individual.
                    But municipal or civil law regards him also as a citizen, and bound to other
                    duties towards his neighbour than those of mere nature and religion; duties
                    which he has engaged in by enjoying the benefits of the common union, and which
                    amount to no more than that he do contribute, on his part, to the subsistence
                    and peace of the society.</p>
                <p>It is likewise “a rule <hi rend="italic">prescribed</hi> because a bare
                    resolution, confined in the breast of the legislator, without manifesting itself
                    by some external sign, can never be properly a law. It is requisite that this
                    resolution be notified to the people who are to obey it. But the manner in which
                    this notification is to be made is matter of very great indifference. It may be
                    notified by universal tradition and long practice, which supposes a previous
                    publication, and is the case of the common law of England and of Scotland. It
                    may be notified <hi rend="italic">viva voce,</hi> by officers appointed for that
                    purpose, as is done with regard to proclamations, and such acts of parliament as
                    are appointed to be publicly read in churches and other assemblies. It may,
                    lastly, be notified by writing, printing, or the like; which is the general
                    course taken with all our acts of parliament. Yet, whatever way is made use of,
                    it is incumbent on the promulgators to do it in the most public and perspicuous
                    manner; not like Caligula, who (according to Dio Cassius) wrote his laws in a
                    very small character, and hung them up upon high pillars, the-more effectually
                    to ensnare the people. There is still a more unreasonable method than this,
                    which is called making of laws <hi rend="italic">ex post facto</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> when, after an action (indifferent in itself) is committed,
                    the legislator then for the first time declares it to have been a crime, and
                    inflicts a punishment upon the person who has committed it. Here it is
                    impossible that the party could foresee that an action, innocent when it was
                    done, should be afterwards converted to guilt by a subsequent law: he had
                    therefore no cause to abstain from it; and all punishment for not abstaining
                    must of consequence be cruel and unjust. All laws should be therefore made to
                    commence <hi rend="italic">infuturο,</hi> and be notified before their
                    commencement; which is implied in the term “prescribed.” But when this rule is
                    in the usual manner notified or prescribed, it is then the subject’s <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193203108" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3108-0131"/> business to be
                    thoroughly acquainted therewith; for if ignorance of what he might know were
                    admitted as a legitimate excuse, the laws would be of no effect, but might
                    always be eluded with impunity.</p>
                <p>But further, municipal law is “a rule of civil conduct prescribed <hi
                    rend="italic">by the supreme power in a state</hi> for legislature, as was
                    before observed, is the greatest act of superiority that can be exercised by one
                    being over another. Wherefore it is requisite to the very essence of a law, that
                    it be made by the supreme power. Sovereignty and legislature are indeed
                    controvertible terms; one cannot subsist without the other.</p>
                <p>This will naturally lead us into a short inquiry concerning the nature of society
                    and civil government; and the natural inherent right that belongs to the
                    sovereignty of a state, wherever that sovereignty be lodged, of making and
                    enforcing laws.</p>
                <p>From what has been advanced, the truth of the former branch of our definition is,
                    we trust, sufficiently evident; that “municipal law is a rule of civil conduct,
                    prescribed <hi rend="italic">by the supreme power in a state?'</hi> We proceed
                    now to the latter branch of it; that it is a rule so prescribed, “commanding
                    what is right, and prohibiting what is wrong.”</p>
                <p>Now, in order to do this completely, it is first of all necessary that the
                    boundaries of right and wrong be established and ascertained by law. And when
                    this is once done, it will follow of course, that it is likewise the business of
                    the law, considered as a rule of civil conduct, to enforce these rights, and to
                    restrain or redress these wrongs. It remains therefore only to consider, in what
                    manner the law is said to ascertain the boundaries of right and wrong, and the
                    methods which it takes to command the one and prohibit the other.</p>
                <p>For this purpose, every law may be said to consist of several parts: one,
                    declaratory, whereby the rights to be observed, and the wrongs to be eschewed,
                    are clearly defined and laid down; another, directory, whereby the subject is
                    intrusted and enjoined to observe those rights, and to abstain from the
                    commission of those wrongs; a third, remedial, whereby a method is pointed out
                    to recover a man’s private rights, or redress his private wrongs: to which may
                    be added a fourth, usually termed the <hi rend="italic">sanction</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">vindicatory</hi> branch of the law, whereby it is signified what
                    evil or penalty shall be incurred by such as commit any public wrongs, and
                    transgress or neglect their duty.</p>
                <p>With regard to the first of these, the <hi rend="italic">declaratory</hi> part of
                    the municipal law, this depends not so much upon the law of revelation or of
                    nature, as upon the wisdom and will of the legislator. This doctrine, which
                    before was slightly touched, deserves a more particular explication. Those
                    rights, then, which God and nature have established, and are therefore called
                    <hi rend="italic">natural rights,</hi> such as are life and liberty, need not
                    the aid of human laws to be more effectually invested in every man than they
                    are; neither do they receive any additional strength when declared by the
                    municipal laws to be inviolable. On the contrary, no human legislature has power
                    to abridge or destroy them, unless the owner shall himself commit some act that
                    amounts to a forfeiture. Neither do divine or natural <hi rend="italic"
                    >duties</hi> (such as, for instance, the worship of God, the maintenance of
                    children, and the like) receive any stronger sanction from being also declared
                    to be duties by the law of the land. The case is the samp as to crimes and
                    misdemeanors, that are forbidden by the superior laws, and therefore styled <hi
                    rend="italic">mala in se,</hi> such as murder, theft, and perjury; which
                    contract no additional turpitude from being declared unlawful by the inferior
                    legislature. For that legislature in all these cases acts only, as was before
                    observed, in subordination to the Great Lawgiver, transcribing and publishing
                    his precepts. So that, upon the <hi rend="italic">I</hi> whole, the declaratory
                    part of the municipal law has no force or operation at all, with regard to
                    actions that are naturally and intrinsically right or wrong.</p>
                <p>But with regard to things in themselves indifferent, the case is entirely
                    altered. These become either right or wrong, just or unjust, duties or
                    misdemeanors, according as the municipal legislator sees proper for promoting
                    the welfare of the society, and more effectually carrying on the purposes of
                    civil life. Thus our own common law has declared, that the goods of the wife do
                    instantly upon marriage become the property and right of the husband; and our
                    statute law has declared all monopolies a public offence; yet that right and
                    this offence have no foundation in nature, but are merely created by the law,
                    for the purposes of civil society. And sometimes, where the thing itself has its
                    rise from the law of nature, the particular circumstances and mode of doing it
                    become right or wrong, as the laws of the land shall direct. Thus, for instance,
                    in civil duties, obedience to superiors is the doctrine of revealed as well as
                    natural religion; but who those superiors shall be, and in what circumstances,
                    or to what degrees, they shall be obeyed, is the province of human laws to
                    determine. And so, as to injuries or crimes, it must be left to our own
                    legislature to decide in what cases the seizing another’s cattle shall amount to
                    the crime of robbery; and where it shall be a justifiable action, as when a
                    landlord takes them by way of distress for rent.</p>
                <p>Thus much for the declaratory part of the municipal law. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >directory</hi> stands much upon the same footing; for this virtually includes
                    the former, the declaration being usually collected from the direction. The law
                    that says, “thou shalt not steal,” implies a declaration that stealing is a
                    crime. And we have seen, that, in things naturally indifferent, the very essence
                    of right and wrong depends upon the direction of the laws to do or to omit
                    them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Υ</hi> ∖∖ <hi rend="italic">ο, remedial</hi> part of a law is
                    so necessary a consequence of the two former, that laws must be very vague and
                    imperfect without it. For in vain would rights be declared, in vain directed to
                    be observed, if there were no method of recovering and asserting those rights
                    when wrongfully withheld or invaded. This is what we mean properly when we speak
                    of the protection of the law. When, for instance, the declaratory part of the
                    law has said that “the field or inheritance which belonged to Titius’s father is
                    vested by his death in Titius,” and the directory part has “forbidden any one to
                    enter on another’s property without the leave of the owner ;” if Gaius after
                    this will presume to take possession of the land, the remedial part of the law
                    will then interpose its office, will make Gaius restore the possession of
                    Titius, and also pay him damages for the invasion.</p>
                <p>With regard to the sanction of laws, or the evil that may attend the breach of
                    public duties, it is observed, that human legislators have for the most part
                    chosen to make the sanction of their laws rather vindicatory than remu-neratory,
                    or to consist rather in punishments than in actual particular rewards; because,
                    in the first place, the quiet enjoyment and protection of all our civil rights
                    and liberties, which are the sure and general consequence of obedience to the
                    municipal law, are in themselves the best and most valuable or all rewards;
                    because also, were the exercise of every virtue to be enforced by the proposal
                    of particular rewards, it were impossible for any state to furnish stock enough
                    for so profuse a bounty; and farther, because the dread of evil is a much more
                    forcible principle of human actions than the prospect of good. For which
                    reasons, though a prudent bestowing of rewards is sometimes of exquisite use,
                    yet we find that those civil laws, which enforce and enjoin our duty, do seldom,
                    if ever, propose any privilege or gift to such as obey the law, but <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193203121" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3121-0132"/> do constantly
                    come armed with a penalty denounced against transgressors, either expressly
                    defining the nature and quantity of the punishment, or else leaving it to the
                    discretion of the judges, and those who are intrusted with the care of putting
                    the laws in execution.</p>
                <p>Of all the parts of a law, the most effectual is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vindicatory</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for it is but lost labour to say, “Do
                    this, or avoid that,” unless we also declare, “This shall be the consequence of
                    your non-compliance.” We must therefore observe, that the main strength and
                    force of a law consists in the penalty annexed to it. Herein is to be found the
                    principal obligation of human laws.</p>
                <p>Legislators and their laws are said to <hi rend="italic">compel</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">oblige:</hi> not that, by any natural violence, they so constrain
                    a man as to render it impossible for him to act otherwise than as they direct,
                    which is the strict sense of obligation; but because, by declaring and
                    exhibiting a penalty against offenders, they bring it to pass, that no man can
                    easily choose to transgress the law; since, by reason of the impending
                    correction, compliance is in a high degree preferable to disobedience. And, even
                    where rewards are proposed as well as punishments threatened, the obligation of
                    the law seems chiefly to consist in the penalty: for rewards, in their nature,
                    can only persuade and allure; nothing is compulsory but punishment.</p>
                <p>It has been held true, and very justly, by the principal of our ethical writers,
                    that human laws are binding upon men’s consciences. But, if that were the only
                    or most forcible obligation, the good only would regard the laws, and the bad
                    would set them at defiance. And, true as this principle is, it must still be
                    understood with some restriction. It holds, we apprehend, as to <hi
                    rend="italic">rights</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and that, when the law has
                    determined the field to belong to Titius, it is a matter of conscience no longer
                    to withhold or to invade it. So also in regard to <hi rend="italic">natural
                    duties,</hi> and such offences as are <hi rend="italic">mala in se.</hi> Here we
                    are bound in conscience, because we are bound by superior laws, before those
                    human laws were in being, to perform the one and abstain from the other. But in
                    relation to those laws which enjoin only positive duties, and forbid only such
                    things as are not <hi rend="italic">mala in se,</hi> but <hi rend="italic"
                    >mala</hi><hi rend="italic">prohibita</hi> merely, without any intermixture of
                    moral guilt, annexing a penalty to non-compliance; here conscience seems to be
                    no farther concerned, than by directing a submission to the penalty, in case of
                    our breach of those laws: for otherwise the multitude of penal laws in a state
                    would not only be looked upon as an impolitic, but would also be a very wicked
                    thing, if every such law were a snare for the conscience of the subject. But in
                    these cases the alternative is offered to every man; “either abstain from this,
                    or submit to such a penalty ;” and his conscience will be clear, whichever side
                    of the alternative he thinks proper to embrace. Thus, by the statutes for
                    preserving the game, a penalty is denounced against every unqualified person
                    that kills a hare, and against every person who possesses a partridge in August.
                    And so too, by other statutes, pecuniary penalties are inflicted for exercising
                    trades without serving an apprenticeship thereto, for erecting cottages without
                    annexing four acres of land to each, for not burying the dead in woollen, for
                    not performing statute work on the public roads, and for innumerable other
                    positive misdemeanors. Now these prohibitory laws do not make the transgression
                    a moral offence, or sin; the only obligation in conscience is to submit to the
                    penalty, if levied. It must, however, be observed, that we are here speaking of
                    laws that are simply and purely penal, where the thing forbidden or enjoined is
                    wholly a matter of indifference, and where the penalty inflicted is an adequate
                    compensation for the civil inconvenience supposed to rise from the offence. But
                    where disobedience to law involves in it also any degree of public mischief or
                    private injury, there it falls within our former distinction, and is also an
                    offence against conscience.</p>
                <p>We have now gone through the definition laid down of a municipal law; and have
                    shown that it is “a rule of civil conduct, prescribed by the supreme power in a
                    state, commanding what is right, and prohibiting what is wrong;” in the
                    explication of which we have endeavoured to interweave a few useful principles
                    concerning the nature of civil government, and the obligation of human laws.
                    Before we conclude this part, it may not be amiss to add a few observations
                    concerning the interpretation of laws.</p>
                <p>When any doubt arose upon the construction of the Roman laws, the usage was to
                    state the case to the emperor in writing, and take his opinion upon it. This was
                    certainly a bad method of interpretation. To interrogate the legislature to
                    decide particular disputes, is not only endless, but affords great room for
                    partiality and oppression. The answers of the emperor were called his rescripts,
                    and these'had in succeeding cases the force of perpetual laws; though they ought
                    to be carefully distinguished, by every rational civilian, from those general
                    constitutions which had only the nature of things for their guide. The Emperor
                    Macrinus, as his historian Capitolinus informs us, had once resolved to abolish
                    these rescripts, and retain only the general edicts: he could not bear that the
                    hasty and crude answers of such princes as Commodus and Caracalla should be
                    reverenced as laws. But Justinian thought otherwise, and he has preserved them
                    all. In like manner, the canon laws, or decretal epistles of the popes, are all
                    of them rescripts in the strictest sense. Contrary to all true forms of
                    reasoning, they argue from particulars to generals.</p>
                <p>The fairest and most rational method to interpret the will <hi rend="subscript">
                    ι</hi> fof the legislator, is by exploring his intentions at the time when the
                    law was made, by signs the most natural and probable. And these signs are either
                    the words, the context, the subject-matter, the effects and consequence, or the
                    spirit and reason of the law. Let us take a short view of them all.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Words</hi> are generally to be understood in their usual and
                    most known signification; not so much regarding the propriety of grammar, as
                    their general and popular use. Thus the law mentioned by Puffendorf, which
                    forbade a layman to lay hands on a priest, was adjudged to extend to him who had
                    hurt a priest with a weapon. Again: Terms of art, or technical terms, must be
                    taken according to the acceptation of the learned in each art, trade, and
                    science. So, in the act of settlement, where the crown of England is limited “to
                    the Princess Sophia, and the heirs of her body being Protestants,” it becomes
                    necessary to call in the assistance of lawyers to ascertain the precise idea of
                    the words “heirs of her body,” which, in a legal sense, comprise only certain of
                    her lineal descendants. Lastly, Where words are clearly repugnant, in two laws,
                    the latter law takes place of the elder; <hi rend="italic">leges</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">posteriores</hi><hi rend="italic">priores contrarias
                    abrogant,</hi> is a maxim of universal law, as well as of our own constitutions.
                    And accordingly it was laid down by a law of the twelve tables at Rome, <hi
                    rend="italic">Quod</hi><hi rend="italic">populus postremum jussit,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">id jus</hi><hi rend="italic">ratum esto.</hi></p>
                <p>2. If words happen to be still dubious, we may establish their meaning from the
                    <hi rend="italic">context</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> with which it may be of
                    singular use to compare a word or a sentence, whenever they are ambiguous,
                    equivocal, or intricate. Thus the proè’me, or preamble, is often called in to
                    help the construction of an act of parliament. Of the same nature and use is the
                    comparison of a law with other laws that are made by the same legislator, that
                    have some affinity with the subject, or that expressly relate to the same point.
                    Thus, when the law of England declares murder to be felony without benefit of
                    clergy, we must resort to the same <pb break="no" facs="nls:193203134"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-3134-0133"/>law of England to learn what the benefit of clergy
                    is; and, when the common law censures simoniacal contracts, it affords great
                    light to the subject to consider what the canon law has adjudged to be
                    simony.</p>
                <p>3. As to the <hi rend="italic">subject-matter,</hi> words are always to be
                    understood as having a regard thereto; for that is always supposed to be in the
                    eye of the legislator, and all his expressions directed to that end. Thus, when
                    a law of Edward III. forbids all ecclesiastical persons to purchase provisions
                    at Rome, it might seem to prohibit the buying of grain and other victual; but
                    when we consider that the statute was made to repress the usurpations of the
                    papal sec, and that the nominations to benefices by the pope were called <hi
                    rend="italic">provisions,</hi> we shall see that the restraint is intended to be
                    laid upon such provisions only.</p>
                <p>4. As to the effects and <hi rend="italic">consequence,</hi> the rule is, That
                    where words bear either none, or a very absurd signification, if literally
                    understood, we must a little deviate from the received sense of them. Therefore
                    the Bolognian law, mentioned by Puffendorf, which enacted, “that whoever drew
                    blood in the streets should be punished with the utmost severity,” was held
                    after long debate not to extend to the surgeon who opened the vein of a person
                    who fell down in the street with a fit.</p>
                <p>5. But, lastly, the most universal and effectual way of discovering the true
                    meaning of a law, when the words are dubious, is by considering the <hi
                    rend="italic">reason</hi> and <hi rend="italic">spirit</hi> of it, or the cause
                    which moved the legislator to enact it. For when this reason ceases, the law
                    itself ought likewise to cease with it. An instance of this is given in a case
                    put by Cicero, or whoever was the author of the rhetorical treatise inscribed to
                    Herennius. There was a law, that those who in a storm forsook the ship, should
                    forfeit all property therein, and the ship and lading should belong entirely to
                    those who staid in it. In a dangerous tempest, all the mariners forsook the
                    ship, except only one sick passenger, who, by reason of his disease, was unable
                    to get out and escape. By chance the ship came safe to port. The sick man kept
                    possession, and claimed the benefit of the law. Now here all the learned agree,
                    that the sick man is not within the reason of the law; for the reason of making
                    it was, to give encouragement to such as should venture their lives to save the
                    vessel; but this is a merit which he could never pretend to, who neither staid
                    in the ship upon that account, nor contributed any thing to its
                    preservation.</p>
                <p>From this method of interpreting laws by the reason of them, arises what we call
                    <hi rend="italic">equity,</hi> which is defined by Grotius, “the correction of
                    that, wherein the law (by reason of its universality) is deficient.” For since
                    in laws all cases cannot be foreseen or expressed, it is necessary that, when
                    the general decrees of the law come to be applied to particular cases, there
                    should be somewhere a power vested of defining those circumstances which (had
                    they been foreseen) the legislator himself would have expressed. And these are
                    the cases which, according to Grotius, <hi rend="italic">lex non</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">exacte</hi><hi rend="italic">definit, sed arbitrio boni viri
                    permittit.</hi></p>
                <p>Equity thus depending essentially upon the particular circumstances of each
                    individual case, there can be no established rules and fixed precepts of equity
                    laid down, without destroying its very essence, and reducing it to a positive
                    law. And, on the other hand, the liberty of considering all cases in an
                    equitable light must not be indulged too far, lest thereby we destroy all law,
                    and leave the decision of every question entirely in the breast of the judge.
                    And law without equity, though hard and disagreeable, is much more desirable for
                    the public good than equity without law, which would make every judge a
                    legislator, and introduce infinite confusion; as there would then be almost as
                    many different rules of action laid down in our courts, as there arc differences
                    of capacity and sentiment in the human mind.</p>
