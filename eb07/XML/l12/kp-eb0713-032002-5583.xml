                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">LIEGE</label><hi rend="italic">(Ligius)</hi> properly
                    signifies a vassal, who holds a kind of fee, that binds him in a closer
                    obligation to his lord than other people. The term seems to be derived from the
                    French <hi rend="italic">lier,</hi> to bind, on account of a ceremony used in
                    rendering faith or homage; which was by locking the vassal’s thumb or his hand
                    in that of the lord, to show that he was fast bound by his oath of fidelity.
                    Cujas, Vigenère, and Bignon, choose rather to derive the word from the same
                    source with <hi rend="italic">leudis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">leodi,</hi>
                    loyal, faithful. But Du Cange coincides in the opinion of those who derive it
                    from <hi rend="italic">liti,</hi> a kind of vassals, so firmly attached to their
                    lord, on account of lands or fees held of him, that they were obliged to do him
                    all manner of service, as if they were his domestics. He adds, this was formerly
                    called <hi rend="italic">litgium</hi><hi rend="italic">servitium,</hi> and the
                    person <hi rend="italic">litge.</hi> In this sense, the word is used (Leg. Edw.
                    cap. 29): <hi rend="italic">Judoei sub</hi><hi rend="italic">tutela
                    regis</hi><hi rend="italic">ligea debent</hi><hi rend="italic">esse;</hi> that
                    is, wholly under his protection. By liege homage, the vassal was obliged to
                    serve his lord towards all, and against all, excepting his father. In this
                    sense, the word was used in opposition to simple homage, which only obliged the
                    vassal to pay the rights and accustomed dues to bis lord, and not to bear arms
                    against the emperor, prince, or other superior lord; so that a liege man was a
                    person wholly devoted to his lord, and entirely under his command. But it must
                    be observed, there were formerly two kinds of liege homage; the one, by which
                    the vassal was obliged to serve his lord against all, without exception even of
                    his sovereign; and the other, by which he was bound to serve him against all,
                    except such other lords as he had formerly owed liege homage to.</p>
                <p>In our old statutes, lieges and liege people are terms peculiarly appropriated to
                    the king’s subjects; as being <hi rend="italic">liges,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tigi,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ligati,</hi> obliged to pay allegiance to him
                    (8 Henry V1., 14 Hen. VIII. &amp;c.), though private persons had their lieges
                    too. <hi rend="italic">Reinaldus, Dei gratia, abbas Ramesioe,</hi><hi

                    a province of the Netherlands, formed in part out of what, before the French
                    Revolution, was the independent ecclesiastical state of that name, and was by
                    France divided into the departments of the Ourthe and of the Sambre and Meuse.
                    It contains also small parts taken from the duchy of Limburg, from the county of
                    Dahlen and the abbey of Stablo, and also of certain villages known by the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">Terres</hi><hi rend="italic">de Redemption.</hi> It extends
                    in N. lat. from 49° 40' to 50° 46', and in E. long, from 4° 49' to 5° 57', and
                    is 2255 square miles in extent. It comprehends four arrondissements, divided
                    into nine cantons, and those into 466 communes, containing 360,000 inhabitants,
                    who are chiefly of the Walloon race, and speak that language, though of late
                    years the use of the French tongue has been very much extended. The face of the
                    country in the northern part is hilly; but in the southern, the largest division
                    is mountainous, where the Ardennes forms a considerable portion. The soil is
                    very-various. On both sides the Meuse, towards the province of Limburg, there
                    are some plains of moderate fertility, and well cultivated; but on that part
                    where the Ourthe joins .the Meuse, and especially towards Luxemburg, the land is
                    rocky and stony, with much slate, which last is the prevailing stone in the
                    woody district of the Ardennes. Agriculture in the north affords moderate
                    products, in the south very poor returns; so that an importation of corn is
                    regularly required, though the extension of potatoes, which has taken place of
                    late years, has diminished the demand for grain. The woods are one of the chief
                    sources of the wealth procured from the soil, and they cover more than 200,000
                    acres. There are mines producing iron and coal, which, before the revolution
                    effected in Brussels in 1830, was a great source of benefit, the former yielding
                    employment to numerous persons in making ironmongery goods; and the latter being
                    of vast importance when the fuel consumed in Holland was drawn by the Meuse from
                    Liège, instead of being furnished by sea from England. Besides the iron
                    manufactures, there are others of paper, woodwork, leather, beer, and corn
                    spirits. The city of Liège, the capital of the province and of the
                    arrondissement of the same name, is situated on the left bank of the Meuse,
                    where it is joined by the Ourthe. It is in a picturesque and fertile district,
                    in a valley of contracted extent. It is fortified, and defended by two powerful
                    citadels on the western and northern sides. It is not well built, though there
                    are some spacious houses and splendid churches, with pleasing promenades. It
                    contains 8000 houses, and 48,000 inhabitants, who are chiefly employed in the
                    fabrication of great guns and small arms, cutlery, and other iron wares. There
                    are breweries, distilleries, and tanneries, and other branches of industry; but
                    all have suffered severely by political occurrences.</p>
