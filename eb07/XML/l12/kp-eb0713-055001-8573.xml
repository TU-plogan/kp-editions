                <p><label type="entry">LONDONDERRY</label>, a maritime county in the province of
                    Ulster, in Ireland, is bounded on the north by the Atlantic, on the east by the
                    county of Down, on the south by that of Tyrone, and on the west by Donegal and
                    Lough Foyle. The area is imperfectly triangular. Its greatest length is from the
                    point of Magilligan, at the entrance of Lough Foyle, to Cookstown, a distance of
                    fifty-two miles; its greatest breadth, from the western point of the liberties
                    of Londonderry to Vow Ferry on the Bann, is forty-four miles. It extends over a
                    surface of 518,270 acres, of which 372,667 are cultivable land, 136,038 bog or
                    unprofitable mountain, and 9565 are under water.</p>
                <p>According to Ptolemy, who is followed by Whitaker, the tribe of the Robogdii were
                    located here. Afterwards it was the territory of the O’Canes, or O’Cathans,
                    feudatories of the great O’Neil family. After the confiscation of this latter
                    chieftain’s princely estate, in consequence of his abrupt flight into Spain at
                    the commencement of the reign of James I., this county, which formed part of its
                    northern portion, was parcelled out amongst twelve companies of London
                    tradesmen, by whom, or their representatives, the greater part of it is still
                    held. Their names are the drapers, salters, vintners, mercers, ironmongers,
                    merchant tailors, cloth-workers, haberdashers, fishmongers, grocers, goldsmiths,
                    and skinners, forming together a body or corporation called the Irish Society.
                    It is now divided into the baronies of Coleraine, Kenaught, Loughinsholin,and
                    Tyrkerrin, together with the liberties of Londonderry and Coleraine, which have
                    separate jurisdictions. In this arrangement it is remarkable that each of the
                    two latter divisions is situated beyond what may be deemed the natural
                    boundaries of the county, the former lying west of the river Foyle, and the
                    latter east of the river Bann. These greater divisions are subdivided into
                    thirty-five parishes, twenty-seven of which are in the diocese of Derry, five in
                    that of Armagh, and three in that of Connor.</p>
                <p>The diocese of Derry is much larger, both as to number of parishes and extent of
                    surface, than the county, comprehending, besides the twenty-seven parishes above
                    named as being within the civil boundary, ten in Donegal, eleven in Tyrone, and
                    part of a parish in Antrim. By a curious anomaly, the ecclesiastical
                    jurisdiction of the parishes in the liberties of Coleraine belongs to the Bishop
                    of Down and Connor. The seat of the see is in the city of Derry, where is the
                    cathedral, a building in the Gothic style, erected in 1633. The chapter consists
                    of a dean, an archdeacon, and three prebendaries.</p>
                <p>The neighbourhood of the great Western Ocean, and the height of the mountain
                    ranges, which either intersect or skirt the county, may account for the fall of
                    a considerable quantity of rain; yet the popular notion of the peculiar wetness
                    of the climate here arises more from the frequency of showers than from the
                    amount of water discharged by them. The maximum annual quantity of rain, during
                    a period of seven years, did not amount to thirty-five inches, the minimum
                    twenty-five inches. The average of rain taken during a period of seven years
                    here and at Keswick in Cumberland, and Kendal in Westmoreland, exhibits the
                    following results:</p>

                <p>Neither does it appear that the north-west wind, so prevalent here, however
                    unfavourable to vegetable, is at all injurious to animal life. On the contrary,
                    the most remarkable instances of longevity have been found on the coast, and in
                    the peninsula of Magilligan. Several instances have occurred of the extension of
                    human life to ninety and even to a hundred and ten years.</p>
                <p>The surface of the county presents an appearance of valleys separated from each
                    other by ridges of rugged, but not very elevated mountains, and expanding, as
                    they approach the coast, into alluvial plains. The most elevated of the
                    mountains are, Sawel, 2236 feet high; Slieve Gallen, 1730 feet; Cairntogher,
                    1521 feet; Donald’s Hill, 1310 feet; Benyevenagh, 1262 feet; and Legavannon,
                    1290 feet.</p>
                <p>The principal river is the Roe, which, receiving as it flows in a northerly
                    direction the tributary streams of the Owenbeg, Owenmore, Gelvan, Castle, and
                    Curley, discharges itself into Lough Foyle; it is subject to sudden and violent
                    floods. The mud deposited near its mouth forms shifting banks, which prevent it
                    from being a useful port for small craft, otherwise the channel is deep enough
                    to be navigated for two miles by flat-bottomed barges. The Faghan rises in the
                    south, and discharges itself into Lough Foyle near Culmore. The Moyola takes a
                    south-eastern course, and falls into Lough Neagh. A small portion only of the
                    fine navigable river Foyle belongs to the county, passing in its course through
                    the liberties of Londonderry. It is navigable for vessels of large burden as far
                    as the city of Londonderry, and thence to Lifford in Donegal for lighters of
                    twenty tons. The Bann, from Lough Neagh, forms the eastern boundary until it
                    approaches Coleraine, where it separates the barony from the liberties of the
                    town. The navigation of this river is impeded by shoals, which form a dangerous
                    bar.</p>
                <p>The valleys formed by these rivers, and their subordinate branches, are called
                    <hi rend="italic">slacks.</hi> That of the Faghan presents some scenery that is
                    peculiarly picturesque, as also does that called the slack of Feeny, a pass
                    which connects the valleys of the Faghan and the Roe. Several glens discharge
                    their streams into this slack; the most beautiful is that of Fin-Glen. On the
                    western side of the ridge of Benyevenagh there is a very uncommon surface called
                    a shaking quag, and also named the Gray Lough. It spreads over many acres.
                    Cattle can pass freely through it in summer, yet at every step the soil yields
                    to the pressure, communicating an undulating motion all around. The surface is
                    broken in every direction by pits full of water of unfathomable depth, and all
                    invariably rectangular parallelograms, very much resembling tan-pits. The quag
                    is surrounded by declivities on almost every side, and therefore it is difficult
                    to account for the cause of its retaining such a quantity of water without any
                    apparent supply. The structure of its margin, formed of stratified substances
                    covered with turf, may, however, account for the retention of the water. There
                    may have been a large lake here, which, by the interlacing roots of the aquatic
                    plants, is now covered with a kind of network that supports the foot, except in
                    places where the workings of the surface produce a fissure. But the cause of
                    this extraordinary regularity of shape in the pits thus formed still remains
                    without satisfactory explanation. The only lake is Lough Finn, situated in the
                    confines of Tyrone; it is of very inconsiderable<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193208586" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8586-0551"/> dimensions. Lough Neagh
                    touches the county in a small portion of its south-eastern boundary. The small
                    port of Ballyronan, in the north-west angle of the lough, affords accommodation
                    for sloops of sixty tons to load and unload. The fine inlet of the Atlantic
                    called Lough Foyle forms the principal part of the western boundary. Having a
                    narrow entrance, but with ten fathoms of water, between Culmore Fort and
                    Magilligan Point, it expands itself into a gulf of fifteen miles in length and
                    seven in breadth, with a channel fourteen fathoms deep at low water, but of
                    difficult navigation from its great narrowness.</p>
                <p>The soil in the northern part, along the sea-coast, is a stiff and reddish clay,
                    interspersed with knolls of basalt, and resting on a substratum of white lime,
                    which occasionally shows itself on the surface. Near the mouth of the Roe is an
                    extensive tract of a marly nature, formed of layers of ouze and shells
                    alternating to a depth of several feet. Fossil shells are frequently found in
                    the ditches. The lands lying between the loamy soil in the low grounds and the
                    higher wastes are either of a blue clay with fragments of quartz, slate, and a
                    shallow covering of peat moss, or a shingle of slate interspersed with red
                    ochreous sand or with gravel and loam. Above the lime is the region of the
                    basalt, and the soil is thenceforth without clay, being merely an oxide of the
                    softer parts of this ironstone, having neither cohesion nor strength, and
                    producing little but potatoes and straw. The country people significantly call
                    it draff land. Yet its summits are admirable as sheep walks; for, how high
                    soever the elevation of a basaltic mountain may be, if the immediate substratum
                    be of the fossil known by the name of zeolite trap, the soil is fertile and the
                    herbage sweet, presenting an elegant carpeting of shamrock, daisy, butter-cup,
                    and plantain, which is eagerly browsed on by sheep.</p>
                <p>The valley of the Roe divides the county into two districts, totally different in
                    respect to their geological character. On the west lies the territory of schist,
                    on the east that of basalt, each accompanied with its peculiar fossil
                    organization. The prevalent species of schist is a kind of flag-rock or
                    schistose mica, next to which in quantity is the laminated schist or flag, the
                    dip of which is generally northwest. The great mountain of Sawel is composed of
                    several varieties of this rock, surmounted towards the summit by amorphous
                    whinstone, interspersed with blocks of quartz. Slieve Gallen is also a mass of
                    basalt, resting upon a bed of granite, which emerges from beneath in various
                    places. Limestone may be found everywhere, from the sea to Benbradagh. The most
                    remarkable cavern on the coast is in the white limestone; it is very
                    appropriately called the Robber’s Cave, having at one time been the asylum of a
                    formidable banditti. A species of blue limestone has been used for various
                    architectural purposes. Sandstone is universally found below the basalt, and is
                    occasionally intermingled with schist. A species of it, of a bright tawny
                    colour, not unlike to that of the Portland stone, is raised in large quantities
                    near Dungiven. Many of the principal buildings are constructed of it. Coal has
                    not yet been discovered in any quantities deserving of notice. Iron is found in
                    great abundance, either in an ochreous state, or mixed with manganese, when it
                    is known by the name of bog ore or woad. The base of Sawel is a mass of martial
                    pyrites mingled with schist. To the abundance of this metal in the peat moss is
                    to be attributed the red colour of the ashes, which are so heavy as to keep in
                    heaps even in a breeze of wind. The metal was formerly smelted, but the
                    operation has been ultimately relinquished as an unprofitable speculation.
                    Copper and lead, in small veins, have been discovered. Boate states that pure
                    gold had been found in a rivulet which discharges itself into Lough Neagh; but
                    the fact has not been substantiated by subsequent discoveries, further than that
                    some specimens of quartz have been observed to contain thin laminae of that
                    metal. Quartz and flint are common in all parts. The flint sometimes exhibits
                    marine impressions, the quartz never. As to crystals, they are of great variety.
                    Zeolite, in rose-cut surfaces, in points, and in thistledown, all beautiful, are
                    common in basalt. The rock-crystals are found exclusively in the schistose
                    regions. They are harder than those found in Kerry. In shape they are truncated
                    prisms of six sides and six facets, and weigh from two to twelve ounces. In all
                    the mountains composed of pyritic schist the streamlets show strong indications
                    of iron, to such a degree, indeed, that in some places the water is not fit for
                    drinking.</p>
                <p>The population has increased progressively from the earliest period at which any
                    probable estimate of its amount was made, as appears by the statements from the
                    following authorities :—</p>

                <p>The last of these estimates gives an average of one inhabitant to every two and a
                    third acres throughout the county, or to every one and a fifth acre of
                    cultivable land. The county was represented in the imperial parliament by eight
                    members, two for the county at large, and two for each of the boroughs of
                    Londonderry, Coleraine, and Newtown-Limavady. The act of union reduced the

                    besides 255 whose religious tenets were not ascertained. According to the same
                    return, the number of schools was 380, out of which, forty-nine, affording
                    instruction to 3119 children, were supported by grants of public money;
                    fifty-three, affording instruction to 2748 children, were maintained by the
                    voluntary contributions of individuals or societies; whilst the remaining 278
                    schools, in which 8023 children were educated, depended wholly on the fees of
                    the pupils. The diocesan school in the city affords the means of liberal
                    education to the sons of the gentry. It is an extensive and well-conducted
                    establishment. The endowment consists of a salary from the London Society, and a
                    subscription from the bishop and beneficed clergy. A mercantile school in
                    Coleraine has also been endowed by the same society.</p>
                <p>The treatment of arable ground differs little from that generally practised
                    throughout the province. The principal crops are barley, oats, and potatoes; the
                    implements the Scotch and Irish ploughs; the manures sea-weed, and composts of
                    which it forms a part, near the coast, and lime and turf-mould in the interior.
                    In Magilligan, the mossy sands are alternately ploughed and laid up in meadow.
                    The fiorin grass springs up luxuriantly here. Amongst the more uncommon species
                    of grasses may be mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Parnassia palustris,</hi>
                    commonly called crottel, in Irish crou-tuil; when manufactured, it produces the
                    litmus, turnsolblue or archil. Extensive dairies are uncommon; the care of milk
                    and butter forms generally a part of the domestic<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193208599" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8599-0552"/> economy of the working
                    farmer. Sheep are mostly brought in at fairs from other districts. There are no
                    herds of goats in the mountains, but individually they are found in many of the
                    habitations of the cottiers. Magilligan contains a very large rabbit-warren,
                    extending over 1500 acres. The annual number of skins sent out of it is 2000;
                    they are sold by auction to the Dublin hatters. The poultry are large. Geese are
                    both large and abundant. They fatten in summer on the vetches and tares which
                    abound in the bottoms, in autumn on the stubble, and in winter on the
                    potato-ridge. Wild and sea fowl are abundant. The county was once remarkable for
                    the quantity of honey it produced; latterly the produce has decreased.</p>
                <p>The linen manufacture is the staple here, and contributes greatly to the
                    comfortable support of the population. The yarn and linen are generally of a
                    coarser staple than in the neighbouring county of Antrim. Sacking is made of the
                    tow-yarn. Potteries, in which the coarser kinds of earthenware are manufactured,
                    are carried on in some places. There are several large distilleries and
                    breweries, and some salt-works. One of the most productive salmon-fisheries in
                    Ireland is on the Bann, near Coleraine. Lampreys are caught at low water at the
                    mouth of the same river. Eels are plentiful in all the streams. The sea
                    furnishes most kinds of fish taken upon other parts of the coast. The sturgeon
                    and sun-fish have been caught in Lough Foyle. An unique specimen of the opah or
                    kingfish was thrown on shore upon the sands of Magilligan. Whales of various
                    species have also been taken on the coast. The seal, porpoise, and grampus are
                    frequent. A species of the pearl mussel has been found in the rivulet which
                    flows through Claady into the Bann.</p>
                <p>The residences of the nobility, and landed proprietors of large fortune, are
                    elegant, and in some instances magnificent. Two mansions, erected by the Earl of
                    Bristol, who had been Bishop of Derry, the one at Downhill, the other at
                    Ballyscullion, were constructed in a style of Grecian architecture. The latter
                    has been suffered to fall into ruin. The habitations of the farmers in some of
                    the richest districts, where stone is scarce, are built of clay, and almost
                    universally covered with thatch; presenting, however, with few exceptions, an
                    appearance of comfort and good order. In all cases, they are built and kept in
                    repair by the tenant. In the houses on the Antrim side of the Bann, the
                    fire-place is advanced some feet from the gable-wall, so that the family can
                    nearly sit round it. It does not appear that the nuisance of smoke is so much
                    felt in houses thus constructed as in those in other parts of the country, in
                    which its smell, and its action upon the eyes, are very offensive to strangers.
                    In the districts where lime is plentiful, the outside of the cabin is
                    whitewashed, and sometimes rougheast; whence, amongst the wildest mountains,
                    scenes of domestic neatness often unexpectedly arrest the eye. Coal is little
                    burned in the country parts. In the open and more fertile districts, which are
                    consequently most thickly peopled, the peat mosses are nearly exhausted. In such
                    situations, when the turf can no longer be cut, it is collected into heaps of
                    wet mire, and moulded by the hand. It is then called baked turf, and makes bad
                    fuel. Providence seems to have compensated the dreary exposure of the mountain
                    districts, by affording them plenty of turbary, which has allured a crowded
                    population to every arable spot, however remote or dreary, where turf is to be
                    had in plenty. The article, when prepared for fuel, is carried down to the
                    lowlands on slide cars, through winding ruts, which present to the inexperienced
                    eye insuperable difficulties in the way of its transit. Bog fir is used amongst
                    the wealthier classes as a good substitute for cannel coal. The cottier cuts it
                    up into laths, called splits, not thicker than the blade of a knife. These are
                    used instead of candles, and serve to give light enough to guide the operations
                    of humble domestic industry during the long winter evenings.</p>
                <p>The manners of the common people exhibit much kindness and courtesy. A stranger,
                    on visiting the cabin, is offered a chair brought from the inner apartment. A
                    remarkable tone of piety pervades their usual conversation. Few make a promise
                    for the future without adding, “with the help of God,” or some other phrase of
                    similar import. They talk much of “the second means,” and, through an over
                    confidence in providential interference, often disregard human aids in cases of
                    sickness. Superstitious notions are prevalent, some of them in common with those
                    in other parts of Ulster, others more peculiar to themselves. When the cottier’s
                    cow is supposed to be “elf-shot,” recourse is not had to animal medicines, but
                    salt and water poured on three halfpence and a petrified sea-urchin called “the
                    fairy’s bullet,"and common in limestone, is deemed an infallible remedy. The
                    weasel is accounted “sawncy,” that is, lucky, about the house. If a cow dies in
                    calving, her flesh must be eaten by “Christians,” and not given to the dogs.
                    There is an almost insurmountable objection to taking an oath according to the
                    usual form. It is most prevalent amongst the seceders, to whose prejudices in
                    this respect the legislature has wisely yielded, by accepting their testimony on
                    asseveration with uplifted hand. At weddings, amongst the Scotch part of the
                    population, the bridegroom and his friends vie with each other in being the
                    first to gallop to the house of the bride. During the race they are greeted with
                    shots from guns and pistols in every village they pass through. A bowl of broth,
                    called “brose,” stands ready prepared at the winning-post, as the reward for the
                    victor in the race. The forms of an Irish wedding in the mountain districts are
                    very different. However suitable the match may be to the wishes of all parties,
                    it is considered as but a sorry exploit unless the bride be run away with. After
                    a few days the parties return, and a liberal carouse, to which every well-wisher
                    of either party is expected to contribute, forms the celebration of a kind of
                    second nuptial.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable relic of ancient fortification is the Giant’s Sconce,
                    situated in the pass between Drumbo and Largantea. It was formed on an isolated
                    knoll of basalt, difficult of access on all sides but the north-east, where art
                    has supplied the deficiency by a wall of massive masonry. The interior was
                    hollowed, as if for a receptacle for men and stores; whilst a covered way,
                    admitting only one person in a stooping posture to pass at a time, surrounded
                    the whole. Several cromleachs are still in existence, some of them surrounded by
                    a circle of upright pillars, somewhat like Stonehenge. The most remarkable is
                    that at Slacht Manus. Cairns are too numerous to admit of special notice. To the
                    present time they are kept up, if not enlarged, by the custom of travellers
                    adding a stone to them as they pass. Danish ditches are sometimes dug up.
                    Sepulchral pillars are numerous, and one peculiarly remarkable stands near
                    Dungiven. Artificial caverns, evidently constructed for the concealment of men
                    and property, are frequently discovered. They are rudely built of stone, without
                    cement; and flags or long stones form the roof. They consist of narrow
                    galleries, some at right angles with the main entrance, others paraJlel to it.
                    The entrance is usually concealed by a rock or grassy sod. Moats, the body of
                    which seems to have been formed of the earth thrown out of the foss, have been
                    found. These enclosures are too low for safety or strength, and so small as not
                    to contain more than thirty persons. Coins, antique pins, rings, and forks, were
                    found in one of them. Castles of acknowledged Irish erection are few. That of
                    Carrickreagh is looked upon as amongst the most ancient. Near Ballyaghran was
                    another. Both are said to have been residences of the family of the M‘Quillans.
                    Pieces of pit-coal, found in the cement <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208612"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-8612-0553"/>of the walls, lead to the opinion that the
                    operations of miners were practised in those remote ages. Some of the
                    castellated mansions of the first English settlers, with their bawns, are still
                    in a state of preservation; as at Kil-lolod, Dungiven, Salterstown, and
                    Muff.</p>
                <p>The most ancient monastic building is the abbey of Derry, founded by Columbkill
                    in the sixth century. The present cathedral stands on its site. At Coleraine
                    were two monasteries, one of Dominicans, the other of regular canons. At Camus,
                    on the Bann, was a very celebrated monastic structure, attributed to St Comgal.
                    The only remains of it at present existing are the fort, with a pillar curiously
                    carved. The remains of the abbey of Dungiven are the most interesting in the
                    county. It was the burial-place of the O’Cahans or O’Kanes, several of whose
                    tombs have resisted the attacks <hi rend="italic">of</hi> time. The principal
                    monument is that of one of the chieftains, named Cooey-na-gal. There is a tower
                    at the north-west side of the building, and a sepulchral pillar placed on an
                    artificial mount. A smaller tumulus in the vicinity, when opened, was found to
                    contain an urn of earthenware with bones. The urn ∣was surrounded with white
                    stones. Other tumuli, when examined, exhibit similar results.</p>
                <p>The city of Londonderry is situated at the western side of the river Foyle, near
                    to its junction with the lough, spreading itself over the summit and sides of a
                    hill, which here projects into the river, and which was once covered with oak
                    trees, whence the place derived the name of Derry Calgach, “the eminence covered
                    with oaks,” which it still partially retains. Its monastery first drew
                    inhabitants thither. The town was entirely ecclesiastical, consisting almost
                    exclusively of churches and the dwellings of the clergy and their dependents.
                    The English government, after having been baffled in several attempts to plant a
                    garrison here during the war against the Earl of Tyrone, at length succeeded, in
                    1600, in gaining possession of the place, and securing it against any efforts of
                    the Irish to dislodge them. It was surrounded with a substantial wall,
                    strengthened with bastions, and had four main streets diverging at right angles
                    from a point on the summit of the hill, now called the Diamond, to a gate at the
                    other extremity of each. The strength of these fortifications was tested in the
                    subsequent wars of 1642 and 1688, in each of which the town maintained a
                    successful stand against its besiegers. After a lapse of more than two
                    centuries, the walls still retain, in most parts, their original form and
                    character. The external ditch, indeed, has disappeared. The gates have been
                    rebuilt in a more flegant style of architecture, and two new ones have been
                    ìdded. One bastion has been removed to make way for a outter-market, and another
                    has been appropriated as the site of a pillar commemorative of the military
                    services of the Reverend George Walker during the memorable siege of 1688. In
                    other respects the walls still remain unaltered, now forming the ornament, as
                    they were once the protection, of the city. They are the favourite walk of the
                    inhabitants, frequented by the beauty and fashion of the city, and commanding,
                    at various points, interesting and extended views of a wooded and watered
                    landscape. The cathedral stands within the walls, in the southern part of the
                    city. It consists of a nave, divided into a central and lateral aisle, separated
                    by pointed arches. The chapel of ease is a plain rectangular structure, of small
                    dimensions. A free church, for the use of the poor, Was opened in 1830, at the
                    expense of the late bishop. There are four meeting-houses, one for the
                    Presbyterian or Scotch church, a second for the Seceders, a third for the
                    Covenanters, and a fourth for the Independents. There are also two Methodist
                    chapels, and a Roman Catholic chapel capable of accommodating 2000 persons. The
                    diocesan school is a simple but handsome stone edifice, consisting of a central
                    pavilion and two wings. It was erected by grants from the London companies, and
                    a large contribution from the bishop. Near to it is the parish or poor school,
                    with accommodations for children of both sexes. The corporation hall stands in
                    the centre of the Diamond. It is surrounded by a colonnade, with embat-tlements;
                    and the same kind of military ornament surrounds its roof. The court-house
                    exhibits much architectural beauty. The other more remarkable public buildings
                    are, the lunatic asylum, the infirmary and fever hospital, the gaol, the
                    custom-house, the linen-hall, the barrack, and the magazine. The bridge is the
                    peculiar boast of Derry. It is built of wood, and extends in length 1068 feet,
                    by a breadth <hi rend="italic">of</hi> forty. A turning bridge, near the centre,
                    admits a free navigation to vessels going up the river. Walker’s Testimonial is
                    a pillar of the Roman Doric order, surmounted by a statue of that celebrated
                    individual. Its height is ninety feet. The markets are good, and well provided
                    with accommodation for buyers and sellers.</p>
                <p>The municipal jurisdiction extends over a space of three miles in every direction
                    from the centre of the city. The government is vested in a mayor, twelve
                    aldermen, two sheriffs, and twenty-four burgesses. The income of the corporation
                    arises from tolls on the bridges, tolls on the market, rents of land and
                    shambles, and tonnage and quayage.</p>
                <p>The progress of commerce may be estimated from the custom-house receipts, which
                    for eight years were as follow:</p>

                <p>Coleraine, the second town in importance, is situated on the eastern or Antrim
                    side of the Bann, near its mouth. Like Londonderry, it owes its existence
                    chiefly to the fostering care of the London companies. Some of the houses built
                    of frame or cage-work in the time of Elizabeth and James I. are yet in
                    preservation. According to the fashion of those days, they have pent-ways or
                    piazzas. The population at present amounts to 5752 souls. The other more
                    remarkable towns are, Newtown-Limavady, Maghcrafelt, Killreagh, Dungiven,
                    Garvagh, Maghera, Moneymore, Tubbermore, Castledawson, and Bellaghy.</p>
