                    de</hi></label>, a most zealous and accomplished astronomer, born at Bourg en
                    Bresse, on the 11th of July 1732, was the son of Peter Lefrançais, and Marianne
                    Mouchinet, his wife.</p>
                <p>His parents were in easy circumstances, and his education being somewhat too
                    indulgent, the natural quickness and impetuosity of his temper was too little
                    restrained. His earliest taste, like that of most other children, seems to have
                    been for romantic tales; and he was fond of making little stories with such
                    materials as he possessed, but their subject was chiefly religious. He was in
                    the habit of living much with the Jesuits, and he imbibed from them a
                    predilection for the pulpit. At the age of ten he used to amuse himself with
                    making sermons, and preaching them to a select congregation. The comet of 1744,
                    however, with its long tail, took more forcible possession of his imagination,
                    and he watched it with the most unremitting attention. Having been sent to Lyons
                    to continue his studies under the Jesuits there, he acquired a taste for poetry
                    and eloquence, and was then inclined to devote himself to literature and to the
                    bar; but an eclipse of the sun recalled his attention to astronomy. His parents
                    wished him to follow the profession of magistrate, and with that view sent him
                    to Paris; but he accidentally lodged in a hotel where Delislc had established an
                    observatory, and this circumstance led him to become acquainted with that
                    professor, and to attend his lectures. These lectures were by no means popular;
                    and the want of a more numerous audience made it easy for the professor to
                    accommodate his instructions to the fixed attention and rapid progress of his
                    new pupil, who became singularly attached to his master, and to all the methods
                    which he employed. Lalande attended, however, at the same time, the
                    physicomathematical lectures of Lemonnier, who was more in credit as a teacher,
                    and who also took great pains for his improvement.</p>
                <p>In the mean time he had completed his legal studies, and at the age of eighteen
                    he was called to the bar as an advocate. His family was anxious for his return
                    to Bourg; but just at that time Lemonnier obtained leave to nominate him as a
                    substitute for himself on an astronomical mission to Berlin, where he was to
                    make observations on the lunar parallax, corresponding with those which Lacaille
                    was sent to the Cape to obtain. He was favourably received by Maupertuis, who
                    introduced him to Frederic and his court; and was made a member of the Academy
                    of Sciences at Berlin, when he was about nineteen.</p>
                <p>He remained a year in that city, observing at night, and passing his mornings in
                    the study of the integral calculus, under Euler’s directions; and his evenings
                    in the society of Voltaire, Maupertuis, D’Argens, and other men of talents. It
                    was not likely that his intercourse with such persons would confirm the
                    principles which he had imbibed from the Jesuits; his moral conduct, however,
                    does not appear to have been influenced by his change of sentiments. After his
                    return to Bourg, he pleaded a few causes to oblige his friends; but the success
                    of his operations at Berlin obtained him speedily a place in the Academy of
                    Sciences at Paris; for, in 1753, before he was twenty-one, he was chosen to fill
                    up a vacancy in the department of astronomy, which had been open for some years.
                    He soon afterwards offended his friend Lemonnier, by rejecting too harshly an
                    unfounded objection of that astronomer to his method of computing the effect of
                    the earth’s ellipticity on the lunar parallax, which differed from Euler’s
                    formula. Lacaille, wĥo drew up the report of a committee appointed on the
                    occasion, decided in Lalande’s favour; but Lemon,nier remained dissatisfied, and
                    would not see him for twenty years. He had some similar discussions, at a later
                    period, with Duséjour, who was a little too severe in criticizing some of his
                    approximations, as if they had been intended to be rigidly accurate; but their
                    personal friendship remained unaltered.</p>
                <p>For more than fifty years he continued to be a constant and voluminous
                    contributor to the Memoirs of the Parisian Academy, as well as to other
                    scientific collections. His investigations were always judiciously directed to
                    the advancement of astronomy; but they can scarcely ever be said to have
                    exhibited any marked features of talent, or of address, beyond what might be
                    expected from the industry of a man of good ordinary abilities, confining
                    himself almost entirely to one subject. He was always anxious to call the public
                    attention to astronomy as a science, and to himself as an individual. Thus, on
                    occasion of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193201769" xml:id="kp-eb0713-1769-0028"
                    />transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769, he addressed a circular letter to most of
                    the governments of Europe, on the importance of obtaining a multiplicity of
                    collateral observations; and he received in reply several invitations from
                    sovereigns whose countries were more favourably situated for the purpose than
                    France, to come and make the observations in person. He thought it unnecessary,
                    however, to leave Paris on the occasion. He contented himself with being the
                    first to announce to the public the result of the most satisfactory comparisons;
                    and his countrymen seemed to give him almost the whole credit of every thing
                    that had been done by others in conformity with his suggestions. He was much
                    mortified, however, in not receiving from Father Hell an account of the
                    observations made at Wardhus; and he was afterwards greatly inclined to dispute
                    their accuracy, because Hell made the parallax smaller than he did by ⅜th of a
                    second; whilst the mean of both results, which is 8, 6", agrees extremely well
                    with the most modern computations; but, in the end, he did justice to the
                    importance of Hell’s observations.</p>
                <p>He was constantly in the habit of passing a few months every year with his family
                    in the country, and he occasionally amused himself, in the course of these
                    visits, with mineralogical excursions, and with chemical studies. He delivered,
                    about the year 1758, an oration before a public assembly at Lyons, on the
                    advantage of monarchy above every other form of government; he even adhered to a
                    similar opinion, and expressed it openly, in times when nothing but his
                    celebrity, as a man devoted exclusively to science, could have made it safe for
                    him to declare it.</p>
                <p>After having published the astronomical tables of Halley, he felt the necessity
                    of a new collection, and determined to begin with those of Mercury, which he
                    found the most imperfect. He pursued, for this purpose, a regular course of
                    observations at the Palais Royal, where he used to go before sunrise, in the
                    winter mornings, to see the planet in the twilight. Having occasion to refer to
                    the observations recorded by Ptolemy, he found it 'necessary to refresh his
                    acquaintance with the Greek language, which he had in some measure neglected.
                    But, with all his labour and diligence, his tables of Mercury exhibited, in
                    1786, an error of forty minutes in the time of a transit. The circumstance
                    mortified him extremely; but it led to a revision of the tables, and he
                    afterwards succeeded in making them much more perfect. It must be recollected,
                    that, in the time of Hevelius, a transit was anxiously expected for four whole
                    days before it occurred.</p>
                <p>He next undertook to improve the tables of Mars and Venus. His tables of these
                    planets were, on the whole, less accurate than those of Mercury, though more
                    exempt from great occasional errors. He had computed their perturbations in the
                    Memoirs of the Academy, but he never thought it worth while to compare his
                    formulas with observation. The irregularities of Jupiter and Saturn were much
                    more discouraging; he was obliged to confine himself, in discussing them, to the
                    most modern observations; and he did not appear sufficiently to appreciate the
                    empirical equations of Lambert, though they greatly diminished the errors of
                    Halley’s tables.</p>
                <p>When Maraldi had given up the management of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Connaissance</hi><hi rend="italic">des Tems,</hi> Lalande and Pingré were
                    candidates for the appointment. Lalande succeeded in obtaining it; but he had
                    the modesty to confess that the work would have been more accurately performed
                    by Pingré, if his connection with the church had not, according to the rules of
                    the academy, incapacitated him for the situation. He made the work, however,
                    much more popular, as a miscellaneous publication, than Pingre was likely to
                    have done; and he was less prejudiced than Pingré in the choice of his tables.
                    He remained editor of the work from 1760 to 1775; it was conducted by Jeaurat
                    from 1776 to 1787, and from 1788 to 1793 by Méchain. Lalande then undertook it
                    once more, Méchain being engaged in some measurements with Delambre, and the
                    academy having been abolished, and its members dispersed.</p>
                <p>Lalande had been disposed to call in question the assertion of Newton and of
                    Voltaire, that no cometcould possibly come into contact with the earth; and he
                    had proved that the effect of perturbations at least rendered their reasonings
                    somewhat inconclusive. A short memoir on the subject, which was to have been
                    read at a public sitting of the academy, was accidentally omitted, as not very
                    important, from the pressure of other business. This circumstance alarmed the
                    sensibility of the public of Paris, who fancied that Lalande had foretold some
                    dreadful catastrophe, which the government was afraid to announce; and when the
                    memoir was published, they insisted that its contents had been modified, to
                    lessen the alarm. Duséjour made some objections to the author’s reasoning; but
                    the whole affair was soon forgotten.</p>
                <p>A memoir on the length of the year was honoured with a prize by the academy at
                    Copenhagen. Delambre, however, thinks the determination not so good as the
                    earlier one of Lacaille, though much better than Mayer’s, which was more
                    commonly adopted. Lalande took great pains also with the subject of the sun’s
                    rotation, employing in his computations of the places of the spots an easy
                    approximation, instead of Duséjour’s more laborious methods; but being careful
                    to compare with each other the most distant observations of the same spot. From
                    the existence of this rotation he thought it reasonable to infer that the sun
                    had also most probably a progressive motion, which would naturally be produced
                    by any single impulse capable of occasioning a rotation. He had some discussions
                    with Dr Maskelyne respecting the mode of computing the equation of time, in
                    which Maskelyne appears to have had the advantage.</p>
                <p>In the year 1762, Delisle resigned in his favour the professorship of astronomy
                    in the College de France, which he kept for nearly forty-six years. He allowed
                    the most attentive of his pupils to board with him at a cheap rate, doing his
                    utmost on all occasions to promote their success in their studies and in life.
                    Thus he brought forward Méchain and Dagelet, and afterwards his own nephew, who
                    completed, with so much diligence and accuracy, the Description of the Heavens,
                    which he had himself projected, and which had been begun by Dagelet before his
                    unfortunate expedition. He was made a fellow of the Royal Society of London in
                    1763.</p>
                <p>His health was generally good, though his constitution was delicate. He had an
                    attack of jaundice in 1767, which was attributed to intense application; but he
                    completely recovered from its effects by an attention to diet, and by the use of
                    horse exercise. He then intended to leave all his property to the academy; but
                    he afterwards gave up his family estates to his relations, and lived on his
                    appointments only, refraining from all kinds of luxuries, in order to be the
                    more able to do acts of liberality to his friends, whom he always sought to
                    oblige in the most delicate manner, and often without making his services known.
                    He had a pension from Russia in the time of the Empress Catherine; it was
                    suspended by Paul, but restored in 1805 by Alexander.</p>
                <p>He was not particularly successful as an observer, but used to refer to the works
                    of his contemporaries, Bradley and Lacaille, though not exactly, according to
                    the expression of one of bis biographers, “as Ptolemy had done to those of
                    Hipparchus ;” for Hipparchus must have been dead two centuries before Ptolemy
                    was born. On the occasion of the disappearance of the ring of Saturn in 1774, he
                    went to Béziers, in order to profit by the superior serenity of the air there,
                    the climate of that country <pb break="no" facs="nls:193201782"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-1782-0029"/>being supposed to be the best in France; but his
                    observations were less valuable than others made at Paris and in London.</p>
                <p>In the year 1798, he undertook an astronomical expedition to Gotha. He had once
                    meditated an aerostatical voyage there; but his companion took care that their
                    dangers should terminate in the Bois de Boulogne. He was received with much
                    interest at Gotha by an assembly of astronomers that was collected from
                    different parts of Germany. The object of the congress was perhaps not unmixed
                    with personal vanity; but it had no political design to promote, unless the
                    general adoption of the new French measures could be considered as a political
                    object. Lalande was by no means a revolutionist; he was sufficiently free from
                    any prejudices of education; but he openly condemned the political opinions of
                    the day; and, in 1792, he even exposed himself to great personal danger in order
                    to save the life of Dupont de Nemours, after the 10th of August; and he was
                    equally useful to some of the clergy, whom he concealed in the buildings of the
                    Observatory at Mazarin College, making them pass for astronomers. He had also
                    the courage to publish accounts of Lavoisier and Bailly, a short time after
                    their deaths.</p>
                <p>The attentions of the German astronomers gave him sincere pleasure. He was at all
                    times extremely sensible to compliments, and even to flattery, though very
                    regardless of satire. He used to call himself a sponge for praise, and an
                    oil-cloth for censure. He professedly believed himself endowed with all the
                    virtues, modesty not excepted. He was so fond of notoriety that he once
                    undertook to exhibit the variations of the light of Algol to the public of Paris
                    on the Pont Neuf; but the police interfered, thinking it right to prevent a
                    disorderly assemblage.</p>
                <p>Though Lalande can only be classed in the second rank as an inventive astronomer,
                    or a mathematician, he certainly stands in the first as a professor and a
                    popular writer. His methods of calculation have in most instances been already
                    superseded by others more convenient or more exact; those which related to
                    particular phenomena for want of sufficient precision, and those which were more
                    general for want of being readily applicable, without continual repetition, to a
                    sufficient number of concurring observations. It has been observed, that he may
                    perhaps have been often too zealous in the pursuit of his favourite objects; but
                    that, if he had possessed more circumspection, and less vivacity of character,
                    he would have been more exempt from criticism, yet would have rendered less
                    important services to science and to mankind.</p>
                <p>His last illness was of a consumptive nature, and he seems to have accelerated
                    its termination by attempting too much to harden himself. He died on the 4th of
                    April 1807, nearly seventy-five years old, and in the perfect possession of his
                    faculties. His last words, when he dismissed his attendants to rest, were, “I
                    have need of nothing more,” and in a few minutes he was dead. Had he survived a
                    few hours, he would have received a letter from Dr Others, announcing the
                    discovery of a new planet, for which that distinguished astronomer afterwards
                    received the fourth prize medal upon the institution founded by Lalande in 1802,
                    for the most important astronomical discovery made in the course of the
                    year.</p>
                <p>Of his voluminous and diversified publications a simple enumeration of the
                    subjects will perhaps be thought too long for perusal, though not improper for
                    insertion in a work which ought to comprehend a complete literary history or
                    bibliography of the sciences.</p>

                    miscellaneous works was a Discours qui a remporté le Prix de l’Academie de
                    Marseille en 1757, Mars. 1757. The subject was the spirit of justice, as tending
                    to the glory and the stability of a government. 147. We have then Three Letters

                    every year, in order to assist him in commanding his temper. He may possibly
                    have derived some little advantage from the practice, but he never acquired
                    enough of self-command to refrain from wounding the feelings of another, by any
                    pointed remark that might suddenly occur to him.</p>

                    kind, and will always be considered as exhibiting the most perfect picture of
                    the science, such as it existed from 1760 to 1790, with all the details of
                    practice and computation. Lemonnier called it, with some truth, the great
                    newspaper of astronomy. The Treatise on the Tides, which constitutes the fourth
                    volume, is chiefly a collection of observations, not sufficient even for the
                    basis of a complete theory: an abstract of it may be found in the <hi

                    expense, under the auspices of François de Neufchateau. The author possessed a
                    very extensive collection of astronomical books, and it has been regretted that
                    he did not insert a more complete account of some of the most rare; but the work
                    is already sufficiently voluminous. Some other productions are attributed to him
