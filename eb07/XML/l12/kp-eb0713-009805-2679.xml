                    de</hi></label>, one of the greatest geometricians and physical astronomers that
                    any age or country has produced, and scarcely less distinguished in the other
                    natural sciences, was a native of Normandy, in which province he first saw the
                    light on the 23d of March 1749. It was observed, even at the commencement of his
                    studies, that he was endowed with a prodigious memory; and that all the ordinary
                    occupations of the mind were to him easy. He rapidly acquired an extensive
                    knowledge of the ancient languages, and cultivated different branches of
                    literature. Every thing interested his rising genius, and every thing served to
                    unfold it. His first successes were achieved in theological studies; the most
                    difficult points of controversy he treated with extraordinary talent and
                    sagacity.</p>
                <p>It is not known by what fortunate accident Μ. de Laplace passed from the study of
                    scholastic learning to that of the higher geometry. This last science, which
                    scarcely admits of a divided affection, now attracted and fixed his attention.
                    From that time, he abandoned himself without reserve to the impulse of his
                    genius, and became sensible that a residence in the capital had become necessary
                    to him. D’Alembert then enjoyed all the splendour of his European reputation. It
                    was he who had just informed the court of Turin, that its academy possessed a
                    geometrician of the first order, Lagrange, who, but for this noble testimony to
                    his merits, would have remained long unknown. D’Alembert had announced to the
                    king of Prussia, that there was only one man in Europe fitted to replace at
                    Berlin the illustrious Euler, who, having been recalled by the government of
                    Russia, had consented to return to St Petersburg. Amongst his inedited letters,
                    Baron Fourier discovered the details of the negociation which fixed Lagrange as
                    a resident at Berlin.</p>
                <p>About the same time, Μ. de Laplace commenced that long career which was destined
                    soon to become so illustrious. He presented himself at the house of D’Alembert,
                    preceded by numerous recommendations, which might have been supposed to be
                    all-powerful. But his attempts were vain; he was not even introduced. He then
                    addressed to the man whose suffrage he had in vain solicited, a very remarkable
                    letter on the general principles of mechanics, of which, at an after period of
                    his life, he several times cited various fragments to his friend Baron Fourier.
                    It was impossible that so great a geometrician as D’Alembert should not be
                    struck with the singular profundity of this composition. The same day, he waited
                    upon the author of the letter, and said to him, “Sir, you see that I pay little
                    attention to recommendations; you have no need of them. You have made yourself
                    better known; that is sufficient for me; you may command my support.” A few days
                    afterwards, he got Μ. de Laplace appointed professor of mathematics to the
                    Military School of Paris. From this moment, having devoted himself exclusively
                    to the science which he had selected, the latter gave to all his labours a fixed
                    direction, from which he never afterwards deviated; for the imperturbable
                    constancy of his views and steadiness of his application formed the principal
                    characteristics of his genius. Already he had reached the known limits of the
                    mathematical analysis; he was then master of all that was most ingenious or most
                    powerful in that science; and no one seemed more capable than he of enlarging
                    its domain. Having resolved a capital question of theoretical astronomy, he
                    formed the design of consecrating his efforts to that sublime science, which he
                    was destined to perfect, and which he alone could embrace in its full extent. He
                    meditated deeply his glorious design; and he passed his whole life in
                    accomplishing it, with a perseverance of which the history of the sciences
                    scarcely presents any similar example.</p>
                <p>The immensity of the subject flattered the just pride of his genius. He undertook
                    to compose the <hi rend="italic">Almagest</hi> of his age, we mean the work
                    which he has left us under the title of <hi rend="italic">Traite de Mécanique
                    Céleste;</hi> a work which is as superior to that of Ptolemy, as the analytical
                    science of the moderns surpasses the elements of Euclid. Time, which alone
                    dispenses literary glory with justice, and which consigns to oblivion <pb

                    mediocrity, perpetuates the remembrance of great works. It is they only which
                    carry to posterity the character of each age. Thus the name of M. de Laplace
                    will live throughout all ages. But enlightened and faithful history will not
                    separate his renown from that of the other successors of Newton. It will unite
                    in one and the same series the illustrious names of D’Alembert, Clairaut,
                    Euler&gt; Lagrange, and Laplace. After Euler, Lagrange contributed most largely
                    to found the mathematical analysis, which, in the writings of these two great
                    geometricians, became a distinct science, the only one of the mathematical
                    theories of which it could be said that it had been completely and rigorously
                    demonstrated. Lagrange was born to invent and to enlarge all the sciences of
                    calculation. If he had been the contemporary of Archimedes and of Conon, he
                    would have shared the glory of the most memorable discoveries; and at Alexandria
                    he would have been the rival of Diophantes.</p>
                <p>M. de Laplace had received from nature all that force of genius which was
                    required for an immense enterprise; and in his <hi rend="italic">Almagest</hi>
                    of the nineteenth century, he has not only comprised all that had previously
                    been discovered in the mathematical and physical sciences, and which serves as
                    the foundation of astronomy; but he added to this science capital discoveries
                    peculiar to himself, and which had escaped all hiŝ predecessors. Either by his
                    own methods, or by those of which Euler and Lagrange had previously indicated
                    the principles, he resolved questions the most important, and certainly the most
                    difficult of all those which had been considered before his time. Thus, in the
                    motions of the moon he discovered an acceleration of which no one had previously
                    been able to-explain the cause. It had been supposed that this effect might
                    proceed from the resistance of the ethereal medium in which the heavenly bodies
                    revolved. But if this were so, the same cause, affecting the courses of the
                    planets, would tend more and more to change the primitive order. These stars
                    would be incessantly disturbed in or deflected from their orbits, and would end
                    by precipitating themselves upon the mass of the sun; and it would be necessary
                    for the creative power to interpose anew in order to prevent or to repair the
                    immense confusion which the lapse of time had produced. This cosmological
                    question was assuredly one of the greatest which the human mind could propose to
                    itself; and it is now completely resolved. The early researches of Μ. de Laplace
                    respecting the invariability of the dimensions of the solar system, and his
                    explanation of the secular equation of the moon, conducted him to this
                    solution.</p>
                <p>He had at first inquired if the acceleration of the lunar movement could be
                    explained by supposing that the action of gravity was not instantaneous, but
                    subjected to a successive transmission, like that of light. In this way,
                    however, he could not discover the true cause. But a new investigation, based
                    upon a sounder principle, led him to the desired object; and, on the 19th of
                    March 1787, he gave to the Academy of Sciences a clear and unexpected solution
                    of this capital difficulty, proving distinctly that the acceleration observed is
                    a necessary effect of universal gravitation. This great discovery threw new
                    light up0n <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> the most important points in the system
                    of the world. From it he deduced, that if the action of gravitation on the stars
                    was not instantaneous, this principle must be propagated at least fifty million
                    times more rapidly than light, the velocity of which is seventy thousand leagues
                    a second. He also concluded that the medium in which the heavenly bodies revolve
                    opposes no sensible resistance to the courses of the planets; since this cause
                    would especially affect the motion of the moon; in which, however, it produces
                    no observable effect. The same principle is also fertile in remarkable
                    consequences. It follows from it, that the motion of rotation of the earth on
                    its own axis is invariable. The duration of the day has not changed the
                    hundredth part of a second during two thousand years. The distance of the sun
                    from the earth may also be deduced with certainty from the assiduous observation
                    of the lunar motions. But the most striking consequence, perhaps, is that which
                    relates to the figure of the earth, the form of which is imprinted in certain
                    inequalities in the course of the moon, which could not have taken place if the
                    earth had been perfectly spherical. The quantity of the terrestrial oblateness
                    may be determined from the lunar movements alone; and the results which have
                    been deduced from these agree with the actual measures which have been obtained
                    from geodesical operations at the equator, in the northern regions of Europe, in
                    India, [and in various other countries. ∣</p>
                <p>“The explanation of the moon’s acceleration,” says Professor Playfair, in his
                    masterly and eloquent review of the <hi rend="italic">Système</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">du Monde,</hi> “and the proof that it is not constantly
                    increasing, but merely a periodical inequality, is a great step in the
                    philosophy of the heavens. The continual increase of the moon’s angular
                    velocity, which this phenomenon seemed to indicate, argued a constant diminution
                    of her distance from the earth, and gave some countenance to the notion that the
                    planetary orbits were Continually diminishing, and that there was, amongst the
                    bodies of our system, a tendency to descend to the centre of gravity of the
                    whole, where their union must finally terminate the present order of nature. To
                    this catastrophe an elegant and philosophic poet has beautifully alluded.</p>
                <p>Roll on, ye stars, exult in youthful prime, Mark with bright curves the printless
                    steps of time; Near and more near your beamy cars approach, And lessening orbs
                    on lessening orbs encroach. Flowers of the sky! ye too to age must yield, Frail
                    as your silken sisters of the field!</p>
                <p>Star after star from heaven’s high arch shall rush, Suns sink on suns, and
                    systems systems crush; Headlong, extinct, to one dark centre fall, And death,
                    and night, and chaos mingle all: Till o’er the wreck, emerging from the storm,
                    Immortal Nature lifts her changeful form;</p>
                <p>Mounts from her funeral pyre on wings of ♯ <hi rend="underline">am</hi> e, And

                <p>The destiny of nature is, however, more noble than that which this magnificent
                    description holds up to the fancy; and the algebraist has extracted from his
                    calculus a more sublime conclusion than the invention of a poet has been able to
                    attain. The constancy of nature, amidst all the changes she undergoes, is upheld
                    by the constitution of those changes, which prescribes to' each its limits, and
                    forces it to recur in a series, which in time reduces to nothing the sum of all
                    the deviations from the mean. Thus, the amount of the whole is permanent, though
                    the terms themselves are perpetually changing; and hence nature is rendered
                    immortal, not by emerging from the storm, but by being ever superior to its
                    power; its order is not renovated, but preserved; and the wisdom of its Author
                    has provided an antidote to evil, that renders all remedies unnecessary.”<note

                <p>We cannot undertake to indicate here the continuation of his labours, and the
                    discoveries which resulted from them. The bare enumeration, however rapid, would
                    exceed the limits prescribed to us. Besides his researches on the secular
                    equation of the moon, and the discovery, not less important and difficult, of
                    the cause.of the great inequalities of Jupiter and of Saturn, we would require
                    to cite his admirable theorems on the libration of the satellites of <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193202705" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2705-0100"/> Jupiter, to
                    recall his analytical labours on the flux and reflux of the sea, and to show the
                    immense extent which he has given to that question. In fact, there was no point
                    of importance in physical astronomy which he did not make the object of profound
                    study and discussion; and be subjected to calculation the greater part of the
                    physical conditions which his predecessors had omitted. In the question, already
                    so complex, of the form and the motion of rotation of the earth, he considered
                    the effect of the presence of the waters distributed between the continents of
                    land, the compression of the interior strata, and the secular diminution of the
                    dimensions of the globe. Amongst these researches may also be remarked those
                    which relate to the stability of the grand phenomena of nature. No subject can
                    possibly be more worthy the attention of philosophers. Thus, it has been
                    ascertained that the causes, whether fortuitous or constant, which disturb the
                    equilibrium of the seas, are subjected to limits which cannot be passed. The
                    specific gravity of the waters being much less than that of the solid earth, it
                    follows that the oscillations of the ocean are always included within very
                    narrow limits, which would not happen if the liquid diffused over the globe was
                    much more heavy. In general, nature keeps in reserve conservative forces, which,
                    being always present, act as soon as the disturbance commences, and with a
                    vigour proportioned to the alteration, until the accustomed order has been
                    re-established. In the primitive and liquid state of the terrestrial globe, the
                    heaviest substances must, by their own weight, have approached nearest the
                    centre; and this condition has determined the stability of the seas.</p>
                <p>Whatever may be the physical cause of the formation of the planets, it has
                    impressed upon all these bodies a motion of projection in the same direction
                    around an immense globe; and by this motion the solar system has become stable.
                    The same effect is produced in the system of the satellites and the rings. In
                    these, order is also maintained by the power of the central mass. It is not,
                    then, as Newton and Euler had both suspected, an adventitious force, which might
                    one day repair or prevent the disturbance caused by time. It is the law of
                    gravitation itself; a law which regulates all, is sufficient for all, and
                    maintains variety and order amongst all. Having once emanated from the supreme
                    wisdom, it has presided since the origin of time, and rendered all disorder
                    impossible. Newton and Euler did not know all the perfections of the universe.
                    In general, as often as any doubt has arisen in regard to the universality of
                    the Newtonian law, and the accession of some new cause has been proposed to
                    explain apparent irregularities, it has always happened that, after a profound
                    investigation, the primordial law has been verified. It now explains all the
                    known phenomena. The more precise observations have become, the more conformable
                    they are found to be to the theory of gravitation. Of all geometricians, Μ. de
                    Laplace is the one who has most profoundly investigated these great questions,
                    which, if we may so express it, he has also terminated. It cannot indeed be
                    affirmed that it was given to him to create an entirely new science, like
                    Archimedes and Galileo; or to give to mathematical doctrines original principles
                    and an immense extent, like Descartes, Newton, and Leibnitz; or, like Newton, to
                    be the first to transport to the heavens, and extend throughout the whole
                    universe, the terrestrial dynamics of Galileo. But, to use the words of Baron
                    Fourier, Μ. de Laplace was born “pour tout perfectionner, pour tout approfondir,
                    pour reculer toutes les limites, pour résoudre ce que l’on aurait pu croire
                    insoluble.” He would have completed the science of the heavens, if that science
                    could have been completed.</p>
                <p>Professor Playfair thus sums up his analysis of the great work of Laplace, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Traité de Mécanique Céleste,</hi> wherein the discoveries
                    which had first been communicated by the author, in the Memoirs of the Academy
                    of Sciences, are brought together into one view, and the general results deduced
                    from them by one uniform method of investigation.</p>
                <p>“Such is the work of Laplace,” says he, “affording an example, which is yet
                    solitary in the history of human knowledge, of a theory entirely complete; one
                    that has not only accounted for all the phenomena that were known, but that has
                    discovered many before unknown, which observation has since recognised. In this
                    theory, not only the elliptic motion of the planets, relatively to the sun, but
                    the irregularities produced by their mutual action, whether of the primary on
                    the primary, of the primary on the secondary, or of the secondary on one
                    another, are all deduced from the principle of gravitation, that mysterious
                    power, which unites the most distant regions of space, and the most remote
                    periods of duration. To this we must add the great truths brought into view and
                    fully demonstrated, by tracing the action of the same power through all its
                    mazes :— That all the inequalities in our system are periodical; that, by a
                    fixed appointment in nature, they are each destined to revolve in the same
                    order, and between the same limits; that the mean distances of the planets from
                    the sun, and the time of their revolutions round that body, are susceptible of
                    no change whatsoever; that our system is thus secured against natural
                    decay,—order and regularity preserved in the midst of so many disturbing
                    causes,—and anarchy and misrule eternally proscribed.</p>
                <p>“The work where this sublime picture is delineated, does honour, not to the
                    author only, but to the human race; and marks, undoubtedly, the highest point to
                    which man has yet ascended in the scale of intellectual attainment. The glory,
                    therefore, of having produced this work, belongs, not to the author alone, but
                    must be shared, in various proportions, among the philosophers and
                    mathematicians of all ages. Their efforts, from the age of Euclid and
                    Archimedes, to the time of Newton and Laplace, have all been required to the
                    accomplishment of this great object; they have been all necessary to form one
                    man for the author, and a few for the readers, of the work before us. Every
                    mathematician who has extended the bounds of his science; every astronomer who
                    has added to the number of facts, and the accuracy of observation; every artist
                    who has improved the construction of the instruments of astronomy,—all have
                    co-operated in preparing a state of knowledge in which such a book could exist,
                    and in which its merit could be appreciated. They have collected the materials,
                    sharpened the tools, or constructed the engines employed in the great edifice,
                    founded by Newton, and completed by Laplace.</p>
                <p>“In this estimate we detract nothing from the merit of the author himself; his
                    originality, his invention, and comprehensive views, are above all praise; nor
                    can any man boast of a higher honour, than that the Genius of the human race is
                    the only rival of his fame.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The same general character is exemplified in his researches on the analysis of
                    probabilities; a science altogether modern, but of immense extent, and one the
                    applications of which will one day embrace the whole range of human knowledge,
                    forming a happy supplement to the imperfection of our nature. The doctrine of
                    probabilities owes its origin to a single glance of the intuitive and fertile
                    genius of Pascal; and it was from the first cultivated by Fermat and Huygens. A
                    geometrician and philosopher, James Bernoulli, was its principal founder. A
                    sin-gularĭy<pb break="no" facs="nls:193202718" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2718-0101"/>
                    happy discovery of Stirling, the researches of Euler, and, above all, an
                    ingenious and important application made by Lagrange, improved this doctrine;
                    whilst new light was shed upon it by the objections of D’Alembert, and by the
                    philosophical views of Condorcet. But it was reserved for Μ. de Laplace to
                    collect and to fix its principles. In his hands it became a new science,
                    subjected to a single analytical method, and er prodigious extent. Fertile in
                    useful applications, this science will one day serve to illustrate all the
                    branches of natural philosophy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>After, what has been said of these brilliant discoveries, it is scarcely
                    necessary to add, that Μ. de Laplace was a member of all the learned academies
                    of Europe. He was also invested with high political dignities. After the 18th
                    Brumaire, the First Consul appointed him minister of the interior; but in this
                    office, it appears, he gave little satisfaction. “A geometrician of the first
                    class,” says Napoleon, “he did not reach mediocrity as a statesman. From the
                    first, the consuls became sensible they had made a mistake in the appointment.
                    He never viewed any subject in a true light; he was always occupied with
                    subtleties; his notions were all problematic; and he carried the spirit of the
                    <hi rend="italic">infiniment</hi><hi rend="italic">petit</hi> into the
                    administration.” Accordingly, at the end of six weeks, he surrendered to Lucien
                    Bonaparte the portefeuille of his office. But he was created a senator, then
                    made vice-chancellor, and at length chancellor of the conservative senate, and
                    at the same time a member of the legion of honour. In 1805, he presented a
                    report to the senate, in which he proved the necessity of restoring the
                    Gregorian calendar, and abolishing that of the republic. In 1814, he voted for
                    the abdication of Napoleon, an act which reflects no great honour on his memory.
                    During the Hundred Days he did not make his appearance at the Tuilleries,
                    apprehensive, no doubt, of being reproached with tergiversation and ingratitude.
                    Soon after the restoration, he was created a peer of France with the title of
                    Marquis; an honour for which he was more indebted, perhaps, to the vote he had
                    given in 1814, than to all his eminence in science. But the immortal author of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mécanique</hi><hi rend="italic">Celeste</hi> required none
                    of those arbitrary and adventitious distinctions, which are so often the reward
                    of political subserviency. His genius and his fame were incapable of receiving
                    any secondary or reflected illustration. The only points of real importance in
                    his life are the eternal truths which he discovered, not the dignities with
                    which he was invested; the immutable laws of the stability of the world which he
                    unfolded, not the rank which he for several years held in the senate called
                    conservative -, and the example which he has left to all those who cultivate the
                    sciences of patient thinking and incomparable perseverance.</p>
                <p>Μ. de Laplace enjoyed an advantage which fortune does not always afford to great
                    men. From his early youth, his merits were fully appreciated by his illustrious
                    friends. D’Alembert, as we have seen, lost no time in introducing him to the
                    Military School of France, and in providing for him, had it been necessary, a
                    better establishment at Berlin. The President Bochard de Saron caused to be
                    printed, at his own expense, the early works of Laplace. All the testimonies of
                    friendship which were given him recall great labours and great discoveries; but
                    nothing could contribute more to the progress of physical knowledge than his
                    relations with the illustrious Lavoisier, whose name, hallowed in the history of
                    the sciences, has become an object of eternal respect and sorrow. These two
                    celebrated men combined their efforts for the advancement of science. They
                    undertook and completed extensive researches, in order to measure one of the
                    most important elements of the physical theory of heat. They made also, about
                    the same time, a long series of experiments on the dilatations of solid
                    substances. The works of Newton show the importance which that great
                    geometrician attached to the special study of the physical sciences. Of all his
                    successors, Μ. de Laplace is the one who has made most of his experimental
                    method; he was almost as great a natural philosopher as a geometrician. His
                    researches on refraction, capillary attraction, barometrical measurements, the
                    statical properties of electricity, the propagation of sound, molecular action,
                    and the properties of gas, prove that every thing connected with the
                    investigation of nature was familiar to him. He desired above all things the
                    perfection of instruments, and caused to be constructed, at his own expense, by
                    a celebrated artist, a valuable astronomical instrument, which he presented to
                    the Observatory of France.</p>
                <p>All sorts of phenomena were perfectly known to him. He was connected by ancient
                    friendship with two natural philosophers, whose discoveries have thrown light
                    upon all the arts and all the chemical theories. History will associate the
                    names of Berthoflet and of Chaptal with that of Μ. de Laplace. He took pleasure
                    in meeting them together, and the conversations which then ensued had all for
                    their object the advancement of science. The gardens of Berthollet at his house
                    at Arcueil were contiguous to those of M. de Laplace. Interesting recollections
                    and great regrets have illustrated this locality. It was there that Laplace
                    received celebrated foreigners, and men in power, from whom science had
                    received, or hoped to receive, benefits, but, above all, those whom a sincere
                    zeal had attached to the sanctuary of the sciences. He received all with extreme
                    politeness—those who were just commencing their career, as well as the veterans
                    who were soon to finish it; and he carried this so far, that persons who did not
                    know the full extent of his genius would perhaps have supposed that he derived
                    some advantage from their conversation.</p>
                <p>In referring to the mathematical works of Μ. de Laplace, we have particularly
                    noticed the depth of his researches and the importance of his discoveries. But
                    these works are distinguished by another quality, which all readers have
                    appreciated, we mean the literary merit of the composition. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Systeme</hi><hi rend="italic">du Monde,</hi> in particular, is
                    remarkable for the elegant simplicity of the style and the purity of the
                    language. There had hitherto been no example of a work of this kind; but it
                    would be a mistake to suppose that a real knowledge of the phenomena of the
                    heavens can be acquired from such writings. The suppression of the signs
                    peculiar to the language of the calculus cannot conduce to clearness, or render
                    the perusal more easy. The work is a perfectly regular exposition of the results
                    of profound study; it is an ingenious and admirable summary of the principal
                    discoveries. The precision of the style, the choice of the methods, the grandeur
                    of the subject, give a singular interest to this vast picture; but its real
                    utility consists in recalling to geometricians the theorems, the demonstrations
                    of which were previously known to them. “C’est, à proprement parler,” says Μ.
                    Fourier, “une table de matières d’un traité mathématique.” The purely historical
                    works of Laplace, have another object. He therein presents to geometers, with
                    admirable talent, the progress of the human mind in the invention of the
                    sciences. The most abstract theories have, in fact, a beauty of expression which
                    is peculiar to them. This is what may <pb break="no" facs="nls:193202731"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-2731-0102"/>be observed in several treatises of Descartes, and
                    in some pages of Galileo, of Newton, and of Lagrange. The novelty of the views,
                    the elevation of the thoughts, and their relation to the great objects of
                    nature, attach and occupy the mind. It is sufficient that the style be pure, and
                    of a noble simplicity. It is this species of literature which M. de Laplace
                    selected; and it is certain that he placed himself in its first rank. If he
                    writes the history of great astronomical discoveries, he becomes a model of
                    elegance and precision. No leading feature of the subject ever escapes him, and
                    the expression is never either ambitious or obscure. Every thing that he calls
                    great is in fact great; whatever he omits does not deserve to be mentioned.</p>
                <p>Μ. de Laplace retained at a very advanced age that extraordinary memory for which
                    he had been so remarkable from his earliest years ;'a precious endowment, which,
                    though not genius itself, enables genius to acquire and to preserve. He had not
                    cultivated the fine arts, but he appreciated them. He loved the music of Italy
                    and the verses of Racine; and he often amused himself in reciting from memory
                    various passages of that great poet. The compositions of Raffaelle adorned his
                    apartments. Beside them were the portraits of Descartes, Vieta, Newton, Galileo,
                    and Euler. Μ. de Laplace had always accustomed himself to a light diet, which he
                    diminished more and more even to excess. His very delicate sight required
                    continual precautions, and he succeeded in preserving it without any alteration.
                    His care of himself had never any other object than that of reserving all his
                    time and all his <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> powers for the labours of the
                    mind. He lived for the^sciences, and the sciences in return have rendered his
                    memory immortal.</p>
                <p>At the commencement of the malady which ultimately carried him off', his friends
                    observed with dismay an instant of delirium. But even in that state the sciences
                    still occupied him. He spoke with unusual ardour of the motion of the stars, and
                    then of an experiment in physics, which he declared to be a capital one;
                    announcing to the persons he believed to be present, that he would soon
                    communicate these questions to the Academy. Meanwhile his strength rapidly
                    declined. His physician, Majendie, who merited all his confidence by superior
                    talents, and by those attentions whichfriendship alone could inspire, watched
                    beside his bed. Μ. Bouvard, his fellow-labourer and friend, never quitted him
                    for an instant. The persons who attended him at his last moments recalled the
                    titles of his glory, and spoke of his most splendid discoveries. “What we do
                    know,” replied the dying man, “is a small matter; what we do not know is
                    immense.” This is all that could be collected·, these were the last articulate
                    expressions that dropped from his lips. He soon afterwards expired without pain;
                    the powerful genius which had so long animated him separated itself from its
                    mortal habitation, and returned to the God who gave it. He died on the 5th of
                    March 1827, in the seventy-eighth year of his age.</p>
                <p>The successors of this great man will see accomplished the phenomena, the laws of
                    which he discovered. They will observe in the lunar motions the changes which he
                    has predicted, and of which he alone could assign the cause. The continual
                    observation of the satellites of Jupiter will perpetuate the memory of the
                    inventor of the theorems which express the laws according to which their courses
                    are regulated. The great inequalities of Jupiter and of Saturn, pursuing their
                    long periods, and giving to these planetary stars new situations, will
                    incessantly recall one of his most astonishing discoveries. These are the titles
                    of a true glory, which nothing can ever destroy. The spectacle of the heavens
                    will be changed; but, at the remote epoch when this shall occur, the glory of
                    the discoverer will remain unchanged. The traces of his genius bear the stamp of
                    immortality.</p>
                <p>The following list of the works of Μ. de Laplace, for which we are chiefly
                    indebted <hi rend="italic">to La France</hi><hi rend="italic">Littéraire</hi> by
                    Μ. Quérard, includes not only the titles of his different publications which
                    appeared in a separate form, but also those of the numerous memoirs with which,
                    during a period extending to rather more than half a century, he enriched the
                    collections of the Academy and the Institute, and the Journal of the Polytechnic
                    School :—</p>

                    in 4to. Another edition of this work was published the same year in 8vo, and the
                    work was reprinted in 1816, 1819, and 1825. The <hi rend="italic">Essai
                    Philosophique</hi> is merely an abstract of the large work on the same
                    subject.</p>

                    augmented by the author, Paris, 1824, in 4to, and in two vols. 8vo. The first
                    edition of this work appeared in 1796, in two vols. 8vo. In five books the
                    author treats, 1st, of the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies; 2d, of the
                    real motions of those bodies; 3d, of the laws of their motions; and, 4th, of the
                    theory of universal gravitation. The fifth book contains an abridgment of the
                    history of astronomy.</p>

                    This is merely the fifth book of the fifth edition of the <hi rend="italic"

                    revised and augmented by the author. The first edition of this work appeared in
                    1812, in4to. From 1816 to 1825 Μ. de Laplace published four supplements, which
                    the publisher, after having sold them for some years separately, added to the
                    volume to which they now serve as a complement. These supplements treat, 1st, of
                    the application of the calculus of probabilities to natural philosophy; 2d, of
                    the application of the calculus of probabilities to geodesical operations; and,
                    3d, of the application of geodesical formulae of probability to the meridian of
                    France. The fourth contains an abridgment of the theory of probabilities.</p>

                    published at different times. The first book treats of the general laws of the
                    equilibrium of motion; the second, of the law of universal gravitation, and the
                    motion of the centres of gravity of the heavenly bodies; the third, of the
                    figure of the heavenly bodies; the fourth, of the oscillations of the sea and
                    the atmosphere; the fifth, of the motions of the heavenly bodies around their
                    proper centres of gravity; the sixth, of the theory of the planetary motions;
                    the seventh, of the theory of the moon; the eighth, of the theory of the
                    satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus; the ninth, of the theory of comets;
                    the tenth, on different points relative to the system of the world; the
                    eleventh, on the figure and rotation of the earth; the twelfth, on the
                    attraction and repulsion of spheres, and the laws of the equilibrium and motion
                    of elastic fluids; the thirteenth, on the oscillation of the fluids which cover
                    the planets; the fourteenth, on the motions of the heavenly bodies around their

                    and the sixteenth, on the motions of the satellites. A second edition of the
                    first two volumes of this work was published at Paris in 1829, 1830. In this
                    country no attempt has yet been made, so far as we know, to translate the <hi
                    rend="italic">Traite de Mécanique</hi><hi rend="italic">Celeste</hi> into
                    English; but, in 1830, an English translation of the first volume, with a
                    commentary, was published at Boston in the United States of America. Both the
                    translation and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193202744" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2744-0103"
                    />the commentary are by Dr Bowditch of Boston; but the amount of the, latter is
                    out of all proportion to the text, being intended to enable persons but
                    moderately skilled in the mathematics to comprehend the profound analytical
                    investigations of the great astronomer, and to follow him to his beautiful and
                    striking results.</p>
                <p>8. Besides the works which we have just enumerated, Μ. de Laplace is also the
                    author of a series of very important Memoirs, in which, from 1772 to 1823, he
                    published the collections of the old and the new Academy of Sciences, that of
                    the Institute, and the Journal of the Polytechnic School. The subjects of these
                    Memoirs are exceedingly various. We give the following list in the chronological
