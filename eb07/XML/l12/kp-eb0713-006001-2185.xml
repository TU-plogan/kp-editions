                <p>I.—ORIGIN OF <hi rend="smallcaps">language: remarks on the idiom and genius of
                    language.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Language,</hi> in the proper sense of the
                    term, signifies the expression of our ideas and their various relations by
                    certain articulate sounds, which are used as the signs of those ideas and
                    relations. By articulate sounds are meant those modulations of the voice, or of
                    sound emitted from the thorax, which are formed by means of the mouth and its
                    several organs, the teeth, the tongue, the lips, and the palate. In a more
                    general sense, <hi rend="italic">language</hi> is sometimes used to denote all
                    sounds by which animals of any kind express their particular feelings and
                    impulses in a manner that is intelligible to their own species.</p>
                <p>Nature has endowed every animal with powers sufficient to make known those
                    sensations and desires with which it is necessary, for the preservation of the
                    individual or the continuance of the kind, that others of the same species
                    should be acquainted. For this purpose, the organs of all vocal animals are so
                    formed as, upon any particular impulse, to utter sounds, of which those of the
                    same species instinctively know the meaning. The summons of the hen is instantly
                    obeyed by the whole brood of chickens; and in many others of the irrational
                    tribes a similar mode of communication may be observed between the parents and
                    the offspring, and also between one animal and another. But it is not amongst
                    animals of the same species only that these instinctive sounds are mutually
                    understood. It is as necessary for animals to know the voices of their enemies
                    as those of their friends; and the roaring of the lion is a sound of which,
                    previously to all experience, every beast of the forest is naturally afraid.
                    Between these animal voices and the language of men, however, there is very
                    little analogy. Human language is capable of expressing ideas and notions, which
                    there is every reason to believe that the mind of the brutes cannot conceive.
                    “Speech,” says Aristotle, “is made to indicate what is expedient and what
                    inexpedient, and, in consequence of this, what is just and unjust. It is
                    therefore given to men, because it is peculiar to them, that of good and evil,
                    just and unjust, they only, with respect to other animals, possess a sense or
                    feeling.” The voices of brutes seem intended by nature to express, not distinct
                    ideas or moral modes, but only such feelings as it is for the good of the
                    species that they should have the power of making known; and in this, as in al!
                    other respects, these voices are analogous, not to speaking, but to weeping,
                    laughing, singing, groaning, screaming, and other natural and audible
                    expressions of passion or appetite. Another difference between the language of
                    men and the voices of brute animals consists in articulation, by which the
                    former may be resolved into distinct elementary sounds or syllables; whereas the
                    latter, being for the most part inarticulate, are not capable of such a
                    resolution. Hence Homer and Hesiod characterize man by the epithet <hi
                    rend="italic">μοξοψ,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">voice-dividing,</hi> as denoting
                    a power peculiar to the human species; for though there are a few birds which
                    utter sounds that may be divided into syllables, yet each of these birds utters
                    but one such sound, which seems to be employed rather as a note of natural music
                    than for the purpose of giving information to others; and her.ee, when the bird
                    is agitated, it utters cries which are very different, and have no
                    articulation.</p>
                <p>A third difference between the language of men and the significant cries of brute
                    animals, is, that the former is the product of art, the latter derived from
                    nature. Every human language is learned by imitation, and is intelligible only
                    to those who either inhabit the country where it is vernacular, or have been
                    taught it by a master or by books. But the voices in question arc not learned by
                    imitation; and being wholly instinctive, they are intelligible to all the
                    animals of that species by which they are uttered, though brought together from
                    the most distant countries on earth. That a dog which had never heard another
                    bark, would notwithstanding bark himself, and that the barkings or yelps of a
                    Lapland dog would be instinctively understood by the dogs of Spain, Calabria, or
                    any other country, are facts which do not admit of doubt. But there is no reason
                    to imagine that a man who had never heard any language spoken would himself
                    speak; and it is well known that the language spoken in one country is
                    unintelligible to the natives of another country where a different language is
                    spoken. Indeed it seems obvious, that were there any instinctive language, the
                    first words uttered by all children would be the same; and that every child,
                    whether born in the desert or in society, would understand the language of every
                    other child, however educated or however neglected. Nay, more, we may venture to
                    affirm that such a language, though its general use might, in society, be
                    superseded by the prevailing dialect of art, could never be wholly lost; and
                    that no man of one country would find it difficult, far less impossible, to
                    communicate the knowledge of his natural and most pressing wants to the men of
                    any other country, whether barbarous or civilized. The exercise of cultivated
                    reason, and the arts of civil life, have indeed eradicated many of our original
                    instincts, but they have not eradicated all.</p>
                <p>There are external indications of the internal feelings and desires, which appear
                    in the most polished society, and which are confessedly instinctive. The
                    passions, emotions, sensations, and appetites, are naturally expressed in the
                    countenance by characters which the savage and the courtier can read with equal
                    readiness. The serene look, the smoothed brow, the dimpled smile, and the
                    glistening eye, denote equanimity and good will, in terms which no man can
                    mistake. The contracted brow, the glaring eye, the sullen gloom, and the
                    threatening air, denote rage, indignation, and defiance, as plainly and forcibly
                    as revilings or imprecations. To teach men to disguise these instinctive
                    indications of their temper, and</p>
                <p>To carry smiles and sunshine in their face, When discontent sits heavy at their
                    heart, constitutes a great part of modern manners. Yet in spite of every effort
                    of the utmost skill, and of every motive resulting from interest, the most
                    consummate hypocrite, or the most hackneyed politician, is not always able to
                    prevent his real disposition from becoming apparent in his countenance. He may
                    indeed, by long practice, acquire a great command over his temper, and the
                    instinctive signs of it; but at times nature will predominate over art, and a
                    sudden and violent passion will flash in his face, so as to be visible to the
                    eye of every beholder. If these observations be just, and we flatter ourselves
                    that no man will call them in question, it seems to follow, that, if mankind
                    were prompted by instinct to use articulate sounds as indications of their
                    passions, affections, sensations, and ideas, the language of nature could never
                    be wholly forgotten, and that it would sometimes predominate over the language
                    of art. Groans, sighs, and some inarticulate lively sounds, are naturally
                    expressive of pain and pleasure, and equally intelligible to all mankind. The
                    occasional use of these no art can wholly banish; and if there were articulate
                    sounds, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193202198" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2198-0061"
                    />naturally expressive of the same feelings, it is not conceivable that art or
                    education could banish the use of them, merely because by the organs of the
                    mouth they are broken into parts and resolvable into syllables.</p>
                <p>It being thus evident that there is no instinctive articulated language, it has
                    become an inquiry of some importance, how mankind were first induced to
                    fabricate articulate sounds, and to employ them for the purpose of communicating
                    their thoughts. Children learn to speak by insensible imitation; and When
                    advanced some years in life, they study foreign languages under proper
                    instructors. But the first men had no speakers to imitate, and no formed
                    language to study. By what means, then, did they learn to speak? On this
                    question only two opinionscan possibly be formed. Either language must have been
                    originally revealed from heaven, or it must be the fruit of human invention.</p>
                <p>The latter opinion is strongly supported by Lord Monboddo, in his very learned
                    and able work on the Origin and Progress of Language. But he candidly
                    acknowledges, that if language was invented, it was of very difficult invention,
                    and far beyond the reach of the grossest savages. Accordingly he holds, that
                    though men were originally solitary animals, and had no natural propensity to
                    the social life; yet, before language could be invented, they must have been
                    associated for ages, and have carried on in concert some common work. Nay, he is
                    decidedly of opinion, that before the invention of an art so difficult as
                    language, men must not only have herded together, but also formed some kind of
                    civil polity, existed in that political state a very long time, and acquired
                    such powers of abstraction as to be able to form general ideas. But it is
                    obvious, that men could not have instituted civil polity, or carried on in
                    concert any common work, without communicating their designs to each other; and
                    there are four ways by which the author thinks that t* is might have been done
                    before the invention of speech, viz. 1st, <hi rend="italic">Inarticulate
                    cries,</hi> expressive of sentiments and passions; 2d, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gestures,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">the expression of countenance;</hi> 3d,
                    <hi rend="italic">Imitative sounds,</hi> expressive of audible things; and, 4th,
                    <hi rend="italic">Painting,</hi> by which visible objects may be
                    represented.</p>
                <p>Of these four ways of communication, it is plain that only two have any
                    connection with language, inarticulate cries and imitative sounds; and of these
                    the author abandons the latter as having contributed nothing to the invention of
                    articulation, though he thinks it may have helped to advance its progress. “I am
                    disposed,” says he, “to believe, that the framing of words with an analogy to
                    the sound of the things expressed by them belongs rather to languages of art
                    than to the first languages spoken by rude and barbarous nations.” It is
                    therefore inarticulate cries only that must have given rise to the formation of
                    language. Such cries are used by all animals who have any use of voice, to
                    express their wants; and the fact is, that all barbarous nations have cries
                    expressing different things, such as joy, grief, terror, surprise, and the like.
                    These, together with gestures and expressions of the countenance, were
                    undoubtedly the methods of communication first used by men. We have but to
                    suppose, says our author, a great number of our species carrying on some common
                    business, and conversing together by signs and cries; and we have men just in a
                    state proper for the invention of language. For if we suppose their numbers to
                    have increased, their wants would also increase; and then these two methods of
                    communication would become too confined for that larger sphere of life which
                    their wants would make necessary. The only thing, then, that remained to be
                    done, was to give a greater variety to the instinctive cries; and as the natural
                    progress is from what is easy to what is more difficult, the first variation
                    would be merely by tones from low to high, and from grave to acute. But this
                    variety could not answer all the purposes of speech in society; and being
                    advanced so far, it was natural that an animal so sagacious as man would go on
                    farther, and come at last to the only other variation remaining, namely,
                    articulation. The first articulation would be very simple, the voice being
                    broken and distinguished only by a few vowels and consonants. And as all natural
                    cries are from the throat and larynx, with little or no operation of the organs
                    of the mouth, it is natural to suppose, that the first languages were for the
                    greater part spoken from the throat; that what consonants were used to vary the
                    cries, were mostly guttural; and that the organs of the mouth would at first be
                    very little employed. From this account of the origin of language, it appears
                    that the first sounds articulated were the natural cries by which men signified
                    their wants and desires to one another, such as calling one another for certain
                    purposes, and other such things as were most necessary for carrying on any joint
                    work; then in process of time other cries would be articulated, to signify that
                    such and such actions had been performed or were performing, or that such and
                    such events had happened relative to the common business. The names of such
                    objects as they were conversant with would be invented; but as we cannot suppose
                    savages to be deep in abstraction or skilful in the art of arranging things
                    according to their <hi rend="italic">genera</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >species,</hi> all things, however similar, except perhaps the individuals of
                    the lowest species, would be expressed by different words not related to each
                    other either by derivation or composition. Thus would language grow by degrees;
                    and as it grew, it would be more and more broken and articulated by consonants;
                    but still the words would retain a great deal of their original nature of animal
                    cries. Add thus things would go on, words unrelated still multiplying, till at
                    last the language would become too cumbersome for use, and then art would be
                    obliged to interpose, and form a language upon a few radical words, according to
                    the rules and method of etymology.</p>
                <p>Those who think that language was originally revealed from heaven, consider this
                    account of its human invention as a series of mere suppositions hanging loosely
                    together, and the whole suspended from no fixed principle. The opinions of
                    Diodorus, Vitruvius, Horace, Lucretius, and Cicero, which are frequently quoted
                    in its support, are in their estimation of no greater authority than the
                    opinions of other men; for as language was formed and brought to a great degree
                    of perfection long before the era of any historian with whom we are acquainted,
                    the antiquity of the Greek and Roman writers, who are comparatively of
                    yesterday, gives them no advantage in this inquiry over the philosophers of
                    France and England. Aristotle has defined man to be a <hi rend="italic">ζοιον
                    μtμητoοον,</hi> or imitative animal; and the definition is certainly so far
                    just, that man is much more remarkable for imitation than invention; therefore,
                    say the r&lt; asoners on this side of the question, had the human race been
                    originally <hi rend="italic">mutum et turpe pecus,</hi> they would have
                    continued so to the end of time, unless they had been taught to speak by some
                    superior intelligence. That the first men sprung from the earth like vegetables,
                    no modern philosopher has ventured to assert; nor does there anywhere appear
                    sufficient evidence that men were originally in the state of savages. The oldest
                    book extant contains the only rational cosmogony known to the ancient nations;
                    and that book represents the first human inhabitants of this earth, not only as
                    reasoning and speaking animals, but also as in a state of high perfection and
                    happiness, of which they were deprived for disobedience to their Creator. Moses,
                    setting aside his claim to inspiration, deserves, from the consistency of his
                    narrative, at least as much credit as Moschus, or Democritus, or Epicurus; and
                    from his prior antiquity, if antiquity could on this subject have any weight, he
                    would deserve more, as <pb break="no" facs="nls:193202211"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-2211-0062"/>having lived nearer to the period of which they
                    all write. But the question respecting the origin of language may be decided
                    without resting on authority of any kind, merely by considering the nature of
                    speech, and the mental and corporeal powers of man. Those who maintain it to be
                    of human invention, suppose men at first to have been solitary animals,
                    afterwards to have herded together without government or subordination, then to
                    have formed political societies, and by their own exertions to have advanced
                    from the grossest ignorance to the refinements of science. But, say the
                    reasoners whose cause we are now pleading, this is a supposition contrary to all
                    history and all experience. There is not upon record a single instance well
                    authenticated of a people emerging by their own efforts from barbarism to
                    civilization. There have indeed been many nations raised from the state of
                    savages; but it is known that they were polished, not by their own repeated
                    exertions, but by the influence of individuals or colonies from nations more
                    enlightened than themselves. The original savages of Greece were tamed by the
                    Pelasgi, a foreign tribe; and were afterwards further polished by Orpheus,
                    Cecrops, Cadmus, and others, who derived their knowledge from Egypt and the
                    East. The ancient Bomans, a ferocious and motley crew, received the blessings of
                    law and religion from a succession of foreign kings; and the conquests of Rome
                    at a later period contributed to civilize the rest of Europe. In America, the
                    only two nations which at the invasion of the Spaniards could be said to have
                    advanced a single step from barbarism, were indebted for their superiority over
                    the other tribes, not to the gradual and unassisted progress of the human mind,
                    but to the wise institutions of foreign legislators.</p>
                <p>This is not the proper place for tracing the progress of man from the savage
                    state to that of political society; but experience teaches us, that in every art
                    it is much easier to improve than to invent? The human mind, when put into the
                    proper track, is indeed capable of making great advances in arts and sciences;
                    but if any credit be due to the records of history, it has not, in a people
                    sunkin ignorance and barbarity, sufficient vigour to discover that track, or to
                    conceive a state different from the present. If the rudest inhabitants of
                    America and other countries have continued, as there is every reason to believe
                    they have continued, for ages in the same unvaried state of barbarism; how is it
                    imaginable that people so much ruder than they, as to be ignorant of all
                    language, should think of inventing an art so difficult as that of speech, or
                    even to frame a conception of the thing. In building, fishing, hunting,
                    navigating, and the like, they might imitate the instinctive arts of other
                    animals, but there is no other animal that expresses its sensations and
                    affections by arbitrary articulate sounds. It is said, that before language
                    could be invented, mankind must have existed for ages in large political
                    societies, and have carried on in concert some common work; but if inarticulate
                    cries, and the natural visible signs of the passions and affections, were modes
                    of communication sufficiently accurate to keep a large society together for
                    ages, and to direct its members in the execution of some common work, what could
                    be their inducement to the invention of an art so useful and difficult as that
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> language?</p>
                <p>Let us however suppose, say the advocates for the cause which we are now
                    supporting, that different nations of savages set about inventing an art of
                    communicating their thoughts, which experience had taught them was not
                    absolutely necessary; how came they all, without exception, to think of the one
                    art of articulating the voice for this purpose? Inarticulate cries, out of which
                    language is fabricated, have indeed an instinctive connection with our passions
                    and affections; but there are gestures and expressions of countenance with which
                    our passions and affections are in the same manner connected. If the natural
                    cries of passion could be so modified and enlarged as to be capable of
                    communicating to the hearer every idea in the mind of the speaker, it is certain
                    that the natural gestures could be so modified as to answer the very same
                    purpose (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pantomime)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">;</hi> and
                    it is strange that, among the several nations who invented languages, not one
                    should have stumbled upon fabricating visible signs of their ideas, but that all
                    should have agreed to denote them by articulated sounds. Every nation whose
                    language is narrow and rude supplies its defects by a violent gesticulation; and
                    therefore, as much less genius is exerted in the improvement of any art than was
                    requisite for its first invention, it is natural to suppose that, had men been
                    left to devise for themselves a method of communicating their thoughts, they
                    would not have attempted any other than that by which they now improve the
                    language transmitted by their fathers. It is vain to urge that articulate sounds
                    are fitter for the purpose of communicating thought than visible gesticulation;
                    for though this may be true, it is a truth which could hardly occur to savages,
                    who had never experienced the fitness of either; and if, to counterbalance the
                    superior fitness of articulation, its extreme difficulty be taken into view, it
                    must appear little less than miraculous that every savage tribe should think of
                    it rather than the easier method of artificial gesticulation. Savages, it is
                    well known, are remarkable for their indolence, and for always preferring ease
                    to utility; but their modes of life give such pliancy to their bodies, that they
                    could with very little trouble bend their limbs and members into any positions
                    agreed upon as the signs of ideas. This is so far from being the case with
                    respect to the organs of articulation, that it is with extreme difficulty, if at
                    all, that a man advanced in life can be taught to articulate any sound which he
                    has not been accustomed to hear. No foreigner who comes to England after the age
                    of thirty ever pronounces the language tolerably well; an Englishman of that age
                    can hardly be taught to utter the guttural sound which a Scotchman gives to the
                    Greek χ, or even the French sound of the vowel u; and of the solitary savages
                    who have been caught in different forests, we know not that there has been one
                    who, after the age of manhood, learned to articulate any language so as to make
                    himself readily understood. The present age has indeed furnished many instances
                    of deaf persons being taught to speak intelligibly by skilful masters moulding
                    the organs of the mouth into the positions proper for articulating the voice;
                    but who was to perform this task amongst the inventors of language, when all
                    mankind were equally ignorant of the means by which articulation is effected? In
                    a word, daily experience informs us, that men who have not learned to articulate
                    in their childhood, nevcrafterwards acquire the faculty of speech but by such
                    helps as savages cannot obtain; and therefore, if speech was invented at all, it
                    must have been either by children who were incapable of invention, or by men who
                    were incapable of speech. A thousand, nay, a million, of children could not
                    think of inventing a language. While the organs are pliable, there is not
                    understanding enough to frame the conception of a language; and by the time that
                    there is understanding, the organs are become too stiff for the task, and
                    therefore, say the advocates for the divine origin of language, reason as well
                    as history intimates, that mankind in all ages must have been speaking animals;
                    the young having constantly acquired this art by imitating those who were older;
                    and we may warrantably conclude, that our first parents received it by immediate
                    inspiration.</p>
                <p>To this account of the origin of language an objection readily offers itself. If
                    the first language was communicated by inspiration, it must have been perfect,
                    and held in reverence by those who spake it, in other words, by all <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193202224" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2224-0063"/> mankind. But a
                    vast variety of languages have prevailed in the world; and some of these which
                    remain are known to be very imperfect, whilst there is reason to believe that
                    many others are lost. If different languages were originally invented by
                    different nations, all this would naturally follow from the mixture of these
                    nations; but what could induce men possessed of one perfect language of divine
                    original, to forsake it for barbarous jargons of their own invention, and in
                    every respect inferior to that with which their forefathers or themselves had
                    been inspired?</p>
                <p>In answer to this objection, it is said, that nothing was given by inspiration
                    but the faculty of speech and the elements of language; for when once men had
                    language, it is easy to conceive how they might have modified it by their
                    natural powers, as thousands can improve what they could not invent. The first
                    language, if given by inspiration, must in its principles have had all the
                    perfection of which language is susceptible; but from the nature of things it
                    could not possibly be very copious. The words of language are either proper
                    names or the signs of ideas and relations; but it cannot be supposed that the
                    All-wise Instructor would load the memories of men with words to denote things
                    then unknown, or with the signs of ideas which they had not then acquired. It
                    was sufficient that a foundation was laid of such a nature as would support the
                    largest superstructure which they might ever after have occasion to raise upon
                    it, and that they were taught the method of building by composition and
                    derivation. This would long preserve the language radically the same, though it
                    could not prevent the introduction of different dialects in the different
                    countries over which men spread themselves. In whatever region we suppose the
                    human race to have been originally placed, the increase of their numbers would
                    in process of time either disperse them into different nations, or extend the
                    one nation to a vast distance on all sides from what we may call the seat of
                    government. In either case they would everywhere meet with new objects, which
                    would occasion the invention of new names; and as the difference of climate and
                    other natural causes would compel those who removed eastward or northward to
                    adopt modes of life in many respects different from the modes of those who
                    travelled towards the west or the south, a vast number of words would in one
                    country be fabricated to denote complex conceptions, which must necessarily be
                    unintelligible to the body of the people inhabiting countries where those
                    conceptions had never been formed. Thus would various dialects be unavoidably
                    introduced into the original language, even whilst all mankind remained in one
                    society and under one government. But after separate and independent societies
                    were formed, these variations would become more numerous, and the several
                    dialects would deviate farther and farther from each other, as well as from the
                    idiom and genius of the parent tongue, in proportion to the distance of the
                    tribes by whom they were spoken.</p>
                <p>If we suppose a few people either to have been banished together from the society
                    of their brethren, or to have wandered of their own accord to a distance, from
                    which through trackless forests they could not return (and such emigrations have
                    often taken place), it is easy to see how the most copious language must in
                    their mouths have soon become narrow, and how the offspring of inspiration must
                    have in time become so deformed as hardly to retain a feature of the ancestor
                    whence it originally sprung. Men do not long retain a practical skill in those
                    arts which they never exercise; and there are abundance of facts to prove, that
                    a single man cast upon a desert island, and having to provide the necessaries of
                    life by his own ingenuity, would soon lose the art of speaking with fluency his
                    mother tongue. A small number of men cast away together, would indeed retain
                    that art somewhat longer; but in a space of time not very long, it would in a
                    great measure be lost by them or their posterity. In this state of banishment,
                    as their time would be almost wholly occupied in hunting, fishing, and other
                    means within their reach to support a wretched existence, they would have very
                    little leisure, and perhaps less desire, to preserve by conversation the
                    remembrance of that ease and those comforts of which they now found themselves
                    for ever deprived: and they would of course soon forget all the words which in
                    their native language had been used to denote the accommodations and elegancies
                    of polished life. This at least seems to be certain, that they would not attempt
                    to teach their children a part of language which in their circumstances could be
                    of no use to them, and of which it would be impossible to make them comprehend
                    the meaning; for where there are no ideas, the signs of ideas cannot be made
                    intelligible. From such colonies as this, dispersed over the earth, it is
                    probable that all those nations of savages have arisen, which have induced so
                    many philosophers to imagine that the state of the savage was the original state
                    of man; and if so, we see that from the language of inspiration must have
                    unavoidably sprung a number of different dialects all extremely rude and narrow,
                    and retaining nothing of the parent tongue, except perhaps the names of the most
                    conspicuous objects of nature, and of those wants and enjoyments which are
                    inseparable from humanity. The savage state has no artificial wants, and
                    furnishes few ideas that require <hi rend="italic">terms</hi> to express them.
                    The habits of solitude and silence incline a savage rarely to speak; and when he
                    speaks, he uses the same terms to denote different ideas. Speech therefore, in
                    this rude condition of men, must be extremely narrow and extremely various.
                    Every new region, and every new climate, suggests different ideas and creates
                    different wants, which must be expressed either by terms entirely new, or by old
                    terms used with a new signification. Hence must originate great diversity, even
                    in the first elements of speech, among all savage nations, the words retained of
                    the original language being used in various senses, and pronounced, as we may
                    believe, with various accents.</p>
                <p>When any of those savage tribes emerged from their barbarism, whether by their
                    own efforts or by the aid of people more enlightened than themselves, it is
                    obvious that the improvement and copiousness of their language would keep pace
                    with their own progress in knowledge and in the arts of civil life; but in the
                    infinite multitude of words which civilization and refinement add to language,
                    it would be little less than miraculous were any two nations to agree upon the
                    same sounds to represent the same ideas. Superior refinement, indeed, may induce
                    imitation, conquests may impose a language, and extension of empires may melt
                    down different nations and different dialects into one mass; but independent
                    tribes naturally give rise to diversity of tongues, nor does it seem possible
                    that they should retain more of the original language than the words expressive
                    of those objects with which all men are at all times equally concerned. The
                    variety of tongues, therefore, the copiousness of some, and the narrowness of
                    others, furnish no good objection to the divine origin of language in general;
                    for, whether language was at first revealed from heaven, or in a course of ages
                    invented by men, a multitude of dialects would inevitably arise as soon as the
                    human race had separated into a number of distinct and independent nations.<note

                    an assertion, that the Deity did not originally bestow on man the gift of
                    speech; but we think, with I.ord Monboddo, and many others, that if such a boon
                    ever was conferred, it must, in the revolutions and calamities that have
                    befallen the human race, inevitably have been lost; and therefore, that as
                    multitudes of languages exist and have ever existed, the art of speech is one
                    which man is capable of attaining to, independently of any supernatural aid.
                    This is the view taken by our best philosophers. Thus, Mr Stewart,
                    notwithstanding his well-known caution in forming conclusions on momentous
                    subjects, unhesitatingly avows his conviction, that “the human faculties are
                    competent to the formation of language.” <hi rend="italic">(Philosophy of the
                    Mind,</hi> vol. iii. chap. 1.) In another place, the same admirable writer makes
                    the following philosophical observations on this subject :—“The steps in the
                    formation of language cannot probably be determined with certainty; yet if we
                    can show, from the known principles of human nature, how the various parts may
                    naturally have arisen, the mind is not only to a certain degree satisfied, but a
                    check is given to that indolent philosophy which refers to a miracle whatever
                    appearances, either in the natural or moral world, it is unable to explain.” One
                    of the most ingenious attempts that ever has been made to show by what steps the
                    human mind would naturally proceed in the acquisition of speech, is that
                    contained in Dr Adam Smith’s “Considerations on the Formation of Languages.” His
                    theory may perhaps be liable to objection in some of its details; but it is
                    developed with singular clearness and simplicity; and it must, in its general
                    scope and design, be allowed by all candid and competent judges to be eminently
                    philosophical. This essay was annexed by its author to the first edition of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Theory of Moral Sentiments</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and we
                    are told by Mr Stewart, that he always regarded it with great partiality, and
                    that he reprinted it, without a single alteration, in the last edition of that
                    work which he himself revised. Mr Stewart’s commentary upon it <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Philosophy of the Mind,</hi> ubi supra) ought to be perused alongst with
                    it</p></note></p>

                <p>As the knowledge of languages constitutes a great part of erudition, as their
                    beauties and deformities furnish employment to taste, and as these depend much
                    upon the idioms of the different tongues, we shall proceed to make a few remarks
                    upon the advantages and defects of some of those idioms of language with which
                    we are best acquainted. As the words <hi rend="italic">idiom</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">genius of</hi> a language are often confounded, it will be
                    necessary to inform the reader, that by <hi rend="italic">idiom</hi> we would
                    here be understood to mean that general mode of arranging words into sentences
                    which prevails in any particular language; and by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >genius</hi> of a language, we mean to express the particular set of ideas which
                    the words of any language, either from their formation or multiplicity, are most
                    naturally apt to excite in the mind of any one who hears it properly uttered.
                    Thus, although the English, French, Italian, and Spanish languages nearly agree
                    in the same general <hi rend="italic">idiom,</hi> yet the particular <hi
                    rend="italic">genius</hi> of each is remarkably different. The English is
                    naturally bold, nervous, and strongly articulated; the French is weaker, and
                    more flowing; the Italian more soothing and harmonious; and the Spanish more
                    grave, sonorous, and stately. Now, when we examine the several languages which
                    have been most esteemed in Europe, we find that there are only two <hi
                    rend="italic">idioms</hi> among them which are essentially distinguished from
                    one another; and all those languages are divided between these two idioms,
                    following sometimes the one and sometimes the other, either wholly or in part.
                    The languages which may be said to adhere to the first <hi rend="italic"
                    >idiom,</hi> are those which in their construction follow the order of nature;
                    that is, express their ideas in the natural order in which they occur to the
                    mind; the subject which occasions the action appearing first; then the action
                    accompanied with its several modifications; and, last of all, the object to
                    which it has reference. These may properly be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >analogous</hi> languages; and of this kind are the English, French, and most of
                    the modern languages in Europe. The languages which may be referred to the other
                    <hi rend="italic">idiom,</hi> are those which follow no other order in their
                    construction than what the taste or fancy of the composer may suggest; sometimes
                    making the object, sometimes the action, and sometimes the modification of the
                    action, to precede or follow the other parts. The confusion which this might
                    occasion is avoided by the particular manner of <hi rend="italic"
                    >inflecting</hi> their words, by which they are made to refer to the others with
                    which they ought to be connected, in whatever part of the sentence they occur,
                    the mind being left at liberty to connect the several parts with one another
                    after the whole sentence is concluded; and as the words may be here transposed
                    at pleasure, those languages may be called <hi rend="italic">transpositwe</hi>
                    languages. To this class we must, in an especial manner, refer the Latin and
                    Greek languages. As each of these <hi rend="italic">idioms</hi> has several
                    advantages and defects peculiar to itself, ŵe shall endeavour to point out the
                    most considerable of them, in order to ascertain with greater precision the
                    particular character and excellence of some of those languages now principally
                    spoken or studied in Europe.</p>
                <p>The partiality which oπr forefathers, at the revival of letters in Europe,
                    naturally entertained for the Greek and Roman languages, made them look upon
                    every distinguishing peculiarity belonging to them as <hi rend="italic">one</hi>
                    of the <hi rend="italic">many</hi> causes of the amazing superiority which those
                    languages evidently enjoyed above every other at that time spoken in Europe.
                    This blind deference still continues to be paid to them, as our minds are early
                    prepossessed with these ideas, and as we are taught in our earliest infancy to
                    believe, that to entertain the least idea of our own language being equal to the
                    Greek or Latin in any particular whatever, would be a certain mark of ignorance
                    or want of taste. Their rights, therefore, like those of the church in former
                    ages, remain still to be examined; and we, without exerting our reason to
                    discover truth from falsehood, tamely sit down satisfied with the idea of their
                    undoubted pre-eminence in every respect. But if we look around us for a moment,
                    and observe the many excellent productions which are to be met with in almost
                    every language of Europe, we must be satisfied that <hi rend="italic">even
                    these</hi> are now possessed of <hi rend="italic">some</hi> powers which might
                    afford at least a presumption, that if they were cultivated with a proper degree
                    of attention, they might, in <hi rend="italic">same respects,</hi> be made to
                    rival, if not to excel, those beautiful and justly admired remains of antiquity.
                    Without endeavouring to derogate from their merit, let us, with the cool eye of
                    philosophic reasoning, endeavour to bring before the sacred <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> tribunal of truth some of those opinions which have
                    been most generally received upon this subject, and rest the determination of
                    the cause on her impartial decision.</p>
                <p>The learned reader well knows, that the several changes which take place in the
                    arrangement of the words in every <hi rend="italic">transpositive</hi> language,
                    could not be admitted without occasioning great confusion, unless certain
                    classes of words were endowed with particular variations, by means of which they
                    might be made to refer to the other words with which they ought naturally to be
                    connected. From this cause proceeds the necessity of several variations of <hi
                    rend="italic">verbs, nouns,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">adjectives</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> which are not in the least essential or necessary in the
                    <hi rend="italic">analogous</hi> languages, as we have pretty fully explained
                    under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Grammar,</hi> to which we refer for
                    satisfaction on this head. We shall in this place consider, whether these
                    variations are an advantage or a disadvantage to language.</p>
                <p>As it is generally supposed that every language the verbs of which admit of <hi
                    rend="italic">inflection,</hi> is on that account much more perfect than one
                    where they are varied by <hi rend="italic">auxiliaries,</hi> we shall, in the
                    first place, examine this with some degree of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193202250" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2250-0065"/>attention; and, that what is
                    said on this head may be the 'more intelligible, we shall give examples from the
                    Latin and English languages. We make choice of these languages, because the
                    Latin is more purely <hi rend="italic">transpositive</hi> than the Greek, and
                    the English admits of less <hi rend="italic">inflection</hi> than any other
                    language that we are acquainted with.</p>
                <p>If any preference be due to a language from the one or the other method of <hi
                    rend="italic">conjugating</hi> verbs, it must in a great measure be owing to one
                    or more of these three causes: Either it must admit of a greater variety of
                    sounds, and consequently afford more scope for harmonious diversity of tones in
                    the language; or a greater freedom of expression is allowed in uttering any
                    simple idea, by the one admitting of a greater variety in the arrangement of the
                    words which are necessary to express that idea than the other does; or, lastly,
                    a greater precision and accuracy in fixing the meaning of the person who uses
                    the language, arise from the use of one of these forms rather than from the use
                    of the other. For, as every other circumstance which may serve to give a
                    diversity to language, such as the general and most prevalent sounds, the
                    frequent repetition of any one particular letter, and a variety of other
                    circumstances of that nature, which may serve to debase a particular language,
                    are not influenced in the least by the different methods of varying the verbs,
                    they cannot be here considered. We shall therefore proceed to make a comparison
                    of the advantages or disadvantages which may accrue to a language by inflecting
                    its verbs, with regard to variety of sound, variety of arrangement, and accuracy
                    of meaning.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> particular that we have to examine is, whether
                    the one method of expressing the variations of a verb admits of a greater
                    variety of sounds. In this respect the Latin seems, at first view, to have a
                    great advantage over the English; since the words <hi rend="italic">amo, amabam,
                    amaveram, amavero, amem,</hi> &amp;c. seem to be more different from one another
                    than the English translations of these, <hi rend="italic">I love, I was loving,
                    I had loved, I shall have loved, I may love,</hi> &amp;c. ∙. for although the
                    syllable <hi rend="smallcaps">am</hi> is repeated in every one ćf the first,
                    yet, as the last syllable usually strikes the ear with greater force, and leaves
                    a greater impression, than the first, it is very probable that many will think
                    the frequent repetition of the word <hi rend="smallcaps">love,</hi> in the last
                    instance, more striking to the ear than the repetition of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >am</hi> in the former. We wi∏ therefore allow this its full weight, and grant
                    that there is as great, or even a greater, difference between the sounds of the
                    different <hi rend="italic">tenses</hi> of a Latin verb, than there is between
                    the words that are equivalent to them in English. But as we here consider the
                    variety of sounds of the language in general, before any just conclusion can be
                    drawn, we must not only compare the different parts of the same verb, but also
                    compare the different verbs with one another in each of these languages. And
                    here, at first view, we perceive a most striking distinction in favour of the
                    <hi rend="italic">analogous</hi> language over the <hi rend="italic"
                    >inflected</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for, as it would be impossible to form a
                    particular set of inflections, different from one another, for each particular
                    verb, all those languages which have adopted this method have been obliged to
                    reduce their verbs into a small number of classes, all the words of each of
                    which classes, commonly called <hi rend="italic">conjugations,</hi> have the
                    several variations of the <hi rend="italic">modes, tenses,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">persons,</hi> expressed exactly in the same manner, which must of
                    necessity introduce a similarity of sounds into the language in general, much
                    greater than where every particular verb always retains its own distinguishing
                    sound. To be convinced of this, we need only repeat any number of verbs in Latin
                    and English, and observe on which side the preference with respect to variety of
                    sounds must fall.</p>

                <p>The simaarity of sounds is here so obvious in the Latin, as to be perceived at
                    the first glance; nor can we be surprised to find it so, when we consider that
                    all their re- ∙ gular verbs, amounting to four thousand or upwards, must be
                    reduced to four conjugations, and even these differing but little from one
                    another, which must of necessity produce the sameness of sounds which we here
                    perceive; whereas, every language that follows the natural order, like the
                    English, instead of this small number of uniform terminations, has almost as
                    many distinct sounds as original verbs.</p>
                <p>But if, instead of the present of the indicative mood, we should take almost any
                    other tense of the Latin verb, the similarity of sounds would be still more
                    perceptible, as many of these tenses have the same termination in all the four
                    conjugations, particularly in the imperfect of the indicative, as below.</p>

                <p>It is unnecessary to make any remarks on the Latin words in this example. But in
                    the English translation we have carefully marked in the first column the words
                    without any inflection; and in the second, have put down the same meaning by an
                    inflection of our verb; which we have been enabled to do, from a peculiar
                    excellency in our own language unknown to any other, either ancient or modern.
                    Were it necessary to pursue this subject farther, we might observe, that <hi
                    rend="italic">the perfect</hi> tense in all the conjugations ends universally in
                    ι, the <hi rend="italic">pluperfect</hi> in <hi rend="smallcaps">eram,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">the future</hi> in <hi rend="smallcaps">am</hi> or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">bo;</hi> in the subjunctive mood the <hi rend="italic"
                    >imperfect universally</hi> in <hi rend="smallcaps">rem,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">perj'ect</hi> in <hi rend="smallcaps">crim,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">pluperfect</hi> in <hi rend="smallcaps">issem,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">future</hi> in <hi rend="smallcaps">ero;</hi> and as a still
                    greater sameness is observable in the different variations for the persons in
                    these tenses, seeing the first person plural in all tenses ends in <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">mus,</hi> and the second person in us, with little variation in
                    the other persons, it is evident that, in respect to diversity of sounds, this
                    method of conjugating verbs by <hi rend="italic">inflexion</hi> is greatly
                    inferior to the more natural method of expressing the various connections and
                    relations of the verbal attributive by different words, usually called <hi
                    rend="italic">auxiliaries.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193202263" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2263-0066"/>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">second</hi> particular by which the different methods of
                    marking the relation of the verbal attributive can affect language, arises from
                    the variety of expressions which either of these may admit of in uttering the
                    same sentiment. In this respect, likewise, the method of conjugation by
                    inflection seems to be deficient. Thus the present of the indicative mood in
                    Latin can at most be expressed only in two ways, viz. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >scribo</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">ego</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">scribo,</hi>
                    which ought, perhaps, in strictness to be admitted only as one; whereas, in
                    English, we can vary it in four different ways, viz. Ísí, I <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >write</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">;</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> I <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">do write</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">;</hi> 3<hi rend="italic"
                    >dly,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">write</hi> I <hi rend="smallcaps">do</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">;</hi><hi rend="italic">⅛thly,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">write
                    do</hi> I.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> We are
                    sufficiently aware that the last variation cannot in strictness be considered as
                    good language, although many examples of this manner of using it in serious
                    composition, both in poetry and prose, might easily be produced from the best
                    authors in the English language. But, however unjustifiable it may be to use it
                    in serious composition, yet, when judiciously employed in works of humour, this
                    and other forced expressions of the like nature produce a fine eiíect, by giving
                    a burlesque air to the language, and beautifully contrasting it with the purer
                    diction of solid reasoning. Shakspeare has on many occasions showed how
                    successfully these may be employed in composition, particularly in drawing the
                    character of Ancient Pistol in Henry V. Without this liberty, Butler would have
                    found greater difficulty in drawing the inimitable character of Hudibras. Let
                    this apology suffice for having inserted this and other variations of the same
                    kind, which, although they may be often improper for serious composition, have
                    still their use in language.</p></note> And if we consider the further variation
                    which these receive in power as well as in sound, by having the emphasis placed
                    on the different words, instead of four we will find eleven different
                    variations. Thus, I <hi rend="italic">write,</hi> with the emphasis upon the <hi
                    rend="italic">I</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> 1 <hi rend="smallcaps">write,</hi>
                    with the emphasis upon the word <hi rend="smallcaps">write.</hi> Let any one
                    pronounce these with the different emphases necessary, and he will be
                    immediately satisfied that they are not only distinct from each other with
                    respect to meaning, but also with regard to sound. The same must be understood
                    of all the other parts of this example.</p>
                <p>I <hi rend="italic">do write.</hi><hi rend="italic">I</hi><hi rend="italic
                    smallcaps"> do</hi><hi rend="italic">write.</hi><hi rend="italic">I do
                    WRITE.</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Write</hi><hi rend="italic">I
                    do.</hi><hi rend="italic">Write</hi> I <hi rend="italic">do.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Write I</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> do.</hi><hi rend="italic
                    smallcaps"> Write</hi><hi rend="italic">do I.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Write</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> do</hi><hi rend="italic">I.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Write do</hi> I.</p>
                <p>None of the Latin tenses admit of more variations than the two above mentioned;
                    nor do almost any of the English admit of fewer than in the above example; and
                    several of these phrases, which must be considered as exact translations of some
                    of the tenses of the Latin verb, admit of many more. Thus the imperfect of the
                    subjunctive mood, which in Latin admits of the above two variations, admits in
                    English of the following:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">I might have written. Written I might have. Have written I
                    might.</hi><hi rend="italic">Written might have I. 1 written might have. Have
                    written might I.</hi></p>
                <p>And if we likewise consider the variations which may be produced by a variation
                    of the emphasis, they will be as under:</p>
                <p>I <hi rend="italic">might have written. I</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                    might</hi><hi rend="italic">have written. I might HAVE Written. I might
                    have</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> written. Written</hi><hi rend="italic">I
                    might have. Written</hi> I <hi rend="italic">might have. Written I</hi><hi
                    rend="italic smallcaps"> might</hi><hi rend="italic">have. Written I
                    might</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> have. Have</hi><hi rend="italic">written
                    I might. Have</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> written</hi><hi rend="italic">1
                    might. Have written</hi> I <hi rend="italic">might. Have written 1</hi><hi
                    rend="italic smallcaps"> might.</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Written</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">might have I. Written</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                    might</hi><hi rend="italic">have I. Written might</hi><hi rend="italic
                    smallcaps"> have</hi><hi rend="italic">I. Written might have</hi> I.</p>
                <p>I <hi rend="italic">written might have.</hi><hi rend="italic">I</hi><hi
                    rend="italic smallcaps"> written</hi><hi rend="italic">might have.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">I written</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> might</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">have.</hi><hi rend="italic">I written might HAVE.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic smallcaps"> Have</hi><hi rend="italic">written might I.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Have</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> written</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">might I Have written</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                    might</hi><hi rend="italic">I.</hi><hi rend="italic">Have written might</hi>
                    I.</p>
                <p>In all twenty-four variations, instead of two. If we likewise consider that the
                    Latins were obliged to employ the same word, not only to express “I <hi
                    rend="italic">might</hi> have written,” but also, “I <hi rend="italic"
                    >could,</hi> I <hi rend="italic">would,</hi> or I <hi rend="italic">should</hi>
                    have written,” each of which would admit of the same variations as the word <hi
                    rend="italic">might,</hi> we have in all <hi rend="italic">ninety-six</hi>
                    different expressions in English for the same phrase, which in Latin admits only
                    of two, unless they have recourse to other forced turns of expression, which the
                    defects of their verbs in this particular has compelled them to invent. &lt;</p>
                <p>But if it should be objected that the last circumstance we have taken notice of
                    as a defect can only be considered as a defect of the Latin language, and is not
                    to be attributed to the inflection of their verbs, seeing they might have had a
                    particular tense for each of these different words <hi rend="italic">might,
                    could, would,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">should</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">we</hi> answer, that even admitting this excuse to be valid, the
                    superiority of the analogous language as such still remains in this respect as
                    twelve to one. Yet even this concession is greater than ought to have been made.
                    For as the difficulty of forming a sufficient variety of words for all the
                    different modifications which a verb may be made to undergo is too great for any
                    rude people to overcome, we find, that every nation which has adopted this mode
                    of inflection, not excepting the Greeks themselves, has been obliged to remain
                    satisfied with fewer words than would have been necessary even to effect this
                    purpose, and make the same word serve a double, treble, or even quadruple
                    office, as in the Latin tense which gave rise to these observations. So that,
                    however in physical necessity this may not be chargeable upon the particular
                    mode of construction, yet in moral certainty it must always be the case; and
                    therefore we may safely conclude, that the mode of varying verbs by inflection
                    affords less variety in the arrangement of the words of the particular phrases,
                    than the method of varying them by the help of auxiliaries.</p>
                <p>But if there should still remain any shadow of doubt in the mind of the reader,
                    whether the method of varying the verbs by <hi rend="italic">inflection</hi> is
                    inferior to that by <hi rend="italic">auxiliaries,</hi> with regard to diversity
                    of sounds or variety of expression, there cannot be the least doubt that, with
                    respect to precision, distinctness, and accuracy in expressing any idea, the
                    latter enjoys a superiority beyond all comparison. Thus the Latin verb <hi
                    rend="italic">amo</hi> may be Englished either by the words <hi rend="italic">I
                    love</hi> or <hi rend="italic">I do love,</hi> and the emphasis placed upon any
                    of the words that the circumstances may require; by means of which the meaning
                    is pointed out with a force and energy which it is altogether impossible to
                    produce by the üse of any single word. The following line from Shakspeare’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Othello</hi> may serve as an example:</p>
                <p>Excellent wretch í</p>
                <p>Perdition catch my soul, but <hi rend="italic">I</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >do</hi><hi rend="italic">tονe</hi> thee.</p>
                <p>Here the strong emphasis on the word <hi rend="smallcaps">do</hi> gives it a
                    force and energy which conveys, in an irresistible manner, a most perfect
                    knowledge of the situation of the mind of the speaker at the time. That the
                    whole energy of the expression depends upon this seemingly insignificant word,
                    we may be at once satisfied of by keeping it away, in this manner:</p>
                <p>Excellent wretch!</p>
                <p>Perdition catch my soul, but <hi rend="italic">I love</hi> thee.</p>
                <p>How poor, how tame, how insignificant is this, when compared with the other. Here
                    nothing remains but a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193202276"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-2276-0067"/>tame assertion, ushered in with a pompous
                    exclamation, which could not here be introduced with any degree <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> propriety. Whereas, in the way that Shakspeare has left it
                    to us, it has an energy which nothing can surpass; for, overpowered with the
                    irresistible force of Desdemona’s charms, this strong exclamation is extorted
                    from the soul of Othello in spite of himself. Surprisedat this tender emotion,
                    which brings to his mind all those amiable qualities for which he had so much
                    esteemed her, and at the same time fully impressed with the firm persuasion of
                    her guilt, he bursts out into that seemingly inconsistent exclamation, <hi
                    rend="italic">Excellent wretch!</hi> and then he adds in the warmth of his
                    surprise, thinking it a thing most astonishing that any warmth of affection
                    should still remain in his breast, he even confirms it with an oath, <hi
                    rend="italic">Perdition catch my soul, but</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Zdo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">love thee.</hi> “In spite of all the falsehoods with which I know
                    thou hast deceived me, in spite of all the crimes of which I know thee guilty,
                    in spite of all those reasons for which I ought to hate thee, in spite of
                    myself, still I find that I love; yes, I <hi rend="smallcaps">do</hi> love
                    thee.” We look upon it as a thing altogether impossible to transfuse the energy
                    of this expression into any language whose verbs are regularly inflected.</p>
                <p>In the same manner we might go through all the other tenses, and show that the
                    same superiority is to be found in each. Thus, in <hi rend="italic">the perfect
                    tense</hi> of the Latins, instead of the simple <hi rend="smallcaps">amavi,</hi>
                    we say I <hi rend="smallcaps">have loved</hi>; and by the liberty we have of
                    putting the emphasis upon any of the words which compose this phrase, we can in
                    the most accurate manner fix the precise idea which we mean to excite; for if we
                    say, I <hi rend="italic">have loved,</hi> with the emphasis upon the word <hi
                    rend="italic">I,</hi> it at once points out the person as the principal object
                    in that phrase, and makes us naturally look for a contrast in some other person,
                    and the other parts of the phrase become subordinate to it: <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >“he</hi><hi rend="italic">has loved</hi> thee much, but I <hi rend="italic"
                    >have loved</hi> thee infinitely more.” The Latins, too, as they were not
                    prohibited from joining the pronoun with their verb, were also acquainted with
                    this excellence, which Virgil has beautifully used in this verse:</p>
                <p>Nos patriam fugimus:</p>
                <p>Tu, Tityre, lentus in umbra, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>We are not only enabled thus to distinguish the person in as powerful a manner as
                    the Latins, but can also with the same facility point out any of the other
                    circumstances as principals; for if we say, with the emphasis upon the word <hi
                    rend="italic">have,</hi> “I <hi rend="smallcaps">have</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >loved,”</hi> it as naturally points out the time as the principal object, and
                    makes us to look for a contrast in that peculiarity, I <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >have</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">:</hi> “I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> loved
                    indeed; my imagination <hi rend="italic">has</hi> been led astray, my reason <hi
                    rend="italic">has</hi> been perverted; but, <hi rend="italic">now</hi> that time
                    has opened my eyes, I can smile at those imaginary distresses which once
                    perplexed me.” In the same manner we can put the emphasis upon the other word of
                    the phrase, <hi rend="italic">loved</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> “I <hi
                    rend="italic">have</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">loved.”</hi> Here the passion is
                    exhibited as the principal circumstance; and as this can never be excited
                    without some object, we naturally wish to know the object of that passion, “Who!
                    what have you <hi rend="italic">loved T'</hi> are the natural questions we would
                    put in this case. “I have <hi rend="smallcaps">loved</hi> Eliza.” In this manner
                    we are, on all occasions, enabled to express, with the utmost precision, that
                    particular idea which we would wish to excite, so as to give an energy and
                    perspicuity to the language, which can never be attained by those languages
                    whose verbs are conjugated by inflection; and if to this we add the
                    inconvenience which all inflected languages are subject to, by having too small
                    a number of tenses, so as to be compelled to make one word on many occasions
                    supply the place of two, three, or even four, the balance is turned still more
                    in our favour. Thus, in Latin, the same word, <hi rend="smallcaps">amabo,</hi>
                    stands for <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> or <hi rend="italic">will</hi> love, so
                    that the reader is left to guess from the context which of the two meanings it
                    was most likely the writer had in view. In the same manner <hi rend="italic"
                    >may</hi> or <hi rend="italic">can</hi> love are expressed by the same word, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">amēm</hi>; as are also <hi rend="italic">might, could,
                    would,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">should</hi> love, by the single word <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">amarem,</hi> as we have already observed, so that the reader is
                    left to guess which of these four meanings the writer intended to express; an
                    ambiguity which occasions a perplexity very different from that clear precision
                    which our language allows of, by not only pointing out the different words, but
                    also by allowing us to put the emphasis upon any of them we please, which
                    superadds energy and force to the precision it would have had without that
                    assistance.</p>
                <p>Upon the whole, therefore, after the most candid examination, we must conclude
                    that the method of conjugating verbs by <hi rend="italic">inflection</hi> is
                    inferior to that which is performed by the help of <hi rend="italic"
                    >auxiliaries</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> because it does not afford such a
                    diversity of sounds, nor allow such variety in the arrangement of expression for
                    the same thought, nor give so great distinction and precision in the meaning. It
                    is, however, attended with one considerable advantage above the other method;
                    for as the words of which it is formed are necessarily of great length, and more
                    sonorous than in the analogous languages, it admits of a more flowing harmony of
                    expression; for the number of monosyllables in this last greatly checks that
                    pompous dignity which naturally results from longer words. Whether this single
                    advantage is sufficient to counterbalance all the other defects with which it is
                    attended, is left to the judgment of the reader to determine. But we may remark
                    before we quit the subject, that even this excellence is attended with some
                    peculiar inconveniences, which shall be more particularly pointed out in the
                    sequel.</p>
                <p>But perhaps it might still be objected, that although the comparisons we have
                    made above may be fair, and the conclusion just, with regard to the Latin and
                    English languages, yet it does not appear clear, that on that account the method
                    of conjugating verbs by <hi rend="italic">inflection</hi> is <hi rend="italic"
                    >inferior</hi> to that by <hi rend="italic">auxiliaries</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> for although it be allowed that the Latin language is defective in point
                    of tenses; yet if a language were formed which had a sufficient number of
                    inflected tenses to answer every purpose; if it had, for instance, a word
                    properly formed for every variation of each tense; ene for <hi rend="italic">I
                    love,</hi> another for <hi rend="italic">I do love</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    one for <hi rend="italic">I shall,</hi> another for <hi rend="italic">I will
                    love</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> one for <hi rend="italic">I might,</hi>
                    another for <hi rend="italic">I could,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">would,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">should love</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and so on through
                    all the other tenses; that this language would not be liable to the objections
                    we have brought against the inflection of verbs; and that of course the
                    objections we have brought are only valid against those languages which have
                    followed that mode and executed it imperfectly. We answer, that although this
                    would in some measure remedy the evil, yet it would not remove it entirely. For,
                    in the first place, unless every verb, or every small number of verbs, were
                    conjugated in one way, having the sound of the words in each tense, and division
                    of tenses, as we may say, different from all the other conjugations, it would
                    always occasion a sameness of sound, which would in some measure prevent that
                    variety of sounds so proper for a language. And even if this could be effected,
                    it would not give such a latitude to the expression as auxiliaries allow; for
                    although there should be two words, one for <hi rend="italic">I might,</hi> and
                    another for <hi rend="italic">I could</hi> love, yet as these are single words,
                    they cannot be varied; whereas, by auxiliaries, either of these can be varied
                    twenty-four different ways, as has been shown above. In the last place, no
                    single word can ever express all that variety of meaning which we can do by the
                    help of our auxiliaries and the emphasis. <hi rend="italic">I have loved,</hi>
                    if expressed by any one word, could only denote at all times one distinct
                    meaning, so that to give it the power of ours, three <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193202289" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2289-0068"/>distinct words at least would
                    be necessary. However, if all this were done; that is, if there were a distinct
                    conjugation formed for every forty or fifty verbs; if each of the tenses were
                    properly formed, and all of them different from every other tense as well as
                    every other verb; and these all carried through each of the different persons,
                    so as to be all different from one another; and if likewise there were a
                    distinct word to mark each of the separate meanings which the same tense could
                    be made to assume by means of the emphasis; and if all this infinite variety of
                    words could be formed in a distinct manner, different from each other, and
                    harmonious; this language would have powers greater than any that could be
                    formed by auxiliaries, if it were possible for the human powers to acquire such
                    a degree of knowledge as to be able to employ it with facility. But how could
                    this be attained, since upwards of ten thousand words would be necessary to form
                    the variations of any one verb, and a hundred times that number would not
                    include the knowledge of the verbs alone of such a language ř<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This assertion may perhaps
                    appear to many very much exaggerated; but if any one should think so, we only
                    beg the favour that he will set himself to mark all the variations of tenses,
                    mode, parson, and number, which an English verb can be made to assume, varying
                    each of these in every way that it will admit, both as to the diversity of
                    expression and the emphasis, and he will soon be convinced that we have here
                    said nothing more than enough.</p></note> How much, therefore, ought we to
                    admire the simple perspicuity of our language, which enables us, by the proper
                    application of ten or twelve seemingly trifling words, the meaning and use of
                    which can be attained with the utmost ease, to express all that could be
                    expressed by this unwieldy apparatus? What can equal the simplicity or the power
                    of the one method, but the well-known powers of the twenty-four letters, the
                    knowledge of which can be obtained with so much ease, whilst their powers know
                    no limits? or, what can be compared to the fancied perfection of the other, but
                    the transcript of it which the Chinese seem to have formed in their
                    unintelligible language?</p>
                <p>Having thus considered pretty fully the advantages and defects of each of these
                    two methods of varying verbs, we cannot help feeling a secret wish arise in our
                    mind, that there had been a people sagacious enough to have united the powers of
                    the one method with those of the other; nor can wė help being surprised, that
                    among the changes which took place in the several languages of Europe after the
                    downfall of the Roman monarchy, some of them did not accidentally stumble on the
                    method of doing it. From many concurring circumstances, it seems probable that
                    the greater part, if not all, of the Gothic nations that overran Italy at that
                    time, had their verbs varied by the help of auxiliaries; and many of the modern
                    European languages which have sprung from them, have so far borrowed from the
                    Latin, as to have some of the tenses of their verbs inflected. Yet the English
                    alone have in any instance combined the joint powers of the two, which could
                    only be done by forming inflections for the different tenses in the same manner
                    as the Latins, and at the same time retaining the original method of varying
                    them by auxiliaries; by which means either the one or the other method could
                    have been employed as occasion required. We have luckily two tenses formed in
                    that way, the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> of the indicative, and the aorist
                    of the <hi rend="italic">past.</hi> In almost all our verbs these can be
                    declined either with or without auxiliaries. Thus the present, without an
                    auxiliary, is, <hi rend="italic">I love, I write, I speak</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> with an auxiliary, <hi rend="italic">I do write, I do love, I do
                    speak-</hi> In the same manner, the past tense, by inflection, is, <hi
                    rend="italic">I loved, I wrote, 1 spoke</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> by
                    auxiliaries, <hi rend="italic">I did love, I did speak, I did write.</hi> Every
                    author who knows any thing of the power of the English language, knows the use
                    which may be made of this distinction. What a pity is it that we should have
                    stopt short so soon. How blind was it in many other nations to imitate the
                    defects without making a proper use of that beautiful language which is now
                    numbered among the dead.</p>
                <p>After the verbs, the next most considerable variation we find between the <hi
                    rend="italic">analogous</hi> and <hi rend="italic">transpositive</hi> languages
                    is in the nouns; the latter varying the different cases of these by <hi
                    rend="italic">inflection</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> whereas the former express
                    all the different variations of them by the help of other words prefixed, called
                    <hi rend="italic">prepositions.</hi> Now, if we consider the advantages or
                    disadvantages of either of these methods under the same heads as we have done
                    the verbs, we shall find, that with regard to the first particular, viz. variety
                    of sounds, almost the same remarks may be made as upon the verbs; for if we
                    compare any particular noun by itself, the variety of sound appears much greater
                    between the different cases in the <hi rend="italic">transpositive,</hi> than
                    between the translation of these in the <hi rend="italic">analogous</hi>
                    language. Thus <hi rend="smallcaps">rex,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">regis,
                    regi,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">regem,</hi> &amp;c. are more distinct from one
                    another in point of sound, than the translation of these, <hi rend="italic">a
                    king, of a king, to α king, a king, 8οc.</hi> But if we proceed one step
                    further, and consider the variety which is produced in the language in general
                    by the one or the other of these methods, the case is entirely reversed. For as
                    it would have been impossible to form distinct variations, different from one
                    another, for each case of every noun, they have been obliged to reduce all their
                    nouns into a few general classes, called <hi rend="italic">declensions,</hi> and
                    to give to all those included under each class the same termination in every
                    case, which produces a like similarity of sound with what we already observed
                    was occasioned to the verbs from the same cause; whereas, in the analogous
                    languages, as there is no necessity for any constraint, there is almost as great
                    a variety of sounds as there are of nouns. The Latins have only five different
                    declensions; so that all the great number of words <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    this general order must be reduced to the very small diversity of sounds which
                    these few classes admit of; and even the sounds of these few classes are not so
                    much diversified as they might have been, as many of the different cases in the
                    different declensions have exactly the same sounds, as we shall have occasion to
                    remark more fully hereafter. We might here produce examples to show the great
                    similarity of sounds between different nouns in the Latin language, and variety
                    in the English, in the same way as we did of the verbs; but as every reader in
                    the least acquainted with these two languages can satisfy himself in this
                    particular, without any further trouble than by marking down any number of Latin
                    nouns, with their translations into English, we think it unnecessary to dwell
                    longer on this particular.</p>
                <p>But if the inflection of nouns is a disadvantage to a language in point of
                    diversity of sounds, it is very much the reverse with regard to the variety it
                    allows in the arranging the words of the phrase. Here, indeed, the transpositive
                    language shines forth in all its glory, and the analogous must yield the palm
                    without the smallest dispute. For as the <hi rend="italic">nominative case,</hi>
                    or that noun which is the cause of the energy expressed by the verb, is
                    different from the <hi rend="italic">accusative,</hi> or that noun upon which
                    the energy expressed by the verb is exerted, these may be placed in any
                    situation that the writer shall think proper, without occasioning the smallest
                    confusion; whereas in the analogous languages, as these two different states of
                    the noun are expressed by the same word, they cannot be distinguished <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193202302" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2302-0069"/> but by their
                    position alone; so that the noun which is the efficient cause must always
                    precede the verb, and that which is the passive subject must follow, which
                    greatly cramps the harmonious flow of composition. Thus the Latins, without the
                    smallest perplexity in the meaning, could say either <hi rend="italic">Brutum
                    amavit</hi><hi rend="italic">Cassius,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Cassius</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">amavit Brutum,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Brutum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cassius αmavit,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Cassius</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Brutum amavit.</hi> As the termination of the word <hi
                    rend="italic">Cassius</hi> always points out that it is in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nominative case,</hi> and therefore that he is the person from whom the energy
                    proceeds; and in the same manner, as the termination of the word <hi
                    rend="italic">Brutum</hi> points out that it is in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >accusative case,</hi> and consequently that he is the object upon whom the
                    energy is exerted; the meaning continues still distinct and clear,
                    notwithstanding of all these several variations; whereas, in the English
                    language, we could only say, <hi rend="italic">Cassius loved Brutus,</hi> or, by
                    a more forced phraseology, <hi rend="italic">Cassius Brutus loved.</hi> Were we
                    to reverse the case, as in the Latin, the meaning also would be reversed; for if
                    we say <hi rend="italic">Brutus loved Cassius,</hi> it is evident, that instead
                    of being the person beloved, as before, <hi rend="italic">Brutus</hi> now
                    becomes the person from whom the energy proceeds, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cassius</hi> becomes the object beloved. In this respect, therefore, the
                    analogous languages are greatly inferior to the transpositive; and, indeed, it
                    is from this single circumstance alone that they derive their chief
                    excellence.</p>
                <p>But although it thus appears evident that any language which has a particular
                    variation of its nouns to distinguish the <hi rend="italic">accusative</hi> from
                    the <hi rend="italic">nominative case,</hi> has an advantage over those
                    languages which have none; yet it does not appear that any other of their <hi
                    rend="italic">cases</hi> adds to the variety, but rather the reverse; for in
                    Latin we can only say <hi rend="italic">Amor Dei</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in
                    English the same phrase may be rendered either <hi rend="italic">the love of
                    God, of God the love,</hi> or, by a more forced arrangement, <hi rend="italic"
                    >God the love of.</hi> And as these oblique cases, as the Latins called them,
                    except the accusative, are clearly distinguished from one another and from the
                    nominative by the preposition which accompanies them, we are not confined to any
                    particular arrangement with regard to these, as with the accusative, but may
                    place them in what order we please, as in Milton’s elegant invocation at the
                    beginning of Paradise Lost.</p>
                <p>Of man’s first disobedience, and the fruit of that forbidden tree, tvhose mortal
                    taste Brought death into the world, and all our wo, With loss of Eden, till one
                    greater man Restore us, and regain the blissful seat, Sing, heavenly muse.</p>
                <p>In this sentence the transposition is almost as great as the Latin language would
                    admit of, and the meaning as distinct as if Milton had begun with the plain
                    language of prose.</p>
                <p>Before we leave this head, we may remark, that the little attention which seems
                    to have been paid to this peculiar advantage derived from the use of an
                    accusative case different from the nominative, is somewhat surprising. The
                    Latins, who had more occasion to attend to this with care than any other nation,
                    and even the Greeks themselves, have in many cases overlooked it, as is evident
                    from the various instances we meet with in their languages where this is not
                    distinguished. For all nouns of the neuter gender, both in Greek and Latin, have
                    in every declension their nominative and accusative singular alike. Nor in the
                    plural of such nouns is there any distinction between these two cases; and in
                    Latin all nouns whatever of the third, fourth, and fifth declensions, of which
                    the number is very considerable, have their nominative and accusative plural
                    alike. So that their language reaps no advantage in this respect from almost one
                    half of their nouns. Nor have any of the modern languages in Europe, however
                    much they may have borrowed from the ancient languages in other respects,
                    attempted to copy from them in this particular; from which perhaps more
                    advantage would have been gained than from copying all the other supposed
                    excellencies of their language. But to return to our object.</p>
                <p>It remains that we consider whether the inflection of nouns gives any advantage
                    over the method of defining them by prepositions, in point of distinctness and
                    precision of meaning? But in this respect, too, the analogous languages must
                    come off victorious. Indeed, this is the particular in which their greatest
                    excellence consists; nor was it, we believe, ever disputed but that, in point of
                    accuracy and precision, this method must excel all others, however it may be
                    defective in other respects. We observed under this head, when speaking of
                    verbs, that it might perhaps be possible to form a language by inflection which
                    should be capable of as great accuracy as in the more simple order of
                    auxiliaries; but this would have been such an infinite labour that it was not to
                    be expected that ever human powers would have been able to accomplish it. More
                    easy would it have been to have formed the several inflections of the nouns so
                    different from one another as to have rendered it impossible ever to mistake the
                    meaning. Yet even this has not been attempted. And as we find that those
                    languages which have adopted the method of inflecting their verbs are more
                    imperfect in point of precision than the other, so the same may be said of
                    inflecting the nouns; for, not to mention the energy which the analogous
                    languages acquire by putting the accent upon the noun, or its preposition, when
                    in an oblique case, according as the subject may require, to express which
                    variation of meaning no particular variety of words have been invented in any
                    inflected language, they are not even complete in other respects. The Latin, in
                    particular, is in many cases defective, the same termination being employed in
                    many instances for different cases of the same noun. Thus the genitive and
                    dative singular, and nominative and vocative plural, of the first declension,
                    arc all exactly alike, and can only be distinguished from one another by the
                    formation of the sentence; as are also the nominative, vocative, and ablative
                    singular, and the dative and ablative plural. In the second, the genitive
                    singular and nominative and vocative plural are the same, as are also the dative
                    and ablative singular, and dative and ablative plural, except those in <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">um,</hi> whose nominative, accusative, and vocative singular,
                    and nominative, accusative, and vocative plural, arc alike. The other three
                    declensions agree in as many of their cases as these do, which evidently tends
                    to perplex the meaning, unless the hearer is particularly attentive to and well
                    acquainted with the particular construction of the other parts of the sentence;
                    all of which is totally removed, and the clearest certainty exhibited at once,
                    by the help of prepositions in the analogous languages.</p>
                <p>It will hardly be necessary to enter into such a minute examination of the
                    advantages or disadvantages attending the variation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >adjectives</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> as it will appear evident, from what
                    has been already said, that the endowing them with terminations similar to, and
                    corresponding with, <hi rend="italic">substantives,</hi> must tend still more to
                    increase the similarity of sounds in any language, than any of those particulars
                    we have already taken notice of; and were it not for the liberty which they
                    have, in transpositive languages, of separating the adjective from the
                    substantive, this must have occasioned such a jingle of similar sounds as could
                    not fail to have been most disgusting to the ear: but as it would have been
                    impossible in many cases, in those languages where the verbs and nouns are
                    inflected, to have pronounced the words which ought to have followed each other,
                    unless their adjectives could have been separated from the substantives;
                    therefore, to remedy this inconvenience, they <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193202315" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2315-0070"/>were forced to devise this
                    unnatural method of inflecting them also; by which means it is easy to recognise
                    to what substantive any adjective has a reference, in whatever part of the
                    sentence it may be placed. In these languages, therefore, this inflection, both
                    as to gender, number, and case, becomes absolutely necessary; and, by the
                    diversity which it admitted in the arranging the words of the several phrases,
                    might counterbalance the jingle of similar sounds which it introduced into the
                    language.</p>
                <p>Having thus examined the most striking particulars in which the transpositive and
                    analogous languages differ, and endeavoured to show the general tendency of
                    every one of the particulars separately, it would not be fair to dismiss the
                    subject without considering each of these as a whole, and pointing out their
                    general tendency in that light: for we all know, that it often happens in human
                    inventions, that every part which composes a whole, taken separately, may appear
                    extremely fine; and yet, when all these parts are put together, they may not
                    agree, but produce a jarring and confusion very different from what we might
                    have expected. We therefore imagine a few remarks upon the genius of each of
                    these two distinct <hi rend="italic">idioms</hi> of language, considered as a
                    whole, will not be deemed useless.</p>
                <p>Although all languages agree in this respect, that they are the means of
                    conveying the ideas of one man to another; yet as there is an infinite variety
                    of ways in which we might wash to convey these ideas, sometimes by the easy and
                    familiar mode of conversation, and at other times by more solemn addresses to
                    the understanding, by pompous declamation, &amp;c. it may so happen, that the
                    genius of one language may be more properly adapted to the one of these than the
                    other, while another language may excel in the opposite particular. This is
                    exactly the case in the two general <hi rend="italic">idioms</hi> of· which we
                    now treat. Every particular in a transpositive language is peculiarly calculated
                    for that solemn dignity which is necessary for pompous orations. Long-sounding
                    words, formed by the inflection of the different parts of speech; flowing
                    periods, in which the attention is kept awake by the harmony of the sounds, and
                    in expectation of that word which is to unravel the whole; if composed by a
                    skilful artist, are admirably suited to that solemn dignity and awful grace
                    which constitute the essence of a public harangue. On the contrary, in private
                    conversation, where the mind wishes to unbend itself with ease, these become so
                    many clogs which encumber and perplex. At these moments we wish to transfuse our
                    thoughts with ease and facility, we are tired with every unnecessary syllable,
                    and w ish to be freed from the trouble of attention as much as may be. Like our
                    state robes, we would wish to lay aside our pompous language, and enjoy
                    ourselves at home with freedom and ease. Here the solemnity and windings of the
                    <hi rend="italic">transpositive</hi> language are burdensome; while the facility
                    with which a sentiment can be expressed in the <hi rend="italic">analogous</hi>
                    language is the thing that we wish to acquire. Accordingly, in Terence and
                    Plautus, where the beauties of dialogue are most charmingly displayed,
                    transposition is sparingly used. In this humble, though most engaging sphere,
                    the analogous language moves unrivalled; in this it wishes to indulge, and never
                    tires. But it in vain attempts to rival the <hi rend="italic">transpositive</hi>
                    in dignity and pomp: the number of monosyllables interrupts the flow of harmony;
                    and although they may give a greater variety of sounds, yet they do not
                    naturally possess that dignified gravity which suits the other language. This,
                    then, must be considered as the striking particular in the genius of these two
                    different <hi rend="italic">idioms,</hi> which marks their characters.</p>
                <p>If we consider the effects which these two different cha racters of language must
                    naturally produce upon the people who employ them, we will soon perceive, that
                    the genius of the <hi rend="italic">analogous</hi> language is much more
                    favourable for the most engaging purposes of life, the civilizing the human mind
                    by mutual intercourse of thought, <hi rend="italic">than the transpositive.</hi>
                    For as it is chiefly by the use of speech that man is raised above the brute
                    creation; as it is by this means he improves every faculty of his mind, and, to
                    the observations which he may himself have made, has the additional advantage of
                    the experience of those with whom he may converse, as well as the knowledge
                    which the human race have acquired by the accumulated experience of all
                    preceding ages; as it is by the enlivening glow of conversation that kindred
                    souls catch fire from one another, that thought produces thought, and each
                    improves upon the other, till they soar beyond the bounds which human reason, if
                    left alone, could ever have aspired to; we must surely consider that language as
                    the most beneficial to society which most effectually removes those bars that
                    obstruct its progress. Now, the genius of the <hi rend="italic">analogous</hi>
                    languages is so easy, so simple and plain, as to be within the reach of every
                    one who is born in the kingdom where it is used to speak it with facility; even
                    the rudest among the vulgar can hardly fall into any considerable grammatical
                    errors: whereas, in the <hi rend="italic">transpositive</hi> languages, so many
                    rules are necessary to be attended to, and so much variation is produced in the
                    meaning, by the .slightest variations in the sound, that it requires a study far
                    above the reach of the illiterate mechanic ever to attain. So that, how perfect
                    soever the language may be when spoken with purity, the bulk of the nation must
                    ever labour under the inconvenience of rudeness and inaccuracy of speech, and
                    all the evils which this naturally produces. Accordingly, we find, that in Rome,
                    a man, even in the highest rank, received as much honour, and w;as as much
                    distinguished among his equals, for being able to converse with ease, as a
                    modern author would be for writing in an easy and elegant style; and Caesar
                    among his contemporaries was as much esteemed for his superiority in speaking
                    the language in ordinary conversation with ease and elegance, as for his powers
                    of oratory, his skill in arms, or his excellence in literary composition. It is
                    needless to point out the many inconveniences which this must unavoidably
                    produce in a state. It is sufficient to observe, that it naturally tends to
                    introduce a vast distinction between the orders of men; to set an impenetrable
                    barrier between those born in a high and those born in a low station; to keep
                    the latter in ignorance and barbarity, while it elevates the former to such a
                    height as must subject the other to be easily led by every popular demagogue.
                    How far the history of the nations who have followed this <hi rend="italic"
                    >idiom,</hi> of language confirms this observation, every one is left to judge
                    for himself.</p>
                <p>II. AFFINITIES OF LANGUAGES.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This part of the article was written by the late Dr Thomas Young, for the
                    <hi rend="italic">Supplement</hi> to the former editions of this
                    work.</p></note></p>
                <p>The study of the affinities of various languages is so far one of the most
                    important of all branches of human knowledge, as it affords, when properly
                    applied, an unerring test of the truth or falsehood of historical evidence,
                    without which it would sometimes be impossible to unravel the mysteries of
                    contradictory testimonies, respecting the relations of the different races of
                    mankind. We have, for example, no traditional evidence in support of any
                    connection between the ancient Egyptians and the Indians; whilst, on the other
                    hand, a number of persons, who came with the English army from the East Indies
                    into Egypt, were so strongly impressed with the resemblance of the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193202328" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2328-0071"/> Egyptian and
                    Indian temples, which appeared even to excite the religious feelings of many of
                    the natives who were amongst the troops employed, that a very general
                    inclination has arisen from these circumstances, to consider the Egyptian
                    mythology as merely a branch of the Indian. But if the Egyptian people had
                    really been of Indian origin; that is, if the Egyptians and Indians had really
                    been one people, at any later period than that at which the whole of the Indian
                    and European races were separated from their common stock; the languages of
                    India and of Egypt could not but have exhibited some features of resemblance,
                    which would have preserved the traces of the connection; whilst, in fact, there
                    is much less similarity between the Egyptian and the Indian, than between the
                    Indian and the Greek, or the English and the Persian; so that etymology may here
                    be adduced as confirming the evidence, or as justifying the silence, of history;
                    and the resemblance of the mythological representations must be considered as in
                    great measure accidental.</p>
                <p>It is, however, only with regard to the languages of the ancient world that we
                    can feel much interest in such an investigation. The American dialects might
                    afford equally extensive subjects of speculation in a metaphysical and critical
                    point of view; but the concerns of barbarians, unconnected and remote from all
                    contact with literature or civilization, and destitute of all historical
                    records, will scarcely be thought to require any great portion of attention from
                    a philosophical inquirer; and there is ample scope for the employment of all our
                    faculties in the analysis and.comparison of the various languages of Europe,
                    Asia, and Africa. If, indeed, an extraordinary exertion of enterprise and
                    industry, which can be expected from a few distinguished individuals only in the
                    course of as many centuries, should make known relations, such as Alexander von
                    Humboldt has appeared to discover, between the American and Asiatic nations, a
                    new field would be opened for the gratification of our curiosity; but it can
                    scarcely be expected that these points of resemblance can be sufficiently
                    numerous to afford any thing like demonstrative evidence, until the whole
                    subject has been much more deeply and repeatedly discussed. In the mean time, a
                    very brief enumeration of the names <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the American
                    languages is all that can be required, on an occasion like the present; except
                    the insulated though interesting remark, that the countries separated by
                    Behring’s Straits exhibit, as might indeed be expected, strong resemblances in
                    some of their languages.</p>
                <p>Of language in general we do not here intend to treat, but merely of languages as
                    they are distinct from each other. It is not, however, very easy to say what the
                    definition ought to be that should constitute a separate language; but it seems
                    most natural to call those languages distinct, of which the one cannot be
                    understood by common persons in the habit of speaking the other, so that an
                    interpreter would be required for communication between persons of the
                    respective nations. Still, however, it may remain doubtful whether the Danes and
                    the Swedes could not, in general, understand each other tolerably well, and
                    whether the Scottish Highlanders and the Irish would be able to drink their
                    whisky together without an interpreter; nor is it possible to say, if the twenty
                    ways of pronouncing the sounds belonging to the Chinese characters, ought or
                    ought not to be considered as so many languages or dialects, though they would
                    render all oral intercourse between the persons so speaking the language
                    actually impracticable. But, whether we call such variations different
                    languages, or different dialects, or merely different pronunciations of the same
                    dialect, it is obvious that they ought all to be noticed in a complete history
                    of languages; and, at the same time, that the languages so nearly allied must
                    stand next to each other in a symmetrical order; the perfection of which would
                    be, to place the nearest together those languages in which the number of
                    coincidences in the signification of words throughout the language are the most
                    numerous.</p>
                <p>It has sometimes been imagined, that all languages in existence present something
                    like a trace of having been deduced from a common origin; and it would be
                    difficult to confute this opinion by very positive evidence, unless every
                    separate language had been very completely analysed and examined by a person
                    well acquainted with a variety of other languages, with which it might be
                    compared. But, without such an examination, the opinion must remain conjectural
                    only, and no more admissible as demonstrated, than the opinions of some
                    empirics, that there is only one disease, and that the only remedy for it is
                    brandy. In an essay on probabilities, lately published in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions,</hi> Dr Young has remarked, that “nothing whatever
                    could be inferred, with respect to the relation of two languages, from the
                    coincidence of the sense of any single word in both of them,” that is, supposing
                    the same simple and limited combinations of sounds to occur in both, but to be
                    applied accidentally to the same number of objects, without any common links of
                    connection; “and that the odds would only be three to one against the agreement
                    of two words, but if three words appeared to be identical, it would be more than
                    ten to one that they must be derived, in both cases, from some parent language,
                    or introduced in some other manner,” from a common source; whilst “six words
                    would give near 1700 chances to one, and eight near 100,000; so that, in these
                    last cases, the evidence would be little short of absolute certainty.”</p>
                <p>The author of the article in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review,</hi> on
                    Adelung’s <hi rend="italic">Mithridates</hi> observes, that, setting out from
                    the establishment of a certain number of separate languages as species, “we may
                    proceed to comprehend, in the description of one <hi rend="italic">family,</hi>
                    such as have more coincidences with each other than diversities, and to refer to
                    the same <hi rend="italic">class</hi> such families as exhibit any coincidences
                    at all that are not fortuitous, imitative,” that is, from onomatopoeia, “or
                    adoptive. In order, however, to avoid too great a number of classes, which would
                    arise from an inadequate comparison of languages imperfectly known, it may be
                    proper, in some cases, to adopt a geographical distinction, as sufficient to
                    define the limits of a class, or to assist in its subdivision into orders. We
                    are thus obliged to employ an arrangement of a mixed nature and, in fact, the
                    tests of affinity here proposed depend so much on the progress of our knowledge
                    in the study of each language, tnat the results must unavoidably be liable to
                    great uncertainty and fluctuation, so that we can reasonably expect nothing more
                    than an approximation to an arrangement completely methodical.</p>
                <p>“If,” continues the reviewer, “the resemblance or identity of a single word, in
                    two languages, supposed to be exempt from the effects of all later intercourse,
                    were to be esteemed a sufficient proof of their having been derived from a
                    common stock, it would follow, that more than half the languages of the
                    'universe would exhibit traces of such connection, in whatever order we might
                    pursue the comparison. Thus we find in a very great number, and perhaps in a
                    majority of known languages, that the sound of the vowel <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> with a labial consonant, is employed for the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Father</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and if this be supposed to be something
                    like an onomatopoeia, or an application of the first sounds which ,an infant
                    naturally utters, the same reason cannot possibly be assigned for the still more
                    general occurrence of the combination <hi rend="smallcaps">nm</hi> in the term
                    <hi rend="italic">name,</hi> which is by no means likely to have originated from
                    any natural association of this kind. But neither <pb break="no"

                    nor any other that can be assigned, are absolutely universal; for, besides the

                    <hi rend="italic">Name,</hi> besides those languages in which the version of an

                    venerate the traces of our common descent from a single pair, wherever they are
                    still perceptible, we must not expect to find them in all existing languages
                    without exception; and an <hi rend="italic">Etymologico</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Universale,</hi> considered as intended to establish such a perfect community
                    of derivation, can only be regarded as a visionary undertaking. Nor must we
                    neglect to unite, in some common arrangement of classification, those languages
                    which have the words here specified, or any other radical words, in common, as
                    incomparably more related to each other than the Chinese to the Cantabrian, or
                    the Irish to the Hottentot.</p>
                <p>“The gradations, by which a language is likely to vary in a given time, seem to
                    be in some measure dependent on the degree of cultivation of the language, and
                    of the civilization of the people employing it. From Homer to the Byzantine
                    historians, the Greek language remained essentially the same for 2000 years; the
                    German has varied but little in 1500; and even the English, notwithstanding its
                    mixture with French and Latin, has altered but three radical words out of the
                    fifty-four which constitute the Lord’s Prayer, in the same period. On the other
                    hand, a few barbarians in the neighbourhood of Mount Caucasus and of the Caspian
                    Sea, of modern origin, and ignorant of the art of writing, are divided into more
                    nations speaking peculiar languages, radically different from each other, than
                    the whole of civilized Europe. In such cases, little light can be thrown upon
                    history by etymological researches, while, with regard to more cultivated
                    nations, we obtain, from the examination of their languages, historical evidence
                    of such a nature, as it is scarcely possible for either accident or design to
                    have falsified.”</p>
                <p>According to the supposition of Professor Adelung, it seems not improbable that
                    Thibet, on the east of Cashmere, may “have been the habitation of Adam
                    immediately after his fall, and the country occupied by the descendants of Cain.
                    In Thibet, and in the countries immediately beyond it, the languages of at least
                    a hundred and fifty millions of people are still principally <hi rend="italic"
                    >monosyllabic;</hi> and from this peculiarity, as well as from the singular
                    simplicity of their structure, they are supposed to constitute the most ancient
                    class of existing languages, though it must be confessed that much of Adelung’s
                    reasoning on this subject is extremely inconclusive.” Mr Townsend remarks very
                    judiciously, that one of the canons of Rudbeck is by no means admissible. “He
                    states, that a language, which has numerous monosyllabic expressions, is a
                    parent language. The English has more than 3700 monosyllabic expressions, and
                    the Chinese has none but such; yet neither of them is, for that reason, to be
                    considered as a parent language. Certain it is, that all languages, by
                    abbreviations, have a tendency to become monosyllabic, and therefore a language
                    which abounds in monosyllables is ancient, and these commonly are the most
                    antiquated parts of every language. New compounds are incessantly created. These
                    are abbreviated, and in process of time be come monosyllabic. In deriving,
                    therefore, a word in one language, from its correspondent expression in some
                    other language, we must ever bear in mind, that, unless in the formation of new
                    compounds, the least abbreviated is commonly the parent, and the most
                    abbreviated its offspring. Would it be possible for any one to persuade us that
                    <hi rend="italic">Colaphus</hi> was derived from <hi rend="italic">Cuff,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Blaspheme</hi> from <hi rend="italic">Blame?</hi> “A similar
                    instance,” says the reviewer, “might be found in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trachelos</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hals</hi> of the Greeks and Germans; for
                    certainly <hi rend="italic">Hals</hi> is more like <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trachelos</hi> than like <hi rend="italic">Collum.</hi></p>
                <p>The Chinese, however, which is the principal, and probably the most ancient, of
                    the monosyllabic languages, is distinguished from almost all others by a more
                    marked peculiarity, which is, that its written characters, instead of depicting
                    sounds, are the immediate symbols of the objects or ideas, and are even
                    imperfectly represented by the sounds, whatever difference of accent or tone may
                    be exhibited by the most refined speaker; as indeed it may happen accidentally
                    in our own language, that we maybe at a loss to explain, without circumlocution,
                    whether we mean to say <hi rend="italic">Son</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sun</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">Beer</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Bier</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">Bear</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Bare</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">You, Ewe,
                    Yew,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">U</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but in the Chinese
                    the real cause of this essential characteristic appears to be, that the symbol
                    was in fact originally intended as a hieroglyphic or picture of the object,
                    though the resemblance, coarse as it probably was at first, has been generally
                    altogether lost by the modifications which the character has conventually
                    undergone. And in this point of view the Chinese would require to be classed
                    with the old Egyptian only, since we know of no other language which was
                    habitually expressed in hieroglyphics and their immediate derivatives. It is not
                    at all uncommon for the same sound in Coptic, as in Chinese, to have four or
                    five senses all essentially different, as may easily be observed in turning over
                    a dictionary; noou, for instance, means <hi rend="italic">Bad,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Them,</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">Shower,</hi> in two verses of
                    St Matthew (v. 45, 46), and perhaps several other things.</p>
                <p>Another ancient and extensive class of languages, united by a greater number of
                    resemblances than can well be altogether accidental, may be denominated the <hi
                    rend="italic">Indo-European,</hi> comprehending the Indian, the West Asiatic,
                    and almost all the European languages. If we chose to assign a geographical
                    situation to the common parent of this class, we should place it to the south
                    and west of the supposed origin of the human race; leaving the north for our
                    third class, which we can only define as including all the Asiatic and European
                    languages not belonging to the two former; which may be called Atactic, or,
                    perhaps, without much impropriety, <hi rend="smallcaps">Tataric</hi>; and which
                    may be subdivided into five orders, <hi rend="italic">Sporadic, Caucasian,
                    Tartarian, Siberian,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Insular.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">African</hi> and <hi rend="italic">American</hi> languages will
                    constitute a fourth and fifth class, sufficiently distinct from all the rest,
                    <hi rend="subscript"> v</hi> but not intended to be considered as any otherwise
                    united among themselves, than by their geographical situation. There is indeed
                    little doubt, that some of the languages here called Tatarie are essentially
                    allied to others, which are referred to the Indo-European class; but they have
                    been too little investigated to allow us to make the selection that would be
                    required for completing the classification.</p>
                <p>The following tables are copied, with considerable additions, from Adelung’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Mithridates.</hi> The words <hi rend="italic">Heaven</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Earth</hi> are chosen as specimens, because they seem to be known
                    in a greater number of languages than any others, except the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Father,</hi> which is supposed to exhibit, in some cases, a
                    fallacious similarity. The German orthography has been principally employed,
                    except in such languages as are usually written in the Roman characters, the
                    pronunciation of the consonants being more uniform than in English, and that of
                    the vowels differing little from the Italian.</p>

                <p>The tables will at least serve, notwithstanding some imperfections and
                    uncertainties, as a convenient synopsis for facilitating the reference to a
                    brief sketch of the history of the different families of languages.</p>
                <p>1. The strongest proof of the great antiquity of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Chinese</hi> language appears to be the extreme simplicity of its structure,
                    and the want of those abbreviations and conventional implications which have
                    been sometimes called the wings of languages. It is natural that, in attempting
                    to express ideas at once by characters, the rude pictures of material objects
                    should first have been principally, if not exclusively traced; thus the
                    Egyptians had ©,; for the <hi rend="italic">sun</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >moon,</hi> and θ for a country or <hi rend="italic">field,</hi> and the Chi
                    nese have still (Ĳ <hi rend="subscript"> f f</hi> [+) for these objects
                    respectively, the characters having been made square instead of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193202445" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2445-0080"/>round, which some of them
                    were in their more ancient forms. The Egyptians represented a <hi rend="italic"
                    >man</hi> by a figure kneeling, and stretching out his hand, or, in the
                    enchorial character, thus . The Chinese figure may originally have been of the
                    same form; but at present is more like a pair of legs only, , whilst a <hi
                    rend="italic">dog</hi> seems to have three or four legs; or . A thousand,
                    according to Mr Jomard’s ingenious conjecture, was copied from the lotus, with
                    its seed vessel, having a great multitude of seeds, and the Chinese is certainly
                    not altogether unlike the</p>
                <p>Egyptian , nor is the character for light , which seems intended to represent a
                    radiant body, altogether different from the ¢¶) or so often found among the
                    hieroglyphics of Egypt, although it is not easy to believe, with Mr Palin, that
                    the manuscripts found with the mummies agree precisely with a Chinese version of
                    the Psalms of David, character for character. The successive introduction of
                    figurative expressions and characters may easily be imagined; but it would be
                    useless to enter at present into further details of this kind, on grounds almost
                    entirely speculative. The Chinese are said to have been, in the ninth century, a
                    race of people resembling the Arabs; their physiognomy was contaminated in the
                    thirteenth and fourteenth by a mixture with their conquerors, the Mongols; but
                    their language remained unaltered. The dialect of <hi rend="italic">Tonkin</hi>
                    is sometimes called the language of <hi rend="italic">Anarn,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Guan</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> on occasions of state they use
                    the Chinese character, but more commonly a character of their own, probably
                    resembling that of the Siamese. Dr Leyden observes, that at least twenty
                    different nations employ the Chinese characters, though they read them quite
                    differently; and he considers the Cochin-Chinese, the Cantonese, and the
                    Japanese, as all essentially different from the Mandarin Chinese, though they
                    have all some words in common. He gives us as the names of the dialects of
                    Chinese, constituting almost as many separate languages, 1, <hi rend="italic"

                    >Kunng</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> II, <hi rend="italic">Hyong san,</hi> spoken
                    at <hi rend="italic">Macao;</hi> 12, <hi rend="italic">San talik;</hi> 13, <hi

                    rend="italic">;</hi> 16, <hi rend="italic">Eo khun,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chinchow.</hi> There is also a language spoken by the <hi rend="italic">Quan
                    to,</hi> between Tonkin and China, a people who consider themselves as more
                    ancient than their neighbours. Notwithstanding, however, all this supposed
                    diversity, we may trace a considerable resemblance in the spoken language, even
                    as far as Corea. In all these dialects, the conversation is a sort of
                    recitative, and the different notes give distinct meanings to the words; as in
                    fact we distinguish in English the sense of Μ? from Μ! or simply Μ.; tones
                    perfectly understood, though never written. The Chinese are without the sound of
                    the letter <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and several other sounds common in Europe;
                    the only way in which they express foreign words is by putting together the
                    characters of the nearest import, with a symbol of pronunciation annexed to
                    them; thus, for <hi rend="italic">Christus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cardinalis,</hi> they are obliged to write <hi rend="italic">Ki</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lu su tu su</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Kia ul</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">fi na li su,</hi> with a mouth annexed to them. The names of
                    places are generally distinguished by a square enclosing the characters which
                    express them, and the names of men, in some books, by a line drawn on one side
                    of the characters only. .In this there seems to be a distant analogy to the ring
                    which encloses proper names in the Egyptian inscriptions, but the names of
                    places were not distinguished in this manner by the Egyptians. The dialects of
                    Cambodia and Laos have received some mixture of Malayan from their neighbours;
                    in writing the former of these, sometimes called <hi rend="italic">K</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">hohmen,</hi> according to Dr
                    Leyden, the Bali, or old Sanscrit character, is employed; and the latter has
                    some analogy with the Siamese; indeed, both the Siamese and the Avanese are
                    disposed to derive themselves from Laos. It may be seen, from the specimens
                    exhibited in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Philology,</hi> that at least some
                    of the Chinese dialects have sounds agreeing in several instances with European
                    words of the same import; but the agreement is scarcely precise enough to
                    justify our inferring from it an original connection between the languages.</p>
                <p>2. The language of <hi rend="smallcaps">Siam</hi> resembles the Chinese in its
                    simplicity and metaphorical structure, though not so decidedly monosyllabic. It
                    is obvious, however, that the distinction of monosyllabic and polysyllabic could
                    not, in very ancient times, have been so positively laid down as at present,
                    since it was usual, in almost all countries, to write the words contiguous to
                    each other in a continued series, without any divisions between them; and, even
                    in modern printing, there is a happy invention, which often restores this
                    agreeable obscurity, under the name of a hyphen, by the use of which we avoid
                    the difficulty of determining whether we wish to employ one word or several. The
                    Siamese call themselves <hi rend="italic">Ehay</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    a part of their country is distinguished by the appellation Tai hai, or Great
                    T’hay. The numerals resemble the Mandarin Chinese; several words of the language
                    are borrowed from the Bali; it is written in an alphabetical character, which is
                    said to be complicated and refined.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Avanese</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Burmanish,</hi> has
                    also borrowed some polysyllabic words from the Bali, and is written in a
                    peculiar alphabetical character. It must be considered as an era in the history
                    of this country, that its emperor has employed Mr Felix Carey, at his own
                    expense, to establish a printing press at Ava, his metropolis, for printing a
                    translation of the Scriptures in Burmanish. A dialect, spoken in the district
                    called Tanengrari, is said to be of greater antiquity. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mon</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Peguan</hi> is called by Dr Leyden a distinct
                    original language; but it is written in the Avancse character, and Adelung’s
                    specimen scarcely differs at all from the Burmanish. The language of Arakan and
                    Rashaan is called <hi rend="italic">Rukheng</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> it
                    contains a number of words from the Bali, many of them converted into
                    monosyllables by an imperfect pronunciation. Dr Leyden considers it as the
                    connecting link between the monosyllabic and the polysyllabic languages; and he
                    calls it an original language, notwithstanding its acknowledged derivation from
                    its neighbours. It employs the Devanagri alphabet, including the letter <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">r.</hi> Out of fifty words of Rukheng, quoted by Buchanan, the
                    seven which are not Burman are only varieties of pronunciation. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Kiayn</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Kolun,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kukis,</hi> north-east of Chatigong, are mentioned as neighbouring
                    tribes, speaking languages almost entirely different from the Rukheng. We find,
                    in Mr Buchanan’s paper, some specimens of the languages of the Burma empire,
                    which it is difficult to distribute methodically without a further knowledge of
                    their peculiar characters, but some of which may, without impropriety, be
                    introduced here.</p>

                <p>4. The language of <hi rend="smallcaps">Thibet,</hi> or the Tangutish, has some
                    words in common with the Chinese, but is less simple in its structure. It is at
                    least as ancient as the religion of the country, which is nearly coeval with
                    Christianity. Its character is well known to be alphabetical, from the title of
                    the learned work of <hi rend="italic">Father</hi><hi rend="italic">Georgi</hi>
                    on the subject.</p>
                <p>5. The <hi rend="italic">Indo-European</hi> languages have been referred to a
                    single class, because every one of them has too great∙a number of coincidences
                    with some of the others to be considered as merely accidental, and many of them
                    in terms relating to objects of such a nature that they must necessarily have
                    been, in both of the languages compared, rather original than adoptive. The <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sanscrit,</hi> which is confessedly the parent language of
                    India, may easily be shown to be intimately connected with the Greek, the Latin,
                    and the German, although it is a great exaggeration to assert any thing like its
                    complete identity with either of these languages. Thus, we find, within the
                    compass of the Lord’s Prayer only, <hi rend="italic">Pida, Pitir,</hi> among the
                    Sanscrit terms for <hi rend="italic">Father,</hi> Gr. <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">Dies.</hi> There arc also some singular resemblances of declension
                    and conjugation between the Sanscrit and the Greek, <hi rend="italic">Dodami,
                    Dodasti, Do-dati</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in old Greek, <hi rend="italic"

                    In Mr Townsend’s work we also find some well-selected instances of resemblance
                    between the Sanscrit and other languages: thus, <hi rend="italic">Bhru,</hi> is

                    works which are still extant in Sanscrit an antiquity of four or five thousand
                    years; but Professor Adelung denies the validity of any of the arguments which
                    have been adduced in favour of a date at all approaching to this.</p>
                <p>The Sanscrit, even in its earliest state, can scarcely have been altogether
                    uniform throughout all the countries in which it was spoken, and it has
                    degenerated by degrees into a great diversity of modern dialects: the term
                    signifies learned or polished. Beyond the Ganges, it is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bali</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Magudha,</hi> which, the missionaries say,
                    “scarcely” differs from Sanscrit; the term Magudha is said to mean mixed or
                    irregular. In Siam the Sanscrit is still the language ŋf elegant literature; and
                    it is often employed throughout India, with some little difference of
                    construction, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Devanagari,</hi> the divine
                    language. The <hi rend="italic">Prakrit</hi> is rather a vague term, meaning,
                    according to Mr Colebrooke, common or vulgar; but it is also applied to the
                    language of the sacred books of the “Jainas.” We find in a little publication,
                    entitled a <hi rend="italic">Brief View of the Baptist Missions and</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Translations,</hi> some useful information respecting the Indian
                    languages and dialects, into a great number of which these laborious and
                    disinterested persons have made or procured translations of the whole of the
                    Scriptures, which they have printed at Serampore, near Calcutta. The dialects,
                    which they enumerate, are principally arranged in a geographical order; and,
                    beginning with those which are spoken towards the middle of India, as the pure
                    <hi rend="italic">Sanscrit</hi> and its least modified dialects, we may place
                    next to them the languages of the countries bordering on the monosyllabic
                    nations, towards the north and east: we have here the dialects of <hi
                    rend="italic">Nepal, Assam</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Uhumiya, Tiperah,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Kassai,</hi> of which little more is known than that
                    translations into the first two have been already executed: the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bengalee</hi> is spoken in and about Calcutta: the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hindee</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Hinduvee</hi> is spoken about
                    Agra; it is printed in the Devanagri character, the font of which contains more
                    than 800 varieties of letters and their combinations; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Urdu</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Oordoo</hi> is a subdialect of the Hindee, as
                    well as the <hi rend="italic">Brijbassa,</hi> which is nearer to the Sanscrit
                    than some other dialects: the <hi rend="italic">Jypura</hi> is mentioned as
                    another language belonging to the same neighbourhood: the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hindustance</hi> is spoken in Hindustan Proper, or Lower Hindustan; the
                    missionaries say it is “<hi rend="italic">diametrically</hi> different” from the
                    Hindee: the <hi rend="italic">Moors</hi> or “Mongol Indostanish” seems to belong
                    to this country, being mixed with a good deal of Persian and Arabic, unless it
                    be rather referrible to the Hindee: the dialects of <hi rend="italic">Udaipura,
                    Benares,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Munipura,</hi> are also called separate
                    languages: the <hi rend="italic">Goandee</hi> is spoken at Nagpore, in the
                    Mahratta country: further east is <hi rend="italic">Orissa</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Uriya,</hi> the language of which is printed in a character
                    requiring 300 different types: the <hi rend="italic">Telug</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Wαrug</hi> is spoken about Cuddalore and Madras: the <hi
                    rend="italic">Telinga</hi> further west: the <hi rend="italic">Carnatic</hi> has
                    a peculiar language, besides the <hi rend="italic">Tamul,</hi> which is spoken
                    from Palea-cate, near Madras, to Cape Comorin, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mαrwa,</hi> which appears to belong to a part of this country. About Cochin in
                    Travancore we have the <hi rend="italic">Maleiam</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi>
                    further north, the languages of <hi rend="italic">Malabar, Kanara,</hi> and of

                    is of considerable antiquity, being found in two copper tablets as old as the
                    eighth or ninth century: then comes the <hi rend="italic">Kunkuna,</hi> about
                    Bombay: the <hi rend="italic">Mahratta</hi> is further inland: the <hi
                    rend="italic">Guzurat</hi> on the coast: and, beyond the Indus, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Beloshee</hi> in Belochistan: north of this we find the <hi
                    rend="italic">Afghan</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pushtu</hi> language, which
                    contains more Hebrew words than any of its neighbours; the people are said to
                    have come from the north about 2000 years ago, and, according to a Persian
                    tradition, to be descended from King Saul; indeed the language stands somewhat
                    more correctly under the Median family in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mithridates,</hi> but since it forms the connecting link between the two
                    families, it might perhaps be as conveniently arranged among the more numerous
                    species of the Sanscrit; it is written in the Arabic character, with some
                    additional letters for expressing the Sanscrit sounds. The language of <hi
                    rend="italic">Multan,</hi> north of Sindh, has about one tenth of Persian mixed
                    with it. The <hi rend="italic">Gipsies</hi> were certainly expelled from some
                    part of India by the cruelties of Timur Leng, about the year 1400; and they were
                    probably some of the <hi rend="italic">Zingans,</hi> in the neighbourhood of
                    Multan, their language having a great number of coincidences with that of
                    Multan, and being still more manifestly a dialect of the Sanscrit, although they
                    have adopted many European, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193202471"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-2471-0082"/>especially Sclavonian words. When they first
                    appeared in Europe, they were supposed to amount to about half a million; at
                    present they are less numerous.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Maldivian</hi> is peculiar to the group of small islands
                    from which it is named; the Baptists have already printed some books in it. The
                    people are said greatly to resemble those of Ceylon. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cingalese,</hi> which is spoken in great part of Ceylon, is a mixture of
                    several of the continental dialects; and it has been observed, that the proper
                    names in Ceylon mentioned by Ptolemy are of Sanscrit origin. Dr Leyden gives, as
                    a proof of the antiquity of the <hi rend="italic">Malayan,</hi> that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Temala</hi> of Ptolemy is derived from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tema,</hi> tin. The connection of this language with the Sanscrit has not been
                    very universally admitted; and some of those who have studied it most are
                    disposed to consider it as wholly original; but, in the purest part of the
                    language, Dr Leyden confesses that there is a considerable resemblance to the
                    Avanese and the Siamese; the words derived from the Sanscrit he considers as
                    somewhat less numerous, amounting, however, to about 5000; they are generally
                    less like the Bali than the Sanscrit; and a still smaller number are borrowed
                    from the Arabic. The character of the monosyllabic languages is in some measure
                    retained. Sir William Jones considered the Malayan as a derivative of the
                    Sanscrit: Mr Marsden supposes it to have received its Sanscrit words through
                    Gujerat; Dr Leyden rather from Kalinga or Telinga; and it exhibits some traces
                    of the dialects of Tamul and Maleialam. Besides these various sources, it is
                    said to have borrowed some of its simplest words from the Javanese and the
                    Bugis; and it has become more nearly monosyllabic by dropping the first
                    syllables of some of the words which it has adopted. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Javanese</hi> is said to be more ancient than the Malayan: the empire of Java
                    was formerly powerful and flourishing: the ancient language was much like the
                    Sanscrit, more so than the Malayan, but was written in a peculiar character.
                    Dialects of this language are still spoken in Bali and in Madura. Leyden thinks
                    the Malays were derived from Java; Marsden rather from Sumatra, though he allows
                    •that there are some reasons for conjecturing that an old Sanscrit colony may
                    have settled many hundred years ago in Java, and mixed its language with a
                    supposed mother tongue of that Asiatic race.</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">Sumatran</hi> dialects, the principal, according to Dr
                    Leyden, is the <hi rend="italic">īìatta,</hi> spoken by a people who occupy the
                    centre of the island, and who still, like some other Indian nations, retain the
                    custom of eating their old relations. The language seems to be partly original,
                    and partly connected with the Malayan, and other dialects of the neighbouring
                    islands. The <hi rend="italic">Pejang</hi> is chiefly a mixture of Batta and
                    Malayan; in the <hi rend="italic">Larnpuhn</hi> or Lampung there is also some
                    Javanese. The <hi rend="italic">Achi</hi> has admitted a still further influx of
                    words belonging to all the Mussulman jargons of the neighbourhood, especially to
                    that of the Mapulas of Malabar. There are other dialects of less note in Néas
                    and the Poggy Islands, most resembling the Batta. This language is provided with
                    a peculiar alphabet, which is remarkable for being written from the bottom of
                    the paper upwards, like the Mexican hieroglyphics; though the Battas, as well as
                    the Chinese, sometimes hold their books so as to read horizontally. In Borneo
                    there appear to be several dialects, or rather separate languages; two of them,
                    according to Dr Leyden, are the Biaju and the Ti-sun. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Andaman</hi> language is inserted here for want of a better place only; it does
                    not appear to have any connection with the Sanscrit, and may possibly be found
                    to be more like that of Madagascar: the people seem to belong to the Papuas, a
                    distinct original race, according to Dr Leyden, black, and with woolly hair.</p>
                <p>Besides the numerous translations into languages of the Indo-European, “class,
                    the Baptist missionaries have also printed some Armenian and Persian works at
                    the indefatigable press of Serampore, which is supplied by a letter-foundery and
                    a paper-mill, belonging to the same establishment, enabling them to execute the
                    whole business at less than half the expense of European books of the same
                    magnitude. The little pamphlet already quoted contains also specimens of the
                    characters of the Sanscrit, Assam, Bengalee, Mahratta, Sikh, and Cashmirian,
                    which somewhat resemble each other in the square form of their characters; as
                    well as of the Burman, Orissa, Telinga, and Cingalese, which have a more rounded
                    and flourished appearance; of the Tamul, ,which looks a little like Armenian; of
                    the Afghan and the Persian used in India; and of the Chinese, both as printed
                    from blocks, and from the moveable metal types which have been cast at
                    Serampore.</p>
                <p>6. The connection of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Median</hi> family with the
                    Sanscrit on one side, and with the Greek and German on the other, is
                    sufficiently proved by the words <hi rend="italic">Abitap,</hi> Zend. <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">Hepta.</hi> There are also some coincidences with the Chaldee,
                    but the Median is certainly not a dialect of the Chaldee. Sir W. Jones and
                    others have said that the Zendish was nearest to the Sanscrit, and the Pehlvi to
                    the Chaldee or Arabic. In ancient Media, the <hi rend="italic">Zendish</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> was the language of the northern, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pehlvi,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Parthian,</hi> of the southern
                    parts; the word Pehlvi or Pahalevi is supposed by Leyden to have been nearly
                    synonymous with Pali or Bali, though this is said to be derived from Bahlika, an
                    Indo-European country. The Zendish was more particularly appropriated to
                    religious purposes, and the Pehlvi had in a great measure superseded it for
                    common use at a very early period; under the Sassanides, again, from the third
                    to the seventh century, the use of the Pehlvi was discouraged, and the old
                    Persian substituted for it. It is said, however, that in the remote parts of the
                    country, about Shirwan, some traces of the Pehlvi may still be found in
                    existence. The <hi rend="italic">Zendavesta</hi> of Zoroaster, which is still
                    extant in Zendish, is said to have been written 520 years <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b. c.</hi>; and Adelung follows Anquetil in asserting its authenticity, even in
                    opposition to the opinion of Jones and Richardson. These languages have little
                    or no connection with the Georgian and Armenian, which have succeeded them in
                    some of the same countries. The old Persian, which seems to be much connected
                    with the Pehlvi, has remained in use, either as a living or as a learned
                    language, ever since the time of the Sassanides; it was current among the
                    Persians when they were conquered by the Arabs in the seventh century; and it is
                    the language of the <hi rend="italic">Shah Namch</hi> of Firdusi, written in the
                    tenth century, as well as of the <hi rend="italic">Ayeen Ahbery,</hi> of which
                    the date is about 1600. The modern <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi> became a
                    cultivated language about the year 1000, having received a considerable mixture
                    of Arabic and Turkish words. The term <hi rend="italic">Parsee</hi> is commonly
                    applied to a corrupt Pehlvi, spoken by the refugee fire-worshippers in
                    Bombay.</p>
                <p>The Goths are said to have inhabited, for some centuries, the countries about the
                    Black Sea, and may originally have bordered on Persia. From this circumstance,
                    and probably also from the effects of a later irruption of the Goths into
                    Persia, which is recorded in history, we may easily explain the occurrence of
                    many Persian words in German, and in the other languages of Northern Europe.
                    Professor Adelung has examined more than two hundred cases of such resemblances,
                    and has found only one sixth <pb break="no" facs="nls:193202484"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-2484-0083"/>part of them in Anquetil’s vocabularies of the
                    more ancient dialects. He has, however, omitted to state what proportion the
                    whole magnitude of these vocabularies bears to that of a complete dictionary of
                    the language. It is well known that an essay was published a few years since in
                    London, <hi rend="italic">On the Similarity of the Persian and English
                    Languages</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and a more elaborate work on the
                    relations of the Persian languages, by Mr le Pileur, has since appeared in
                    Holland. Mr le Pileur attempts to explain the is or s of the genitive of the
                    northern languages, by the Persian preposition <hi rend="smallcaps">ez,</hi>
                    which seems to be synonymous with the Greek and Latin <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >ex</hi>; but he has not shown that this <hi rend="smallcaps">ez</hi> ever
                    follows the noun to which it relates.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Kurds</hi> speak a corrupt dialect of the Persian; they are
                    probably derived from the Carduchi of the Greeks, who inhabited the Gordiaean
                    Hills. They spread into Persia about the year 1000, and are now situated on the
                    borders of the Persian and Turkish dominions. The language of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Afghans,</hi> about Candahar, is said to contain about one fourth
                    of Persian, and some Tartarian, besides the Sanscrit which abounds in it.</p>
                <p>7. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arabian</hi> family is called by the German critics
                    <hi rend="italic">Semitic,</hi> from Shem the son of Noah, as having been
                    principally spoken by his descendants. Though not intimately connected with the
                    European languages, it is well known to have afforded some words to the Greek
                    and, Latin; it has also some in common with the Sanscrit, though apparently
                    fewer than either the Greek or the German. Thus we have <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">Ego</hi> as well as for <hi rend="italic">Ni</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Mi</hi> of verbs, for the <hi rend="italic">Anoh</hi> of the
                    Egyptians, and even for the <hi rend="italic">Ngo</hi> of the Chinese.</p>
                <p>The northern nations of this family have sometimes been comprehended under the
                    name <hi rend="italic">Aramaic,</hi> in contradistinction to the middle or
                    Canaanitish, and the southern or Arabian. The Eastern Aramaic, or old <hi
                    rend="italic">Chaldee,</hi> is very little known; it was the language of a
                    people situated in the north of Mesopotamia, which is now the south of Armenia;
                    a part of them extended themselves further south, and became Babylonians, of
                    whose dialect some traces are said still to exist about Mosul and Diarbeker. The
                    old Assyrians, between the Tigris and Media, were a colony of the Babylonians,
                    and spoke a language unintelligible to the Jews (2 Kings, xviii). The Western
                    Aramaic has become known, since the Christian era, as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Syriac,</hi> in which there is an ancient and valuable translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">New Testament.</hi> It is still spoken about Edessa and Harran.
                    The Palmyrene was one of its dialects; the modern <hi rend="italic"
                    >Assyrian</hi> of the Russian vocabularies appears to be another.</p>
                <p>The language of the Canaanites is said by St Jerome to have been intermediate
                    between the Hebrew and the Egyptian. The people are supposed to have come
                    originally from the Persian Gulf; the Philistines, who were found among them, to
                    have emigrated from the Delta to Cyprus, to have been thence expelled by the
                    Phoenicians, and to have adopted the language of the Canaanites when they
                    settled among them. The book of Job is considered as affording some idea of the
                    dialect of Edom; it is well known to contain many Arabisms, besides some other
                    peculiarities. The <hi rend="italic">Phoenician</hi> is only known from a few
                    coins and inscriptions found chiefly in Cyprus and in Malta, and not yet very
                    satisfactorily deciphered, though Akerblad is convinced, by some of them, that
                    it varied but very little from the Hebrew; of its descendant, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Punic,</hi> or Carthaginian, a specimen is preserved in the speech
                    of Hanno in Plautus, as happily arranged by Bochart; the objection of Adelung,
                    respecting the want of a proper name, appearing to have arisen from a mistake.
                    The last six lines of the text are probably either a repetition of the same
                    speech in the old Libyan of the neighbourhood, or a jargon intended to imitate
                    it.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Hebrews</hi> originated among the Chaldeans, Terah, the
                    father of Abraham, having been a native of Ur, or Edessa, beyond the Euphrates.
                    They adopted the language of the Canaanites, among whom they led a nomadic life,
                    till their residence in Egypt, which must probably have had some effect in
                    modifying their language. After that time, however, it appears to have varied
                    but little, in a period of 1000 years, from Moses to Malachi; and this
                    circumstance Adelung considers as so uncommon and improbable, that he is
                    disposed to believe that the writings of Moses must have been modernized at
                    least as late as the time of Samuel. The old Hebrew became extinct, as a living
                    language, about 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>; 1000 years afterwards, the
                    Masoretic points were added, to assist in its pronunciation; and this was done
                    in some measure upon the model of the Syro-Chaldaic, which at that time was
                    still spoken. The Septuagint version, which is much older, supports, in the
                    instances of many of the proper names, the reading indicated by the points; but
                    in about as many others it appears to deviate from that system, and to agree
                    with a mode of pronunciation founded upon the text or principal characters
                    alone. The reading in Greek letters of Origen, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hexapla,</hi> tends, on the whole, very strongly to support the points. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Chaldee</hi> had superseded the Hebrew at the time of the
                    captivity, and was gradually converted into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Syro-Clialdaic,</hi> which is called Hebrew in the New Testament. The Targums,
                    and the Talmud of Babylon, are in the older Chaldee; and a Syro-Chaldaic
                    translation of the New Testament has been discovered to be still in
                    existence.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Samaritan</hi> somewhat resembles the Chaldee. It was
                    formed among the Phoenicians and others, who occupied the habitations of the ten
                    tribes when they were carried into captivity by Salmanassar and Esarhaddon. Its
                    peculiar alphabet is well known as a mere variation of the Hebrew.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Rabbinical</hi> dialect was principally formed in the
                    middle ages, among the Spanish Jews, who were chiefly descended from the
                    inhabitants of Jerusalem; while those of Germany and Poland were generally
                    Galileans, and spoke a ruder dialect of the Hebrew than the fugitives from the
                    metropolis.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Arabs</hi> have been a distinct, and in a great measure an
                    independent nation, for more than 3000 years. Some of them were descended from
                    Shem; others, as the Cushites, Canaanites, and Amalekites, from his brother Ham.
                    Their language, as it is found in the Koran, contains some mixture of Indian,
                    Persian, and Abyssinian words. Its grammar was little cultivated until a century
                    or two after the time of Mahommed. It is certainly copious, but its copiousness
                    has been ridiculously exaggerated and absurdly admired. The best Arabic is
                    spoken by the upper classes in Yemen; in Mecca it is more mixed; in Syria
                    corrupt, and still more so in some parts of Africa. There are dialects which
                    require the assistance of an interpreter to make them intelligible; at the same
                    time, it has been maintained by Aryda, a learned Arab of Syria, in contradiction
                    to Niebuhr, that the Arabic of the Koran is still employed in conversation among
                    the best educated of the people, as well as in correct writing. The Arabs living
                    in houses are called Moors, and those of Africa are the best known under this
                    name. The Ma-puls or Mapulets of Malabar and Coromandel are a numerous colony of
                    Arabs, who have been settled there above a thousand years.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ethiopians</hi> are descended from the Cushite Arabs. In
                    the time of Nimrod they conquered Babylon; before that of Moses they emigrated
                    into Africa, and settled in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193202497"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-2497-0084"/>and about Tigri; in Isaiah’s time they seem to
                    have extended to Fez; and at present they occupy Tigri, Amhara, and some
                    neighbouring countries. They became Christians in 325, but retained the
                    initiatory ceremony of the Jews and Mussulmen. The pure or literary Ethiopic is
                    called <hi rend="italic">Geez,</hi> or Axumitic, in contradistinction to the
                    Ainharic, by which it was superseded as the language of common life in Amhara
                    about the fourteenth century, although it is still spoken, without much
                    alteration, in some parts of <hi rend="italic">Tigri,</hi> while in others, as
                    in <hi rend="italic">Hauasa,</hi> a different dialect is spoken. The Ethiopic
                    was first particularly made known in Europe by the elaborate publications of
                    Ludolf. Mr Asselin has lately procured a translation of the whole of the Bible
                    into the Amharic, as it is now spoken at Gondar; it was executed by the old
                    Abyssinian traveller who was known to Bruce and to Sir William Jones, and it is
                    said to be now printing at the expense of some of the British societies.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Maltese</hi> is immediately derived from the modern Arabic,
                    without any intervention of the Punic. The island, having been successively
                    subject to the Phaeacians, Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, and
                    Goths, was subdued by the Arabians in the ninth century; in the eleventh the
                    Normans conquered it; and it remained united with Sicily until it became in some
                    measure independent, under the knights of St John.</p>
                <p>8. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Lycian</hi> isonly known from a few short
                    inscriptions copied by Mr R. Cockerell, and published in Mr Walpole’s
                    collection, together with two or three longer ones, which have been lately
                    brought from Antiphellos by the enterprising and indefatigable Mr W. J. Bankes.
                    By means of a proper name in one of Mr Cockerell’s inscriptions, we obtain a
                    part of the alphabet; thus î is <hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >;</hi> Δ, D; <hi rend="smallcaps">e,</hi> i; P, R; 3 &gt; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> s</hi>; and probably A, ιι; and I, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >l.</hi> A further comparison of the different parts of the other inscriptions
                    with the Greek phrases that almost uniformly accompany them, implying “<hi
                    rend="smallcaps">for himself and his wife and his children,”</hi> gives us the
                    words <hi rend="smallcaps">a,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">at</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript smallcaps"> ,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">- hi,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">himself;</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">sa,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >his,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">for his,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">hrdi,</hi> or
                    perhaps <hi rend="smallcaps">hroi,</hi><hi rend="italic">wife</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">tidaimi,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >son</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">tidaima,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">children</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >atbi,</hi><hi rend="italic">and.</hi> It does not appear that any of these
                    words would authorize us to place the Lycian language as a member of the great
                    Indo-European class; but it is reported to have been much mixed with Greek, and,
                    on account of its geographical situation, it may be allowed to occupy a
                    temporary rank between the principal oriental and European languages. If it has
                    a shadow of likeness to any other language, it is perhaps to the Cimbric; and
                    <hi rend="italic">Tidaimi</hi> may also possibly be allied to the Greek <hi
                    rend="italic">Titheno,</hi> to nurse.</p>
                <p>9. Respecting the ancient <hi rend="smallcaps">Phrygian,</hi> we have a few
                    traditions only, which at least agree in giving it a high antiquity, as the
                    source of several Greek words. Thus, Plato observes, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cratylus,</hi> that the terms denoting <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">water</hi> are not derived from any other Greek words, but are
                    Phrygian primitives. It seems, however, that <hi rend="italic">water</hi> was
                    called <hi rend="italic">Bedü</hi> by the Phrygians, and the word resembles the
                    <hi rend="italic">Bada, Bath,</hi> of the northern nations, as well as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vate,</hi> water, of the Swedes; <hi rend="italic">Mairai,</hi>
                    the fates, derived from the Phrygian, is compared to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Meyar,</hi> virgins, of the Gothic; and <hi rend="italic">Bek, bread,</hi> is
                    as much like our <hi rend="italic">Bake,</hi> as like the Albanian <hi
                    rend="italic">Buk, bread.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Greek</hi> has no very intimate or general connection with
                    any of the older languages which have been preserved entire, although there are
                    a number of particular instances of its resemblance to the Sanscrit, some of
                    which have been already mentioned; it has also many German and Celtic words,
                    some Sclavonian, and, as it is said, a few Finnish. It can only have been
                    immediately derived from the language of the neighbouring Thracians and
                    Pelasgians, who secin to have come originally from the middle of Asia, through
                    the countries north of the Black Sea, and to have occupied not only Greece and
                    Thrace, but also the neighbouring parts of Asia Minor, where they probably
                    retained their ancient dialect to a later period than elsewhere. The whole of
                    the Thracian states were greatly deranged by the expedition of the Celts in 278
                    B. c. which terminated in their settling the colony of Galatia. The Dacians, or
                    Getae, who principally occupied Bulgaria, extended themselves further
                    northwards, and afterwards constituted the Roman provinces of Moesia and Dacia,
                    which were conquered by the Goths in the third century. The Macedonians, in the
                    time of Alexander, spoke a language which was nearly unintelligible to the
                    Greeks in general; even the Pelasgi in Epirus and Thessaly long retained a
                    dialect materially different from their neighbours, and in Arcadia still longer.
                    The Hellenes, who emigrated from Asia Minor into Greece, were not sufficiently
                    numerous to carry their own dialect with them, although the language assumed
                    their name. The Graeci in Italy were Pelasgians, although Dionysius of
                    Halicarnassus includes them in the denomination Hellenic; their language must
                    have been Aeolo-Doric, and it was in this form that the Latin received its
                    mixture of Greek; the Lacedemonian also retained it till a late period, writing,
                    for instance, instead of <hi rend="italic">Pais, Poir,</hi> as in Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">Puer.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Aeolic</hi> appears once to have
                    extended over Attica, and to have left some Aeolisms in the old Attic dialect.
                    This dialect was the principal basis of the common language of Greece at a later
                    period, which must have been the most cultivated under the protection of the
                    court of Alexandria, and which continued to be spoken and written in the highest
                    circles of Constantinople throughout the middle ages. By degrees it degenerated
                    into the modern <hi rend="italic">Romaic,</hi> having received a mixture of
                    Turkish and Italian, and perhaps of some other neighbouring languages.</p>
                <p>11. The <hi rend="smallcaps">German</hi> family is sufficiently connected with a
                    variety of others belonging to the Indo-European class, to be admitted into it
                    upon a very short investigation. Its resemblances to the Greek, within the
                    compass of the Lord’s Prayer, besides <hi rend="italic">Father</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Name,</hi> are <hi rend="italic">Wille, Wollen,</hi> Gr. <hi
                    rend="italic">Boule,</hi> perhaps <hi rend="italic">Brot</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Proat, bread,</hi> like <hi rend="italic">Artos,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Freyen</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Losen,</hi> like <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhiicin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lusein.</hi> Dr Jamieson has
                    shown very clearly, in his <hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Scythicus,</hi> how immediately the structure of the Gothic languages is
                    derived from that of the Greeks. Thus the <hi rend="smallcaps">ein</hi> of the

                    as if both hands were tied together; and <hi rend="smallcaps">pente</hi> has a
                    strong resemblance to <hi rend="smallcaps">panta,</hi> as if <hi rend="italic"
                    >all</hi> the five fingers were reckoned: and, on the other hand, <hi

                    the original of <hi rend="smallcaps">deca.</hi> But none of these etymologies
                    seems to be so decisive of originality as that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >caterva,</hi> which is evidently related to <hi rend="italic">turba</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">turma,</hi> while the first syllable remains unexplained in Latin;
                    but in the Celtie we have <hi rend="italic">cad tarf</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >cath tarf,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">war troop,</hi> agreeing undeniably with
                    the sense. For another example, we may take <hi rend="italic">ventus</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">wind,</hi> for which we find no Latin etymology, while the
                    German furnishes us with <hi rend="italic">wehen,</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >blow,</hi> and thence <hi rend="italic">wehend</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >wind</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the words <hi rend="italic">nodus</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">knot</hi> afford also a similar instance, <hi rend="italic"
                    >nodus</hi> having nothing nearer to it in Latin than <hi rend="italic"
                    >neo,</hi> to spin, <hi rend="italic">necto,</hi> to unite; but in German we
                    have <hi rend="italic">knutten,</hi> to join, and in English <hi rend="italic"
                    >knit</hi> and <hi rend="italic">knead</hi> from the same root. The degrees of
                    comparison are expressed in Greek by <hi rend="smallcaps">eros</hi> and ιsros;
                    in Anglo-Saxon by <hi rend="smallcaps">er</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">era,</hi>
                    and ιsτ or <hi rend="smallcaps">ast.</hi><hi rend="italic">Er</hi> seems to mean
                    <hi rend="italic">before,</hi> as well as the Latin <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >or.</hi> The Coptic has no comparative, but for <hi rend="italic">better than
                    I,</hi> the Egyptians said <hi rend="italic">very good before me.</hi> It would
                    seem at first sight natural to make <hi rend="italic">than</hi> a preposition,
                    as well as <hi rend="italic">before,</hi> and to say <hi rend="italic">better
                    than me</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but the faet is, that in English, as well
                    as in German, it was usual of old to say <hi rend="italic">then</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">denn</hi> in this sense; and <hi rend="italic">lie is wiser than
                    I</hi> meant only, <hi rend="italic">he is wise</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">before,
                    then</hi><hi rend="italic">I follow.</hi> The idea of time or place is now
                    dropped as unessential to the kind of priority in question, but the ground of
                    the grammatical construction remains unaltered. In Moeso-Gothic the comparative
                    termination is ιzo or ozo, the superlative ιsτs or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >ista;</hi> thus the Greek <hi rend="smallcaps">meizon</hi> becomes <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">meizo,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">maists</hi> is obviously
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">megistos.</hi> The old <hi rend="italic">megalos</hi> is
                    <hi rend="italic">mikils,</hi> mickle or muckle; and <hi rend="italic">minor,
                    minimus,</hi> became <hi rend="italic">minnizo, minnists</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> in Persian, <hi rend="italic">mih</hi> is <hi rend="italic">great,
                    milder, greater, mihtras, greatest</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >better</hi> seems to be from the old German <hi rend="italic">bied</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">bieder,</hi><hi rend="italic">upright, honest,</hi> and resembles
                    the Persian <hi rend="smallcaps">bihter,</hi><hi rend="italic">better.</hi> The
                    Moeso-Gothic verbs have also some striking resemblances in their form to the
                    Latin; thus the present tense of <hi rend="italic">to have</hi> is <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">haba, habais, ha-</hi> ΒΑ1Τ11; HABAM, ΗΑΒΑΙΤΗ, HABAND; HABUIT
                    İS HABA1DA; HABENS, HABANDS; HABENTIS, HABAND1S; HABENTEM, HABANDAM; HABENTES,
                    HABANDANS. The substantive verb singular in Greek is <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >cimi,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">eis,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">esti</hi>; the
                    plural in Latin <hi rend="smallcaps">sumus, estis,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >sunt;</hi> the Moeso-Gothic has <hi rend="smallcaps">im, is,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">ist,</hi> siJUM, suuτH, <hi rend="smallcaps">sind;</hi> and sis
                    is <hi rend="smallcaps">suais;</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">esse, wisan.</hi> The
                    Moeso-Gothic nouns frequently retain the resemblance of the Greek more strongly
                    than their more modern derivatives: thus a τooτπ does notseem to point very
                    immediately to <hi rend="smallcaps">dentem</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >odonta</hi> as its source; but the older form ruNTiiu is clearly the
                    intermediate stage of this modification; and numberless other instances of the
                    same kind might easily be found.</p>
                <p>The Germans were known, as early as the time of Pytheas, that is, 320 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> as consisting of the Jutes in Denmark, the Teutones
                    on the coast to the east of them, the Ostiaeans next, and lastly the Cossini,
                    Cotini, 'or Goths. Professor Adelung imagines that the eastern nations, or
                    Suevi, employed almost from the earliest times a high German dialect, and the
                    western, or Cimbri, a low German; the Suevi he supposes to have been driven, at
                    a remote period, into the south of Germany by the Selavonians; and some of the
                    Goths appear to have extended as far as the Crimea. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bible</hi> of Ulphila, in the Gothic or Moeso-Gothic of 360, is the oldest
                    specimen in existence of the German language. Besides the Greek and Latin, which
                    appear to prevail so much in the language, it exhibits a considerable mixture of
                    Selavonian and Finnish; the translation is far more literal than it could be
                    made in any of the more modern dialcets of the German, and sometimes appears to
                    follow the text with somewhat too much servility.</p>
                <p>The modern <hi rend="italic">German,</hi> founded on the higher dialects of
                    Saxony, was fixed and made general by Martin Luther. There are many shades of
                    dialect and pronunciation in the different parts of this diversified country,
                    but none of them of any particular interest, or established by any literary
                    authority. There are still some German colonies in the territories of Vieenza
                    and Verona, called the Sette Comuni, which retain their language. The German
                    Jews have a peculiar jargon, borrowed in some measure from their brethren in
                    Poland, which they write in Hebrew characters; and another similar mixture of
                    discordant dialects is spoken by the Rothwelsh, a vagabond people in the south
                    of Germany, who have sometimes been confounded with the Gipsies.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Low Saxon,</hi> or Platt Deutsch, is spoken about
                    Halberstadt, and farther north, in the countries between the Elbe and the Weser;
                    it seems to be intimately connected with the Frieslandish and Danish, as well as
                    with the English. The <hi rend="italic">Frieslanders</hi> originally extended
                    from the Rhine to the Ems, and the Canchi, thence to the Elbe; these countries
                    still retain a dialect materially varying from those of their neighbours. The
                    Brokmic laws of the thirteenth century exhibit some remarkable differences from
                    the German of the same date: thus we find in them <hi rend="italic"
                    >īłedieva,</hi> a judge, or <hi rend="italic">Peeve,</hi> instead of <hi
                    rend="italic">Pichter</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Kenne,</hi><hi rend="italic">kin</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">sida,</hi><hi rend="italic">side,</hi> as in Swedish, instead of
                    <hi rend="italic">seite.</hi> The Batavian Frieslandish approaches very much to
                    the English; it has several subdialects, as those of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Molkwer</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hinde-lop.</hi> Some of the Cauehish
                    Frieslanders remain in the territory of Bremen; the North Frieslanders occupy
                    Heligoland, Husum, and Amröm. .</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Dutch</hi> language is a mixture of Frieslandish, Low
                    Saxon, and German, with a little French. It appears, from Kolyn’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronicle,</hi> to have been distinctly formed as early as
                    1156.</p>
                <p>The Scandinavian branch of the Germanic family is characterized by the want both
                    of gutturals and of aspirates, which renders its pronunciation softer and less
                    harsh; and by some peculiarities of construction, for instance, by the place of
                    the article, which follows its noun, both in <hi rend="italic">Danislι</hi> and
                    Swedish, instead of preceding it, as in most other languages. The name of
                    Denmark is first found in the ninth century; until the sixth the people were
                    called Jutes. <hi rend="italic">Norway,</hi> in the ninth century, was termed
                    Nordmanland. A corrupt Norwegian is still, or was lately, spoken in some of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Orkneys,</hi> which were long subject to Norway and Denmark.
                    In the eastern parts of <hi rend="italic">Iceland,</hi> the language is much
                    like the Norwegian; but, on the coast, it is mixed with Danish. The oldest
                    specimen of Icelandic is the <hi rend="italic">Jus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ecclesiasticum</hi> of 1123. The term Runic relates to the rectilinear
                    characters cut in wood, which were sometimes used by the Scandinavian nations.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Swedes</hi> are derived from a mixture of Scandinavians
                    with Goths from Upper Germany, but their language does not exhibit any dialectic
                    differences corresponding to this difference of extraction. Mr Townsend has
                    given us a list, from Peringskiold, of 670 Swedish words resembling the Greek;
                    but it must be confessed that the resemblance is in many eases extremely
                    slight.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Saxons</hi> are mentioned by Ptolemy as a small nation in
                    Holstein, whence, in conjunction with the Frieslanders, and the Angles of south
                    Jutland, they came over to England, about the year 450. The Saxons settled
                    principally south of the Thames, the Angles north. At the union of the
                    Heptarchy, the Saxon dialect prevailed, and the Anglish, which nearly resembled
                    the Danish of that time, was less in use; but new swarms of Danes having
                    inundated the north of England in 787, the Danish dialect was introduced by
                    Canute and his followers; and it is about this period that our earliest
                    specimens of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193202523"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-2523-0086"/>Anglo-Saxon are dated. The Saxon dialect again
                    obtained the ascendancy under Edward the Confessor; and although some French was
                    introduced by this prince, and still more by William the Conqueror, into the
                    higher circles of society, the courts of law, and the schools, yet the use of
                    the French language never became general among the lower classes, and the Saxon
                    recovered much of its currency in the thirteenth century, when the cities and
                    corporate towns rose into importance, under Edward the First. In the fourteenth
                    century it was permanently established, with the modifications which it had
                    received from the French; and it may be considered as truly English from this
                    period, or even somewhat earlier, at least if Pope Adrian’s rhymes are the
                    genuine production of 1156. It is still much more German than French; in the
                    Lord’s Prayer, the only words of Latin origin are <hi rend="italic">Trespass,
                    Temptation,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Deliver.</hi> Professor Adelung’s remarks
                    on the simplicity of the English language appear to be so judicious as to
                    deserve transcribing. “The language,” he observes, “only received its final
                    cultivation at the time of the Reformation, and of the civil disturbances which
                    followed that event; nor did it acquire its last polish till after the
                    Revolution, when the authors who employed it elevated it to that high degree of
                    excellence, of which, from its great copiousness, and the remarkable simplicity
                    of its construction, it was peculiarly capable. It is the most simple of all the
                    European languages; the terminations of its substantives being only changed in
                    the genitive and in the plural, and the alterations of the roots of the verbs
                    not exceeding six or seven. This simplicity depends in some measure on a
                    philosophical accuracy, which is carried systematically through the whole
                    language, so that the adjectives, participles, and article, are indeclinable,
                    being in their nature destitute of any idea of gender, case, or number; and the
                    form of generic distinction is [almost entirely] confined to objects which are
                    naturally entitled to it. The pronunciation, on the other hand, is extremely
                    intricate; and foreign proper names, in particular, are much mutilated whenever
                    they are adopted by the English.”</p>
                <p>12. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Celtic</hi> family forms a very extensive and very
                    interesting subdivision of the Indo-European class. It has been asserted by some
                    writers, “that the six original European languages, the Iberian, Celtic,
                    Germanic, Thracian, Sclavonian, and Finnish, were just as distinct at the
                    beginning of their history as they now are ;” but this assertion must be
                    subjected to considerable modification. The thing is in itself so improbable, as
                    to require far more evidence than we possess to establish it, even if that
                    evidence were of a more decisive nature; and, in fact, it will actually be
                    found, upon a comparison of the Gothic of Ulphila with the more modern dialects,
                    that the Germanic of that day did approach more nearly, both to the Celtic and
                    to the Thracian or Greek, than any of its more modern descendants do. The change
                    of <hi rend="smallcaps">tunthu</hi> into <hi rend="smallcaps">tooth,</hi> for
                    which the Germans have <hi rend="smallcaps">zahn,</hi> has already been noticed;
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">atta</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">himina</hi> of
                    Ulphila seem to be more like the Irish Atair and Neamh, than the modern ' ater
                    and Himmel are; and the Moeso-Gothic <hi rend="smallcaps">vair,</hi> which
                    answers to the Cimbric <hi rend="smallcaps">fear,</hi> a man, is not at present
                    found in German, though its traces may still be observed in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Firiobarno</hi> of the Franks in 1020; the antiquity of the root
                    is shown by the Celtic names in Caesar beginning so often with <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">ver,</hi> and still more strongly by the testimony of
                    Herodotus, that the Scythian called a man <hi rend="smallcaps">aior.</hi> At the
                    same time, therefore, that we admit the propriety of considering the Celtic and
                    Germanic as families clearly distinct, with respect to any period with which we
                    are historically acquainted, we must not forget that they exhibit undeniable
                    traces of having been more intimately connected with each other, and with their
                    neighbours, in the earlier stages of their existence. The resemblances of the
                    Celtic to the Latin are too numerous to require particular notice, the immediate
                    and extensive connection between these languages being universally admitted; but
                    if any evidence were desired on this subject, it might be obtained in abundance,
                    by a reference to Court de Gebelin’s <hi rend="italic">Monde Primitif.</hi> With
                    respect to the Greek, the terms <hi rend="italic">Hael,</hi> sun; <hi
                    rend="italic">Dur,</hi> water; <hi rend="italic">Deru,</hi> oak; <hi
                    rend="italic">Garan,</hi> crane; <hi rend="italic">Crunn,</hi> ice, are among
                    the Celtic words of the most indisputable originality; and their resemblance to
                    <hi rend="italic">Helios, Hudor, Drills, Geranos,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cruaen,</hi> is equally undeniable. We find, also, in the Cimbric, <hi
                    rend="italic">Bαs,</hi> low, connected with <hi rend="italic">Bathus, Bara,</hi>
                    bread, perhaps with <hi rend="italic">Bora,</hi> food; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Deyrnas,</hi> kingdom, with <hi rend="italic">Turannis</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    <hi rend="italic">Gau-riaon,</hi> exulting. With the German it is easy to find a
                    number of very near approaches to identity, even in that Celtic which can be
                    proved, principally from the etymologies of proper names, to be prior to the
                    date of any known or supposed secondary intercourse or mixture of the natives
                    concerned. Thus we have, either accurately or very nearly in the same

                <p>The Celts may be imagined to have emigrated from Asia after the Iberians or
                    Cantabrians, and before the Thracians or Pelasgians, settling principally in
                    Gaul, and spreading partly into Italy, under the name of Ausonians and Umbrians.
                    In 570 B. c. they undertook expeditions for the purposes of conquest, but they
                    were subdued by the Romans. Their language was current in Gaul till the sixth or
                    seventh century, when it was superseded by the rustic Roman, which by degrees
                    became French; in Ireland and Scotland it has remained with few alterations; in
                    Wales and Brittany it has been more mixed. The Gauls must have peopled Britain
                    at least as early as 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> The true ancient
                    Britons are the Highlanders of Scotland only, having been driven northwards by
                    the Cimbri: they still call their language Gaelic. The Irish are probably
                    derived from these Highlanders; they were originally termed Scots or Scuits,
                    that is, fugitives, from the circumstance of their expulsion from Britain; so
                    that, where the Scots are mentioned before the tenth century, as by Porphyry in
                    the third, we are to understand the Irish. Gildas, in 564, sometimes calls them
                    Scotch and sometimes Irish. After the retreat of the Romans from Britain, a part
                    of them re-entered Scotland about the year 503, and changed its name from
                    Caledonia to Scotia Minor. In 432 St Patrick laid the foundation of the
                    civilization of Ireland; and, in the seventh century, several Irish priests
                    undertook missions to the continent. At the beginning of this century, some
                    Scandinavian freebooters had begun to visit Ireland; and, in the year 835, they
                    formed large colonies of emigrants, who established themselves firmly in that
                    country, and in the Scottish islands, bringing with them many Gothic words,
                    which became afterwards mixed with the Celtic, and which seem to constitute
                    about one fifth part of the modern Irish and Gaelic, 140 Gothic words being
                    found under the first six letters of the alphabet only. Some of these Normen
                    remained distinct from the Irish till the year 1102. The oldest specimens of the
                    Irish language, admitted by the continental critics to be authentic, are of the
                    ninth century; though some of our antiquaries have imagined they have discovered
                    records of a much earlier date. The Gaelic of the Isle of Man, is mixed with
                    Norwegian, English, and Welsh. A Gaelic colony formerly <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193202536" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2536-0087"/>established at Walden, in
                    Essex, has been placed by Chamberlayne in Italy, as a nation of <hi
                    rend="italic">Waldenses.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cimbric</hi> or Celto-Germanic language was remarked by
                    Caesar as differing from the Gallic, although the distinction has not always
                    been sufficiently observed. The Cimbrians seem to have existed as a nation 500
                    or 600 years B. c.; the Gauls called them Belgae; the invaded Britain a little
                    before Caesar’s time, and drove the ancient inhabitants into the Highlands and
                    into Ireland. Having called the Saxons to their assistance against the Scots and
                    Picts in the fifth century, they were driven by their new allies into Wales,
                    Cornwall, anċĻBrittany. Their language is remarkable for the frequent changes of
                    the initial letters of its radical words in the formation of cases and numbers;
                    thus, from <hi rend="italic">Pen,</hi> a man, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Britannish,</hi> is derived the plural <hi rend="italic">Tud</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> from <hi rend="italic">Vreg,</hi> a woman, <hi
                    rend="italic">Groages.</hi> Almost half of the Welsh language seems to be
                    German, and half of the remainder is perhaps Latin or Celtic; of the Britannic,
                    about half resembles the Latin or French. Brittany was originally inhabited by
                    the Armoricans; whether they were properly Belgae or Gauls is uncertain. The
                    country was named Britannia Minor, from the emigration of the British in 449;
                    these new comers mixed with the original inhabitants, all speaking the same
                    language, and in a few years became so numerous, as to be able to send an army
                    of 12,000 men to the assistance of the Emperor Anthemius.</p>
                <p>Professor Adelung is disposed to consider the German portion of the different
                    branches of the Celtic, which varies from one fifth to one half of the whole
                    language, as an accidental mixture, and derived through different channels. But
                    we cannot in all cases find any historical evidence of the existence of these
                    channels; it is difficult, for example, to suppose that the Scandinavian
                    incursions were able at any early period to influence the language of the
                    Highlands of Scotland; and wherever it happens, as it frequently does, that no
                    term is to be found, in the Irish, the Gaelic, or the Welsh, for expressing the
                    same idea, besides the word that they all have in common with the German, it is
                    scarcely possible to believe that there ever was any other Celtic word, which
                    has been so uniformly superseded by independent causes. We find, for instance,
                    under the two first letters of the alphabet only, the words <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ap</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Apa</hi> in Irish, <hi rend="italic">Ap</hi> in
                    Welsh, <hi rend="italic">Affe</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ape</hi> in Gothic;
                    again, <hi rend="italic">Abal, Afal, Αpfil</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Angar, Aneang,</hi><hi rend="italic">Enge;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Email,</hi><hi rend="italic">Bach, Backen;</hi><hi rend="italic">Barr ad, Barr,
                    Bare; Beoir, Bir, Bier; Biail, Bwiall, Beil</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Bocan, Bwch, Bock</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Brathair, Brawd, Bruder</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">Bul,
                    Bwla,</hi><hi rend="italic">Bulle</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the same
                    agreement is found in almost all other instances of German words that are
                    detected in the Irish language.</p>
                <p>The much-disputed question respecting the antiquity of the poems attributed to
                    Ossian has an immediate reference to the history of the Celtic languages. It has
                    been observed, with apparent justice, by Professor Adelung, who is not in
                    general sceptical on such occasions, that if these poems were really very
                    ancient, their language could not but exhibit marks of antiquity. There is an
                    Irish <hi rend="italic">Leavre Lecan</hi> at Paris, written in the thirteenth
                    century, and scarcely intelligible to the best Irish scholars of the present
                    day; the oldest Gaelic manuscripts have also peculiar expressions no longer in
                    use; while the works supposed to be the productions of a period so much more
                    remote are found to be in “excellent modern Gaelic, impressed with all the marks
                    of the language of Christianity, and of that of the Norwegian invaders, whether
                    these conquerors may be supposed to have influenced the Gaelic language
                    immediately in Scotland, or by the intervention of Ireland.” It must not,
                    however, be forgotten, that these marks of Scandinavian intercourse are somewhat
                    more ambiguous than Professor Adelung is disposed to admit; and that a book
                    written in the thirteenth century is more likely to have preserved the language
                    in an antiquated form than poems so marvellously committed to memory from
                    continual recitation only, by people supposed to understand them, and of course
                    imperceptibly modifying the expressions without intending to alter them. But
                    since an invasion from Lochlin, that is, Denmark or Norway, is actually
                    mentioned in “Fingal,” the author of the poem could certainly not have been
                    older than the seventh or eighth century, if we are to credit the historical
                    accounts of these invasions; and since, in the poems discovered by Dr Matthew
                    Young, St Patrick is introduced discoursing with Ossian respecting the Christian
                    religion, we have an additional argument for denying that he was contemporary
                    with Caracalla or Carausius, these emperors having both lived in the third
                    century, and St Patrick in the fifth.</p>
                <p>14. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Etruscan</hi> is only known as the immediate parent
                    of the Latin; but it was written in a character totally different, and was read
                    from right to left. Notwithstanding the industry and ingenuity of Lanzi, the
                    evidence of the accuracy of his interpretations is somewhat imperfect. We should
                    naturally have expected to find more words of a Celtic or Gothic origin, and not
                    merely Greek or Latin words with the terminations a little varied, as <hi
                    rend="italic">Ustite</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Ustura, Tribo</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">Tribus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Urte</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Urta</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Heorte</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> still less
                    should we have expected that the same sense should be expressed sometimes by a
                    Greek and sometimes by a Latin word, as <hi rend="italic">lJrtu</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Puni</hi> for Bread, <hi rend="italic">Capros</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Feres</hi> for a Boar. The Etrurians and Umbrians were originally
                    a branch of the Celts from Rhaetia, as is shown by the similarity of the names
                    of places in those countries, as well as by the remains of Etruscan art found in
                    that part of the Tyrol; they are supposed to have entered Italy through Trent,
                    about the year 1000 B. c., and to have afterwards improved their taste and
                    workmanship under the auspices of Demaratus of Corinth, who settled in Etruria
                    about 660 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Etruria</hi>
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">Etruscans.)</hi></p>
                <p>15. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Latin</hi> language is placed at the head of a
                    family, rather with regard to the number of its descendants than to the
                    independence of its origin, being too evidently derived from the Celtic, mixed
                    with Greek, to require particular comparison. The first inhabitants of Italy
                    appear to have been Illyrians or Thracians, Cantabrians, Celts, Pelasgians, and
                    Etrurians. Rome, from its situation, would naturally acquire much of the
                    languages of these various nations, and at the same time much of the Greek from
                    the colonies in the south of Italy. In the time of Cicero, the Italian songs,
                    supposed to be about 500 years old, were no longer intelligible, even to those
                    who sang them. We find, in an inscription still more ancient, and approaching to
                    the time of Romulus, <hi rend="italic">Loses</hi> for <hi rend="italic"

                    modern Gaelic.</p>
                <p>The Latin remained in perfection but a few centuries. In the middle ages, a
                    number of barbarous words were added to it, principally of Celtic origin, which
                    are found in the glossaries of Dufresne and Charpentier. At the end of the
                    seventh century it began to acquire the character of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Italian,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">Campo</hi><hi rend="italic">divisum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">est;</hi> and, in the eighth century, in Spain, we find, as an
                    example of its incipient conversion into Spanish, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vendant</hi><hi rend="italic">sine pecho, de nostras terras.</hi> The formation
                    of the Italian language may be said to have been completed by Dante, in the
                    beginning of the fourteenth century; and it was still further polished by the
                    classical authors who immediately succeeded 1 m. It contains many German words,
                    derived from the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193202549"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-2549-0088"/>different nations who occupied in succession the
                    northern parts of Italy, and some Arabic, Norman, and Spanish, left by
                    occasional visitors in the south. It is spoken by the common people in very
                    different degrees of purity. Among the northern dialects, that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Friuli</hi> is mixed with French, and with some Sclavonian. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Sicilians,</hi> having been conquered in succession by the
                    Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Normans, Germans, French, and
                    Spaniards, have retained something of the language of each. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sardinia</hi> has given shelter to Iberians, Libyans, Tyrrhenes, Greeks,
                    Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, Goths, Lombards, Franks, Arabs,
                    Pisans, and Aragonians; and the proper Sardinian language is a mixture of Latin
                    with Greek, French, German, and Castilian. Corsica has also been occupied by a
                    similar diversity of nations; its peculiar idiom is little known, but the
                    dialect of the upper classes is said to approach nearly to the Tuscan.</p>
                <p>Spain, after its complete subjugation by the Romans, enjoyed some centuries of
                    tranquillity. The Vandals and Alans retained their power in Spain but for a
                    short time; the Suevi, on the north coast, somewhat longer; and from these
                    nations the rustic Roman, which had become general in Spain, received some words
                    of German origin. It derived, however, much more from the Arabic during the
                    domination of the Moors, which lasted from the beginning of the eighth century
                    to the end <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the fifteenth; and, at one time, the Arabic
                    was almost universally employed throughout the country, except in the churches.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Spanish</hi> language advanced the most rapidly toward
                    perfection during the height of the national prosperity, which immediately
                    followed the conquest of America. It was afterwards neglected, and again more
                    particularly cultivated by the Academy of Madrid, in the eighteenth century; as
                    far at least as an academy can be supposed to have any influence in the
                    modifications of a language.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Portuguese</hi> is supposed to have received a mixture of
                    French from the followers of Count Henry of Burgundy, under whom Portugal first
                    formed a separate state in 1109; but the language is very different from that of
                    the confines of France and Spain; and the nasal vowels, which are remarkable in
                    the Portuguese, differ materially from those of the French, or of any other
                    nation. Many Latin words are retained in the Portuguese which are not found in
                    any other modern language; and it is remarkable that almost all the words of the
                    language are contracted, by the omission of some of the radical letters of the
                    originals.</p>
                <p>The Rhaetians, in the country of the Grisons, were subdued by the Romans in the
                    time of Augustus. They became part of the Alemannish kingdom, under Theodobert,
                    in 539; their union with Switzerland took place in the beginning of the
                    fourteenth century. Half of the Grisons speak the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Romanish</hi> language, immediately derived from the Latin, though mixed with
                    some German, which has been particularly made known by Mr Planta’s account of it
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions.</hi> One third speak
                    German, with some mixture of Romanish words, and the rest a bad Italian.</p>
                <p>France, in the time of the Romans, was occupied by the Gauls, together with the
                    Aquitanians, who were probably Cantabrians, and the Cimbrians or Belgians. From
                    the rustic Roman, mixed with the languages of these nations, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Romance</hi> was gradually formed. In the fifth century, the
                    Franks took possession of the north-eastern part of the country. They retained
                    their language for some centuries, but by degrees it became mixed with the
                    Romance, and formed <hi rend="italic">French,</hi> of which at least one fifth
                    is supposed to be of German origin, though many of the German words seem to have
                    been admitted through the medium of the Italian. In the south of France, the
                    language remained more exempt from the influence of the German, under the name
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Provençal;</hi> and the troubadours contributed,
                    especially from the eleventh to the thirteenth century, to give it refinement
                    and currency; but, in later times, the <hi rend="italic">Langue d’oui</hi> has
                    prevailed over the <hi rend="italic">Langue d’oc,</hi> which is now spoken by a
                    few of the lowest class only.</p>
                <p>The last and least genuine of the descendants of the Latin is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Wallachian,</hi> about one half of which is borrowed from the
                    German, Sclavonian, and Turkish. The original Thracians of the country must have
                    been in a great measure superseded by the successive settlements of various
                    nations; in the third century, some of the Goths and Vandals; in the fourth, the
                    Jazyges, after Attila’s death; in the fifth, some Huns and Alans; about the end
                    of the seventh, the Bulgarians, and afterwards the Petschenegers and Hungarians,
                    established themselves in it; and, in the thirteenth century, Wallachia became
                    an independent state. The Latin part of this language has much of the Italian
                    form, and had even assumed it as early as the fifth century. It must have been
                    derived from Roman colonies, and more lately, perhaps, from the missionaries
                    sent into the country by Pope Gregory XI. The <hi rend="italic">Dacian</hi> or
                    Hungarian dialect prevails on the north of the Danube; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thracian,</hi> or Cutzo-Wallachian, on the south; the latter is more mixed with
                    Greek and Albanian. There is also a small Wallachian colony in Transylvania.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cantabrian</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Biscayan</hi> has many
                    words in common with the Latin, whether originally or by adoption, and was
                    probably in some measure connected with the Celtic dialects, which were the
                    immediate predecessors of the Latin, though still sufficiently distinct from
                    them. The Cantabrian <hi rend="smallcaps">√4z7ω,</hi> Father, has some
                    resemblance to the Irish <hi rend="italic">At'air,</hi> and the Moeso Gothic <hi
                    rend="italic">Atta</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">Gern</hi> is
                    not wholly unlike <hi rend="italic">Coelum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ereenjaa, Regnum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Borοndatia, Voluntas</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the coincidence
                    of <hi rend="italic">Gun,</hi> Day, with the Tartarian, is perhaps more
                    accidental. But the word <hi rend="italic">Lurre,</hi> Earth, which seems at
                    first sight so unlike any other language, is in all probability the derivative
                    of <hi rend="italic">Tellure;</hi> and this form of the word affords also a
                    connecting link with the Irish <hi rend="italic">Talu,</hi> and may have been
                    contracted into the more common Latin word <hi rend="italic">Terra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> a supposition which seems to lessen the probability of the
                    original connection of this form of the word with the Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >Era,</hi> and the Sanscrit <hi rend="italic">Stira.</hi> The Biscayan is still
                    spoken in the angles of France and Spain adjoining to the northern extremity of
                    the Pyrenees. The same people were called Cantabrians in the north, and Iberians
                    in the south, and extended between the Pyrenees and the Rhine, as Ligurians, or
                    inhabitants of the coast. They have adopted a few German words, perhaps from the
                    empire of the west Goths; and they have furnished the modern Spanish with more
                    than a hundred original words of their own. The construction of the language is
                    extremely intricate; its verbs have eleven moods, among which are a
                    consuetudinary, a voluntary, a compulsory, and a penitudinary. Larramendi’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Grammar,</hi> published at Salamanca in 1729, is called <hi
                    rend="italic">El Impossible Vencido.</hi> A valuable abstract of the most
                    interesting particulars relating to the language is found in the Additions to
                    the Mithridates, by the Baron William von Humboldt, late Prussian ambassador to
                    the court of Great Britain, printed at Berlin 1816. Dr Young has lately
                    remarked, in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1819,
                    that at least six of the words contained in Humboldt’s vocabulary coincide very
                    accurately with the Coptic, or ancient Egyptian, though they are not found in
                    any of the languages of the neighbouring countries; and he infers that the
                    chances are “more than a thousand to one, that, at some very remote period, an
                    Egyptian colony established itself in Spain.” It may be observed, that one of
                    these words, <hi rend="italic">guchi,</hi> little, appears to be also Turkish or
                    Tartarian; so that it becomes a se <pb break="no" facs="nls:193202562"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-2562-0089"/>cond instance of a coincidence between this
                    language and the Cantabrian.</p>
                <p>16. The connection of the Sclavonian and Lithuanian, and of the other branches
                    constituting the <hi rend="smallcaps">Slavic</hi> family, with the languages of
                    the Indo-European class in general, is sufficiently established, without
                    exceeding the limits of the Lord’s Prayer, by the resemblance of <hi
                    rend="italic">Nebi</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Nebesi</hi> to the Cimbric <hi
                    rend="italic">Nefoedd,</hi> and the Greek <hi rend="italic">Nephos,</hi> and of
                    <hi rend="italic">Wolja</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chljeb</hi> to the Gothic <hi
                    rend="italic">Wilja</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hlaif.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sclavonians</hi> are the descendants of the ancient Sarmatians, who were
                    situated north of the Black Sea and of the Danube. They were conquered by the
                    Goths, and then driven by the Tartars and Huns into the north-east of Germany,
                    and the neighbouring countries. Procopius calls them Spori, and divides them
                    into the Sclavi and Antes, the latter, perhaps, the same as the Wends. They
                    formed, at an early period, two principal states, Great Russia, about Novogorod,
                    and Little Russia, on the Dnieper, its capital being Kiew. The Russi were a
                    Scandinavian branch, under Rurik, to whom the Sclavonians of the former state
                    submitted in 862, whence they were called Russians; and Rurik’s successor, Oleg,
                    conquered Kiew. After several vicissitudes, the Russians were liberated by Iwan
                    Wasiliewitch, at the end of the fifteenth century; and this period was the
                    beginning of their greatness. Their language has some mixture of Greek, Finnish,
                    Swedish, Tartarian, and Mongol. The ecclesiastical dialect was uniformly
                    retained in all literary works in the former part of the last century, but now
                    the language of conversation is generally adopted in writing. This language is
                    more immediately derived from that of Great Russia; that of the church, which is
                    called the Slawen-ish, rather from Little Russia, and especially from the
                    dialect of Servia. The <hi rend="italic">Malo-Russian</hi> dialect is somewhat
                    mixed with the Polish, and is spoken in Ukraine and Little Russia; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Susdalian</hi> is mixed with Greek and other languages, and is
                    spoken in Thrace.</p>
                <p>In 640, the Sclavonians took possession of Illyria, which before that time had
                    been overrun by a variety of other nations; and they still retain it, under the
                    names of Servians, Croatians, and Southern Wends. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Servians</hi> are supposed to have come from Great Servia, now East Gallicia,
                    on the Upper Vistula; the <hi rend="italic">Croatians</hi> from Great
                    Chro-batia, probably situated on the Carpathian Mountains. Cyril first adapted
                    the Greek alphabet to the Sclavonian language in Pannonia; his letters were
                    afterwards a little altered, and attributed to St Jerome, in order to reconcile
                    the people to their use; and in this form they are termed Glagolitic characters.
                    The Servian dialect is intermediate between the Russian and the Croatian. The
                    Bulgarians speak a corrupt Sclavonian, which Boscovich, from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ragusa,</hi> could scarcely understand. The <hi rend="italic">Uskohs</hi> are a
                    wild race of the Bulgarians, extending into Carniola, and speaking a mixed
                    language. The dialect of Sclavonia and Dalmatia is nearly the same as that of
                    Servia and Bosnia; the churches use the ecclesiastical language of Russia. In
                    Ragusa, the orthography approaches, in some measure, to the Italian. The Servian
                    is also imperfectly spoken by a small colony in Transylvania. The Southern <hi
                    rend="italic">Wends</hi> were first distinguished in 630, and were probably so
                    named, like the Veneti, from being settled on the shores of rhe Adriatic, the
                    word <hi rend="italic">Wend</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Wand</hi> meaning Sea.
                    They are now mixed with Germans in Carniola, Carinthia, and Lower Stiria. In
                    Hungary there is a small colony, who call themselves Slowens, and speak /the <hi
                    rend="italic">Wendish</hi> dialect of the <hi rend="italic">Sclavonian.</hi> The
                    western Slavonians, or the proper Sclavi, write their language in the Roman
                    characters; but the specimens copied from Adelung are accommodated in their
                    orthography to the German mode of pronunciation.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Poles</hi> probably came with the Russians from the</p>
                <p>Danube into the countries abandoned by the Goths; the name Pole implies an
                    inhabitant of plains. Their language was partly superseded by the Latin in the
                    tenth century, when they received the rites of the Latin church; but it has in
                    later times been more cultivated. The Cas-subians, or Kashubians, in Pomerania,
                    speak a Polish mixed with a little German. In Silesia, the names of places in
                    the plains are Sclavonian; in the hills, more lately occupied, German; but
                    German has been the language of Breslau ever since the year 1300.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Bohemians</hi> emigrated with the Moravians and Slowake
                    into their present habitations about the middle of the sixth century, after the
                    destruction of the kingdom of Thuringia by the Franks and Saxons. There is a
                    Bohemian hymn of the date 990, and a chronicle in rhyme of 1310. One third of
                    the Bohemians are of German origin, and speak a corrupt German.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Serbs</hi> or Wends came about the same time into the
                    countries between the Saal and the Oder, from the neighbourhood of the Volga or
                    the Crimea; a few of them are still left in <hi rend="italic">Lusatia,</hi>
                    under the name of Wends or Sclavonians, and some in Misnia. In Pomerania the
                    Wendish became extinct about 1400: but the <hi rend="italic">Polabes</hi> in
                    Lüneburg, on the Leyne, kept up till lately a language consisting of a mixture
                    of Wendish and German. The <hi rend="italic">Sora∙ bic</hi> of the Russian
                    vocabulary seems to be the same with this Serbian.</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">Lithuanian</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Lettish</hi>
                    language, two thirds are Sclavonian, the rest is principally German. When the
                    Goths had removed from the Baltic towards the Black Sea, their neighbours the
                    Aestii remained for some hundred years independent, till, in the sixth century,
                    the Sclavonians incorporated themselves with them, and formed the Lettish people
                    and language. The <hi rend="italic">Old Prussian</hi> was spoken, at the time of
                    the Reformation, in Samland and its neighbourhood, but it is now lost; it
                    contained more German than the other Lithuanian dialects. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prussian Lithuanian</hi> is spoken from the Inster to Memel, especially in
                    Insterburg. The <hi rend="italic">Polish Lithuanian,</hi> in Samogitia, has a
                    little mixture of Polish. The proper <hi rend="italic">Lettish</hi> is current
                    in Lettland and Courland; it is purest about Mittau and Riga; the old
                    Courlanders having been Fins, this dialect has received a little Finnish from
                    them. The <hi rend="italic">Crivingian</hi> is another dialect, spoken by the
                    Krewins in Courland.</p>
                <p>17. The Tshudish or Finnish, the Hungarian, and the Albanian languages, have some
                    traits of resemblance to each other; they are placed as forming the <hi
                    rend="italic">sporadic</hi> or scattered order of the great <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tatarie</hi> or Asiatic class, being in some measure geographically detached
                    from the rest, and scattered through different parts of Europe; they immediately
                    follow the Indo-European class, as exhibiting an occasional resemblance to some
                    of the languages contained in it, though not enough to make it certain that the
                    connection is essential or original. Thus the Finnish is said to have some
                    coincidences with the Greek, the Laplandish with the Hebrew, the Hungarian with
                    the Finnish, and the Albanian with all its neighbours.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">Tshudish</hi> is employed as comprehending the Fins,
                    Laplanders, Esthonians, and Livonians; a race of people of unknown origin, but
                    in all probability unconnected with the Huns or Mongols. Their languages are
                    remarkable for the great complexity of their structure; their nouns, for
                    example, having from ten to fifteen cases, among which are reckoned, in the
                    Finnish, a nuncupative, a conditional accusative, a factitive, a mediative, a
                    descriptive, a penetrative, a locative, a privative, and a negative. The
                    Esthonian has less direct variety of termination, but several intricate
                    combinations. There is also a great mùltiplicity of dialects, partly from a
                    mixture of Scandinavian, and partly from other causes; in Lapland, al <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193202575" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2575-0090"/> most every church
                    has a peculiar version of the service kept for its use. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Finnish</hi> is intermediate between the <hi rend="italic">Laplandish</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Esthonian.</hi> The Esthonians are the Aestii of the
                    Romans, the name implying Easterly, and being appropriate to the country, and
                    not to the people. The principal dialects of their language are those of Reval
                    and of Dorpat; some authors also consider the dialect of the Krewins in Courland
                    as belonging to it. The <hi rend="italic">Livonian</hi> is much mixed with other
                    languages, and has been almost superseded by the Lettish. Amongst the Laplandish
                    words which Rudbeck has derived from the Hebrew, we find <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aedhame,</hi> Earth, like the Hebrew <hi rend="italic">Ada-meh</hi><hi

                <p>18. The <hi rend="italic">Hungarians</hi> inhabited, in the fourth century, the
                    country of the Bashkirs, between'the Tobol, the Volga, and the Jaik, perhaps as
                    colonists, since their name signifies strangers. Their language was spoken in
                    this neighbourhood as late as the thirteenth century; in the sixth they were
                    conquered by some of their Turkish neighbours; in the end of the ninth they were
                    forced by the Petschenegers, a Tartarian nation, to remove nearer to the
                    Carpathian Mountains. They were then engaged in the German wars, and their
                    country having been occupied during their absence by the Bulgarians, they took
                    possession of the Bulgarian kingdom on the Theiss, as well as of Pannonia. Their
                    language is somewhat like the Finnish, but the people are very different from
                    the Fins in appearance; which might indeed be the effect of a difference of
                    climate; but, in fact, the language appears to be still more like the
                    Sclavonian, with a mixture of a multitude of others; it has some words from
                    various Tartarian dialects, German, French, Latin, Armenian, Hebrew, Persian,
                    and Arabic; but it has no traces of the Mongol, nor is it possible that the
                    people can be descendants of the Huns, whose character and cast of features can
                    never be eradicated. The word <hi rend="italic">Coach,</hi> so general in
                    Europe, is originally Hungarian, having been derived from the town of <hi
                    rend="italic">Kots,</hi> where coaches are said to have been invented. The
                    Szecklers, in Transylvania, speak a language like the Hungarian; it is uncertain
                    whether they are a Hungarian colony, or remains of the Petschenegers; but,
                    however this may be, there is little doubt that the Hungarians are principally
                    of Tartarian extraction, though much mixed with other nations.</p>
                <p>19. The <hi rend="italic">Albanians</hi> speak a language, of which a
                    considerable portion is Greek, Latin, German, Sclavonian, or Turkish; but the
                    rest seems to be perfectly, distinct from any other language with which we are
                    acquainted. They are probably connected with the Albanians between Mount
                    Caucasus and the river Cyrus, who are supposed to be derived from the Alani;
                    some of them seem to have entered Bulgaria as late as 1308. In 1461, many of
                    them fled from the Turks to <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sicily,</hi> where they still exist near Reggio and Messina. The Clementines
                    are an Albanian colony, who followed the Austrian army in 1737; such of them as
                    escaped from the pursuit of the Turks established themselves in Syrmia.</p>
                <p>20. The languages referred to the <hi rend="italic">Caucasian</hi> order have
                    little to distinguish them from the resUof the class, except their geographical
                    situation, in the immediate neighbourhood of the Caucasian Mountains. They have
                    a general resemblance to some others of the languages of Northern Asia, and
                    particularly to the Samojedic dialects, spoken on the mountains between Siberia
                    and the Mongols. Except the Armenian and Georgian, they are scarcely ever
                    employed in writing; and principally, perhaps, from this cause, they exhibit as
                    great a diversity, in the space of a few square miles, as those of many other
                    nations do in as many thousands. It is only conjectured that most of the
                    inhabitants of these countries are derived from the miscellaneous fragments of
                    expeditions of various nations, left behind in their passage through them at
                    different periods.</p>
                <p>The connection of the <hi rend="italic">Armenian</hi> with the Sanscrit and the
                    Persian, is just enough to make it equally possible that the coincidences may
                    have been derived from a common parent, or that one language may have simply
                    borrowed detached words from the other. We find, in different parts of Mr
                    Townsend’s work, about ten Armenian words resembling some other language; these
                    are, <hi rend="italic">Air,</hi> a man, <hi rend="italic">Air,</hi> Irish; <hi
                    rend="italic">Atamn,</hi> a tooth, <hi rend="italic">Odonta,</hi> Greek; <hi
                    rend="italic">Chuerh,</hi> four, <hi rend="italic">Cha-tur,</hi> Sanscrit; <hi
                    rend="italic">Dor,</hi> a door; <hi rend="italic">Ε,</hi> is, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Est,</hi> Latin; <hi rend="italic">Es,</hi> I, <hi rend="italic">laze,</hi>
                    Russian; <hi rend="italic">Gas,</hi> a goose, <hi rend="italic">Gans,</hi>
                    German; <hi rend="italic">Houze,</hi> a house; <hi rend="italic">Lakeil,</hi> to
                    lick, <hi rend="italic">Leicliciìi,</hi> Greek; and <hi rend="italic">Sirt,</hi>
                    the heart. Nothing is known of the history of the Armenian before the time of
                    Miesrob, who translated the Bible into it, in 405; the historian Moses, of
                    Chorene, was his pupil. The language flourished till the year 800, and is still
                    preserved in tolerable purity in the cloisters. The common people speak a
                    dialect more corrupt and mixed. The fathers of the Armenian convent at Venice
                    have been very laudably employed in the improvement of the literature of their
                    nation, by the publication of several very elegant editions of Armenian books,
                    which have been executed at their press; in particular, of an Armenian
                    translation of Eusebius, containing some passages which are not extant in Greek,
                    and said to have been copied from a manuscript of great antiquity at
                    Constantinople. It is, however, very remarkable, that, as they candidly confess,
                    the copy, when first received by them, contained the corrections and additions
                    of Scaliger, in conformity with the text of the printed Greek edition; and the
                    copyist, when questioned, asserted that he had merely translated and inserted
                    passages of his own accord, and in silence, in order to make the work more
                    perfect. Still the Armenian Eusebius is a very handsome book, and every way
                    calculated to do credit to the Venetian editors and their patrons; a Latin
                    translation of it only has been published by Angelo Mai at Milan.</p>
                <p>21. The <hi rend="italic">Georgians</hi> are supposed to have derived their name
                    from the river Cyrus or Gur, and to have extended formerly to Colchis, under the
                    denomination of Iberians. Moses of Chorene, in the fifth century, mentions the
                    Georgian translation of the Bible. The old language is still preserved in the
                    churches, and the common dialect of the country is derived from it, together
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Kartuclislι, Imirettish, Mingrelish,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Suanetish,</hi> which are varieties of that dialect; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tushetish</hi> is mixed with some Kistic. The Georgians have no
                    fewer than thirty-seven letters, and among them a variety of aspirates and
                    sibilants, of no very agreeable sounds.</p>
                <p>22. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Abassic</hi> nations seem to be the oldest
                    inhabitants of the Caucasian country. 23. The <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Circassians</hi> are situated to the east of them, on the promontory of North
                    Caucasus. 24. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Ossetes,</hi> on the left of the Terek,
                    north of the mountain; the dialect of the <hi rend="italic">Dugors</hi> is
                    scarcely distinguishable from this. 25. The Kisuc, spoken by the <hi
                    rend="italic">In-gushans,</hi> and their neighbours at the head of the Terek, is
                    connected with the Tushctic Georgian. 26. The <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Lesgians,</hi> east of Caucasus, on the Caspian Sea, have a number of distinct
                    dialects, or rather languages. Thus, the <hi rend="italic">Chunsag</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Avarie,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Dido,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kasi Kumuk,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Andi,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ahushan,</hi> have little connection with each other, except that
                    the Dido somewhat resembles the Chunsag, of which the Avarie, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Antsug,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Dzhar,</hi> seem to be
                    subordinate dialects. The Kasi Kunifik appears to have adopted some words of the
                    Armenian, and the Andi and Akushan<pb break="no" facs="nls:193202588"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-2588-0091"/> of the Georgian. The dialect of Kubesha resembles
                    that of Akusha, and retains no traces of a supposed European origin.</p>
                <p>27. The languages of the central and elevated parts of Asia are comprehended in
                    the order <hi rend="italic">Tartarian</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> they extend
                    from the Caspian Sea to the mouth of the Amur, through countries which have
                    been, in former ages, the constant scenes of emigration and barbarism. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Turco-Tartarians</hi> are supposed to correspond to the
                    descendants of the Magog of the Scriptures, and to some of the Scythians of the
                    Greeks. The Turks of Turkestan seem to have been the Massagetae and Chorasmii of
                    the ancients; their country extended north of Persia and Thibet, from the
                    Caspian to the Altaic Mountains. In the twelfth century they wrae brilliant and
                    victorious; at present, a few of their descendants only are left in the
                    neighbourhood of the Mongols, and their language is no longer spoken; the
                    Turcomans scattered in Persia and Arabia are derived from the same race. The
                    Osmans, now commonly called Turks, left Turkestan in 545, and succeeded in the
                    conquest of Persia. They were denominated Osmans, from one of their leaders, in
                    the fourteenth century. Their language has been much mixed with Arabic and
                    Persian. This language, with the neighbouring dialects, has been considered in
                    the table as belonging to a family called <hi rend="italic">Caspian,</hi> the
                    word Tartarian having been previously applied to the whole order. Several of
                    these dialects exhibit a mixture of words from the language of the Mongols,
                    which, as well as the Calmuck, has a sufficient connection with them to be
                    arranged as belonging to the same Turco-Tartarian family. It would, perhaps, be
                    equally correct to consider some of them rather as distinct languages than as
                    dialects of a single one; but it is not easy to discriminate those which are
                    entitled to this rank; and, on the other hand, some specimens have been
                    admitted, from the Comparative Vocabularies, which scarcely deserved to be
                    noticed as separate dialects. The <hi rend="italic">Bucharians</hi> are situated
                    between the Oxus and Jaxartes, on the river Koly. They still retain some traces
                    of a superior degree of civilization, by which they were once distinguished.
                    Their language is little known, but it seems to be at least as much connected
                    with the Median and Arabian families as with the Caspian. The Tartars were
                    described by the terms Scythians, Bulgarians, Avari, and other appellations,
                    before they were conquered and united by Genghiz Khan the Mongol. In the year
                    1552 they became subject to the Russians. The most westerly are the Nogaic or
                    Nagaic and Crimean Tartars; their language is much like the Turkish, but mixed
                    with some Mongol. Those of Cumania in Hungary have now forgotten their original
                    language, and speak the Hungarian, the last person who understood the Cumanian
                    hav <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> ing died in 1770. They entered Hungary in 1086,
                    and became Christians in 1410. The Tartarian, or rather Caspian, is spoken in
                    great purity aboutKasan; a dialect somewhat different in Orenburg; and another
                    by the <hi rend="italic">Kirgishes,</hi> who occupy part of the ancient
                    Turkestan. “Among the Siberian Tartars, the remains of the kingdom of Turan,
                    some are Mahometans; others, as the Turalinzic villagers, have been made
                    Christians; at least the Archbishop Phi-lophei performed the ceremony of
                    baptizing them, by ordering his dragoons to drive them in a body into the
                    river.” The inhabitants of the banks of the <hi rend="italic">Tara,</hi> a
                    branch of the Irtish, are said to be derived from the Bucharians. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Tshulimic</hi> Tartars enjoy the same advantage as the Turalinzic,
                    and are considered as Christians by the Russians. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Teleutes,</hi> in Sonjor, are heathens, nearly like the Shamanites of India.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Jakuts</hi> extend along the Lena to the sea; their
                    language contains some Mantshuric and some Tungusic. That of the Tshuwashes, on
                    the Volga, is said to have been once completely distinct from the Tartarian or
                    Caspian; and even at present, though more mixed with it, may require to be
                    classed as forming a separate species.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Mongols</hi> are marked by their features as a race very
                    different from the other Tartars; the character of their countenance seems to be
                    easily propagated from father to son, and never to be completely effaced; their
                    original habitation appears to have been in the neighbourhood of the Altaic
                    Mountains. The description of the Huns, found in Ammianus, Procopius, and
                    others, agrees exactly with the present Mongols, whom the Chinese still call <hi
                    rend="italic">Kiong nu</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and more particularly with
                    the Calmucks. The proper names of the Huns are also found to be explicable from
                    the Mongol language. In the first century they were driven westwards by the
                    Chinese: under Attila they penetrated into the middle of Europe; and they were
                    little less successful at subsequent periods, under Genghiz Khan and Timur Leng.
                    When they were expelled from China, after having held it in subjection for more
                    than a century, they carried back no civilization with them; nor was either of
                    the languages permanently affected by this temporary mixture of the nations,
                    although the physiognomy of the Chinese bears ample testimony of its having once
                    existed. The construction of their language seems to be very indirect and
                    figurative. Mr Townsend has copied from General Val-lancy a long list of words,
                    in Strahlenberg’s <hi rend="italic">Mongol Vocabulary,</hi> which agree very
                    remarkably with the Irish; among these we find <hi rend="italic">Are</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Ere,</hi> man, Irish <hi rend="italic">Ar, Air, Fear</hi><hi

                    >Baichu,</hi> I live long, Irish <hi rend="italic">Booth,</hi> long life; <hi

                    rend="italic">Caorog</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> without going any further in
                    the alphabet. The last two instances are very striking, and seem to point very
                    strongly at that part of the east from which the Ceits may be supposed to have
                    originally emigrated. The <hi rend="italic">Calmuck</hi> dialect is somewhat
                    mixed with the neighbouring Tartarian. The Tagurians, or Daurians, between the
                    lake Baikal and the Mongol Hills, are said to be of Mantshuric origin: but their
                    language evidently resembles the Calmuck. The <hi rend="italic">Burattish</hi>
                    is from the Russian Vocabularies.</p>
                <p>28. The <hi rend="italic">Mantshurians</hi> are sometimes improperly called
                    Eastern Mongols; they are subjects of the empire of China. Their language is
                    rude, and not much like the Chinese, though evidently derived from the
                    monosyllabic class. It has some few words in common with the European languages,
                    <hi rend="italic">as Kiri,</hi> patient, <hi rend="italic">Kirre,</hi> German,
                    <hi rend="italic">Cicur,</hi> Latin, tame; <hi rend="italic">Furu, Furor</hi><hi

                    >Sanguis; Ania,</hi> a year, <hi rend="italic">Annus</hi>; but, considering the
                    remoteness of their situation, we can scarcely form any conclusion from the
                    occurrence of these resemblances. Μ. Abel Rémusat held the appointment of
                    professor of this language at Paris; but it was found difficult for him to
                    render its study very popular in the midst of so busy a metropolis. Whether the
                    language of the island of <hi rend="italic">Sagalien,</hi> opposite to the mouth
                    of the Amur, is a dialect of the Mantshuric, or totally distinct, and requiring
                    to be classed with the insular languages, appears to be not yet sufficiently
                    ascertained. The <hi rend="italic">Corean</hi> has been supposed to be a mixture
                    of Mantshuric and Chinese: the Coreans do not understand either of those
                    languages when they are spoken, but this fact is perfectly compatible with the
                    supposition.</p>
                <p>29. The <hi rend="italic">Tungusians,</hi> in the east of Siberia, subject to the
                    Chinese, speak a peculiar language, mixed with some Mongol. The Russian
                    vocabularies contain specimens of a variety of their dialects, besides those of
                    the Tshapogirs on the Jenisei, and the Lamuti on the Sea of Ochotsk, none <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> them particularly interesting or remarkable.</p>
                <p>30. The languages belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Siberian</hi> order occupy
                    the principal part of the north of Asia, between the mountainous Tartarian
                    territory and the Frozen Sea. At the commencement of this order, we find a
                    variety of in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193202601" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2601-0092"
                    />considerable nations in the neighbourhood of the confines of Europe and Asia,
                    which have their distinct languages, probably formed, in times comparatively
                    modern, out of the fragments of others. They have almost all of them some
                    Finnish words, but none a sufficient number to justify us in considering them as
                    dialects of the Finnish language, although the people were very probably
                    connected with the Fins as neighbours, in the middle ages, on the banks of the
                    Dwina and elsewhere. The <hi rend="italic">Sirjanes,</hi> in the government of
                    Archangel, speak nearly the same language with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Permians,</hi> who are partly in the same government, and partly in that of
                    Kasan. The <hi rend="italic">Wotiaks,</hi> on the Wiatka, also in Kasan, have a
                    dialect which seems to be intermediate between the Permian and the Tsheremissic.
                    31. The <hi rend="italic">Woguls,</hi> situated on the Kama and the Irtish,
                    afford specimens of several dialects in the Russian collection; they seem to
                    have borrowed a few words from the Hungarian, and much more from the language of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ostiaks</hi> (32), who are also divided into several
                    races. 33. The <hi rend="italic">Tskere-misses,</hi> situated on the Volga, in
                    Kasan, have a little mixture of Turco-Tartarian. 34. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Morduins,</hi> on the Oka and Volga, have about one eighth of their language
                    Finnish, and also some Turco-Tartarian words. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Moktanic</hi> is a dialect differing but slightly from the Morduin. 35. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Teptjerai</hi> are people paying no taxes, who originated from the
                    relics of the Tartaro-Kasanic kingdom in the sixteenth century, and who are said
                    to speak a language peculiar to themselves. The arrangement of all these
                    dialects must remain very imperfect, for want of a greater number of specimens
                    of their peculiarities.</p>
                <p>36. The <hi rend="italic">Samojedic</hi> nations are situated north of the
                    Tartars, by whom they may possibly have been driven into their present
                    habitations. Their languages seem to have some affinity with the Caucasian and
                    Lesgian dialects, and some of them with the Wogulic and Ostiak families; the
                    specimens in the Comparative Vocabularies seem to have been multiplied somewhat
                    too liberally. 37. The <hi rend="italic">Camashes</hi> are situated on the right
                    of the Jenisei; they are Shamanites or Buddists; their language seems to be a
                    mixture of several others, and is divided into several very distinct dialects.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Koibals</hi> have been baptized; they have borrowed some
                    words from the Turco-Tartarian family. The <hi rend="italic">Motors</hi> are
                    situated on the Tuba. 38. The Ostiaks on the river Jenisei afford us five
                    specimens of languages totally different from those of the Ostiaks already
                    mentioned, but nearly connected with each other, so that they may properly be
                    called <hi rend="italic">Jenisei-Ostiaks.</hi> 39. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jukagirs,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ju-kadshirs,</hi> are few in number; they
                    arc situated between the Jakuti and the Tshutshi; they have some Jakutish words
                    mixed with their language, and some Tsheremissic. 40. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Koriaks</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Tshutshi</hi> occupy the
                    north-easternmost point of Siberia; the proper Koriak is spoken on the bay of
                    Penshin; the <hi rend="italic">Kolymic</hi> on the river Kolyma, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tigilicοη</hi> the Tigil in Kamtschatka, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Karaginic</hi> on the island Karaga; the Tshutshic has been considered as a
                    dialect of the Koriak. 4L The <hi rend="italic">Karntschatkans</hi> are a little
                    further south; the <hi rend="italic">Tigilic Kamtschatkan</hi> is found,
                    however, on the north of the Tigil; the <hi rend="italic">Srednish</hi> to the
                    west, on the Bolshaia, and the <hi rend="italic">Jozhnyshic</hi> on the river
                    Kamtschatka, and towards the South Cape. The languages of the neighbouring parts
                    of America, according to Professor Vater, greatly resemble the Tshutshic.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Insular</hi> order of the Tatarie or Atactic class of
                    languages must be understood as comprehending all the Asiatic islands east of
                    Borneo. 42. The language of the <hi rend="italic">Curi-lees</hi> is spoken not
                    only in the principal of these islands, but also in Kamtschatka, about Cape
                    Lopatka; but in some of the islands the Japanese is spoken. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Japanese</hi> derive themselves from the Chinese, but their
                    language contradicts this opinion; they have evident traces of Mongol extraction
                    or relationship. The amiable islanders of <hi rend="italic">Looehoo</hi> will
                    long be remembered by the British public, for the hospitality they showed to the
                    Alceste and the Lyra; their language appears to be related to the Japanese, as
                    might be expected from their situation. <hi rend="italic">Formosa</hi> was
                    conquered by the Dutch in 1620, but in 1661 it was taken from them by a Chinese
                    pirate: the next year some books were printed in the Formosan language in
                    Holland, the recapture of the island not being yet known there; in 1682, it was
                    finally given up to the Chinese government. 47. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Moluccan</hi> is considered by Dr Leyden as an original language; that of
                    Magindanao contains some Malayan, Moluccan, Tagalish, and Bugis. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Tαgalish,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Gala,</hi> is the principal
                    language of the <hi rend="italic">Philippines,</hi> and almost as generally
                    understood in that neighbourhood as the Malay and Hindustance in other parts; it
                    is allied to the Malayan and to the Javanese, and was probably derived in great
                    measure from these languages; it also resembles in some measure the Bugis. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Bissayish</hi> is a ruder dialect of the Tagalish. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Sulu</hi> differs but little from these dialects, being derived
                    from the same sources. The <hi rend="italic">Bugis</hi> is the language of
                    Celebes; it is supposed to be more ancient than the Javanese; it seems to
                    contain no Sanscrit, but much Malay, Tagalish, and Javanese, and some of the old
                    Ternate, or Mohiccan; it is written in a peculiar character, and some good
                    poetry is found in it. There is a dialect called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mungharar.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Birna</hi> somewhat resembles this
                    dialect; it is spoken in the eastern parts of Sumbawa, and the western of Endé
                    or Flores; it is written either in the Bugis or the Malay character; it seems to
                    have a distant resemblance to the language of Orissa. The dialect of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sumbawa</hi> exhibits some slight variations. A few single words,
                    as <hi rend="italic">Matta,</hi> the eye, and <hi rend="italic">Matte,</hi>
                    death, are found to coincide in almost all the islands of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pacific Ocean</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the languages of which,
                    notwithstanding their immense distances, seem to differ less than those of the
                    inhabitants of some very small continental tracts; and they might probably be
                    divided into a few well-defined families, if our knowledge of them were more
                    complete. The resemblance of <hi rend="italic">Matte</hi> to the Arabian <hi
                    rend="italic">Mot,</hi> and the Latin <hi rend="italic">Mactare,</hi> is
                    probably accidental.</p>
                <p>The number of the <hi rend="smallcaps">African</hi> languages is supposed to
                    amount to one hundred or one hundred and fifty, and as many as seventy or eighty
                    of them have been distinguished with tolerable accuracy. The population of
                    Africa seems to have been derived from Arabia, and, as some critics think,
                    rather from the southern than from the northern parts; a great number of its
                    present inhabitants are negroes, but these cannot be distinguished from the rest
                    by any infallible criterion. The account given by Ptolemy of the interior part
                    of the country appears to be wonderfully accurate and extensive; although some
                    of his measures seem to be erroneous, and not sufficiently reconcileable with
                    the truth, even by adopting Major Rennell’s hypothesis respecting them. It is
                    however remarkable that Ptolemy followed Hipparchus in extending the eastern
                    coast of Africa to the Ganges, although more correct ideas of its form had been
                    entertained at Alexandria before his time.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Egyptians</hi> demand the priority in treating of the
                    inhabitants of Africa, from their early connection with ancient history, both
                    sacred and profane. It is observable that the representations of the old
                    Egyptians have countenances more or less approaching to the negro physiognomy,
                    though the dry bones of the skeleton have that character somewhat less decidedly
                    than they must have had when clothed with the thick lips and flattish noses of
                    the generality of the representations; at the same time there are sculptures of
                    great antiquity, which exhibit features not unlike those of correct Grecian or
                    Roman beauty; and others have a considerable resemblance to the Arabian nation.
                    At present the people of middle Africa in general are more or less like negroes,
                    but they are somewhat less <pb break="no" facs="nls:193202614"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-2614-0093"/>dark, and their noses and lips are less peculiar;
                    the women sometimes screamed if Burckhardt made his appearance on a sudden, and
                    called him the Devil, because he was white. The Egyptians are supposed by some
                    writers to have received their civilization from Ethiopia; but there are at
                    present no traces of the remains of high civilization farther south than Nubia,
                    except a few scattered monuments about Axum, of no great antiquity. The
                    Egyptians were at first called Copts by the Saracens, and their language has
                    been commonly distinguished by the appellation <hi rend="italic">Coptic,</hi>
                    that is, as written in characters which are principally Greek, and frequently
                    intermixed with a number of pure Greek words; but not a single fragment of
                    Coptic has yet been discovered in this form that is earlier than the
                    establishment of Christianity in Egypt; and it seems probable that the character
                    was introduced by the early Christians at the time of the translation of the
                    Scriptures into Coptic, which is certainly of very high antiquity. The Greek
                    authors frequently mention an Egyptian alphabet of twenty-five letters; but no
                    traces of any such alphabet are found in the multitudinous inscriptions or
                    manuscripts that have been preserved by the exertions of the numerous and
                    adventurous travellers who have lately visited the country. The Greek words
                    mixed with the Coptic are not considered by the grammarians as incorporated with
                    the language, nor are they admitted into the dictionaries The genuine language
                    bears very evident marks of great antiquity; its construction is simple and
                    often awkward; and a great number of its words are monosyllables. We have
                    positive evidence of its having remained unaltered from the time of Herodotus,
                    Plutarch, and other Greek authors; and it affords us the etymology of the name
                    of Moses, and of some other words mentioned in the Scriptures. It exhibits a few
                    coincidences with other ancient languages, but not enough to enable us to
                    consider it either as the offspring or the parent of any of them, except that it
                    gives us something like an explanation of the meaning of some of the Greek
                    particles. Out of one hundred and fourteen original Egyptian words, there are
                    fifty-two that resemble the Greek, twenty-seven the German and English, eighteen
                    the Hebrew, three the Syriac, two the Arabic, two the Sanscrit, one the
                    Sclavonian, and one the Cantabrian. It is, however, probable, that a person more
                    intimately acquainted with the languages of the Arabian family would have been
                    able to find a much greater number of coincidences, since nations which had so
                    much intercourse as the Jews and the Egyptians could scarcely fail to have many
                    words in common, even if their languages had been at first completely different;
                    and probably many of the Arabic roots, which are not Hebrew, may be found in the
                    Egyptian. To the Cantabrian word inserted in this enumeration, Dr Young added
                    five others, the whole six being <hi rend="italic">Berria,</hi> new; <hi
                    rend="italic">Ora,</hi> a dog; <hi rend="italic">Guchi,</hi> little; <hi
                    rend="italic">Oguia,</hi> bread: “Otsoa,” a wolf, whence the Spanish <hi

                    >Uonsh,</hi> a wolf; and <hi rend="italic">Shaskf,</hi> seven. Hence he infers,
                    that “if we consider these words as sufficiently identical to admit of our
                    calculating upon them, the chances will be more than a thousand to one that, at
                    some very remote period, an Egyptian colony established itself in Spain; for
                    none of the languages of the neighbouring nations retain any traces of having
                    been the medium through which these words have been conveyed. On the other
                    hand,” he continues, “if we adopted the opinions of a late learned antiquary,”
                    General Vallancey, “the probability would be still incomparably greater that
                    Ireland was originally peopled from the same mother country; since he has
                    collected more than one hundred words which are certainly Egyptian, and which he
                    considers as bearing the same sense in Irish; but the relation, which he has
                    magnified into identity, appears in general to be that of a very faint
                    resemblance; and this is precisely an instance of a case in which it would be
                    deceiving ourselves to attempt to reduce the matter to a calculation.” It may,
                    indeed, be imagined that the Egyptian dominions may formerly have extended to
                    the Straits of Gibraltar, and that Spain may have derived a part of its
                    population from this part, of Africa, which approaches so near to it; but it
                    could scarcely have happened that no traces of Egyptian monuments should ever
                    have been found at any distance from the Nile, if that active people had really
                    occupied any considerable portion of the neighbouring continent. The word <hi
                    rend="italic">Chemistry,</hi> in Greek <hi rend="italic">Chemia,</hi> is well
                    known to be derived from the Egyptian; it has successively been compared, by the
                    Quarterly Reviewer, to <hi rend="italic">Cliirn</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clιem,</hi> heat, and to <hi rend="italic">Chem,</hi> secret, the latter being
                    the more probable origin of the two; and a third etymon might be found, if it
                    were required, in the <hi rend="italic">Dshem,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ghem,</hi> to find, or Invention. The Coptic language has been nearly extinct
                    for about two centuries; but the service has been read in Coptic much more
                    lately in some of the churches, though it has now been almost entirely
                    superseded by the Arabic. The proper Coptic, or Memphitic, which was the dialect
                    of Lower Egypt, is supposed, from a word quoted by Herodotus, to be the most
                    ancient; the Sahidic or Thebaic of Upper Egypt was probably preserved for a
                    longer time, especially in some of the monasteries; there is a separate version
                    of the principal part of the <hi rend="italic">Bible</hi> in this dialect,
                    fragments of which have been published by Mingarelli and Woide; a third dialect,
                    much resembling the Thebaic, is commonly called the Bashmuric; and a fourth, the
                    Oasitic, has been partially made known by Mr Quatremère de Quincy. The Egyptians
                    have left no traces of their language among the people who at present occupy the
                    countries that they inhabited; the Nubian vocabularies collected by Burckhardt
                    contain no Coptic words; the people are of different Arab races, but have
                    acquired peculiar dialects, probably mixed with those of the neighbouring negro
                    nations, of several of which we find specimens in Mr Salt’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Voyage to Abyssinia.</hi> But one of the most learned, as well as the most
                    adventurous and industrious, of modern travellers, has remarked some
                    coincidences between the old Egyptian language and that of the Barabras, who are
                    neighbours of the Nubians, and extend to the confluence of the Tacazze and the
                    Nile. The Geez and Amharic have already been mentioned as descendants of the
                    Arabian family; they seem to have introduced some traces of this extraction into
                    several of the neighbouring dialects, probably by the translations of the
                    Scriptures, or by the use of the Koran. Professor Vater has taken some pains to
                    prove that the language of Amhara, the Camara of Aga-tharchides, is wholly
                    independent of the Ethiopic and Arabian; but in this he appears to be mistaken.
                    It exhibits some slight resemblance to the Sanscrit, in a few instances; thus,
                    <hi rend="italic">Tshegure</hi> is hair, in Sanscrit, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tshicura.</hi> Macrizi tells us, that there are, in the whole, fifty Abyssinian
                    dialects; but he has probably exaggerated their number. We have obtained more
                    authentic information respecting them from the collections of Bruce, and of his
                    editor, Murray, and still more lately from Dr Seetzen and Mr Salt. Of the Mek of
                    Dongola, the representative of a long race of the Christian kings of Nubia,
                    little is now known, except that he is in a great measure dependent on the king
                    of Sennaar on the one hand, and has been expelled from a part of his territories
                    by the Mamelukes on the other. Of the Agows and the Gafats, neighbours of the
                    Abyssinians, and situated on the Bahr el Azrek, as well as the Jewish Falashas,
                    who are scattered over the country, especially in Dembea, we have read much in
                    the historical romances of Mr Bruce, which certainly give a faithful picture of
                    the countries to which they relate, notwithstanding some unaccountable
                    inaccuracies with respect to the personal adventures of the author.</p>

                <p>The north of Africa is occupied by inhabitants not much differing in appearance
                    from the Arabs. Its three principal divisions are the coast, the country of wild
                    beasts, and the desert. The later Arabs have expelled the earlier Africans from
                    the first division, and partly from the second; the Berbers occupy the third,
                    inhabiting principally the Oases, or cultivable islands, scattered through the
                    desert from Mount Atlas to Egypt, and speaking, as Horneman first ascertained,
                    the same language throughout this vast extent. They were first well described by
                    Leo Africanus: they are probably the remains of the Mauritanians, Numidians,
                    Gaetulians, and Garamatians. There is no foundation whatever for the opinion of
                    some modern authors of celebrity, that their language is derived from the Punic.
                    We even find, from Sallust, that the Numidian language differed from the
                    Carthaginian, and from Valerius Maximus; that it was written in a peculiar
                    character, perhaps the same with that which is found in the inscriptions from
                    Lebeda, now in the court of the British Museum. The language of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Canaries</hi> considerably resembles the Berber; thus, milk is <hi
                    rend="italic">Acho</hi> in Berber, and <hi rend="italic">Aho</hi> in the
                    Canaries. These islands were discovered in 1330, and afterwards conquered, with
                    some difficulty, by the Spaniards. The inhabitants were a fine race of men, and
                    lived in comfort and tranquillity; and they still present some traces of their
                    original character and condition.</p>
                <p>The country between the desert Zahara and the Niger is inhabited by a race of
                    people who have a great resemblance to negroes, but are somewhat different from
                    them. In the east are those of <hi rend="italic">Soudan</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Afnu,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Begermah</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> in the west the <hi rend="italic">Foulahs</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">Fellatas</hi> are a branch of these, extending
                    considerably to the north-east, with a mixture of negroes.</p>
                <p>Of the languages of the negroes, strictly so called, many interesting specimens
                    have been collected by the zeal of the evangelical missionaries in the Caribbee
                    Islands, and published by Oldendorp, in his Account of the Mission; but they do
                    not afford us sufficient materials to enable us to trace any extensive
                    connections or dependencies among their multifarious dialects.</p>
                <p>There are some points of coincidence between the language of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Madagascar</hi> and those of the Malays, the Philippine islanders, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Beetjuana</hi> Caffres, and the <hi rend="italic">Corana</hi>
                    Hottentots: there are also a few words, in many of the African dialects,
                    borrowed from the modern Arabic, not, as Court de Gebclin would persuade us,
                    from the Phoenician. Nor can any other of the affinities be very distinctly
                    established.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Caffres</hi> have little of the negro character except the
                    black colour, and less of this as they become more remote from the equator. They
                    are supposed to extend across the whole of Africa, immediately north of the
                    Hottentots, as far as Benguela and Quiloa. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hottentots,</hi> with their neighbours the <hi rend="italic">Bosjemen,</hi>
                    speak different dialects of the same singular language, in different parts of
                    their country. Of that of the <hi rend="italic">Dammaras,</hi> little or nothing
                    is known. Lichtenstein has classed them as Hottentots; but Barrow, who was
                    better acquainted with them, considers them as Caffres.</p>
