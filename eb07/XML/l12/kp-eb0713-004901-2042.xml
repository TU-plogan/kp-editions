                <p><label type="entry">LANARKSHIRE, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Clydesdale</hi></label>,
                    a county in Scotland, situated between 55. 20. and 55. 56. north latitude, and
                    3. 25. and 4. 22. west longitude. It is bounded on the north by the counties of
                    Dumbarton and Stirling, on the east by those of Edinburgh, Linlithgow, and
                    Peebles, by Dumfriesshire on the south, and by the counties of Ayr and Renfrew
                    on the west. In length, from north to south, it is about forty-seven miles; its
                    greatest breadth, from east to west, is thirty-two, and it extends over 942
                    square miles, or 602,880 English acres, of which about 271,000 acres are under
                    cultivation. It is divided into three wards; the <hi rend="italic">Upper,
                    of</hi> which Lanark is the chief town, containing about two thirds of its area,
                    on the east, south, and southwest, the greater part mountainous; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Middle,</hi> which has the town of Hamilton in its centre,
                    stretching along the west and north; and the <hi rend="italic">Lower,</hi>
                    containing the city of Glasgow, and a small tract around it.</p>
                <p>This extensive district presents great variety of surface. Some of the mountains
                    in the Upper Ward, where it is bounded by Dumfriesshire, are about 3000 feet
                    high; and Tintock, on the northern boundary of the hilly district, is nearly
                    2300. Leadhills, a village on its southern extremity, is 1564 feet above the
                    level of the sea, being the highest iphabited ground in Scotland. But in
                    proceeding along the banks of the Clyde north from Tintock, the face of the
                    country softens down to gentle elevations and depressions, and for twelve miles
                    the river winds slowly through fertile haughs. The Middle Ward is much less
                    elevated, few of the heights being little more than 700 feet above sea level;
                    the town of Hamilton is only about eighty; yet there are no plains of any extent
                    except along the banks of the Clyde, and a considerable part of the surface is
                    covered with moss, in many places to a great depth. Of the Lower, the greater
                    part is a highly ornamented district, particularly the banks of the Clyde, which
                    are thickly planted with villas, the summer residence of the wealthy inhabitants
                    of the city of Glasgow.</p>
                <p>The principal river, and, in a commercial point of view, the greatest in
                    Scotland, is the Clyde, from which the county is frequently called <hi
                    rend="italic">Clydesdale.</hi> It has its rise in the ridge of mountains which
                    separate Lanarkshire from Dumfriesshire, and, flowing first north and then
                    northwest, through the middle of the county, falls into the frith of the same
                    name above Greenock, carrying with it the waters collected from 1200 square
                    miles. The principal streams which join it on the south are Duneaton, Douglas,
                    Nethan, Avon, and West Calder; and on the north the Medwin, Mouse, South and
                    North Calders, and Kelvin, which separates Lanarkshire from Dumbartonshire. The
                    Clyde is navigable to Glasgow for vessels of more than 300 tons burden, and
                    drawing thirteen feet water; and two miles higher up for smaller vessels. Most
                    kinds of the fish found in the other rivers of Scotland are also found in the
                    Clyde; but it is supposed that the great increase of trade on the river, and the
                    use of the water for the various purposes of manufacture, have been injurious to
                    the fisheries.</p>
                <p>Sandstone and limestone are the prevailing rocks in the lower parts of
                    Lanarkshire, and argillaceous schistus in the high grounds. In the Cathkin
                    Hills, near Glasgow, there is a number of basaltic columns, more than forty feet
                    high, inclined at an angle of about seventy degrees. Ironstone abounds in many
                    parts of the county, and is wrought to a great extent, there having been
                    nineteen furnaces in operation in 1835, producing 56,000 tons of iron annually,
                    exclusive of six furnaces in preparation, calculated to make 13,000 tons
                    additional, being more than three fourths of the whole quantity made in
                    Scotland. The great increase in this manufacture has been partly attributed to
                    the hot-blast invented by Mr Neilson of Glasgow, first tried on a large scale in
                    the Clyde iron-works, and immediately thereafter adopted at the Calder works.
                    The use of this improvement is rapidly extending, and is likely to effect a most
                    beneficial change on the production of this valuable metal. On the southern
                    extremity are the well-known lead-mines belonging to the Earl of Hopetoun, from
                    which the village of Leadhills takes its name. These mines now yield annually
                    only 700 tons of lead, being less than the half of the quantity produced <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193202055" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2055-0050"/> during the war.
                    This deficiency is attributed solely to the want of demand, the ore being still
                    found in abundance. A manufactory of small shot was established about two years
                    ago. In the same quarter gold was discovered in the time of James HL, and
                    afterwards collected in considerable quantities, from which the celebrated
                    “bonnet pieces” of James V. were coined. But coal is by far the most important
                    of its mineral treasures. It is supposed to stretch throughout an area of about
                    70,000 acres, and, including the different seams, to be about ten feet thick.
                    The field near Glasgow contains eight seams, one of them seven feet thick, the
                    whole amounting to upwards of thirty feet. There are several good seams of
                    cannel or candle coal in different parts of the county. This kind has been long
                    used by the country people for lighting their houses, and is now carried in
                    great quantities to Glasgow and other towns, for the manufacture of gas.</p>
                <p>The valued rent of Lanarkshire is L.162,1l8. !6s. 10d. Scots, and the real rent
                    of lands, houses, mines, and quarries, is L.75l,364'. Is. 2d. About two thirds
                    of the county is the property <hi rend="italic">of</hi> great landholders, but
                    small properties are very numerous. The number of landholders above L.400 of
                    valued rent is about seventy; and below that sum and above L.10, upwards of 750.
                    These small estates, with those of many of the class immediately above them, are
                    cultivated by their owners; the large ones are letout to tenants on leases,
                    except the enclosed grass lands, a great part of which is let out from year to
                    year for grazing only.</p>
                <p>The arable land is for the most part divided into farms of a moderate extent,
                    held on leases for nineteen years; but it is notan uncommon practice to let the
                    grazing lands for two or three crops only, for which a high rent is often
                    obtained. The sheep pastures in the mountain districts yield a rent averaging
                    about two shillings and ninepence per acre, and the arable land about twenty
                    shillings, the best in general being only cultivated. In the lower portion of
                    the Upper Ward, where cultivation is more indiscriminate, the average is not
                    much higher; but in the Middle and Lower Wards the average of arable land may he
                    computed at thirty shillings. Much of the arable land in the first division is
                    dry and fertile; clay prevails in the second and third; and along the banks of
                    the Clyde there are considerable tracts of an alluvial description. Of late
                    years much land has been reclaimed and improved by draining; and incalculable
                    benefit has been derived from the planting of clumpsand strips of trees in
                    exposed situations, although this practice has not yet become so general as its
                    importance obviously demands. The present system of entails, under which a great
                    proportion of the land in this county is held, has been much blamed for
                    retarding such improvements.</p>
                <p>As this county slopes to the west almost throughout its whole extent, the
                    Atlantic exerts a powerful influence on its climate. For about two thirds of the
                    year the wind blows from the south-west and west. Intense frosts are of short
                    duration, and snow seldom lies long in the lower districts; but, from the
                    general humidity of the atmosphere, and also of the soil, seed-time and harvest
                    are often late. In regard to heat, there is a considerable difference between
                    the Upper and Middle Wards, the thermometer on the same day commonly standing
                    several degrees higher in the latter than in the former. Its range is from
                    eleven to eighty-five degrees. The quantity of rain that falls at Glasgow varies
                    from fourteen and a half to twenty-eight and a half inches, the average for
                    thirty years being twenty-two and a third; but at Lanark the influence of the
                    Atlantic is less sensibly felt, owing probably to its open and elevated
                    situation. This however may, equally with the great humidity of the other wards,
                    account for the lateness of the harvest. Lanarkshire is therefore, upon the
                    whole, less favourable to the culture of corn than the eastern counties of
                    Scotland.</p>
                <p>The dairy is accordingly an object of considerable importance here, and is
                    carried on in all its branches. Besides the dairies kept in and near the city of
                    Glasgow, for supplying the inhabitants with milk, cream, and fresh butter, a
                    great number of cows are kept in the landward districts, the produce of which is
                    applied to making butter and cheese, and the fattening of calves. The cheese is
                    in general equal in quality to the best Dunlop, and brings the highest prices in
                    the Edinburgh and Glasgow markets. Lesmahagow and Carnwath parishes are said to
                    produce the best. Within the last few years several of the Highland Society’s
                    prizes for the best imitation of Stilton and double Gloucester cheeses have been
                    obtained by the dairy farmers of the latter parish. The Ayrshire breed of cattle
                    has hitherto been most prized; but a new species has recently been introduced,
                    and found to be of superior quality, viz. the Lanarkshire newly-improved breed,
                    crossed by the Ayrshire cow and short-horned bull, or <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> The draught-horses of Clydesdale have long been famous. They are
                    supposed to have originated from some Flanders or Holstein horses brought over
                    in the seventeenth century by one of the Dukes of Hamilton.</p>
                <p>From the earliest period, Clydesdale has been celebrated for its fruit. The
                    Venerable Bede, who flourished in the eighth century, speaks of the “apple-yards
                    of Lanark” as being then famous. Till the beginning of the present century,
                    however, the orchards seem to have been principally confined to sloping banks,
                    and acclivities inaccessible to the plough. But the growing prosperity and
                    wealth of Glasgow, and the obstructions to continental intercourse about the
                    period above alluded to, operated a change so favourable, that some of the
                    richest holm lands were speedily devoted to this species of cultivation. It
                    ises-timated that there areat least 600 acres in orchards, which are gradually
                    extending, although the reduced value and the precariousness of the crop seem to
                    hold out little inducement. The average value of the fruit at the orchards
                    during the war was about L.8000 per annum, but of late years it has not exceeded
                    L.5000. The average price of apples at the orchards in 1835 was under two
                    shillings per sack of about forty pounds. Gooseberries and currants are likewise
                    largely cultivated. In some of the more extensive orchards, they yield L.50 or
                    L.60 annually.</p>
                <p>The internal communication by means of roads is in a high state of improvement.
                    The great line of road from Glasgow to Carlisle and London intersects the whole
                    county from east to west; and in every direction it is traversed by roads in the
                    best state of repair. But other modes <hi rend="italic">of</hi> communication
                    have been found requisite for the immense trade carried on in Glasgow and the
                    neighbourhood. The navigation of the Clyde has been much improved by deepening
                    and confining the bed of the river, and by canals formed in several directions.
                    These are, the Forth and Clyde Canal, connecting the friths of these two rivers,
                    thirty-five miles distant from each other; this was the first considerable work
                    of the kind undertaken in Scotland, and has been a very useful and successful
                    one; the shares of L.100 were lately selling at L.540: at Stockingfield, a
                    collateral branch proceeds to Port Dundas, at Glasgow: the Monkland Canal, from
                    the coalworks in the parishes of Monkland, to the Forth and Clyde at Port
                    Dundas: and die Ardrossan Canal, which is completed from Port Eglinton, near
                    Glasgow, to the village of Johnston, a distance of eleven miles, and is intended
                    to be continued to Ardrossan, on the coast of Ayrshire, twenty-two miles
                    farther. Railways, too, which promise to fulfil the wonders of the nursery tale
                    of the seven-league boots, have been projected, and some of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193202068" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2068-0051"/>them executed. The
                    Kirkintilloch Railway stretches from the canal into the coalfields of Monkland.
                    The Garnkirk Railway is the only one on which locomotive engines are employed.
                    It extends from Glasgow to near Airdrie, where it is joined by the Ballochney
                    Railway. The Wishaw and Coltness Railway, partly executed, is intended to open
                    this mode of communication to near the centre of the county; whilst one on a
                    more extensive scale is in contemplation for connecting the cities of Edinburgh
                    and Glasgow. In short, railways, which seem as yet in their infancy, are now
                    being pushed out in all directions from the great emporium of the west, and will
                    no doubt thrive under the fostering enterprise and industry of that great
                    city.</p>
                <p>The city of Glasgow, with its manufactures and commerce, has been described in
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Glasgow.</hi> The other towns are Lanark (see
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Lanark</hi>), Rutherglen, Hamilton, and
                    Airdrie, with which may be classed the populous villages of Strathaven and
                    Biggar, polling stations for the elections of members of parliament. Hamilton is
                    situated on the Clyde, thirty-eight miles west of Edinburgh, and eleven
                    south-east of Glasgow, with a population of 9513. In the neighbourhood is the
                    seat of the Duke of Hamilton; and three miles below is Bothwell Bridge, noted
                    for the defeat of the Covenanters, on the 22d of June 1679. Rutherglen is a
                    royal burgh, on the Clyde, two and a half miles above Glasgow. Airdrie, situated
                    in the parish of New Monkland, on the great road between Edinburgh and Glasgow,
                    about ten miles from the latter, is rapidly rising into importance. It has been
                    recognised as a burgh under the parliamentary and burgh reform acts. The
                    population of the town in 1831 was 6594, of the parish 9867. There are a number
                    of villages in the vicinity of Glasgow, which, by their situation, belong to
                    that city; and several of considerable extent in different parts of the county.
                    Amongst the latter may be mentioned Carnwath, Carluke, Douglas, Lesmahagow,
                    Stonehouse, Leadhills, and New Lanark. The cotton manufacture, the iron-works,
                    and the collieries, give employment to the greater part of the inhabitants of
                    Lanarkshire. Every great establishment has a considerable village in the
                    neighbourhood, where the workmen reside.</p>
                <p>The county of Lanark sends one member to parliament, who is chosen by a
                    Constituency of 3634, of whom above 200 consist of the old freeholders. The city
                    of Glasgow sends two members, chosen by a constituency of 8883; and the royal
                    burghs of Lanark and Rutherglen, and the towns of Hamilton and Airdrie, have a
                    share in the election of other two members; Lanark, Hamilton, and Airdrie, being
                    joined with Falkirk, and Linlithgow and Rutherglen with Kilmarnock, Port
                    Glasgow, Dumbarton, and Renfrew. It has one sheriff, whose jurisdiction extends
                    over all the county, and three substitutes, at Lanark, Glasgow, and Hamilton.
                    Lanarkshire contains forty-seven parishes, of which eleven belong to the
                    Presbytery of Lanark, fourteen to that of Hamilton, and thirteen to that of
                    Glasgow, all in the Synod of Glasgow and Ayr; and nine to the Presbytery of
                    Biggar, in the Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The ecclesiastical revenue,
                    exclusive of that of the churches within the city of Glasgow, including the
                    estimated value of the glebes, may be stated, on an average of the last seven
                    years, at about L.l 1,550. The increase of the population has been uncommonly
                    rapid; but it may be attributed chiefly to the city of Glasgow, and the spread
                    of its manufactures.</p>
