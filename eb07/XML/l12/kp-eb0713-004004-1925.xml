                    de</hi></label>, eldest son of Μ. Lamoignon, first president of the parliament
                    of Paris, was born in that city on the 26th of June 1644. Not choosing to
                    intrust his education to any one, his father became his first instructor, and
                    taught him the elementary parts of learning. After having attended a course of
                    rhetoric under Rapin, young Lamoignon applied himself to the study of law, and
                    in this pursuit found great assistance in the conferences of the advocates whom
                    the president assembled at his residence. It was the wish of the president that
                    his son should first appear at the bar as a simple advocate; and, accordingly,
                    the latter continued for about two years in the ordinary practice of the
                    profession. Possessing a refined taste, and full of the good principles which he
                    had derived from the study of the ancients, the young lawyer brought to the
                    courts of law that judicial eloquence which the mania for citation and false
                    display had exiled from their precincts. In 1666, he was appointed counsellor to
                    the parliament. Two years afterwards, when the plague had appeared at Soissons,
                    and ap prehensions were entertained that the contagion might reach Paris, Μ. de
                    Lamoignon was employed to take the necessary measures for arresting its
                    progress. In the discharge of this duty he displayed equal energy and
                    intelligence. Whilst abundant resources of medicine were accumulated at Soissons
                    to combat the evil at its source, he established a sanitary line or cordon,
                    which completely intercepted all communication with the centre of infection. He
                    had himself written out the details of this operation, so foreign to the nature
                    of his ordinary pursuits, but which was nevertheless crowned with complete
                    success. Being appointed master of requests some time afterwards, he was one of
                    the commissioners whom LouisXIV. formed into a particular council, when he
                    himself held the seals after the death of the chancellor Seguier. In 1674, he
                    was appointed advocategeneral to the parliament, an office which had become
                    vacant by the death of a son of the celebrated Bignon. During the twenty-five
                    years that he held this office, he rendered the most important services to
                    jurisprudence; and if the eloquent pleadings he pronounced have not been
                    preserved, history has at least transmitted to us the sentiments of admiration
                    which they excited. It is to a discourse pronounced in the cause of the Marquis
                    of Langey by this celebrated magistrate, who knew so well how to reconcile the
                    interests of morality and society with the respect due to laws consecrated by
                    long usage, that France owes the abolition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >congress</hi> (a court for proving virility or impotence), an institution
                    worthy <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the rude age that gave it birth, but which had
                    hitherto been preserved. It was in conformity with his conclusions that the
                    decree of abolition was pronounced by the first president, his father. Louis
                    XIV. had thought of Lamoignon for the situation of first president of the
                    parliament; a mistake, perhaps even an intrigue, had deprived him of that of
                    attorney-general, which was given to Labriffe; but the distinction with which he
                    exercised the functions of advocate-general, his zeal, and his marked
                    predilection for that office, induced him to retain it eight years after he had
                    been made president <hi rend="italic">à mortier,</hi> that is, in 1690. In 1707,
                    when enfeebled by the excessive labour he had undergone, he resigned in favour
                    of his eldest son, and died on the 7th of August 1709. Μ. de Lamoignon loved and
                    cultivated letters; and his intimate connections with some of the greatest
                    geniuses of his age, particularly with Bourdaloue, Boileau, Racine, and Regnard,
                    have also added to his celebrity. It is to him that the sixth epistle of Boileau
                    is addressed. But notwithstanding his friendship for men of letters, he refused
                    to become a member of the French Academy, when that society called upon him to
                    join it; though he afterwards accepted a place in the Academy of Inscriptions,
                    of which he became president. The only production of M. de Lamoignon that has
                    been printed is his letter on the death of Bourdaloue, which is appended to the
                    third volume of the <hi rend="italic">Caremeoĩ</hi> that celebrated preacher;
                    but he also wrote a life of bis father, Guillaume de Lamoignon, which is said to
                    breathe the most ardént filial piety and affection. <hi rend="smallcaps"
