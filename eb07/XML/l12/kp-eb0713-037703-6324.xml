                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    arrondissement of the department of the North, in France. It extends over 356
                    square miles, is divided into sixteen cantons, and subdivided into 129 communes,
                    which together contain 241,800 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same
                    name, the most celebrated fortified place in Europe, and in the most fertile
                    district of rrance. It is situated on the river Deule, which is navigable for
                    barges and other small craft. The streets are broader than is usual in fortified
                    places, and the new part of the city is handsome. Some of the public buildings,
                    especially the theatre, the exchange, the barracks, and St Stephen’s church, are
                    fine. It contains 11,500 houses, and 62,500 inhabitants, who are occupied in
                    numerous manufactures, though most of them are on a small scale. The most
                    important are sugar-refining, glass-making, weaving linen, cotton, and woollen
                    goods. The spinning of lace, and making of thread, employs many hands, as does
                    the fabrication of pillow-lace. A vast quantity of seed-oil and of oil-cake is
                    also made, both for domestic use and for exportation. Long. 2. 59. 11. E. Lat.

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lisle,</hi><hi rend="italic">Joseph Nicholas de,</hi> an
                    eminent astronomer and geographer, was born at Paris in the year 1688. His
                    father having taught him the principles of grammar, he afterwards attended
                    lectures in Mazarin College, where he delivered rhetorical exercises in the year
                    1706. A total eclipse of the sun having taken place on the 12th of March in that
                    year, his taste for mathematics was thus discovered, and he was accordingly
                    placed under a proper tutor, who taught him the elements of geometry,
                    fortification, and mechanics; but his favourite study was the science of
                    astronomy.</p>
                <p>In 1707, he obtained the place of engineer at Martinico which made him acquainted
                    with the art of drawing’; an acquisition which proved highly useful to him in
                    his geographical labours, and also in the study of astronomy. His father having
                    procured a copy of an Account of a Voyage to the South Sea, from his son’s
                    master, young De Lisle was excited by the perusal of it to the study of natural
                    history, and began to make collections of insects, and sketch their varieties;
                    but being afterwards persuaded that a study requiring such immense collections
                    to be made as he found in Aldrovandus, was wholly incompatible with the
                    unremitting attention which his favourite science required, he relinquished it
                    entirely. The attention he paid to astronomical researches was so great, that he
                    was considered as meriting the correspondence of some of the ablest astronomers
                    of Europe at the early age of twenty-one. In 1709 he made a wooden quadrant,
                    which he divided with the utmost accuracy, and which answered the intended
                    purpose in his early observations. He likewise constructed a table for Cassini,
                    of the right ascensions and declinations, adapted to all the degrees of latitude
                    and longitude of the planets, and the obliquity of the ecliptic; and this table
                    was made use of by Cassini in foretelling the occultations of the stars by the
                    moon.</p>
                <p>De Lisle being informed by Cassini in 1710 of his method of representing an
                    eclipse of the sun, by the projection of a terrestrial parallel on a plane, he
                    instantly conceived the idea of applying it to every part of the earth, by means
                    of a globe mounted and prepared for that purpose. Such astronomers as he made
                    acquainted with his project conceived it to be impracticable; but when the
                    machine was completed, they bestowed the highest encomiums on the noble
                    invention. The first memorable observation made by De Lisle was that of the
                    moon, on the 23d of January 1712, after which his labours experienced some
                    interruption from indisposition. About this time the situation of his father’s
                    numerous family rendered it necessary that he should provide for himself, so
                    that he was obliged to make his astronomical knowledge subservient to the
                    absurdities of astrology, receiving pecuniary presents from the regent for his
                    services. He also received, in 1715, the grant of a pension of six hundred
                    livres, on which occasion he calculated tables of the moon according to the
                    Newtonian theory, prior to Halley’s communications to him, which were printed in
                    1719. De Lisle was chosen a member of the Academy of Sciences in 1714.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206337" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6337-0378"/>
                <p>In 1720 he delivered a proposal to the academy for ascertaining in France the
                    figure of the earth, a design which was carried into execution some years
                    afterwards. In 1723 he delivered to the same body a memoir on the transits of
                    Mercury, wherein a method of calculating them was proposed by him, as well as
                    the way in which they were to be observed, and the inferences to be deduced from
                    these observations. He proposed the use of the quadrant in observing the
                    transits of Venus and Mercury, which has been found superior to any other
                    instrument for that important purpose, and is sanctioned since his day by the
                    practice of the ablest astronomers.</p>
                <p>De Lisle visited England în the year 1724, and there became acquainted with
                    Newton and Halley, and had the honour of obtaining their approbation. Newton
                    made him a present of his own portrait, and Halley gave him a copy of the tables
                    which he had published in 1719. He was also created a member of the Royal
                    Society, and enjoyed similar honours from every literary society in Europe
                    before his death. In 1721 he received an invitation from Peter the Great to go
                    to St Petersburg to fill the chair of astronomer in the Imperial Academy of
                    Sciences. Upon the death of that emperor, his successor Catharine renewed the
                    invitation, at the same time offering him a considerable pension, which he
                    accepted, and, in 1726, set out for St Petersburg, accompanied by his brother
                    Louis and Μ. Vignon, who were to act as his assistants. He reached St Petersburg
                    in the month of October, and was established in the observatory erected by Peter
                    the Great, which he occupied for twenty-one years. It was in every respect
                    commodious, but extremely deficient in astronomical apparatus, which his own
                    ingenuity and indefatigable application in a great measure supplied.</p>
                <p>A transit of Mercury over the sun’s disc was expected in the year 1740, which
                    would not be visible in Europe, and therefore De Lisle undertook a journey to
                    the distant regions of Asia; but after travelling through the inhospitable wũlds
                    of Siberia, the cloudiness of the atmosphere prevented him from observing the
                    transit; a mortification which he endeavoured to support by his geographical and
                    physical remarks, and in drawing up a description of the country. He constructed
                    an interesting map of Russia, assisted by his brother Louis, who was appointed
                    to make observations in the most distant parts of that immense empire. He was
                    occasionally employed for the long period of forty years in making
                    meteorological observations, which he executed with an accuracy almost
                    incredible.</p>
                <p>After a number ofdiscouragements and difficulties, and the irregular payment of
                    his pension, had been long experienced by De Lisle at St Petersburg, he returned
                    disgusted to his native place, and was chosen professor of mathematics at the
                    Royal College, where he rendered the most essential service to the sciences, by
                    the important instructions which he gave to his numerous pupils, many of whom
                    became afterwards the most distinguished characters, such as MM. de Lalande and
                    Messier.</p>
                <p>When the transit of Mercury over the sun was eagerly expected in 1753 by the
                    greatest astronomers, De Lisle published an interesting map of the world,
                    representing the effect of Mercury’s parallaxes in different countries, that
                    those places might be known which were proper for making such observations on
                    the transit as might determine the distance of the sun. As the apparent orbit of
                    the planet traversed nearly the centre of the sun, De Lisle made use of this
                    circumstance to determine the diameter of that luminary. The last work of our
                    author which was inserted in the volumes of the French Academy was a memoir on
                    the comet which appeared in the year 1758, discovered by a peasant in the
                    vicinity of Dresden.</p>
                <p>It may perhaps be asserted with justice, that the most important service which he
                    rendered to astronomers was the correction of the double error of Halley
                    respecting the transit of Venus, looked for in the year 1761, as by this means
                    he prevented many learned men from undertaking long voyages in order to observe
                    it. About the year 1754, De Lisle was appointed by the king of France
                    astronomical geographer to the marine, in which capacity he was employed to
                    collect plans and journals of naval captains, to arrange them methodically, and
                    to make extracts from them of whatever might be beneficial to the service. About
                    the year 1758 he withdrew into retirement at the abbey of St Genevieve, where
                    much of his time was spent in devotional exercises, and in acts of charity and
                    beneficence. Still, however, he continued to prosecute those studies which had
                    been so dear to him during the earlier part of his life. In 1768, he was seized
                    with a scorbutic complaint, of which he was cured by his medical friends; but in
                    the month of September of the same year he was seized with a species of
                    apoplexy, which carried him off on the 11th of that month, in the eighty-first
                    year of his age.</p>
                <p>His extraordinary merit as a man of science may in some measure be gathered from
                    this concise account of his life; and, as a citizen of the world, his piety was
                    unaffected, his morals pure, his integrity undeviating, his spirit generous and
                    disinterested, and his whole manners highly amiable. The only publication of
                    his, besides those already mentioned, consisted of Memoirs illustrative of the
                    History of Astronomy, in two vols. 4to.</p>
