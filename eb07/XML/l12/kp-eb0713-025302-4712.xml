                <p><label type="entry">LETTER</label>, a character used to express one of the simple
                    sounds of the voice. As the different simple sounds are expressed’by different
                    letters, these, by being differently compounded, become the visible signs or
                    characters of all the modulations and varieties of sound used to express our
                    ideas in a regular language. Thus, by the help of speech we render our ideas
                    audible; by the assistance of letters we render them visible; and by means of
                    these we can wrap up our thoughts, and send them to the most distant parts of
                    the earth, or read the transactions of different ages. What letters were
                    originally, who first invented them, and amongst what people they were primarily
                    used, there is still reason to doubt. Philo attributes this great and noble
                    invention to Abraham; Josephus, StIrenaeus, and others, to Enoch; Bibliander, to
                    Adam; Eusebius, Clemens Alexandrinus, Cornelius Agrippa, and others, to Moses;
                    Pomponius Mela, Herodian, Rufus Festus, Pliny, Lucan, and others, to the
                    Phoenicians; St Cyprian, to Saturn; Plato and Tacitus, to the Egyptians; some,
                    to the Ethiopians; and others, to the Chinese, who cannot possibly be entitled
                    to this honour, since all their characters are the signs of simple ideas, and
                    have nothing in common with letters.</p>
                <p>There have also been various conjectures respecting the different kinds of
                    letters used in different languages. Thus, according to Crinitus, Moses invented
                    the Hebrew letters; Abraham the Syriac and Chaldaic; the Phoenicians those of
                    Attica, brought into Greece by Cadmus, and thence carried into Italy by the
                    Pelasgians; Nicoŝtrata, the Roman; Isis, the Egyptian; and Vulfilas, those of
                    the Goths. These, however, are but fanciful conjectures, which it is sufficient
                    to state, and would be vain to examine or discuss.</p>
                <p>The natural order of invention, in the visible representation of thought, seems
                    to be indicated, not merely by theory, but by facts ascertained from the
                    analysis of ancient graphic remains, as well as by the practice actually
                    followed amongst several existing nations. The primary and elemental form was
                    unquestionably that of picture-writing, or the delineation, more or less rude,
                    of external objects, as these present themselves to the eye; with perhaps some
                    marks expressive of <hi rend="italic">day, week, month, year,</hi> and even of
                    <hi rend="italic">time</hi> generally. The next was the hieroglyphic or
                    ideagraphic form, which consisted not only of pictures or resemblances of
                    external objects, but also, and in a much larger proportion, of images
                    metaphorically or analogically transferred, so as to become signs of other
                    things, and to indicate general notions as well as simple ideas. This was no
                    doubt a very great improvement on picture-writing, inasmuch as it gave
                    considerable extension and variety to the power of expression, and enabled
                    mankind, though in a laborious form, to write their annals, inscribe their
                    monuments, and preserve what knowledge they had acquired. The third and the last
                    step in the gradual improvement of .writing, was the invention of letters; that
                    is, of signs or marks expressive, not of ideas whether simple or complex, but of
                    the elementary sounds of the human voice, lhis was the ultimate term, the final
                    generalization, which led to the greatest and happiest of all discoveries, that
                    of a literal alphabet.</p>
                <p>It is no doubt true that some nations appear to have stopped short before
                    reaching this final term, and to have remained satisfied with a more elaborate
                    and imperfect mode of graphic representation. The Mexicans, for instance, had
                    not advanced beyond picture-writing, in its rudest and simplest form. The
                    Chinese have, for ages, employed a multitude of ideagraphic characters, derived,
                    by composition and otherwise, from a limited number of elementary pictures or
                    representations of external objects, without making the least step towards an
                    alphabet, on the very verge of which invention they stand as often as they
                    employ their ideagraphic characters, phonetically, to express the sounds of a
                    foreign proper name. The ancient Egyptians also remained contented with their
                    hieroglyphical system; and although Plato attributes to their god Thoth the
                    invention of letters, the honour of that discovery appears rather to have
                    belonged to other nations, who were not trammelled by habit, or restrained by
                    prejudice, from attempting to improve their method of written expression. But it
                    does not follow from this, as some have pretended, that letters are not
                    derivable from ideagraphic signs, because some nations had not the ingenuity to
                    make the derivation. It might with as much reason be maintained, that the law of
                    universal gravitation is not deduceable from the fact of the descent of heavy
                    bodies in a line directed towards the centre of the earth, because the deduction
                    was not fully made, and clearly established, until the time of Newton. The
                    Egyptians, like the Chinese, as often as they had occasion to write a foreign
                    proper name, employed their ideagraphic characters phonetically, that is, as
                    alphabetical letters expressive of <hi rend="italic">sounds</hi> merely; in
                    other words, the very exigencies of their graphic system forced upon them the
                    knowledge and the practice of an alphabet, to the extent here indicated. They
                    were, therefore, upon the very threshold of the discovery; necessity itself had
                    impelled them in the right direction; the slightest attempt at generalization
                    would have led them to the grand consummation; and, if they had tried to do
                    that, generally, which they found themselves obliged to do in particular cases,
                    the result would have been the displacement of ideagraphic by alphabetic
                    characters. But does it follow, because they failed to make this final step,
                    that the invention of letters was not the natural result of that state of things
                    which immediately preceded it; or that alphabetic writing is not an invention of
                    man, but “a miraculous gift to him from God,” as Dr Wall of Dublin and some
                    others contend?</p>
                <p>This seems to be not only unphilosophical in an eminent degree, but likewise
                    absurd and preposterous. For if it required a miracle to deduce letters from
                    hieroglyphics, it must have equally required one to deduce hieroglyphics, in all
                    their complex variety of tropical, kuriological, and anaglyphic, from mere
                    imitative representations, such as were found in use amongst the Mexicans when
                    the Spaniards first landed in the New World. The distance between the Mexican
                    and the Egyptian systems is fully as great as, if not greater than, the distance
                    between phonetic hieroglyphics and the alphabet of Cadmus. If we were always to
                    presume the interposition of miraculous agency in cases where men failed to
                    reach inventions or discoveries, upon the very borders of which they had been
                    standing for ages, history would become a romance, and philosophy a manual of
                    superstition. The order of nature is not thus dislocated and disturbed; nor does
                    the ordinary progress of invention, improvement, and generalization require to
                    be accounted for or explained by supposititious assumptions of supernatural
                    interposition. The miracle connected with the invention of an alphabet is its
                    extreme simplicity, united with the almost unlimited power which it gives to man
                    of expressing his thoughts in writing.</p>
                <p>Letters constitute the first or elementary part of grammar; and they are
                    combined, first, into syllables, secondly, into words, and, thirdly, into
                    sentences. The alphabet <pb break="no" facs="nls:193204725"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-4725-0254"/>of every language consists of a certain number of
                    letters, which ought to have each a different sound, figure, and use. As the
                    difference of articulate sounds was intended to express the different ideas of
                    the mind, so one letter was originally intended to signify only one sound, and
                    not, as at present, to express sometimes one sound, and sometimes another; a
                    practice which has brought a great deal of confusion into languages, and
                    rendered the acquisition of the modern tongues much more difficult than it would
                    otherwise have been. This consideration, together with the defects of all the
                    known alphabets, from their wanting certain letters to express certain sounds,
                    has occasioned several attempts to form an universal alphabet, containing an
                    enumeration of all the single sounds or letters which are used in any
                    language.</p>
                <p>Grammarians distinguish letters into vowels, consonants, mutes, liquids,
                    diphthongs, and characteristics. They receive their denomination from the shape
                    and turn which is given to them; and in writing are distinguished into different
                    hands, as round text, German text, round hand, Italian, and so forth; and in
                    printing, into Roman, Italic, and black letter.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="smallcaps">Letter,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Type,</hi>
                    amongst printers, not only includes the capitals, small capitals, and small
                    letters, but all the points, figures, and other marks cast and used in printing;
                    and also the large ornamental letters cut in wood or metal, which are employed
                    instead of the illuminated letters used in manuscripts. The letters used in
                    printing are cast at the ends of small pieces of metal, about three quarters of
                    an inch in length; and the letter being not indented, but raised, easily gives
                    the impression, when, after being blacked with a glutinous ink, paper is closely
                    pressed upon it. (See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Printing.)</hi> A fount
                    of letters includes small letters, capitals, small capitals, points, figures,

                    rend="smallcaps">Letter</hi> is a writing directed and sent by one person to
                    another. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Epistle.</hi></p>
                <p>The art of epistolary writing was considered by the Romans amongst the number of
                    polite and liberal accomplishments; and we find Cicero mentioning, with great
                    pleasure, in some of his letters to Atticus, the elegant specimen he had
                    received from his son of his genius in this way. It seems indeed to have formed
                    part of their education; and, in the opinion of Mr Locke, it well deserves to
                    have a share in ours. The writing of letters enters so much into all the
                    occasions of life, that no gentleman can avoid showing himself in compositions
                    of this kind. Occurrences will daily force him to make this use of his pen,
                    which lays open his breeding, and sense, and his abilities, to a severer
                    examination than any oral discourse.</p>
                <p>Purity in the choice of words, and justness of construction, joined with
                    perspicuity, are the leading properties of the epistolary style. Accordingly,
                    Cicero says, “In writing letters, we make use of common words and expressions
                    and Seneca observes, “I would have my letters to be like my discourses, when we
                    either sit or walk together, unstudied and easy.” For what prudent man, in his
                    common discourse, aims at bright and strong figures, beautiful turns of
                    language, or laboured periods? Nor is it always requisite to attend to exact
                    order and method. He who is master of what he writes, will naturally enough
                    express his thoughts without perplexity and confusion; and anything more than
                    this is seldom necessary, especially in familiar letters.</p>
                <p>As the subjects of epistles are exceedingly various, they necessarily require
                    corresponding variety in the manner of expression. If the subject be something
                    weighty and momentous, the language should be strong and solemn; in things of an
                    inferior description, free, easy, and familiar; and upon lighter matters, jocose
                    and pleasant. In exhortations, it ought to be lively and vigorous; in
                    consolations, kind and compassionate; in admonition, grave and serious. In
                    narratives, it should be clear and distinct; in requests, modest; in
                    commendations, friendly; in prosperity, cheerful; in adversity, mournful, but
                    not mean or desponding. In a word, the style ought to be accommodated to the
                    particular nature of the subject concerning which it is the object of the writer
                    to express his sentiments and feelings.</p>
