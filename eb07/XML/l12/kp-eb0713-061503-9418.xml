                    Lyttelton, keeper of the great seal in the reign of Charles I. was eminent for
                    his probity and moderation at the commencement of that monarch’s disputes with
                    his subjects. Without forfeiting his fidelity to the king, he preserved the
                    esteem of the parliament until the year 1644, when he was made colonel of a
                    regiment in the king’s army at York. He died in 1645. Besides several of his
                    speeches, which have been printed, he wrote reports in the Common Pleas and
                    Exchequer, printed at London in 1683, in folio; several arguments and
                    discourses; and various other things.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lyttelton,</hi><hi rend="italic">George Lord,</hi> eldest
                    son of Sir Thomas Lyttelton, descended from the great Judge Lyttelton, was born
                    in 1700, at seven months. The midwife, supposing him to be dead, threw him
                    carelessly into the cradle, where, had not some signs of life been noticed by
                    one of the attendants, he might never have recovered. He received <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193209431" xml:id="kp-eb0713-9431-0616"/>the elements of his education
                    at Eton school, where he showed an early inclination to poetry. His pastorals
                    and some other light pieces were originally written in that seminary of
                    learning. He was removed from thence to the university of Oxford, where he
                    pursued his classical studies with uncommon avidity, and sketched the plan of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Persian Letters</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a work which
                    afterwards procured him great reputation, not only from the elegance of the
                    language in which the letters were composed, but from the excellent observations
                    they contained on the manners of mankind.</p>
                <p>In the year 1728, he set out on the tour of Europe; and, upon his arrival at
                    Paris, accidentally became acquainted with the Honourable Mr Poyntz, then our
                    minister at the court of Versailles, who was so much struck with the
                    extraordinary capacity of the young traveller, that he invited him to his house,
                    and employed him in many political negociations, which he executed with great
                    judgment and fidelity.</p>
                <p>Mr Lyttelton’s excellent conduct whilst on his travels was a lesson of
                    instruction to the rest of his countrymen. Instead of lounging away his hours at
                    the coffee-houses frequented by the English, and adopting the fashionable
                    follies and vices of France and Italy, his time was passed alternately in his
                    library and in the society of men of rank and literature. In this early part of
                    his life, he wrote a poetical epistle to Dr Ayscough, and another to Mr Pope,
                    both evincing singular taste and correctness.</p>
                <p>After continuing a considerable time at Paris with Mr Poyntz, who, to use his own
                    words, behaved like a second father to him, he proceeded to Lyons and Geneva;
                    and thence went to Turin, where he was honoured with flattering marks of
                    attention by his Sardinian majesty. He then visited Milan, Venice, and Genoa,
                    and finally established himself at Rome, where he applied himself closely to the
                    study of the fine arts, and, even in that celebrated metropolis, was allowed to
                    be a perfect judge of painting, sculpture, and architecture.</p>
                <p>During his continuance abroad, he constantly corresponded with his father, Sir
                    Thomas Lyttelton. Several of his letters yet remain, and place his filial
                    affection in a very distinguished light. He soon afterwards returned to his
                    native country, and being elected representative for the burgh of Ockhampton in
                    Devonshire, he conducted himself so much to the satisfaction of his
                    constituents, that they several times re-elected him for the same place, without
                    putting him to the least expense.</p>
                <p>About this period, he received great marks of friendship from Frederick prince of
                    Wales, and was, in the year 1737, appointed principal secretary to his royal
                    highness, and continued in the strictest intimacy with him till the time of his
                    death. In the year 1742, he married Lucy, the daughter of Mr Hugh Fortescue of
                    Filleigh, in the county of Devon; a lady whose exemplary conduct, and uniform
                    practice of religion and virtue, established his conjugal happiness upon the
                    most solid basis.</p>
                <p>In 1744, he was appointed one of the lords commissioners of the Treasury; and,
                    during his continuance in that station, constantly exerted his influence in
                    rewarding merit and ability. He was the friend and patron of Fielding, Thomson,
                    Mallet, Young, Hammond, West, Pope, and Voltaire. On the death of Thomson, who
                    left his affairs in a very embarrassed condition, Mr Lyttelton took that poet’s
                    sister under his protection. He revised the tragedy of Coriolanus, to which that
                    writer had not put the last hand; and brought it out at the theatre-royal,
                    Covent Garden, with a prologue of his own composition, in which he so
                    affectingly lamented the loss of that delightful bard, that not only Mr Quin,
                    who spoke the lines, but almost the whole audience, spontaneously burst into
                    tears.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the year 1746, his felicity was interrupted by the loss of
                    his wife, who died in the twenty-ninth year of her age, leaving him a son and
                    daughter. He wrote a monody on her death, which will be remembered whilst
                    conjugal affection and a taste for poetry exist in this country.</p>
                <p>His masterly observations on the conversion and apostleship of St Paul were
                    written at the desire ofMr Gilbert West, in consequence of Mr Lyttelton’s
                    asserting, that besides all the proofs of the Christian religion which might be
                    drawn from the prophecies of the Old Testament, from the necessary connection it
                    has with the whole system of the Jewish religion, from the miracles of Christ,
                    and from the evidence given of his resurrection by all the other apostles, he
                    thought the conversion of St Paul alone, duly considered, was of itself a
                    demonstration sufficient to prove that Christianity was a divine revelation. Mr
                    West was struck with the thought, and assured his friend, that so compendious a
                    proof would be of great use to convince those unbelievers who would not attend
                    to a longer series of arguments; and time has shown that he was not mistaken in
                    his conjecture, as the tract is esteemed one of the best defences of
                    Christianity which has hitherto been published.</p>
                <p>In 1754, he resigned his office of lord of the Treasury, and was made cofferer to
                    his majesty’s household, and sworn a member of the privy council; previously to
                    which, he married a second time, Elizabeth, daughter of Fieldmarshal Sir Robert
                    Rich, a lady whose indiscreet conduct gave him great uneasiness, and from whom
                    he was separated, by mutual consent, a few years after his marriage.</p>
                <p>After being appointed chancellor, and under-treasurer of the court of exchequer,
                    he was, by letters-patent dated the 19th of November 1757 (31 Geo. II.), created
                    a peer of Great Britain, by the style and title of Lord Lyttelton, •baron of
                    Frankley, in the county of Worcester. His speeches on the Scotch and mutiny
                    bills in the year 1747, on the Jewish bill in 1753, and on the privilege of
                    parliament in 1763, showed sound judgment, powerful eloquence, and inflexible
                    integrity. During the last ten years he lived chiefly in retirement, in the
                    continual exercise of all the virtues which ennoble private life. His last work
                    was <hi rend="italic">Dialogues of the Dead,</hi> in which the morality of
                    Fénélon and the spirit of Fontenelle are happily united.</p>
                <p>In the middle of July 1773, he was suddenly seized with an inflammation of the
                    bowels, which terminated in his death, at his seat near Hagley, on the 22d of
                    that month. A complete collection of his works was published after his decease,
                    by his nephew, Mr George Ayscough.</p>
