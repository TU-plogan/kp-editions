                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">LEVELLING</label> may be defined the art which enables us to
                    find a line or surface exactly level, as also to find how much higher or lower
                    any given point on the surface of the earth is than another.</p>
                <p>The practice of levelling, therefore, consists, 1. in finding and marking two or
                    more points that shall be on a level, as already defined; 2. in comparing the
                    points thus found with other points, to ascertain the difference in their
                    heights or levels, for the purpose of making roads, conducting water, draining
                    low grounds, rendering rivers navigable, forming canals, and the like.</p>
                <p>With regard to the theory of levelling, we must observe, that a plumb-line,
                    hanging freely in the air, marks the direction of gravity, and a line drawn at
                    right angles to the direction of the plumb-line, and touching the earth’s
                    surface, is a true level only on that particular spot; but if this line which
                    crosses the plumb be continued for any considerable length, it will rise above
                    the earth’s surface, and the apparent level will be above the true one, because
                    the earth is globular; and this rising will be as the square of the distance to
                    which the said right line is produced; that is to say, it is raised eight inches
                    very nearly above the earth’s surface at one mile’s distance; four times as
                    much, or thirty-two inches, at the distance <pb break="no" facs="nls:193204803"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-4803-0260"/>of two miles; nine times, or seventy-two inches,
                    at the distance of three, &amp;c. This is owing to the globular figure of the
                    earth; and this rising is the difference betwixt the true and apparent levels;
                    the curve of the earth be· ing the true level, and the tangent to it the
                    apparent level. Hence it appears, that the less distance we take betwixt any two
                    stations, the truer will be our operations in levelling; and so soon does the
                    difference between the true and 'apparent levels become perceptible, that it is
                    necessary to make an allowance for it if the distance betwixt the two stations
                    exceeds two chains.</p>
                <p>Let BD be a small portion of the earth’s circumference, whose centre of curvature
                    is A, and consequently all the points of this arch will be on a level. But a
                    tangent BC meeting the vertical line AD in C, will be the apparent level at the
                    point B; and therefore DC is the difference between the apparent and true level
                    at the point B. The distance CD, therefore, must be deducted from the observed
                    height, to have the true difference of level, or the difference between the
                    distances of two points from the surface of the earth, or from the centre of
                    curvature A. But we shall afterwards see how this correction may be avoided
                    altogether in certain cases.</p>
                <p>To find an expression for CD, we have (Euclid, iii. 36) BC <hi rend="superscript"
                    > 2</hi> = CD (2 AD + CD). But since in all cases of levelling CD is exceedingly
                    small compared with 2 AD, we may safely neglect CD <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>, and then BC <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = 2 AD ×</p>
                <p>BC <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi></p>
                <p>CD, or CD = Hence the depres-</p>
                <p>sion of the true level is equal to the square of the distance divided by twice
                    the radius of the curvature of the earth. If we take the mean radius of the
                    earth as the mean radius of its curvature, and consequently 2 AD = 7912 miles,
                    then 5280 feet being one mile, we shall have CD the depression in inch- 5280 ×
                    12 × <hi rend="smallcaps">BCž</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> onno

                </table>
                <p>A table sufficiently large to embrace every case, by simply taking proportional
                    parts between its numbers, would occupy several pages; but the formula is of
                    general application. However, when the distance is in miles, eight times its
                    square will be very nearly the depression in inches, or two thirds of the same
                    square the depression in feet. When the distance is in chains, a convenient rule
                    for many ordinary purposes is to divide its square by 800; the quotient is very
                    nearly the depression in inches. In this manner was computed the following table
                    of the curvature of the earth :—</p>

                <p>The preceding formulae and tables suppose the visual ray CB to be a straight
                    line; whereas, on account of the unequal densities of the air at different
                    distances from the earth, the rays of light are incurvated by refraction. The
                    effect of this is to lessen the difference between the true and apparent levels,
                    but in such an extremely variable and uncertain manner, that if any constant or
                    fixed allowance is made for it in formulae or tables, it will often lead to a
                    greater error than what it was intended to obviate. For, though the refraction
                    may at a mean compensate for about a seventh of the curvature of the earth, it
                    sometimes exceeds a fifth, and at other times does not amount to a fifteenth. We
                    have therefore made no allowance for refraction in these tables or formulae; but
                    we shall presently see how its effects may frequently be obviated.</p>
                <p>Levelling is either simple or compound. The former is when the level points are
                    determined from one station, whether the level be fixed at one of the points or
                    between them. Compound levelling is nothing more than a repetition of many
                    simple operations.</p>
                <p>An example of simple levelling is given Plate CCCXXH∙ fig. 7, where A, B are the
                    station-points of the level; C, D the two points ascertained. Let the height
                    from A to C be six feet, and from B to D nine feet, the difference is three feet
                    which B is lower than A.</p>
                <p>Had the station-points of the level been above the line of sight, and the
                    distance from A to C been six feet, ana from B to D nine feet, the difference
                    would still have been three feet which B was higher than A.</p>
                <p>But when the distance between the stations is consι-derable, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193204816" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4816-0261"/>we must provide for the
                    effects of the curvature of the earth and of the refraction of the atmosphere.
                    As to the former, it may be readily ascertained by the tables and formulae given
                    above, provided we know the distance; and we shall presently show how it may be
                    frequently compensated for, or avoided altogether. But the refraction is so
                    extremely variable, 'that it cannot be disposed of with the like certainty,
                    though there are several ways in which its effects may often be avoided or
                    compensated in a great measure along with those of curvature, as we shall now
                    explain. If the levelling instrument, instead of being placed at the one station
                    and directed to the other, were set either in the middle between or at equal
                    distances from both stations, such instrument, properly adjusted, being directed
                    first to the one station and then to the other, would, by means of the
                    intersection of the wires, mark upon the poles at these stations two points,
                    which would either be exactly on a level, or would differ only in a small
                    degree, owing to some slight inequality in the refractions. For if, on account
                    of the joint effects of curvature and refraction, the point observed on the one
                    pole were, for example, six feet above the level of the instrument itself, the
                    same must obviously hold of the point observed on the other pole, so far at
                    least as the curvature of the earth is concerned; and unless the refraction be
                    different on the different sides of the instrument (which may sometimes happen
                    in a small degree), the points marked on the two poles must be on a level.
                    InŢliis way, it is obvious, that were it not for the figure of the earth being
                    slightly spheroidal, the effect of curvature would be entirely avoided, and that
                    of refraction very nearly.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, in place of using two poles and one levelling instrument, two of the
                    latter are employed simultaneously at equal distances from the same pole. In
                    that case the difference in the heights of the points which they mark upon it
                    should be equal to the difference in the heights of the instruments themselves,
                    were it not for the source of slight inaccuracy already stated.</p>
                <p>To facilitate the operations just mentioned, there is in the telescopes of some
                    levels a semi-transparent micrometer scale instead of wires. This having its
                    graduated edge crossing the axis at right angles, readily affords the means of
                    approximately estimating equal distances from the stations or from the levelling
                    instrument, without actual measurement. For this purpose an assistant at some
                    distance holds up a pole so as to be parallel to said scale, while the observer,
                    viewing the pole through the telescope, notices how many divisions it subtends
                    on the scale; and, of course, in whatever manner the positions of the assistant
                    or telescope are varied, if the same length of pole held parallel to the scale
                    subtends the same part of it, the distance between them must be the same.</p>
                <p>But where great accuracy is required, a somewhat different and greatly preferable
                    mode of avoiding the effects of curvature and refraction is by reciprocal
                    levelling; which consists in two observers simultaneously taking the levels from
                    the opposite ends of the same range, each having a levelling instrument placed
                    close by the stationpole of the other. Thus, supposing the effects of refraction
                    to be alike in both directions, it is evident that the difference in the heights
                    of telescopes placed horizontally at T and <hi rend="italic">t</hi> must equal
                    the difference in the heights of the points P and <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> to
                    which these telescopes are respectively directed on the opposite station-poles
                    PS and <hi rend="italic">ps</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> so that <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> is as much below the level of P as <hi rend="italic">t</hi>
                    is lower than T, and therefore Pz —pT is double the difference in the levels of
                    T and <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> or of P and <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> A great
                    recommendation to this method is, that it does not require the distance between
                    T and <hi rend="italic">t</hi> to be known. But it readily affords the means of
                    ascertaining the effect of refraction separately when the distance is known,
                    because that is equal to the excess of the effect of the earth’s curvature over
                    the difference in the levels of T and P.</p>
                <p>When the levelling instruments in the reciprocal method admit of their telescopes
                    being elevated or depressed from a state of parallelism with the spirit-levels,
                    and are likewise provided with the means of measuring such deviation; then, if
                    each telescope be directed exactly to the other, the two angles which the axes
                    of the telescopes make with the respective vertical lines, together with the
                    horizontal angle (or that which these verticals form with each other), must
                    obviously exceed 180° by the sum of the refractions in both directions. This,
                    however, is more properly applicable to the mensuration of great differences of
                    level by a trigonometrical process than to ordinary levelling. But neither this
                    nor any other method yet known gives the exact values of the two refractions
                    separately. It only gives their sum, still leaving some little uncertainty as to
                    the separate or proper value of each refraction.</p>
                <p>As an example of compound levelling, suppose it were required to know the
                    difference of height between the points A and N, fig. 8. In this operation
                    stakes or pegs should be driven down at A and Ń, nearly level with the surface;
                    and should be so fixed, that they may not be changed until the whole operation
                    is finished. A plan of the ground between the proposed points A and N should
                    then be made, by which will be discovered the shortest way between them, and
                    whence, too, the number of stations necessary to be taken will be determined.
                    The operator will also be able to distribute them properly according to the
                    nature and situation of the ground. In the figure twelve stations are marked.
                    Stakes or pegs ought to be driven in at the limits of each station, as A, B, C,
                    D, &amp;c. They ought to be two or three inches above the ground, and driven
                    firmly into it; but where rock occurs, it may be sufficient to make a mark on
                    it. Stakes should also be driven in at each station of the instrument, as 1, 2,
                    3, 4, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The operation may be begun in the following manner. Let the first station be at
                    1, equally distant from the two points A and B, which themselves are distant 166
                    yards. Write down then in one column the first limit A, with the number of feet,
                    inches, and tenths, which the point of sight indicated on the station-staff at
                    A, viz. seven feet six inches; in the second column, the second limit B, with
                    the height indicated at the station-staff B, viz. six feet; lastly, in the third
                    column, the distance from one stationstaff to the other, which in this caseis
                    166yards. Remove now the level to the point marked 2, which is in the middle
                    between B and C, the two places where the stationstaves are to be held;
                    observing that B, which was the second limit in the former operation, is the
                    first in this. Then write down the observed heights as before; in the first
                    column B with four feet six inches; in the second, C with five feet six inches
                    -⅛ths; in the third, 560 yards, the distance between B and C.</p>
                <p>Should it be impossible, on account of the inequality of the ground at the third
                    station, to place the instrument in the middle between the two station-staves,
                    find the most convenient point, as at 3; then measure exactly how far this is
                    from each station-staff, as, for instance, from 3 to C 160 yards; from 3 to D 80
                    yards; and the remainder of the operation will be as in the preceding
                    station.</p>
                <p>In the fourth operation, we must endeavour to compensate for any error which
                    might have happened in the last, from the instrument not being in the middle
                    between, or <pb break="no" facs="nls:193204829" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4829-0262"/>at
                    equal·distances from the-stations. Mark out, therefore, 80 yards from the
                    station-staff D to the point 4, and 160 yards from 4 to E; and this must be
                    carefully attended to, as by such compensations the work may be much
                    facilitated. Proceed in the same manner with the eight remaining stations,
                    observing to enter everything in its proper column. If all the ascents are not
                    in one column by themselves, and all the descents in another, regard must be had
                    to the proper signs of these quantities, which is rather more troublesome. And
                    when the whole is finished, sum each column separately, and then subtract the
                    less from the greater; the difference, which in the present case is 5 feet 4
                    inches ⅛ths, shows the ground at N to be thus much lower than at A.</p>
                <p>To obtain a section of this level, draw the dotted line 0 0, fig. 8, either above
                    or bclow the plan, which may be taken for the level or horizontal line. Let fall
                    then perpendiculars upon this line from all the station-points and places where
                    the station-staves were fixed. Beginning now at A, set off 7 feet 6 inches upon
                    the vertical line from A to <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for
                    the height of the level point determined on the staff at this place, draw a line
                    through <hi rend="italic">a</hi> parallel to the dotted line 00, which will cut
                    the third perpendicular at <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> the second station-staff.
                    Set off from this point downwards six feet to B, which shows the second limit of
                    the first operation; and that the ground at B is one foot six inches higher than
                    at A: place your instrument between these two lines at the height of the level
                    line, and trace the ground according to its different heights. Now set off, on
                    the second station-staff B, four feet six inches to C, the height determined by
                    the level at the second station; and from C draw a line parallel to 0 0, which
                    will cut the fifth perpendicular at <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> the third
                    station-staff. From this point set off five feet six inches ⅛ths downwards to C,
                    which will be our second limit with respect to the preceding one, and third with
                    respect to the first. Then draw your instrument in the middle between B and C,
                    and delineate the ground, with its inequalities. Proceed in the same manner from
                    station to station, till you arrive at the last N, and you will have the profile
                    of the ground over which the level was taken.</p>
                <p>This method answers very well where only a general profile of the different
                    stations is required; but where, for some special purpose, it is necessary to
                    have an exact detail of the ground between the limits, we must go to work more
                    particularly. Suppose, therefore, the level to have been taken from A to N by
                    another route, but on more uniform ground, in order to form a canal. Draw at
                    pleasure a line to represent the level, and regulate the rest; then let fall on
                    this line perpendiculars to represent the staves at the limits of each station,
                    taking care that they be fixed accurately at their respective distances from
                    each other. The difference between the extreme limits in this case ought to be
                    the same as in the former, viz. five feet four inches -^θths. Set off this
                    measure upon the perpendicular of the first limit; and from it, prolonging the
                    perpendicular, mark off the height determined at the first station-staff. Do the
                    same with the second and third, and so on with the rest, till this part of the
                    work is finished; there remains then only to delineate in detail the ground
                    between the station-staves. Sometimes a series of stakes is fixed in the ground,
                    of such various lengths that all their tops are on a level. This, however, can
                    only be done where the difference of level is small; and is used rather with the
                    view of regulating some works to be executed or erected along the line, than for
                    the mere purpose of levelling.</p>
                <p>Fig. 9 gives an example of compound levelling, where the situation is so steep
                    and mountainous, that the staves cannot be placed at equal distances from the
                    instrument, or where it is even impossible to make a reciprocal levelling from
                    one station to the other. Thus, suppose the point. K to be the bottom of a basin
                    where it is required to make a fountain, the reservoir being at A; so that, in
                    order to know the height to which the jet d’eau will rise, it is necessary to
                    know how much the point A is above K.</p>
                <p>In great heights such as this, it will be necessary to proceed by small descents
                    or ascents, as from A to B, or C. The instrument must be adjusted with all
                    possible care; and it may even be proper, in some part of the work, to use a
                    smaller instrument. The following is a table of the different operations used in
                    making this level.</p>

                <p>In this case only two levellings are supposed to be made between A and D, though
                    more were necessary; but they are omitted to avoid confusion. In the fourth
                    station the height found was sixteen feet eight inches; but, on account of the
                    great length, it was requisite to reduce the apparent level to the true one. At
                    the last limit we get the height from <hi rend="italic">n</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">o</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> then from o to I; from I to K; all
                    which added together, and then corrected for the curvature, give forty-seven
                    feet three inches. Now, by summing each column separately, and subtracting one
                    from the other, we have fifty-one feet three inches for the height which the
                    point A is above the bottom of the basin, and which will cause the jet d’eau to
                    rise forty-five feet. The figure shows only the general section of this
                    operation, but an exact profile of the mountain is more difficult, as requiring
                    many operations; though some of these might be obtained by measuring from the
                    level line without moving the instrument.</p>
                <p>When the principal limits of the levelling have been determined and fixed, it
                    only remains to find the level between the limits, according to the methods
                    already pointed out, using every advantage that may contribute to the success of
                    the work, and at the same time avoiding all obstacles and difficulties that may
                    retard or injure the operations. The first rule is always to take the shortest
                    possible route from one limit to another, though this rule ought not to be
                    followed if there are considerable obstacles in the way, as hills, woods, marshy
                    ground, or if, by going aside, any advantage can be obtained. It may sometimes
                    be useful to deviate very considerably from the general rule, in order to take
                    in ponds, the surfaces of which, except during storms, might all be taken as
                    perfectly level; and thus levels are frequently taken across the country for a
                    considerable way.</p>
                <p>Farther information connected with the practice of levelling will be found under
                    the articles relating to Canals, Inland Navigation, Railroads, Surveying,
                    &amp;c.; as also in the various accounts which have been published of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Trigonometrwal Survey,</hi> and in other works on similar
                    subjects.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Levelling-</hi><hi rend="italic">Staves,</hi>
                    instruments used in levelling, serving to support the marks to be observed, and
                    at the same time to measure the heights of those marks from the ground. They
                    usually consist of mahogany staves ten feet long, each being in two parts, which
                    slide in upon <pb break="no" facs="nls:193204842" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4842-0263"
                    />one another to about 5A feet, for the more convenient carriage. They are
                    divided into small equal parts, and numbered at every tenth division by 10, 20,
                    30, &amp;c. as in figure 6; and on one side the feet and inches, or tenths, are
                    also sometimes marked. These staves are likewise frequently called <hi
                    rend="italic">levelling poles, station-poles,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >station-staves.</hi></p>
                <p>A vane A slides up and down each of these staves, and by brass springs will stand
                    at any part. These vanes are about ten inches long and four inches broad; and
                    are painted with stripes of white and black alternately. They have each a brass
                    wire across a square hole in the centre, which serves to point out the height
                    correctly, by coinciding with the horizontal wire of the telescope of the
                    level.</p>
