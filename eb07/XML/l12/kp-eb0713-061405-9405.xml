                <p><label type="entry">LYSIAS</label>, one of the most celebrated of the Greek
                    orators, was born at Athens 458 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi> and died, at
                    the age of eighty, B. c. 378. He was the contemporary of some of the greatest
                    men that Athens ever produced, of Thucydides and Xenophon, of Euripides and
                    Sophocles. He was the son of Cephalus, a Syracusan, and is himself sometimes
                    said to have been a native of this city; but he was born at Athens, whither his
                    father was induced to emigrate by the advice of his friend Pericles. Cephalus
                    was distinguished both for his great riches and for his virtues. It was at his
                    house that Plato placed the scene of the most celebrated of his works, his
                    Dialogues on the Republic. Cephalus no doubt procured the best masters to
                    forward the education of his son; but Lysias left Athens at a very early age <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi> 443), and proceeded to Thurium in the south of
                    Italy, to which place the Athenians were sending a colony. He was accompanied by
                    the two celebrated historians Herodotus and Thucydides, and remained there for
                    many years, during which time he is said to have studied the art of eloquence
                    under two Syracusans, Tisias and Nisias. After the unsuccessful expedition of
                    the Athenians to Sicily <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.</hi> c. 413), it would appear
                    that Thurium, with their other dependencies in Magna Graecia, refused to submit
                    any longer to Athenian supremacy. All those who remained well affected towards
                    the parent state were obliged to fly, and Lysias on that occasion <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi> 411) returned with his brother Polemarchus to
                    Athens. Here he employed himself in commercial pursuits, and we are told that
                    the two brothers employed one hundred and twenty slaves in the manufacture of
                    shields. We do not hear that he took any active part in the stormy politics of
                    Athens, now approaching the conclusion of her war with Sparta. Athens fell into
                    the hands of Lysander, and thirty tyrants were appointed to administer the
                    affairs of the city. The patriotism and riches of Polemarchus and of his brother
                    Lysias marked them out as fit objects for persecution to the tyrants.
                    Polemarchus was put to death, and Lysias with great difficulty saved his life by
                    flying to Megara <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.</hi> c. 404). Here he engaged in the
                    conspiracy to restore the independence of his country, and is said to have
                    furnished three hundred men at his own expense to assist Thrasybulus. The
                    tyrants were expellee!, and Lysias returned to Athens <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.
                    c.</hi> 403), where he commenced his new career as an orator. It does not appear
                    that he was much employed in the assemblies of the people, but that he confined
                    himself principally to writing <hi rend="italic">accusations</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">defences,</hi> at the desire of such persons as had occasion to
                    impeach the conduct of others, or to defend their own. As a reward for his
                    services, Thrasybulus proposed to the people that he should be admitted to the
                    freedom of the state; but Archinus procured its rejection, because the proposal
                    had not been made first to the senate, as the law required. Plutarch states that
                    there were extant in his time no less than 475 orations ascribed to Lysias, of
                    which only 235 were genuine, according to Dionysius. We are likewise told that
                    he composed institutions of oratory, epistles, and panegyrics; but of all these
                    writings only thirty-four orations have come down to us, some of which are in an
                    imperfect state. The pleadings of Lysias contain a curious detail of the
                    domestic manners and internal economy of the Greeks. Dionysius of Halicarnassus
                    has written a critique on the works and style of Lysias; and, according to him,
                    the orator was particularly distinguished for simplicity and precision, as well
                    as for the fidelity with which he depicted the manners of the age. Quintilian
                    compares him to a clear and pure rivulet rather than to a majestic river, whilst
                    Cicero considers him as the model of a perfect orator. The earliest edition of
                    the orations of Lysias is that of Aldus, 1513; but the best is that of Taylor,
                    Gr. et Lat. London, 1739, and of Reiske, Leipzig, 1772. The latest edition is by
                    Foertoch (Lips. 1829); and he has also published separately, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observationes</hi><hi rend="italic">criticae in Ly∙ siae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Orationes,</hi> Lips. 1829. See also Franzius, <hi rend="italic"

                    1828. There is an English translation of the Orations by Gillies, London,
                    1778.</p>
