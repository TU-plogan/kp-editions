                    rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Charles,</hi> a celebrated
                    botanist and natural historian, was born on the 24th of May 1707, in a village
                    called Roeshult, in Smaland, where his father, Nicholas Linné or Linnaeus, was
                    then vicar, but afterwards preferred to the curacy of Stenbrohult. It is said,
                    that on the farm where Linnaeus was born there yet stands a large lime tree,
                    from which his ancestors took the surnames of <hi rend="italic">Tiliander,
                    Lindelius,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Linnaeus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    that this origin of surnames, taken from natural objects, is not uncommon in
                    Sweden.</p>
                <p>This eminent man, whose talents enabled him to reform the whole science of
                    natural history, acquired, early in life, some of the highest honours that await
                    the most successful proficients in medical science. We find indeed that he was
                    made professor of physic and botany in the university of Upsala at the age of
                    thirty-four, and, six years afterwards, physician to Adolphus king of Sweden,
                    who in the year 1753 still further honoured him, by creating him knight of the
                    order of the polar star. Nor did his honours terminate here. In 1757 he was
                    ennobled; and in 1776 the king of Sweden accepted the resignation of his office,
                    and rewarded his declining years by doubling his pension, and by a liberal
                    donation of landed property settled on him and his family.</p>
                <p>It seems probable that Linnaeus’s taste for the study of nature was formed from
                    the example of his father, who, as he has himself informed us, cultivated, as
                    his first amusement, a garden plentifully stored with plants. Young Linnaeus
                    soon became acquainted with these, as well as with the indigenous plants of his
                    neighbourhood. Yet, from the smallness of his father’s income, the young
                    naturalist was on the point of being destined to a mechanical employment:
                    fortunately, however, this design was overruled. In 1717 he was sent to school
                    at Wexio, where, as his opportunities were enlarged, his progress in all his
                    favourite pursuits was proportionally extended. At this early period he paid
                    attention to other branches of natural history, particularly to the study of
                    entomology.</p>
                <p>The first part of his academical education Linnaeus received at Lund, in Sweden,
                    under Professor Stobaeus, who favoured his inclination for the study of natural
                    history. After a residence of about a year, he removed in 1728 to Upsala. Here
                    he soon contracted a close friendship with Artedi, a native of the province of
                    Angermania, who had already been four years a student in that university, and,
                    like himself, had a strong bent to the study of natural history in general, but
                    particularly to that of ichthyology. Soon after his residence at Upsala, our
                    author was likewise fortunate enough to obtain the favour of several gentlemen
                    of established character in literature. He was in a particular manner encouraged
                    in the pursuit of his studies by the patronage of Dr Olaus Celsius, at that time
                    professor of divinity, and the restorer of natural history in Sweden; who, being
                    struck with the diligence of Linnaeus in describing the plants of the garden at
                    Upsala, and his extensive knowledge of their names, not only patronized him in a
                    general way, but admitted him to his house, his table, and his library. Under
                    such encouragement, it is not strange that he made a rapid progress, both in his
                    studies and the esteem of the professors; in fact, we have a very striking proof
                    of his merit and attainments, since we find, that, after a residence of only two
                    years, he was thought sufficiently qualified to give lectures occasionally from
                    the botanic chair, in the room of Professor Rudbeck.</p>
                <p>In the year 1731, the Royal Academy of Sciences at Upsala, having for some time
                    meditated the design of improving the natural history of Sweden, at the instance
                    particularly of Professors Celsius and Rudbeck, deputed Linnaeus to make the
                    tour of Lapland, with the view of exploring the natural history of that arctic
                    region; an undertaking to which his reputation, already high as a naturalist,
                    and the strength of his constitution, equally recommended him. He left Upsala on
                    the 13th of May, and took his route to Gevalia or Gevels, the principal town of
                    Gestricia, forty-five miles distant from Upsala. From thence he travelled
                    through Helsingland into Medalpadia, where he made an excursion, and ascended a
                    remarkable mountain before he reached Hudwickswald, the chief town of
                    Helsingland. He then proceeded through Angermanland to Hernosand, a sea-port on
                    the Bothnian Gulf, seventy miles distant from Hudwickswald. When he had advanced
                    thus far, he found it proper to retard his journey, as the spring was not
                    sufficiently advanced, and took this opportunity of visiting those remarkable
                    caverns on the summit of Mount Skula, though at the hazard of his life.</p>
                <p>When Linnaeus arrived at Uma, in West Bothnia, about ninety-six miles from
                    Hernosand, he quitted the public road, and took his course through the woods
                    westward, in order first to traverse the most southern parts of Lapland. Having
                    now reached the country that was more particularly the object of his inquiries,
                    being equally a stranger to the language and to the manners of the people, and
                    without any associate, he committed himself to the hospitality of the
                    inhabitants, and never failed to experience it fully. He speaks in several
                    places, with peculiar satisfaction, of the innocence and simplicity of their
                    lives, and their freedom from diseases. In this excursion he reached the
                    mountains towards Norway; and after encountering great hardships, returned into
                    West Bothnia, quite exhausted with fatigue. He next visited Pitha and Lula, upon
                    the Gulf of Bothnia; from which latter place he again took a western route, by
                    proceeding up the river of that name, and visited the r <hi rend="underline"
                    >uin</hi> s of the temple of Jockmock in Lula Lapland or Lap Mark; he thence
                    traversed what is called the <hi rend="italic">Lapland Desert,</hi> destitute of
                    all villages, cultivation, roads, or any conveniences, and inhabited only by a
                    few straggling people, originally descended from the Finlanders, who settled in
                    this country in remote ages, being entirely a distinct people from the
                    Laplanders. In this district he ascended a noted mountain called Wallevari, in
                    speaking of which he has given us a pleasant relation of his finding a singular
                    and beautiful new plant <hi rend="italic">(Andromeda</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tetragona),</hi> when travelling within the arctic circle, with the sun in his
                    view at midnight, in search of a Lapland hut. From hence he crossed the Lapland
                    Alps into Finmark, and traversed the shores of the North Sea as far as
                    Sallero.</p>
                <p>These journeys from Lula and Pitha on the Bothnian Gulf, to the north shore, were
                    performed on foot; and he was attended by two Laplanders, one his interpreter,
                    and the other his guide. He tells us that the vigour and strength of these two
                    men, both old, and sufficiently loaded with his baggage, excited his admiration,
                    since they appeared quite unfatigued by their labour, whilst he himself,
                    although young and robust, was frequently quite exhausted. In this journey he
                    was wont to sleep under the boat with which they forded the rivers, as a defence
                    against rain, and the gnats, which in the Lapland summer are not less teasing
                    than in the torrid zone. In descending one of these rivers, he narrowly escaped
                    perishing by the oversetting of the boat, and lost many of the natural
                    productions which he had collected.</p>
                <p>Linnaeus thus spent the greater part of the summer in examining this arctic
                    region, and those mountains on which, four years afterwards, the French
                    philosophers secured immortal fame to Sir Isaac Newton. At length, after having
                    suffered incredible fatigues and hardships, in climbing precipices, passing
                    rivers in miserable boats, suffering repeated vicissitudes of heat and cold, and
                    not unfrequently hunger and thirst, he returned to Torneo in September. He did
                    not take the same route from Torneo as when he set out for Lapland, having
                    determined to visit and examine the country on the eastern side of the Bothnian
                    Gulf. His first <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206168" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6168-0365"
                    />stage, therefore, was to Ula in East Bothnia, and thence to Old and New
                    Carlebay, eighty-four miles south from Ula. He continued his route through W <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> asa, Christianstadt, and Biorneburg, to Abo, a small
                    university in Finland. Winter was now setting in apace; he therefore crossed the
                    gulf by the island of Aland, and arrived at Upsala in November, after having
                    performed, mostly on foot, a journey of ten degrees of latitude in extent,
                    exclusively of those deviations which such a design rendered necessary.</p>
                <p>In 1733 he visited and examined the several mines in Sweden, and made himself so
                    well acquainted with mineralogy and the docimastic art, that he was sufficiently
                    qualified to give lectures on these subjects upon his return to the university.
                    The outlines of his system of mineralogy appeared in the early editions of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Systema</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but he did not exemplify the whole until the year 1768.</p>
                <p>In the year 1734* Linnaeus was sent by Baron Reuter - holm, governor of
                    Dalecarlia, with several other naturalists in that province, to investigate the
                    physical productions of that part of the Swedish dominions; and it was in this
                    journey that he first laid the plan of an excellent institution, which was
                    afterwards executed, in a certain degree at least, by himself, with the
                    assistance of many of his pupils, and the result published under the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">Pan Suecicus,</hi> in the second volume of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Amaenitates Academicae.</hi></p>
                <p>After the completion of this expedition, it appears that Linnaeus resided for a
                    time at Fahlun; the principal town in Dalecarlia, where he tells us that he
                    taught mineralogy and the docimastic art, and practised physic; and where he was
                    very hospitably treated by Dr More, the physician of the place. It also appears
                    that he contracted at this time an intimacy with one of that gentleman’s
                    daughters, whom he married about five years afterwards, upon his settling as a
                    physician at Stockholm. In this journey he extended his travels quite across the
                    Dalecarlian Alps into Norway; but we have no particular account of his
                    discoveries in that kingdom. In 1735 Linnaeus travelled over many other parts of
                    Sweden, some parts of Denmark and Germany, and fixed in Holland, where he
                    chiefly resided until his return ∙to Stockholm, about the year 1739. In 1735,
                    the year in which he took the degree of doctor of physic, he published the first
                    sketch of his <hi rend="italic">Systema</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturoe,</hi> in a
                    very compendious way, and in the form of tables, only in twelve pages in folio.
                    By this it appears that he had at a very early period of his life, certainly
                    before he was twenty-four years of age, laid the basis of that great structure
                    which he afterwards raised, not only to the increase of his own fame, but to
                    that of natural science.</p>
                <p>In 1736 Linnaeus arrived in England, and visited Dr Dillenius, the learned
                    professor at Oxford, whom he justly considered as one of the first botanists in
                    Europe. He mentions with particular respect the civilities he received from
                    Dillenius, and the privileges he gave him of inspecting his own and the
                    Sherardian collections of plants. It is needless to say, that he visited Dr
                    Martyn, Mr Rand, and Mr Miller, and that he was in a more singular manner
                    indebted to the friendship of Dr Isaac Lawson. He also contracted an intimate
                    friendship with Mr Peter Collinson, which was reciprocally increased by a
                    multitude of good offices, and continued to the last without any diminution. Dr
                    Boerhaave had furnished him with letters to Sir Hans Sloane; but these, it
                    seems, did not procure him the reception which the warmth of his recommendation
                    appeared to claim.</p>
                <p>One of the most agreeable circumstances that happened to Linnaeus during his
                    residence in Holland, arose from the patronage of Mr Clifford, in whose house he
                    lived a considerable part of his time, being now as it were the child of
                    fortune. <hi rend="italic">Exivi</hi><hi rend="italic">patrid</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">triginta</hi><hi rend="italic">sex</hi><hi rend="italic">nummis
                    aureis</hi><hi rend="italic">dives,</hi> are his own words. With Mr Clifford,
                    however, he enjoyed pleasures and advantages scarcely at that time to be met
                    with elsewhere in the world; that of a garden excellently stored with the finest
                    exotics, and a library furnished with almost every botanic author of note. How
                    happy he found himself in this situation, those only who have felt the same kind
                    of ardour can conceive. Whilst in Holland, Linnaeus was recommended by Boerhaave
                    to fill the place, then vacant, of physician to the Dutch settlement at Surinam;
                    but he declined it on account of his having been educated in so opposite a
                    climate.</p>
                <p>Besides being favoured with the particular patronage and friendship of <hi
                    rend="subscript"> l</hi> Boerhaave and Mr Clifford, as has already been
                    mentioned, he had also the pleasure of being contemporary with, and of reckoning
                    amongst the number of his friends, many other learned persons who have since
                    proved ornaments to their profession, and whose merit has most deservedly raised
                    them to fame and honour. Amongst these may be mentioned Dr John Burmann,
                    professor of botany at Amsterdam, whose name and family are well known in the
                    republic of letters, and to whom our author dedicated his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eibliotheca Eotanica,</hi> having been greatly assisted in compiling that work,
                    by the free access he enjoyed to that gentleman’s excellent library; John
                    Frederick Gronovius of Leyden, editor of Clayton’s <hi rend="italic">Flora
                    Virginica,</hi> and who very early adopted Linnaeus’s system; Baron Van Swicten,
                    physician to the empress-queen; Isaac Lawson, afterwards one of the physicians
                    to the British army, who died much regretted, at Oosterhout, in the year 1747,
                    and from whom Linnaeus received singular and most obliging civilities; Kramer,
                    well known for an excellent treatise on the docimastic art; Van Royen, botanic
                    professor at Leyden; and Lieberkun of Berlin, famous for his skill in
                    microscopical instrumentsand experiments. To these may also be added the names
                    of Albinus and Gaubius, and of others, were it requisite to show that our
                    author’s talents had very early rendered him conspi cuous, and gained him the
                    regard of all those who cultivated and patronized any branch of medical science;
                    and to which, doubtless, the singular notice with which Boerhaave had honoured
                    him did not a little contribute.</p>
                <p>Early in the year 1738, after Linnaeus had left Mr Clifford, and, as it should
                    seem, when he resided with Van Royen, he had a long and dangerous attack of
                    sickness; and upon his recovery went to Paris, where he was kindly entertained
                    by the Jussieus, at that time the first botanists in France. The opportunity
                    this gave him of inspecting the <hi rend="italic">Herbaria</hi> of Royen and
                    Tournefort, and those of the above-named gentlemen, afforded him great
                    satisfaction. He had intended to proceed from thence into Germany, to visit
                    Ludwig and Haller, with whom he was in close correspondence; but he was not able
                    to complete this part of his intended route, and was obliged to return without
                    this gratification.</p>
                <p>Our author did not fail to avail himself of the advantages which access to the
                    several museums of this country afforded him, in every branch of natural
                    history; and the number and importance of his publications, during his absence
                    from his native country, sufficiently demonstrate that fund of knowledge which
                    he must have imbibed before, and no less testify his extraordinary application.
                    These were, <hi rend="italic">Systematis</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae,
                    Fundamenta</hi><hi rend="italic">Botanica,</hi><hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca
                    Eotanica,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Genera Plantarum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> the last of which is justly considered as the most valuable of all the
                    works of this celebrated author. The immense application bestowed upon it the
                    reader may easily conceive, when he is informed, that before the publication of
                    the first edition the author had examined the characters of eight thousand
                    flowers. The last book of Linnaeus’s composition, published during his stay in
                    Holland, was the <hi rend="italic">Classes Plantarum,</hi> which is a copious
                    illustration of the second part of the <hi rend="italic">Fundamenta.</hi></p>
                <p>About the latter end of the year 1738, or the begin <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193206181" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6181-0366"/>ning of the next, Linnaeus
                    settled as a physician at Stockholm, where he seems to have met with
                    considerable opposition, and was oppressed by many difficulties; but all of
                    these he at length overcame, and got into extensive practice; and, soon after
                    his settlement, married the lady before mentioned. By the interest of Count
                    Tessin, who was afterwards his great patron, and even procured medals to be
                    struck in honour of him, he obtained the rank of physician to the fleet, and a
                    stipend from the citizens for giving lectures in botany. And what at this time
                    especially was highly favourable to the advancement of his character and fame,
                    by giving him an opportunity of displaying his abilities, was the establishment
                    of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholm, of which Linnaeus was constituted
                    the first president, and to which the king granted several privileges,
                    particularly that of free postage to all papers directed to the secretary. By
                    the rules of the academy, the president held his place but three months. At the
                    expiration of that term, Linnaeus made his <hi rend="italic">Oratio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">memorabilibus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi><hi rend="italic">Insectis,</hi> on the 3d of October 1739; in which he
                    endeavours to excite an attention and inquiry into the knowledge of insects, by
                    displaying the many singular phenomena that occur in contemplating the nature of
                    those animals, and by pointing out, in a variety of instances, their usefulness
                    to mankind in particular, and to the economy of nature in general.</p>
                <p>During all this time, however, Linnaeus appears to have had his eye fixed upon
                    the botanical and medical chair at Upsala, then occupied by Rudbeck, who was far
                    advanced in life. We learn indeed that he was so intent on pursuing and
                    perfecting his great designs in the advancement of his favourite study of
                    nature, that he had determined, if he failed in procuring the professorship at
                    Upsala, to accept the offer which had been made to him by Haller, of filling the
                    botanic chair at Göttingen. However, in course of time, he obtained his wish. In
                    the year 1741, upon the resignation of Roberg, he was constituted joint
                    professor of physic, and physician to the king, with Rosen, who had been
                    appointed in the preceding year on the death of Rudbeck. These two colleagues
                    agreed to divide the medical departments between them; and their choice was
                    confirmed by the university. Rosen took anatomy, physiology, pathology, and the
                    therapeutic part; Linnaeus, natural history, botany, materia medica, dietetics,
                    and the diagnosis morborum.</p>
                <p>During the interval of his removal from Stockholm to Upsala, in consequence of
                    this appointment, our professor was deputed by the states of the kingdom to make
                    a tour to the islands of Oeland and Gothland in the Baltic, attended by six of
                    the pupils, commissioned to make such inquiries as might tend to improve
                    agriculture and arts in the kingdom, to which the Swedish nation had for some
                    time paid particular attention. The result of this journey was very successful,
                    and having proved fully satisfactory to the states, was afterwards communicated
                    to the public. On his return he entered upon the professorship, and on the 17th
                    of October pronounced before the university his oration <hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">Peregrinationum</hi><hi rend="italic">intra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Patriam</hi><hi rend="italic">necessitate,</hi> in which he
                    forcibly displays the usefulness of such excursions, by pointing out to the
                    students that vast field of objects which their country held out to their
                    cultivation, whether in geography, physics, mineralogy, botany, zoology, or
                    economics, and by showing the benefit that must accrue to themselves and their
                    country as rewards of their diligence. The animated spirit which pervades the
                    whole of this composition renders it one of the most pleasing and instructive of
                    all our author’s productions.</p>
                <p>Linnaeus was now fixed in the situation which was the best adapted to his
                    character, his taste, and abilities; and which seems to have been the object of
                    his ambition and the centre of his hopes. Soon after his establishment, he
                    laboured to get the academical garden, which had been founded in 1657, put upon
                    a better footing, and very soon effected it, procuring also a house to be built
                    for the residence of the professor. The whole had been in ruins ever since the
                    fire in 1702; and at the time Linnaeus was appointed professor of botany, the
                    garden did not contain above fifty plants that were exotic. His correspondence
                    with the first botanists in Europe soon supplied him with great variety. He
                    received Indian plants from Jussieu of Paris, and from Van Royen of Leyden;
                    European plants from Haller and Ludwig: American plants from Mr Collinson, Mr
                    Catesby and others; and a variety of annuals from Dillenius; in short, how much
                    the garden owed to his diligence and care in a few years, may be seen ‘by the
                    catalogue published under the title of <hi rend="italic">Hortus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Upsaliensis,</hi><hi rend="italic">exhibens plantas exoticas horto

                    8vo. By this catalogue it appears that the professor had introduced eleven
                    hundred species, exclusively of all the Swedish plants and varieties, which, in
                    ordinary gardens, amount not unfrequently to one third of the whole number. The
                    preface contains a curious history of the climate at Upsala, and the progress of
                    the seasons throughout the whole year.</p>
                <p>From the time that Linnaeus and Rosen were appointed professors at Upsala, it
                    should seem that the credit of that university, as a school of physic, had been
                    increasing: numbers of students resorted thither from Germany, attracted by the
                    character of these two able men; and in Sweden itself many young men were
                    invited to the study of physic by the excellent manner in which it was taught,
                    who otherwise would have engaged in different pursuits.</p>
                <p>Whilst Linnaeus was meditating one of his capital performances, which had long
                    been expected and greatly wished for, he was interrupted by a tedious and
                    painful attack of the gout, which left him in a very weak and dispirited state;
                    and, according to the intelligence which his friends gave of him, nothing was
                    thought to have contributed more to the restoration of his spirits than the
                    seasonable acquisition, at this juncture, of a collection of rare and
                    undescribed plants.</p>
                <p>The fame which our author had now acquired by his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Systema</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae,</hi> of which a sixth edition, much
                    enlarged, had been published at Stockholm in 1748, in 8vo, with eight tables
                    explanatory of the classes and orders, had brought, as it were, a conflux of
                    every thing rare and valuable in every branch of nature, from all parts of the
                    globe, into Sweden. The king and queen of Sweden had their separate collections
                    of rarities, the former at Ul-ricksdahl, and the latter, very rich in exotic
                    insects and shells, procured at a great expense, at the palace of
                    Drott-ningholm, both of which our author was employed in arranging and
                    describing. Besides these, the museum of the Royal Academy of Upsala had been
                    augmented by a considerable donation from the king, whilst hereditary prince, in
                    1746, by another from Count Gyllenborg the year before, and by a third from Μ.
                    Grill, an opulent citizen of Stockholm.</p>
                <p>From this time the professor appeared in a more elevated rank and situation in
                    life. His reputation had already procured him honours from almost all the royal
                    societies in Europe; and his own sovereign, sensible of his merit, and greatly
                    esteeming his character and abilities, favoured him with a mark of his
                    distinction and regard, by creating him a knight of the polar star. With
                    science, it was no longer <hi rend="italic">laudatur et alget.</hi> His
                    emoluments kept pace with his fame and honours; his practice in his profession
                    became lucrative; and we find him soon after possessed of a country-house and
                    gardens atHammarby, about <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206194"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-6194-0367"/>. five miles from Upsala. He had moreover received
                    one of the most flattering testimonies of the extent and magnitude of his fame
                    that perhaps was ever shown to any literary character, the state of the nation
                    which conferred it, and all its circumstances, being duly considered. This was
                    an invitation to Madrid from the king of Spain, there to preside as a
                    naturalist, with the offer of an annual pension for life of two thousand
                    pistoles, letters of nobility, and the perfect free exercise of his own
                    religion. But, after the most perfect acknowledgments of the singular honour
                    done him, he respectfully answered, “that if he had any merits, they were due to
                    his own country.”</p>
                <p>In the year 1755, the Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholm honoured our
                    professor with one of the first premiums, agreeably to the will of Count
                    Sparree, who had decreed two gold medals, of ten ducats value each, to be
                    annually given by the academy to the authors of such papers, in the preceding
                    year’s Stockholm Acts, as should be adjudged most useful in promoting
                    agriculture particularly, and all branches of rural economy. This medal bore on
                    one side the arms of the count, with this motto, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Superstes</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">scientiis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">amor Erederici Sparree.</hi> Linnaeus obtained it in consequence
                    of a paper <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">plantis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">quoe</hi><hi rend="italic">Alpium</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    >fieri</hi><hi rend="italic">possint</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the
                    ultimate intention was to recommend these plants as adapted to culture in
                    Lapland. This paper was inserted in the Stockholm Acts for 1754 (vol. xv.).
                    Linnaeus also obtained the <hi rend="italic">praemium centum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aureorum,</hi> proposed by the Imperial Academy of Sciences at St
                    Petersburg, for the best paper written to establish or disprove, by new
                    arguments, the doctrine of the sexes of plants. It was, if possible, an
                    additional glory to Linnaeus to have merited this premium from the St Petersburg
                    Academy, inasmuch as a professor of that society, a few years before, had with
                    more than common zeal, although with a futility like that of the other
                    antagonists of our author, endeavoured to overturn the whole Linnaean system of
                    botany, by attempting to show that the doctrine of the sexes of plants had no
                    foundation in nature, and was unsupported by facts and experiments.</p>
                <p>It appears that Linnaeus, upon the whole, enjoyed a good constitution; but that
                    he was sometimes severely afflicted with a <hi rend="italic">hemicrania,</hi>
                    and was not exempted from the gout. About the close of 1776, he was seized with
                    an apoplexy, which left him paralytic; and at the beginning of the year 1777, he
                    suffered another attack, which very much impaired his mental powers. But the
                    disease supposed to have been the more immediate cause of his death, was an
                    ulceration of the urinary bladder, of which, after a tedious indisposition, he
                    died, on the 11th of January 1778, in the seventy-first year of his age. His
                    principal other works, besides those already mentioned, are, The <hi

                    >Amaenitates</hi><hi rend="italic">Academicae.</hi> The last of his treatises
                    was the <hi rend="italic">Mantissa Altera,</hi> published in 1771; but before
                    his death he had finished the greater part of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mantissa</hi><hi rend="italic">Tertia,</hi> afterwards completed and published
                    by his son.</p>
                <p>To the lovers of science it will not appear strange that uncommon respect was
                    shown to the memory of this great man. We are told, “that on his death a general
                    mourning took place at Upsala, and that his funeral procession was attended by
                    the whole university, as well professors as students, and the pall supported by
                    sixteen doctors of physic, all of whom had been his pupils.” The king of Sweden,
                    after the death of Linnaeus, ordered a medal to be struck, one side of which
                    exhibits Linnaeus’s bust and name, and the other Cybele, in a dejected attitude,
                    holding in her left hand a key, and surrounded with animals and growing plants,
                    with the legend, <hi rend="italic">Deam luctus angit</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    only honoured the Royal Academy of Sciences with his presence when Linnaeus’s
                    commemoration was held at Stockholm, but, as a still higher tribute, in his
                    speech from the throne to the assembly of the states, he lamented Sweden’s loss
                    by his death.</p>
                <p>His stature was diminutive, being below the middle size; his head was large, and
                    its hinder part very high; his look was ardent, piercing, and apt to daunt the
                    beholder; his ear was not sensible to music; and his temper quick, but easily
                    appeased. Nature had, in an eminent manner, been liberal in the endowment of his
                    mind. He seems to have possessed a lively imagination, corrected by a strong
                    judgment, a most retentive memory, unremitting industry, and the greatest
                    perseverance in all his pursuits. This is evident from that continued vigour
                    with which he prosecuted the design, which he appears to have formed so early in
                    life, of totally reforming and constructing anew the whole science of natural
                    history. And this fabric he raised, and gave to it a degree of perfection
                    unknown before; and he had moreover the uncommon felicity of living to see his
                    own structure rise above all others, notwithstanding every discouragement its
                    author at first laboured under, and the opposition it afterwards met with.
                    Neither has any writer more cautiously avoided the common error of building his
                    own fame upon the ruin of another man’s. He everywhere acknowledged the peculiar
                    merits of each author’s system; and no man appears to have been more sensible of
                    the partial defects of his own. Those anomalies which had principally been the
                    objects of criticism, he well knew that every artificial arrangement must abound
                    with; and having laid it down as a fixed maxim, that every system must finally
                    rest on its intrinsic merit, he willingly committed his own to the judgment of
                    posterity. Perhaps there is no circumstance of Linnaeus’s life which shows him
                    in a more dignified light than his conduct towards his opponents. Disdaining
                    controversy, and justly considering it as an unimportant and fruitless sacrifice
                    of time, he never replied to any assailant, numerous as they were at one
                    season.</p>
                <p>To all who observe the aid which this extraordinary man has brought to natural
                    science, his talents must appear in a very conspicuous point of view; but more
                    especially to those who, from similarity of tastes, are qualified to see more
                    distinctly the vast extent of his original design, the greatness of his labour,
                    and the elaborate execution he has given to the whole. He had a happy command of
                    the Latin language, which alone is the language of science; and no man ever
                    applied it more successfully to his purposes, or gave to description such
                    copiousness, united with that precision and conciseness which so eminently
                    characterize his writings.</p>
                <p>The ardour of Linnaeus for the study of nature, even from his earliest years, and
                    that uncommon application which he bestowed upon it, gave him a most
                    comprehensive view both of its pleasures and usefulness, at the same time that
                    it opened to him a wide field, hitherto but little cultivated, especially in his
                    own country. Hence he was early led to regret, that the study of natural
                    history, as a public institution, had not made its way into the universities; in
                    many of which, logical disputations and metaphysical theories had too long
                    prevailed, to the exclusion of more useful science. Availing himself therefore
                    of the advantages which he derived from a large share of eloquence, and an
                    animated style, he never failed to display, in a lively and convincing manner,
                    the relation which this study has to the public good; to incite the great to
                    countenance and protect it; to encourage and allure youth into its pursuits, by
                    opening its manifold sources of pleasure to their view, and showing them how
                    greatly this agreeable employment would add, in a variety of instances, both to
                    their comfort <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206207" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6207-0368"
                    />and emolument. His extensive view of natural history, as connected with almost
                    all the arts of life, did not allow him to confine these motives and incitements
                    to those only who were designed for the practice of physic. He also laboured to
                    inspire the great and opulent with a taste for this study, and wished
                    particularly that such as were devoted to an ecclesiastical life should possess
                    some share of natural science; not only as a means of sweetening their rural
                    situation, confined, as many are, perpetually to a country residence, but as
                    that which would almost inevitably lead, in a variety of instances, to
                    discoveries.</p>
                <p>Linnaeus lived to enjoy the fruit of his own labour. Natural history raised
                    itself in Sweden, under his culture, to a state of perfection unknown elsewhere;
                    and was from that time disseminated throughout all Europe. His pupils dispersed
                    themselves all over the globe; and, with their master’s fame, extended both
                    science and their own. More than this, he lived to see the sovereigns of Europe
                    found several public institutions in favour of this study; and even
                    professorships established in different universities for the same purpose,
                    chairs which do honour to their founders, and which have excited a curiosity for
                    the science, and a sense of its worth, that cannot fail to advance its progress,
                    and in time to raise it to that rank which it is entitled to hold amongst the
                    pursuits of mankind.</p>
