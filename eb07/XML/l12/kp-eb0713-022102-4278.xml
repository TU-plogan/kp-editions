                <p><label type="entry">LEITRIM</label>, a maritime county of the province of
                    Connaught, in Ireland, is bounded on the north by tĥe Atlantic and the counties
                    of Donegal and Fermanagh, on the cast by the counties of Fermanagh and Cavan, on
                    the south by those of Longford and Roscommon, and on the west by Roscommon and
                    Sligo. In shape it has been compared to an hour-glass, broad at both ends, and
                    contracted in the middle. Its greatest length, measured from south-east to
                    north-west, is fifty-two miles; its breadth where broadest is twenty, and where
                    narrowest not more than seven miles; extending over an area of 420,375 acres, of
                    which 266,640, or little more than one half, are cultivated land, 128,167 are
                    bog or unimproveable mountain, and 25,568 are under water.</p>
                <p>The county, which derives its name from an obscure village on the Shannon, is
                    supposed to have formed part of the region inhabited by the tribe of the
                    Nagnatae in the time of Ptolemy. The Irish chroniclers distinguish it by the
                    name of Hy-Brune-Brefine, or Brennie. The family of O’Ruarck, which derived its
                    descent from Roderic, king of Ireland, held in it the rank of chieftain; and
                    under him were those of O’Murrey, M‘Loghlin, M‘Glanchie, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193204291" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4291-0222"/>M‘Granell. It was made
                    shire-ground, together with the other counties in Connaught, by Queen Elizabeth;
                    and is now divided into the five baronies of Carrigallon, Dromahaire, Leitrim,
                    Mohill, and Rosclogher. These baronies are subdivided into seventeen parishes,
                    of which ten are in the diocese of Kilmore, and seven in that of Ardagh. For the
                    greater convenience of transacting the sessional business of the county, it is
                    divided into two districts; that of Manor-Hamilton in the north, comprising the
                    baronies of Rosclogher and Dromahaire; and that of Carrick-on-Shannon to the
                    south, comprehending the three southern baronies.</p>
                <p>The climate is not only colder than the more southern counties, but also moister,
                    owing to the number and height of the mountains with which the greater part of
                    its surface is overspread. The whole of the northern part of the county is
                    mountainous. Lugnaquilla, the most elevated of the mountains, rises to the
                    height of 1485 feet; Benbo is 1403 feet high; Lacka, 1315; the Green Mountain,
                    950 feet. More southerly are Slieve-an-Eirin and Bencroi. Large tracts of ground
                    comparatively level are to be found in the southern part of the county, the
                    greater part of which is well wooded, fertile, and abounding in picturesque
                    scenery. The soil in general is stiff, heavy, cold, and wet. The tops and sides
                    of most of the hills are covered with a thin ferruginous loam, based upon a hard
                    gravel. The valleys, which are in general well watered, are of a quality
                    superior to the hills, deeper in mould, and much more fertile. The more level
                    tracts, already noticed, are a dark rich soil on a limestone bottom.</p>
                <p>The county is not more remarkable for its mountains than for its lakes. The
                    principal is Lough Allen, situated in its centre, where narrowest. It is eight
                    miles long from north to south, and four*where broadest, and may be looked upon
                    as the great reservoir and distributer of all the running water in the county,
                    and the embryo feeder of every canal that may be made to traverse it. Storms on
                    thislake are violent, and the waves run very high. The boatmen who navigate it
                    assert that it is unfathomable in some parts. A few miles to the north is Lough
                    Clean, or Bel-hovel Lake, which discharges its waters into Lough Allen by a
                    stream of some magnitude. Several smaller sheets of water are scattered
                    throughout the southern baronies. On the borders are Lough Gill, Lough Melvyn,
                    Lough Cane, and Lough Boffin. The Shannon is said by some writers to take its
                    rise in Lough Clean, but its source is more generally reputed to be in Quilca
                    Mountain, where it is known by the name of Avonmore, or the Great River, to
                    distinguish it from the many lesser streams that, like it, contribute to feed
                    the great central lake. Issuing from the southern extremity of Lough Allen, it
                    forms the western boundary of the county. The Bonnet rises near Lough Clean, and
                    falls into Lough Gilly. The small rivers Bundrows and Brinduff, which separate
                    Leitrim from Donegal and Sligo, contain between their mouths the scanty line of
                    three miles of sea-coast belonging to the county. Many other streams, too small
                    to be particularly noticed, and discharging themselves into some of the numerous
                    lakes or larger rivers, afford a copious and perennial supply of water.</p>
                <p>The central parts of the county form part of the great coal-fields of Ireland.
                    The principal vein is in Bencroi Mountain, the summit of which is bog. The works
                    originally belonged to the O’Reillys, from whom they devolved by mortgage to one
                    of the Latouche family, who, after a very great expenditure, relinquished them.
                    The coal is not considered as of good quality. Coal has also been found in the
                    hill of Lacka, and in Lugnaquilla, where it crops out at an elevation of about
                    1170 feet above the sea level, at Meneask. Iron-ore abounds in the
                    Slieve-na-Eirin, or Iron Mountain. On its northern side, where the interior has
                    been denuded by the mountain floods, the metal shows itself in large quantities,
                    alternating with strata of limestone.</p>
                <p>The ore here is considered as richer than that of Roscommon. It was worked until
                    the failure of timber and the ' want of a sufficient supply of mineral coal put
                    a stop to the operations. Indications of the same ore are to be found in several
                    other parts of the mountainous district, and even in the interior of the plain
                    country, near the Shannon. Indeed the soil is so deeply and extensively
                    impregnated with it, that the inhabitants, who have not the means of rendering
                    it profitable, denounce it as the bane of the country. Lead has been found near
                    Lurganboy. Upon the north side of Benbo Mountain are pits whence copper has been
                    extracted. Manganese is also found in large quantities, as is pipe clay, yellow
                    ochre, white and brown chalks, clays of various hues, and sand suited for the
                    manufacture of glass. The substratum of the parts of the county north and south
                    of the coal and iron district is chiefly limestone, interspersed occasionally
                    with sandstone. Benbo is granitic. The quantity of bog is estimated to occupy
                    7234 acres. Its general depth is thirty feet, and it rests on a stratum of marl
                    or blue clay. The highest level of any of the bogs above the Shannon at Lough
                    Reagh is 114 feet, that of the lowest twenty-nine. All are so far elevated as to
                    admit of drainage. There is a sulphureous spa at Drumsna, in high repute for
                    cutaneous disorders, and by many considered as more effective than that of
                    Swadlinbar. There are also others of the same quality at Annaghduff, Meelock,
                    and Attymanus, and in some other places. Cavan spa is a chalybeate, issuing from
                    the southern part of a peninsula in the north of Lough Allen. Oakfield spa,
                    likewise chalybeate, is near the sea. Both are visited for their supposed
                    sanative qualities.</p>
                <p>The population, like that of every other part of'Ireland, has been progressively
                    on the increase ever since any series of systematic observations have been
                    directed to ascertain it. The following are the most important epochs of its
                    increase :—</p>

                <p>The foregoing table exhibits an increase upwards of quintuple in seventy years.
                    But it is to be observed, that the ratio of increase between the first and last
                    parliamentary census, which may be deemed to have been taken with greater
                    accuracy than those of former years, which rest chiefly on conjectural
                    computation, does not establish the authenticity of such a rapid increase. The
                    average of population to the superficial contents of the county gives a rate of
                    one inhabitant to one acre and eighty-eight hundred parts.</p>
                <p>This population was represented in the Irish House of Commons by six members, two
                    for the county at large, and two for each of the close boroughs of
                    Carrick-on-Shannon and Jamestown. The union struck off the borough
                    representatives, and as no change has been made in this point by the reform act,
                    the county now sends but two members to the imperial parliament. The state of
                    the constituency, as affected by the legislative alterations made since the
                    passing of the Catholic emancipation bill, by which the right of the
                    forty-shilling freeholders to vote in the election of representatives was
                    abolished, exhibits the following results :—</p>

                <p>Hence it appears, that whilst, previously to the extinction of the forty-shilling
                    freeholders, there was one elector for every four families nearly, the number
                    was reduced, after the change, to one for every eighteen.</p>

                <p>The state of crime may be estimated, to a certain degree, from the following
                    return of the numbers committed for criminal offences during the seven years
                    ending December 1834, viz :—</p>
                <p>1828 380 1832 293</p>

                <p>The foregoing statement is taken from the annual report of the inspectors-general
                    of prisons. Another return from the county officers gives the following result
                    for the year 1834, which is both more specific, and varies from the other in no
                    small degree as to the number of committals. The great excess of persons
                    discharged unpunished above those convicted presents a very extraordinary
                    characteristic as to the administration of justice in this, as in many other
                    counties. Capital executions are very uncommon here.</p>

                <p>The state of public education, as collected from the parliamentary inquiries in
                    1821 and 1824-26, may be inferred from the following table. The information on
                    this interesting topic, collected by the late commission of public instruction,
                    having been made up according to dioceses, instead of counties, as had been the
                    case in the preceding parliamentary returns, precludes the possibility of giving
                    a statement either of the numbers of children receiving instruction, or of the
                    comparative amount of the different religious persuasions, for the year
                    1834.</p>

                <p>Of the numbers in the latter of these returns, 2147 were of the established
                    church, twenty-seven were dissenters, 7757 Roman catholics, and 1204 whose
                    religious persuasion could not be ascertained. The total number of schools was
                    242, of which twenty-one, educating 1181 pupils, were maintained by grants of
                    public money; sixty-four, educating 3113, derived their support from private
                    contributions’; and the remaining 157 schools, educating 6841 pupils, were
                    supported wholly by the fees of those who received instruction in them.</p>
                <p>The quantity of land under tillage is small, and the plough little used excepting
                    in the champaign districts. In the other parts the mode of culture is by the
                    loy, a narrow spade with a long handle. The hills are generally steep, and,
                    though abounding with stones, are tough, and retentive of moisture. The loy
                    penetrates into this species of soil more easily than the common broad spade,
                    and the length of its handle serves as a lever to overcome the resistance of the
                    tenacious soil. Potatoes are planted with a steveen, which is a stake about
                    foui' feet long and three inches in diameter, tapering to a point at the lower
                    end, near which a crosspiece is fixed to rest the foot on whilst pressing the
                    implement into the ground. The seed is dropped into the hole thus made, which is
                    then filled up with mould. Oats are the general crop; barley is but little
                    grown; rye and wheat still less. Flax forms a part of the usual rotation of
                    crops. Tillage farms are small; those for grazing are of considerable size, and
                    often held by several tenants in common. The grasses are mostly natural, and in
                    general excellent, producing fat and well-flavoured meat, and excellent milk and
                    butter. Dairies of large size are seldom to be met with, but every small farmer
                    produces butter to dispose of at some of the neighbouring markets. Green food is
                    seldom used. The cattie are housed in some parts from December to May, whilst in
                    others they are left out during the winter. The usual fence is a drain, backed
                    at one side with a bank of clammy aluminous earth, about three or four feet
                    high. The ditch thus made soon hardens into a consistency nearly equal to brick,
                    and answers , every purpose of fencing except against sheep, in which case it is
                    topped with brushwood. Stone-walls are few. Hawthorn hedges are to be met with
                    in some parts. Manures are rich and abundant. Every part has a command of
                    limestone, eithersolid, or in gra⅛el or marl. The farmers living upon the
                    confined verge of sea-coast within the county industriously take advantage of
                    the sea-weeds, shells, and gravel found there. Much attention is paid to the
                    collection of every kind of manure. The farm-houses are generally long, narrow
                    buildings, of one story high, with a yard before them, of which the offices form
                    the sides. The repairs are always made by the landlord, a custom very uncommon
                    in other counties. Leases are generally for three lives, or thirty-one years.
                    Non-alienation clauses are common, and the tenant is sometimes bound down to
                    manure a certain portion of the land.</p>
                <p>The manufactures are confined to that of coarse linen, the weaving of which is
                    carried on to a considerable extent. Potteries of coarse vessels are numerous
                    about Leitrim and Dromahaire. The only navigable river by which an inland trade
                    can be carried on is the Shannon. About fifty years ago a canal was opened from
                    near Longford to Battlebridge, about three miles south of Lough Allen, in order
                    to form a water communication thence to Limerick. This canal, if completed to
                    the lough, would enable boats to ply thence to Dublin by its connection with the
                    Royal Canal at Tarmenbarry. There are no fisheries of any consequence, although
                    many kinds of fresh-water fish, particularly perch, may be caught in great
                    abundance.</p>
                <p>The general food of the peasantry is potatoes and oaten bread, with butter and
                    eggs occasionally, and flesh meat at the great festivals. The clothing is neat,
                    clean, and substantial; the coat usually of native frize, and the waistcoat and
                    breeches of corduroy. In their general demeanour the peasantry are kind,
                    warm-hearted, and amenable to the laws. They are, like those of most other parts
                    of Ireland, singularly Attached to peculiar places of interment. One of the most
                    frequented of these is on a small island near the entrance of the Shannon into
                    Lough Neagh, where there are the remains of a church. It has been from time
                    immemorial the burying-place for the residents in all the surrounding country;
                    and when access to it is prevented on such occasions, by the stormy state of the
                    lake, the friends of the deceased prefer remaining on the shore by the
                    putrefying corpse, until the weather become favourable enough to permit a
                    passage across, to removing it for interment elsewhere. The frequent occurrence
                    of fatal accidents in these funereal voyages induced a neighbouring gentleman to
                    have a piece of ground upon the adjoining mainland consecrated as a cemetery,
                    but to no purpose. The survivors preferred awaiting all chances of weather
                    rather than relinquish the idea of depositing the bones of their departed friend
                    with those of his forefathers. The mountainous districts are thickly peopled,
                    but have few resident proprietors. The lowest classes there speak Irish. They
                    have a singular custom, when they have recourse to blood-letting, of opening a
                    vein in each arm, in order to let the blood run even. Dancing is the favourite
                    amusement in convivial meetings; every one is fond of displaying his agility in
                    this enlivening exercise. At weddings the men ride to the place of worship, each
                    horseman <pb break="no" facs="nls:193204325" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4325-0224"
                    />having a woman behind him, except the bridegroom, who rides single. λVhen a
                    person is seen ridingFon a pyebald horse, it is considered as a sign that he is
                    a physician. The cabin-doors in these districts are of wicker-work, lined in the
                    inside by a mat. The harness for the cattle is exceedingly rude, being little
                    more than a hay rope or band. The people in the neighbourhood of the iron-works
                    appear to live in a state of extreme misery. They are wretchedly clothed, and
                    dwell in mud houses filled with smoke. The vicinity of the three counties of
                    Leitrim, Cavan, and Sligo to each other, gives occasion to party feuds, which
                    often lead to desperate battles between hostile clans or factions, that never
                    terminate without bloodshed, and not unfrequently with loss of life.</p>
                <p>There are but few remains of ancient Irish antiquities. The most remarkable are
                    two druidical altars; one very large near Fenagh, the other of smaller
                    dimensions at Let-terfyan. They are called by the natives Leaba Dearmud is
                    Graine, or Darby’s and Graine’s bed. The principal monastic buildings of which
                    any vestiges can now be traced, are the following. Crevlea, near the river
                    Bonnet, built by Margaret, widow of O’Ruarck, in 1509. The walls, which are
                    nearly entire, have on them some curious figures, and contain several antique
                    monuments. Fionagh, in Fenagh parish, still exhibits a window of fine
                    workmanship: the place was anciently celebrated as a school of divinity, and was
                    resorted to by students from many parts of Europe. A Franciscan friary, at
                    Jamestown, was remarkable in the eventful period of 1641, as being the place
                    where the Roman Catholic clergy assembled, and nominated commissioners to treat
                    with such foreign powers as were willing to assist them in their struggle
                    against the usurped authorities which then governed England. Clone, near a small
                    river of the same name in Mohill barony, has still some ruins to point out its
                    site. Mohill Abbey, Annaghduff, and Drum-leas, have been converted into parish
                    churches. Some others are known only by name. Amongst the military antiquities
                    maybe noticed O’Rorke’s Hall, atDromahaire, near the Bonnet, the destruction of
                    which was expedited by using its materials for the construction of the
                    neighbouring castle of Dromahaire, supposed to have been built by Sir William
                    Villiers in the year 1628. Other castles, built by various members of the
                    O’Ruarck family, are those of'Long-field, Cloncorrick, Castle Cor, and one on
                    the banks of Lough Gill. Woodford House is built on the site of another of the
                    O’Ruarcks’castles. Manor-Hamilton Castle, built by Sir Frederick Hamilton, in
                    the reign of Elizabeth, is by much the largest, best built, and handsomest in
                    the county. Castle John stands on an island in the little lake of Lough Scur.
                    Dungarbery Castle, near the sea, is of the era of Elizabeth.</p>
                <p>The population of Leitrim may be said to be wholly rural: no town in it contains
                    two thousand inhabitants. Carrick-on-Shannon, the county town, where the assizes
                    are held, and all the public business transacted, contains no more than 1428
                    inhabitants. Though well circumstanced for inland trade, from its situation on a
                    fine navigable river, no advantage has been taken of its position. Its only
                    public buildings are a court-house, a jail, a chapel of ease, and a barrack. The
                    mail-coach road to Sligo passes through it. The only other towns whose
                    population exceeds a thousand souls are, Mohill, which contains 1606, and
                    Manor-Hamilton, which has 1348 inhabitants.</p>
