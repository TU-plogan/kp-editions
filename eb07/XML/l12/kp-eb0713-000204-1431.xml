                <p><label type="entry">LABEO, C. <hi rend="smallcaps">Antistius</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated lawyer of the age of Augustus and Tiberius, was son of Antistitis
                    Labeo, who formed one of the conspiracy against Caesar, and, after the
                    unsuccessful battle of Philippi, caused himself to be put to death by one of his
                    own slaves. His son seems to have inherited all the independent-principles of
                    the father, and to have expressed at times his opinions respecting the measures
                    of Augustus with such freedom, that it was thought by his friends that he was
                    subject to fits of insanity. (Hor. <hi rend="italic">Sat.</hi> i. 3, 82; Suet.
                    <hi rend="italic">Aug.</hi> 54.) Some say that he was offered the consulship by
                    Augustus, but that he refused the honour, lest he should be suspected of having
                    sold his independence to the emperor. Others say that he was a candidate for the
                    consulship, and that Augustus caused M. Ateius Capito to be elected in
                    preference to him. (Tacit. <hi rend="italic">Aim.</hi> iii. 75.) He had applied
                    himself more particularly to the study of law, and left many works, of which
                    scarcely any thing remains except the title; eight books on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Probabilities,</hi> of which Julius Paulus made an abridgment; a work in
                    forty-two books, entitled <hi rend="italic">Posteriores,</hi> because it
                    appeared after his death. Of these two works fragments are to be found in the
                    pandects of Justinian. The latter is abridged by Jabolenus, who flourished under
                    Trajan. (Gell, xiii. 10.) His other works are, Commentaries on the Twelve
                    Tables, and on the Edicts of the Praetor and Curile Aediles; a Treatise on the
                    Praetor Urbanus and Peregrinus; a Treatise on Pontifical Law, in fifteen books.
                    It is disputed whether some other works mentioned by St Augustin belong to this
                    Labco, or to another of the same name. (See <hi rend="italic">Opuscula</hi><hi
