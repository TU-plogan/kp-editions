                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">SYRACUSE</label>, a celebrated city of Sicily, and once the
                    capital of the island. According to Thucydides and Strabo, it was built by
                    Archias, one of the Heraclidae, who came from Corinth into Sicily in the second
                    year of the 11 th Olympiad, and derived its name from a neighbouring marsh named
                    <hi rend="italic">Sgraco.</hi> What form of government first prevailed in the
                    city, is not known. Many have supposed it originally to have been governed by
                    kings: but if this was the case, the monarchical government continued only for a
                    very short time; since Aristotle, Diodorus Siculus, and Justin, mention it as
                    being very early subject to a democracy. The history is obscure and unimportant
                    till the time of Gelon, when Syracuse first began to make a conspicuous
                    figure.</p>
                <p>Gelon was born in the city of Gela in Sicily, of the family of Telines, who had
                    been created priest of the infernal gods. He signalized himself in a war carried
                    on against the Syracusans, by Hippocrates, tyrant of Gela, whom he defeated in a
                    pitched battle. Having thus become very powerful among his countrymen, he soon
                    found means to seize on the sovereignty for himself. In a short time, having put
                    himself at the head of some Syracusan exiles, he marched towards that place,
                    where he was received with loud acclamations, and obtained possession of the
                    city.</p>
                <p>In order to people the capital of his new dominions, Gelon first demolished the
                    neighbouring city of Camarina, and transplanted the inhabitants to Syracuse.
                    Soon afterwards, entering into a war with the Megareans, he defeated them, took
                    and razed their cities, and in like manner transplanted the people. Syracuse
                    thus became powerful, and full of inhabitants; and the friendship of Gelon was
                    courted both by Athens and Lacedaemon at the time of the Persian invasion. In
                    the mean time the Carthaginians had entered into a treaty with the Persians; by
                    which it was agreed, that the former should attack those of the Greek name in
                    Sicily and Italy, in order to divert them from assisting each other. Sicily was
                    accordingly invaded by the Carthaginians with a vast army; but they were utterly
                    overthrown by Gelon, as is related under the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Carthage.</hi> After this victory, the people out of gratitude obliged him to
                    assume the title of king, which till that time he had refused. A decree also
                    passed by which the crown was settled on his two brothers Hiero and Thrasybulus
                    after his death. The new king, instead of keeping his subjects in greater awe,
                    studied to make them happy, and was the first man who became more virtuous by
                    being raised to a throne. He was particularly famous for his honesty, truth, and
                    sin cerity; is said never to have wronged the meanest of his subjects, and never
                    to have made a promise which he did not perform.</p>
                <p>Gelon died in the year 471 <hi rend="smallcaps">b c</hi>. after having reigned
                    three or four years; and was succeeded by his brother Hiero, whose character is
                    differently drawn by different historians. He is highly celebrated in the odes
                    of Pindar; and it is certain that his court was the resort of men of wit and
                    learning, to whom he behaved in the most courteous manner and with the greatest
                    liberality.</p>
                <p>In 459 <hi rend="smallcaps">b c.</hi> Hiero was succeeded by. Thrasybulus; who
                    proving a tyrant, was in ten months dethroned, and a popular government
                    restored, which continued for the space of fifty-five years.</p>
                <p>About this time the Syracusans entered into a war with the Siculi, which
                    terminated in the total subjection of the latter; after which Syracuse became so
                    powerful, that it in a manner gave law to the whole island. The Greek cities
                    indeed enjoyed a perfect liberty, but they all acknowledged Syracuse as their
                    metropolis. By degrees, however, the latter began to assume such an authority
                    over them as was totally inconsistent with liberty; and this occasioned many
                    wars, which involved them in much distress and danger. They began with the
                    Leontines, whose territory they laid waste, and reduced their city to great
                    straits. Leontini was an Athenian colony; and this furnished the Athenians, who
                    had already meditated the conquest of Sicily, with a pretence to attack the
                    Syracusans with their whole force. Under colour of assisting their countrymen,
                    therefore, they sent a fleet of 250 sail to Sicily; but the Leontines, sensible
                    that their pretended allies aimed at nothing less than the conquest of the whole
                    island, concluded a peace with Syracuse; and the disappointed Athenians vented
                    their rage on those who had advised and conducted the expedition.</p>
                <p>During the continuance of the popular government, the Syracusans took part in the
                    long war between Athens and Sparta. This war was scarcely ended, when a new and
                    formidable invasion by the Carthaginians took place; but the event of that
                    expedition was as unfortunate to the Carthaginians as the former had been. In
                    the mean time, a considerable revolution had happened in Syracuse. The city of
                    Agrigentum had been taken by the Carthaginians; and of the few inhabitants who
                    escaped, some fled to Syracuse, where they accused the Syracusan commanders of
                    having betrayed the city into the hands of the enemy. Dionysius, a man of great
                    valour and address, but who had become very obnoxious to the populace, took this
                    opportunity of attempting to retrieve his credit. He therefore supported the
                    accusations brought against his countrymen by the Agrigentines, and even
                    impeached the magistrates as having a secret intelligence with the enemy, and
                    attempting to introduce an oligarchy. As his speech was entirely levelled
                    against the more wealthy, it was very agreeable to the poorer citizens: the
                    commanders were instantly degraded; and others, among whom was Dionysius, were
                    appointed. Having once gained this point, he began to consider how he might
                    effect the dismission of his colleagues. For this purpose, he never joined in
                    any council of war with the other commanders, nor imparted to them his
                    resolutions, giving out that he could not trust them, and that they had more
                    regard for their own interest than the welfare of their country. But while he
                    was proceeding in this manner, the more prudent part of the citizens, perceiving
                    what he aimed at, complained of him to the senate and magistrates, and fined him
                    as a disturber of the public peace. According to the laws, the fine was to be
                    paid before he could speak in public, and the circumstances of Dionysius did not
                    allow him to discharge it. In this dilemma he was assisted by Philistus the
                    historian, a man of great wealth, who not only paid this fine for him, but
                    encouraged liim to speak his<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=74" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0074-0056"/>
                    mind freely, as it became a zealous citizen to do, promising to pay all the
                    fines which should be imposed upon him.</p>
                <p>Being extricated out of this difficulty, Dionysius next proceeded, with all the
                    eloquence of which he was master, to inveigh against those who by means of their
                    power or interest were able to oppose his designs, and by degrees brought them
                    into discredit. His next scheme was to get those exiles recalled whom the
                    nobility had banished at different times; as thinking that they would support
                    him with all their power, as well out of gratitude, as out of hatred to the
                    opposite party. Having likewise gained this point, he next found means to
                    ingratiate himself with the soldiery to such a degree that, under pretence of
                    taking proper measures for resisting the Carthaginians, he was chosen commander
                    in chief, with absolute and unlimited power. This was no sooner done than,
                    pretending his life was in danger, he selected 1000 men for his guard, whom he
                    attached to his interest by great promises. As no person durst now oppose him,
                    he possessed himself of the capital, where all the arms and provisions were
                    kept; after which he publicly took the title of king of Syracuse in the year 404
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b c.</hi> The Syracusans did not tamely submit to their new
                    master; but Dionysius managed matters so well, that their frequent revolts
                    answered no other purpose than more certainly to entail slavery on themselves;
                    and he was allowed to possess the throne without much opposition till his death,
                    which happened in the year 366 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi></p>
                <p>On the death of Dionysius, he was succeeded by his son, likewise called
                    Dionysius. He was naturally of a mild and peaceable temper, averse to cruelty,
                    and inclined to learning; but his father, to whom all merit, even in his own
                    children, gave umbrage, stifled as far as possible his good qualities by a mean
                    and obscure education. He no sooner ascended the throne, than Dion, brother to
                    Aristomache, wife of the elder Dionysius, undertook to correct the faults of his
                    education, and to inspire him with thoughts suitable to the high station in
                    which he was placed. For this purpose he sent for the philosopher Plato, under
                    whose care he immediately placed the young king. This instantly produced a
                    reformation on Dionysius; but the courtiers, dreading the effects of the
                    philosopher’s instructions, prevailed on him to banish Dion, and to keep Plato
                    himself in a kind of imprisonment in the citadel. At last, however, he set him
                    at liberty; and Plato then returned to his own country.</p>
                <p>Dion, in the mean time, visited several of the Grecian cities, and at last took
                    up his residence in Athens; but the honours which were everywhere paid him
                    raised such jealousies in the breast of the tyrant, that he stopped his revenue,
                    and caused it to be paid into his own treasury. In a short time Dionysius again
                    sent for Plato; but, finding it impossible to dissolve the friendship between
                    him and Dion, disgraced, and placed him in a very dangerous situation, in the
                    midst of assassins who hated him. Not daring, however, to offer him any
                    violence, he allowed him soon after to depart; revenging himself on Dion, whose
                    estate he sold, and gave his wife Arete in marriage to Timocrates, one of his
                    flatterers.</p>
                <p>Dion now resolved to revenge himself on the tyrant for the many injuries which he
                    had sustained, and at once to deliver his country from the oppression under
                    which it groaned. He began with raising foreign troops privately, by proper
                    agents, for the better execution of his design. Many Syracusans of distinction
                    entered into his scheme, and gave him intelligence of what passed in the city;
                    but of the exiles, of whom there were upwards of 1000 dispersed up and down
                    Greece, only twenty-five joined him; so much were they awed by the dread of the
                    tyrant. The troops were assembled at the island of Zacynthus, in number only
                    about 800; but who had all been tried on many occasions, were well disciplined,
                    and capable of animating by their example the forces which Dion hoped to find in
                    Sicily. When they were about to sail, Dion acquainted them with his design, the
                    boldness of which at first occasioned among them no small consternation; but he
                    soon removed their fears, by telling them that he did not lead them as soldiers,
                    but as officers, to put them at the head of the Syracusans and all the people of
                    Sicily, who were ready to receive them with open arms. Having then embarked in
                    two small trading vessels, they arrived in twelve days at Cape Pachynum, near
                    Syracuse. They at length reached the port of Minoa, not far from Agrigentum, and
                    here they received intelligence that Dionysius had set sail for Italy, attended
                    by a fleet of eighty galleys. Dion now resolved to take advantage of the
                    tyrant’s absence, and immediately proceeded to Syracuse. On his march he
                    prevailed on the inhabitants of Agrigentum, Gela, Camarina, and otlier cities,
                    to join him. As soon as he entered the territories of Syracuse, multitudes
                    flocked to him; and as nobody appeared to oppose him, he boldly entered the
                    city, where he quickly found himself at the head of 50,000 men. As soon as he
                    had landed in Sicily, Timocrates, to whom his wife Arete had been given by
                    Dionysius, and to whom the care of the city had been left, despatched a courier
                    to let the tyrant know the danger to which he was exposed. Dionysius was,
                    however, accidentally prevented from receiving a timely account of Dion’s
                    arrival; so that when he entered the citadel by sea, seven days after Dion’s
                    arrival, he found his affairs in a desperate situation. Upon this he had
                    recourse to artifice; and having amused the Syracusans by a feigned negociation,
                    until he observed that they kept a negligent guard, he attacked them all at once
                    with such fury, that he had almost taken the city. But Dion encouraged the
                    soldiers by his example so much, that he at last obtained a complete victory;
                    for which they presented him with a crown of gold. It was not long, however,
                    before the ungrateful Syracusans began to think of conferring quite different
                    rewards on their benefactor. Dionysius had the address to render him suspected
                    by the multitude; at the same time that Heraclides, an excellent officer, but a
                    secret enemy to Dion, did all that lay in his power to sink his credit.
                    Dionysius was soon obliged to fly into Italy, but left Heraclides to oppose
                    Dion.</p>
                <p>Dion at length obtained possession of the city, and Heraclides having submitted
                    to him, was received into favour; but as his seditious and turbulent behaviour
                    still continued, Dion at last gave orders to put him to death. This action,
                    however necessary, so affected the mind of Dion, that he became melancholy; and
                    ever after imagined himself haunted by a frightful spectre, resembling a woman
                    of gigantic stature, with the haggard looks and air of a fury. In a short time
                    after he lost his life, through the treachery of Calippus, or Gylippus, who
                    pretended to be his intimate friend, and who immediately after caused his wife
                    and sister to be carried to prison. Calippus having removed Dion, soon made
                    himself master of Syracuse, where he committed all manner of cruelties; but he
                    was driven out, and forced to fly to Rhegium, where he was murdered by the same
                    dagger which had killed Dion. In 350 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> Dionysius
                    again made himself master of Syracuse; and being exasperated by his past
                    misfortunes, became more tyrannical than ever. The Syracusans first had recourse
                    to Icetas, tyrant of Leontini; but as the Carthaginians took this opportunity to
                    invade them with a powerful fleet and army, they were obliged to apply to the
                    Corinthians. By them Timoleon, a celebrated commander, was sent to the
                    assistance of the Syracusans, whom he found in a very distressed situation;
                    Icetas being master of the city, the Carthaginians of the harbour, and Dionysius
                    of the citadel. As all parties were equally the enemies of Dionysius, he found
                    it impossible to resist, and therefore surrendered himself to Timoleon, by whom
                    he was sent to Corinth; where at last he was reduced to the necessity of
                    teaching a school for his support.<pb break="no"

                    After the expulsion of the tyrant, Timoleon withdrew to Catena, leaving only 400
                    Corinthians, under the command of an experienced officer named Leon, to guard
                    the citadel. These were immediately besieged by Icetas and the Carthaginians,
                    but Timoleon found means to relieve them in spite of all opposition; and having
                    dispersed emissaries through the army of Mago the Carthaginian general,
                    exhorting the mercenary Greeks to forsake him, he was so much intimidated, that
                    in spite of all the remonstrances which Icetas could make, he set sail for
                    Africa, leaving his colleague to carry on the war in the best manner he
                    could.</p>
                <p>The day after the departure of Mago, Timoleon assaulted the city so fiercely,
                    that the troops of Icetas were driven from the walls, and the Corinthians became
                    masters of the place. Timoleon, by sound of trumpet, invited the inhabitants to
                    come and assist in demolishing the citadel and other castles, which he called
                    the <hi rend="italic">nests of tyrants;</hi> after which he caused edifices for
                    the administration of justice to be erected in the place where the citadel had
                    stood. He found the city in a most miserable condition; for many having perished
                    in the wars and seditions, and others having fled to avoid the oppression of
                    tyrants, Syracuse, once so wealthy and populous, was now become almost a desert;
                    insomuch that the horses were fed on the grass which grew in the market-place.
                    Timoleon supplied the city with inhabitants from Corinth and other cities of
                    Greece, at the same time that great multitudes from Italy and the other parts of
                    Sicily resorted thither. Timoleon distributed the lands among them; but sold the
                    houses, and with the money arising from the sale established a fund for the
                    support of the poor. Having thus restored Syracuse, he next delivered all the
                    Greek cities of Sicily from the tyrants who had taken possession of them, all of
                    whom he put to death. After this he resigned his authority, and led a retired
                    life, venerated in the highest degree by the Syracusans, and by all the cities
                    in Sicily. After his death he was honoured as a god; the expense of his funeral
                    was defrayed by the public; sports, with horse-races and gymnastic exercises,
                    were held annually on the day of his death; and it was decreed, that whenever
                    the Syracusans were at war with the barbarians, they should send to Corinth for
                    a general.</p>
                <p>For twenty years the Syracusans enjoyed the fruits of Timoleon’s victories; but
                    new disturbances arising, in a short time another tyrant started up, who
                    exceeded all that had gone before him in cruelty and other vices. This was the
                    celebrated Agathocles, of whose exploits against the Carthaginians a full
                    account is given under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Carthage.</hi> He was
                    poisoned by one Moenon in the year 289 <hi rend="smallcaps">b c</hi>., after
                    having reigned twenty-eight and lived ninety-five years. A succession of tyrants
                    followed, till at last the city, being held by two rivals, Toenion and
                    Sosistratus, who made war within the very walls, Pyrrhus king of Epirus was
                    invited into Sicily, in order to put an end to these distractions. He willingly
                    complied with the invitation, and was everywhere received with loud
                    acclamations, as the deliverer, not only of Syracuse, but of all Sicily. As he
                    had a fine army of 30,000 foot and 5000 horse, with a fleet of 200 sail, he
                    drove the Carthaginians from place to place, till he left them only the two
                    strong posts of Eryx and Lilybaeum. The former of these he took by assault, and
                    was <hi rend="italic">himself</hi> the first man who mounted the walls, after
                    having killed a great number of Africans with his own hand. The Mamertines,
                    likewise, who had conquered a considerable part of the island, were everywhere
                    defeated and driven out, till at last they were shut up in the city of Messana.
                    The Carthaginians, alarmed at the rapidity of his conquests, sent ambassadors
                    with proposals of peace upon very advantageous terms; but Pyrrhus, elated by the
                    expectation of reducing the whole island, refused to hearken to any terms unless
                    they would instantly abandon it. So sanguine were his anticipations, that he
                    caused his son to assume the title of king of Sicily; but in the mean time,
                    having displeased the Sicilians by his arbitrary behaviour, they deserted from
                    him in such numbers that he was glad to set out for Italy, for which retreat the
                    embassies he received from the Samnites, Tarentines, and other Italians,
                    furnished him with an honourable pretext. He embarked in the ships which he had
                    brought with him from Italy, but was met at sea by the Carthaginians, who sunk
                    seventy of his vessels, and dispersed or took the rest, so that he saved himself
                    in Italy with only twelve vessels, the poor remains of a fleet of 200 sail. No
                    sooner were the Mamertines apprised of his departure, than they despatched a
                    body of 18000 men to harass him after his landing. These having passed the
                    straits before him, posted themselves on the road which Pyrrhus must take in
                    marching by land to Tarentum, and concealing themselves among woods and rocks,
                    attacked him unexpectedly, and with great resolution. But Pyrrhus be haved on
                    this occasion with his usual bravery. The attack being made on his rear, he
                    hastened thither, and made a dreadful slaughter of the enemy, till a wound in
                    the head obliged him to retire.</p>
                <p>After the departure of Pyrrhus, Hiero the son of Hierocles, a descendant of
                    Gelon, the first king of Syracuse, was chosen general of the forces, along with
                    another named Artemidorus. The two generals had nothing more at heart than to
                    put an end to the confusion and disorder which reigned in the city; and with
                    this view they entered it at the head of their forces. On this occasion Hiero
                    discovered extraordinary talents for government. By mere dint of insinuation and
                    address, without shedding blood or hurting a single citizen, he calmed the minds
                    of the people, reconciled the factions, and so gained the affections of all,
                    that he was invested with the whole civil as well as military power in the
                    state. He soon afterwards married the daughter of one of the first citizens; and
                    having distinguished himself by his exploits against the Mamertines, was
                    unanimously elected king of Syracuse in the year 265 <hi rend="smallcaps">b
                    c</hi>.</p>
                <p>Some time after Hiero’s accession to the throne, he again defeated the
                    Mamertines, and reduced them to such straits that they were obliged to call in
                    the Romans to their assistance. The consequences of this have been fully related
                    under the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Rome</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Carthage.</hi> Hiero, who had allied himself with the Carthaginians, being
                    himself defeated by the Romans, and finding his allies unable to protect him
                    against the power of that republic, concluded an alliance with them, and
                    continued faithful to them even in the time of the second Punic war, when they
                    were in the greatest distress. In his reign flourished the celebrated
                    mathematician Archimedes, whose genius he employed in fortifying the city of
                    Syracuse, by innumerable machines, in such a manner as rendered it absolutely
                    impregnable to every method of attack known at that time.</p>
                <p>Hiero died about 211 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> and was succeeded by his
                    grandson Hieronymus; but he imprudently forsook the counsels of his grandfather,
                    and entered into an alliance with the Carthaginians. He was soon afterwards
                    murdered, in consequence of his tyranny and cruelty; and the greatest disorders
                    took place in the city, which Hannibal, though then in Italy, found means to
                    foment, in hopes of keeping the Syracusans in his interest. This indeed he
                    effected; but as his own affaire in Italy began to decline, he could not prevent
                    Marcellus from landing in Sicily with a formidable army, which the Sicilians had
                    no means of resisting. Syracuse was soon invested; but the machines invented by
                    Archimedes baffled all attempts to take it by assault. The immense preparations
                    which the consul had made for taking the city by storm, could not have failed to
                    accomplish his purpose, had the place been otherwise defended than by the genius
                    of Archimedes. The Roman fleet consisted of sixty quinqueremes, besides a far
                    greater number of other ships. The decks were covered with soldiers armed
                    with<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=76"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0076-0058"/> darts, slings, and bows, to drive the besieged
                    from the ramparts, which on one side were washed by the sea, and to facilitate
                    the approach to the walls. But a machine of Marcellus’s own invention, called a
                    <hi rend="italic">sambuca,</hi> was that on which he placed his chief reliance.
                    The consul’s design was to bring his sambuca to the f∞t of the walls of
                    Acra-dina; but while it was at a considerable distance (and it advanced very
                    slowly, being moved only by two ranks of rowers), Archimedes discharged from one
                    of his engines a vast stone, weighing, according to Plutarch’s account, 1250
                    pounds, then a second, and immediately after a third, all which, falling upon
                    the sambuca with a dreadful noise, broke its supports, and gave the galleys upon
                    which it stood such a violent shock that they parted, and the machine which
                    Marcellus had raised upon them with immense labour and expense was battered to
                    pieces. At the same time, several other machines, which were not visible without
                    the walls, and consequently did not lessen the confidence of the Romans in the
                    assault, played incessantly upon their ships, and overwhelmed them with showers
                    of stones, rafters, and beams pointed with iron, insomuch that Marcellus found
                    it necessary to retire with all possible haste, and sent orders to his land
                    forces to do the same; for the attack on the land side was attended with no
                    better success, the ranks being broken and thrown into the utmost confusion by
                    the stones and darts, which flew with such noise, force, and rapidity, that they
                    struck the Romans with terror, and dashed all to pieces before them.</p>
                <p>Marcellus, surprised, though not discouraged, at this artificial storm, which he
                    did not expect, held a council of war, in which it was resolved, the next day
                    before sunrise, to advance close to the wall, and remain there. They were in
                    hopes by this means to secure themselves against the terrible storm of stones
                    and darts which fell on the ships when at a distance; but Archimedes had
                    prepared engines which were adapted to all contingencies. When the Romans
                    therefore had brought their ships close under the wall, and thought themselves
                    well covered, they were unexpectedly overwhelmed with a new shower of darts and
                    stones, which fell perpendicularly on their heads, and obliged them to retire
                    with great precipitation. But they had no sooner removed to some distance, than
                    a new shower of darts overtook them, which made a dreadful havock of the men,
                    while stones of an immense weight, discharged from other machines, either
                    disabled or broke in pieces most of their galleys. This loss they sustained
                    without being able to revenge it on the enemy; for Archimedes had placed most of
                    his engines behind the walls, and not only out of the reach, but even out of the
                    sight, of the enemy; so that the Romans were repulsed with a dreadful slaughter,
                    without seeing the hand that occasioned it. What most harassed them in the
                    attack by sea, was a sort of crow with iron claws, fastened to a long chain,
                    which was let down by a lever. The weight of the iron made it fall with great
                    violence, and drove it into the planks of the galleys. Then the besieged, by a
                    great weight of lead at the other end of the lever, weighed it down, and
                    consequently raised up the iron of the crow in proportion, and with it the prow
                    of the galley to which it was fastened, sinking the poop at the same time into
                    the water. After this the crow letting go its hold all of a sudden, the prow of
                    the galley fell with such force into the sea, that the whole vessel was filled
                    with water, and sunk. At other times, the machines, dragging ships to the shore
                    by hooks, dashed them to pieces against the points of the rocks which projected
                    under the walls. Other vessels were quite lifted up into the air, there whirled
                    about with incredible rapidity, and then let fall into the sea, and sunk, with
                    all that they contained. How these stupendous works were effected, few, if any,
                    have hitherto been able to comprehend.</p>
                <p>The troops under the command of Appius suffered no less than the fleet in this
                    second attack. In the whole space of ground which the army occupied when formed,
                    the last files as well as the first were overwhelmed with showers of darts and
                    flints, against which they could not possibly defend themselves. When they had
                    with infinite trouble brought the mantlets and covered galleries, under which
                    they were to work the rams, near the foot of the wall, Archimedes discharged
                    such large beams and stones upon them as crushed them to pieces. If any brave
                    Roman ventured to draw too near the wall, iron hooks were immediately let down
                    from above, which, taking hold of his clothes or some part of his body, lifted
                    him up in the air and dashed out his brains with the fall. Marcellus, though at
                    a loss how to proceed, could not however forbear expressing himself with
                    pleasantry. Shall we persist, said he to his workmen, in making war upon this
                    Briareus, upon this giant with an hundred hands? But the soldiers, if they saw
                    upon the walls only a small cord, or the least piece of wood, were so terrified,
                    that they immediately turned their backs and fled, crying out that Archimedes
                    was going to discharge some dreadful machine upon them.</p>
                <p>The consuls, finding themselves thus defeated in every attempt, turned the siege
                    into a blockade, reduced most of the other places in the island, and defeated
                    the forces which were sent against them; and at last Marcellus made himself
                    master of Syracuse itself. He took the opportunity of a festival, when the
                    soldiers and citizens had drunk plentifully, to make a detachment scale the
                    walls of Tyche, in that part of it which was nearest to Epipolae, and which was
                    ill guarded. He speedily possessed himself of Epipolae; and the inhabitants of
                    Neapolis, as well as Tyche, then sent deputies to offer their submission.
                    Marcellus granted life and liberty to all of free condition, but gave up those
                    quarters of the city to be plundered. The soldiers had orders to spare the lives
                    of the citizens; but they were cruel in their avarice, slew many of them, and
                    among the rest the incomparable Archimedes. He was very intent on a
                    demonstration in geometry, and calmly drawing his lines, when a soldier entered
                    the room, and applied a sword to his throat. “Hold!" said Archimedes, “one
                    moment, and my demonstration will be finished.” But the soldier, equally
                    regardless of his prayer and his demonstration, instantly put him to death. Of
                    the manner of his death there are different accounts, but all agree that
                    Marcellus regretted it extremely, and showed a singular favour to his relations
                    for his sake.</p>
                <p>The city of Syracuse continued subject to the western empire till its declension,
                    when the island of Sicily being ravaged by different barbarians, the capital
                    also underwent various revolutions, till at last, in the ninth century, it was
                    so destroyed by the Saracens that very few traces of its ancient grandeur are
                    now to be seen. The ancient city of Syracuse was of a triangular form, and
                    consisted of five parts or divisions. The circuit, according to Strabo, amounted
                    to 180 stadia, or twenty-two English miles and four furlongs. This account Mr
                    Swinburne once suspected of exaggeration; but after spending two days in tracing
                    the ruins, and making reasonable allowances for the encroachments of the sea, he
                    was convinced of the exactness of Strabo’s measurement.</p>
                <p>The modem city is the capital of an intendancy of its own name. It is situated on
                    a noble harbour, with an excellent bottom, and a plentiful supply of fresh
                    water; but though well adapted for a naval station, or for an extended
                    commercial port, it is only visited by a few polaccas or other small coasting
                    vessels. Lord Nelson, when in pursuit of the French expedition in 1798, was here
                    enabled to water and provide his fleet with fresh meat in five days. The city is
                    now fortified, and has a strong citadel. The streets are confined and narrow;
                    the public buildings, though numerous, have little to recommend them. There is a
                    museum and a public library, as well as some private cabinets. The country
                    around, being abundantly irrigated, is highly fertile, produ-<pb break="no"
