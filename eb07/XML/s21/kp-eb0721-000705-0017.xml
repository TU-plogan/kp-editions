                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">SUSPENSION BRIDGE</label> is such a structure as is hung and
                    stretched across some chasm, water-course, or other space, over which it is
                    designed to form a passage. In Thibet, Peru, and various other remote regions,
                    bridges on this principle, though of an extremely rude and perishable
                    construction, and forming a most unstable and oscillating path, seem to have
                    existed anterior to any thing which is at present known of the history of those
                    countries; but the introduction of suspension bridges into civilized states, at
                    least on a large scale and of a substantial fabric, is of very modern date. The
                    leading features in the structure of the latter sort have hitherto, for the most
                    part, consisted in fixing securely in the two opposite banks, the extremities of
                    strong chains, which, being carried over piers or pillars, reach across the
                    space to be passed, in such a manner that each portion of chain intercepted
                    between two piers is allowed naturally to assume by its weight the figure of the
                    curve thence named the <hi rend="italic">catenaria.</hi> From these chains, a
                    platform for the roadway is suspended by means of a series of equidistant
                    vertical roads. Some bridges approaching to this description are said to have
                    existed in China for many<pb break="no"

                    ages, though these cannot be expected to bear any close comparison with the
                    productions of more intelligent artists, and especially the famous bridge which
                    Telford constructed across the Menai Straits, to connect the Isle of Anglesea
                    with the coast of Wales, and which at the time of its being completed (1826) was
                    the largest of the kind in the world. The span of the suspended or central arch,
                    between the highest points of the chains on the tops of the piers, and 153 feet
                    above high water in the straits, is 560 feet, and the versed sine or depression
                    in the middle is forty-three feet. Seven stone arches, of 52½ feet span each,
                    make up the rest of the bridge; four of those being next the island, and three
                    on the Welsh coast. But the chains, of which there are sixteen, reach over the
                    whole structure, and, besides, descend sixty feet in sloping pits or shafts, to
                    where they are secured by means of cast-iron frames ingrafted in the rocks; the
                    entire length of each chain being 1714 feet, or almost one third of a mile. The
                    two suspension piers of the middle arch rise fifty-two feet above the roadway,
                    and are surmounted by cast-iron blocks and saddles, moveable upon
                    friction-rollers, for the purpose of allowing the chains which pass over them to
                    move with freedom when expanding or contracting under the vicissitudes of
                    temperature. The suspended platform, elevated 100 feet above high water, is
                    occupied by two carriage-roads, each twelve feet wide, with a footpath of four
                    feet between them. These pass through arches in the suspension piers; and each
                    is separated and strongly railed in by lattice ironwork, both for protection,
                    and also for stiffening the roadway to prevent vibration. Each of the chains is
                    fivefold, being composed of five series of iron bars, in such a manner that
                    there are eighty bars in the cross section of the whole chains. Each bar is nine
                    feet nine inches in length, three inches in breadth, and one in thickness, with
                    six connecting plates at each double joint, eighteen inches long by ten broad,
                    and one thick; the whole being secured by two bolts of fifty-six pounds each.
                    The design of such complexity is, that any part of the chain may with safety be
                    removed at any time for repair, or be replaced by a new one.</p>
                <p>The Menai Bridge, however, has been greatly surpassed, both in length and height,
                    by a far lighter and much less expensive one, though of great strength, which
                    has since been constructed by M. Challey of Lyon, over the river Sarine, at
                    Freyburg, in Switzerland. This was completed in 1834. The span is 870 feet, and
                    the roadway is elevated 167 feet above the water of the Sarine. The lightness of
                    this bridge is in a great measure owing to its neither being suspended by chains
                    nor solid iron rods, but by four cables of iron wire, each containing about 1200
                    wires, the united strength of which could support thrice the load they will ever
                    be likely to bear, or three times the weight of two rows of loaded waggons
                    extending over its whole length. It is greatly in favour of these cables that
                    the wires have not been twisted together like so much hair or hemp; for we have
                    no doubt that twisting would have increased the stress in the ratio of radius to
                    the cosine of the obliquity, as it must unavoidably do in ordinary ropes; but
                    each wire just preserves the same direction as the cable itself does, and which,
                    between the piers, is that of a catenarian curve, depressed fifty-five feet at
                    the middle. Two of the cables are placed close together at each side of the
                    bridge; each cable, except where it passes in a flattened shape over
                    friction-rollers on the tops of the piers, has the whole of its wires firmly
                    bound into a cylindrical form, by means of annealed wire wound round them at
                    intervals of two or three feet. They are painted white, both for preservation,
                    and that the least tendency to rust might be detected at once. The cables first
                    enter the banks in a sloping direction, and after passing over friction-rollers,
                    and then descending forty-five feet vertically in shafts cut in the rock, they
                    are finally attached at the bottom to massy blocks of stone, which are securely
                    held down by means of masonry, filling up the shafts in a dovetailed form.</p>
                <p>But the catenarian form of suspension, however well suited to support a heavy
                    load uniformly distributed over it and at rest, is by no means easily restrained
                    from a readiness which it naturally has to yield, like a fluid, to any change or
                    inequality in the pressure, and consequently to oscillate or undulate when used
                    for a bridge which has to support loads that are not only very unequal, but
                    perpetually shifting their positions on it. To remedy or obviate this defect,
                    various schemes have at different times been proposed. Some of these are merely
                    attempts to stiffen the fabric by means of stays, strongly trussed railings,
                    &amp;c. In other schemes, it has been proposed to abandon the chains and cables
                    altogether, and to use in their stead separate and un yielding suspensions for
                    the different parts of the roadway. Thus in the Annals of Philosophy for January
                    1818, Mr Loudon has given a design for a bridge to cross the Mersey at Runcorn,
                    in which the suspension is to be effected by a considerable number of straight
                    iron rods, radiating from the tops of the piers, and separately attached to two
                    series of equidistant points ranging along the roadway. Under this arrangement,
                    it is evident that no material sinking of a particular part of the roadway could
                    occur without the rods which supported it giving way altogether, and it were
                    easy to have these as strong as any chains. Nearly the same scheme was
                    afterwards given by Mr Seaward in the Philosophical Magazine for December 1823,
                    and has been still more recently proposed again, with some improvements, by Mr
                    Curtis, at the Liverpool meeting of the British Association, under the title of
                    “an inflexible suspension bridge.” At the Newcastle meeting, a scheme was
                    brought forward by Mr Dredge, for what he calls “a mathematical suspension.” His
                    paper then read has been printed with some additions in the Mechanics Magazine
                    for October 1838; but instead of any thing mathematical, the terms in which he
                    has expressed himself are so enigmatical, if not paradoxical, that, from an
                    attentive perusal, we have only been able to gather, that by means of a tapering
                    chain, and what he calls “diagonal rods,” he professes (though without
                    explaining how) both to lessen the strain greatly, and also to proportion the
                    strength of the several parts so accurately to the stress, as to require a much
                    less quantity of materials than usual. He farther informs us that a bridge
                    constructed at Bath, on these unexplained principles, has answered admirably.
                    There are various other projects for bridges, which our limits will not permit
                    us to specify. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. e. e.)</hi></p>
