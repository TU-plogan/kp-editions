                <p><label type="entry">SWIMMING</label>, the art of floating one’s self on water,
                    and at the same time making a progressive motion through it. As swimming is not
                    natural to man, it is evident that at some period it must have been unknown
                    among the human race. Nevertheless there are no accounts of its origin to be
                    found in the history of any nation; nor are there any nations so barbarous but
                    that the art of swimming is known among them, and that in greater perfection
                    than among civilized people. It is probable, therefore, that the art, though not
                    absolutely natural, will always be acquired by people in a savage state, from
                    imitating the brute animals, most of whom swim naturally. Indeed so much does
                    this appear to be the case, that very expert swimmers have recommended it to
                    those who wished to learn the art, to keep some frogs in a tub of water
                    constantly beside them, and to imitate the motions by which they move through
                    that element.</p>
                <p>The theory of swimming depends upon one very simple principle; namely, that if a
                    force be applied to any body, it will always move towards that side where there
                    is the least resistance. Thus, if a person standing in a boat pushes with a pole
                    against the side or any other part of the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=54" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0054-0040"/>
                    vessel in which he stands, no motion will ensue; for as much as he presses in
                    one direction with the pole, just so much does the action of his feet, on which
                    the pressure of the pole must ultimately rest, push the vessel the other way:
                    but if, instead of the side of the vessel, be pushes the pole against the shore,
                    then only one force acts upon it, namely, that of the feet; which being resisted
                    only by the water, the boat begins to move from the shore. Now the very same
                    thing takes place in swimming, whether the animal be man, quadruped, bird, or
                    fish. If we consider the matter simply, we may suppose an animal in such a
                    situation that it could not possibly swim: thus, if we cut off the fins and tail
                    of a fish, it will indeed float in consequence of being specifically lighter
                    than the water, but cannot make any progressive motion, or at least but very
                    little, in consequence of wriggling its body; but if we allow it to keep any of
                    its fins, by striking them against the water in any direction the body moves the
                    contrary way, just as the boat moves the contrary way to that in which the oars
                    strike the water. It is true, that as the boat is but partly immerged in the
                    water, the resistance is comparatively less than when a frog or even any other
                    quadruped swims; but a boat could certainly be rowed with oars though it were
                    totally immerged in water, only with less velocity than when it is not. When a
                    man swims, he in like manner strikes the water with his hands, arms, and feet;
                    in consequence of which the body moves in a direction contrary to the stroke.
                    Upon this principle, and on this only, a man may either ascend, descend, or move
                    obliquely in any possible direction, in the water. One would think, indeed, that
                    as the strength of a man’s arms and legs is but small, he could make but very
                    little way by any stroke he could give the water, considering the fluidity of
                    that element. Nevertheless it is incredible what expert swimmers will perform in
                    this way; of which Dr Forster gives a most remarkable instance in the
                    inhabitants of Otaheite, whose agility, he tells us, was such, that when a nail
                    was thrown overboard, they would jump after it into the sea, and never fail to
                    catch it before it reached the bottom.</p>
                <p>As to the practice of swimming, there are but few directions which can be given.
                    The great obstacle is the natural dread which people have of being drowned; and
                    this it is impossible to overcome by any thing but accustoming ourselves to go
                    into the water. With regard to the real danger of being drowned, it is but
                    little; and on innumerable occasions arises entirely from the terror above
                    mentioned, as will appear from the following observations by Dr Franklin.</p>
                <p>“lst, That though the legs, arms, and head, of a human body, being solid parts,
                    are specifically somewhat heavier than fresh water, yet the trunk, particularly
                    the upper part, from its hollowness, is so much lighter than water, as that the
                    whole of the body, taken together, is too light to sink wholly under water, but
                    some part will remain above until the lungs become filled with water; which
                    happens from drawing water into them instead of air, when a person in the fright
                    attempts breathing while the mouth and nostrils are under water.</p>
                <p>“2dly, That the legs and arms are specifically lighter than salt water, and will
                    be supported by it; so that a human body would not sink in salt water though the
                    lungs were filled as above, but from the greater specific gravity of the
                    head.</p>
                <p>“3dly, That therefore a person throwing himself on his back in salt water, and
                    extending his arms, may easily lie so as to keep his mouth and nostrils free
                    from breathing; and by a small motion of his hands may prevent turning, if he
                    should perceive any tendency to it.</p>
                <p>“4thly, That in fresh water, if a man throws himself on his back near the
                    surface, he cannot long continue in that situation, but by a proper action of
                    his hands on the water.</p>
                <p>If he uses no such action, the legs and lower part of the body will gradually
                    sink till he comes into an upright position, in which he will continue
                    suspended, the hollow of the breast keeping the head uppermost.</p>
                <p>“5thly, But if in this erect position the head is kept upright above the
                    shoulders, as when we stand on the ground, the immersion will, by the weight of
                    that part of the head that is out of the water, reach above the mouth and
                    nostrils, perhaps a little above the eyes; so that a man cannot long remain
                    suspended in water with his head in that position.</p>
                <p>“Gthly, The body continued suspended as before, and upright, if the head be
                    leaned quite back, so that the face looks upwards, all the back part of the head
                    being then under water, and its weight consequently in a great measure supported
                    by it, the face will remain above water quite free for breathing, will rise an
                    inch higher every inspiration, and sink as much every expiration, but never so
                    low as that the water may come over the mouth.</p>
                <p>“7thly, If therefore a person unacquainted with swimming, and falling
                    accidentally into the water, could have presence of mind sufficient to avoid
                    struggling and plunging, and let the body take this natural position, he might
                    continue long safe from drowning, till perhaps help would come; for as to the
                    clothes, their additional weight while immersed is very inconsiderable, the
                    water supporting it; though when he comes out of the water, he would find them
                    very heavy indeed.”</p>
                <p>The method of learning to swim is as follows. The person must walk into water so
                    deep that it will reach to the breast. He is then to lie down gently on the
                    belly, keeping the head and neck perfectly upright, the breast advancing
                    forward, the thorax inflated, and the back bent; then withdrawing the legs from
                    the bottom, and stretching them out, strike the arms forwards in unison with the
                    legs. Swimming on the back is somewhat similar to that on the belly, but with
                    this difference, that although the legs are employed to move the body forwards,
                    the arms are generally unemployed, and the progressive motion is derived from
                    the movement of the legs. In diving, a person must close his hands together,
                    and, pressing his chin upon his breast, make an exertion to bend with force
                    forwards. While in that position, he must continue to move with rapidity under
                    the surface; and whenever he chooses to return to his former situation, he has
                    nothing to do but to bend back his head, and he will immediately return to the
                    surface.</p>
                <p>It is very common for novices in the art of swimming to make use of corks or
                    bladders to assist in keeping the body above water. Some have utterly condemned
                    the use of these; Dr Franklin however allows that they may be of service for
                    supporting the body while one is learning what is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >stroke,</hi> or that manner of drawing in and striking out the hands and feet
                    that is necessary to produce progressive motion. “But,” says he, “you will be no
                    swimmer till you can place confidence in the power of the water to support you:
                    I would therefore advise the acquiring that confidence in the first place,
                    especially as I have known several who, by a little of the practice necessary
                    for that purpose, have insensibly acquired the stroke, taught as it were by
                    nature.</p>
                <p>“The practice I mean is this. Choosing a place where the water deepens gradually,
                    walk coolly into it till it is up to your breast: then turn round your face to
                    the shore, and throw an egg into the water, between you and the shore; it will
                    sink to the bottom, and be easily seen there if the water is clear. It must lie
                    in the water so deep as that you cannot reach it to take it up but by diving for
                    it. To encourage yourself in order to do this, reflect that your progress will
                    be from deeper to shallower water; and that at any time you may, by bringing
                    your legs under you, and standing on the bottom, raise your head far above the
                    wa-<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=55"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0055-0041"/> ter: then plunge under it with your eyes open,
                    throwing yourself toward the egg, and endeavouring, by the action of your hands
                    and feet against the water, to get forward till within reach of it. In this
                    attempt you will find that the water buoys you up against your inclination; and
                    it is not so easy a thing to sink as you imagined; that you cannot but by active
                    force get down to the egg. Thus you feel the power of the water to support you,
                    and learn to confide in that power; while your endeavours to overcome it, and to
                    reach the <hi rend="italic">egg,</hi> teach you the manner of acting on the
                    water with your feet and hands; which action is afterwards used in swimming to
                    support your head higher above water, or to go forward through it.”</p>
                <p>As swimming is a healthy exercise and a pleasant amusement, and as a dexterity in
                    it may frequently put it in a man’s power to save his own life and the lives of
                    his fellow-creatures, perhaps of his dearest friends, it can neither be useless
                    nor uninteresting to consider a few of the evolutions which a swimmer must be
                    master of, that he move in any direction without difficulty, without danger, and
                    without being unnecessarily fatigued.</p>
                <p>There are several different ways of turning one’s self in swimming. You may do it
                    in this way: turn the palm of the right hand outwards, extend the arm in the
                    same manner, and make a contrary movement with the left hand and left arm; then,
                    by a gradual motion, incline your head and whole body to the left side, and the
                    evolution will be finished. There is another way, which is easier still. Bend
                    your head and body toward that side to which you are going to turn. If you wish
                    to turn to the left, incline the thumb and the right hand toward the bottom,
                    bend the fingers of the right hand, stretch it out, and use it for driving away
                    the water sidewise, or, which is the same thing, for pushing yourself the
                    contrary way. At the same time, with your left hand, the fingers being close,
                    push the water behind you, and all at once turn your body and your face to the
                    left, and the manoeuvre will be accomplished. If you wish to turn to the right,
                    you must do with your right hand what you did with your left, and with your left
                    what you did with your right. You must be careful when turning yourself never to
                    stretch out your legs, and be sure that the water be so deep that you be in no
                    danger of hurting yourself.</p>
                <p>When you are swimming on your belly, and wish to turn on your back, draw your
                    feet in quickly, and throw them before you; stretch out your hands behind you,
                    and keep your body firm and steady. When you wish to turn from swimming on your
                    back, fold your feet at once under your body, as if you were throwing them to
                    the bottom, and at the same instant dart your body forwards, that you may fall
                    upon your belly.</p>
                <p>In swimming, the eyes ought to be turned towards heaven. This is a most important
                    rule, and to the neglect of it many of the accidents which befall swimmers are
                    owing. For when they bend their eyes downwards, they insensibly bend their head
                    too, and thus the mouth being too deep in the water, may admit a quantity of it
                    in breaking; besides, the more the body is stretched, it covers a greater part
                    of the surface of the water, and consequently its specific gravity is less. Any
                    person who will make the experiment will find it impossible to dive while he
                    keeps his head erect and his eyes fixed on the heavens.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An interesting question occurs here, which
                    deserves to be considered. Since the body, when spread upon the surface, can be
                    supported with so little exertion, and frequently without any at all, as in
                    swimming on the back, how comes it to pass that <hi rend="italic">a</hi> person
                    when drowned sinks and frequently rises again some time afterwards. The reason
                    is this. In the act of drowning, the lungs are filled with water, and
                    consequently the body, being specifically heavier, sinks. It is well known that
                    the human body contains a great quantity of air. This air is at first compressed
                    by the water; and while this is the case, the body remains at the bottom; but as
                    soon as the air by its elasticity endeavours to disengage itself from the
                    compression, the body is swelled and expanded, becomes specifically lighter than
                    the water, and consequently rises to the top.</p></note></p>
                <p>The easiest posture in swimming is lying on the back. When you wish to swim in
                    this posture, lay yourself softly on your back, and raise your breast to the
                    surface of the water, keeping your body extended in the same line. Put your
                    hands easily over the upper part of your thighs, and throw out your legs and
                    draw them in alternately, keeping them within two feet of the surface. In this
                    way you may advance in any direction you please. You may perhaps not like having
                    so much of your head under water; there is, however, no way of swimming so easy,
                    so safe, and so little fatiguing. If you wish to swim with great rapidity, you
                    may use your arms as well as your feet; and you will find this the easiest way
                    of breaking the force of the waves.</p>
                <p>In swimming on the back, one may advance forward as well as backward. For this
                    purpose the body must be kept straight and extended; the breast inflated, so
                    that the hollow of the back may assume a semicircular form. The hands must
                    recline over the upper parts of the thighs. It is also necessary to raise the
                    legs one after another, and draw them in strongly towards the hams, and then
                    leave them suspended in the water. This way of swimming is not only pleasant,
                    but may serve to rest you when fatigued.</p>
                <p>When you are tired with swimming on your back and belly, you may swim on one
                    side. When you wish to do this, sink a little your left side and raise your
                    right; you will immediately find yourself on your left side. Move then your left
                    hand without either raising or sinking it; you have only to stretch it and draw
                    it back, as in a straight line, on the surface of the water. Independently of
                    the pleasure which this kind of motion will give you, you will have the
                    satisfaction of seeing both sides of the river.</p>
                <p>It is possible to swim on the belly without the assistance of the hands. For this
                    purpose you must keep your breast erect, your neck straight, and fix your hands
                    behind your head, or upon your back, while you move forward by employing your
                    feet. This way is not without its advantages. It is an excellent resource when
                    the arms are seized with a cramp, or with any indisposition which makes it
                    painful to exert them. This in some cases may be preferable to swimming on the
                    back; for while in that attitude, one cannot see before them without turning
                    every instant. If one of your legs be seized with a cramp, take hold of it with
                    the hand opposite to it, and use the other hand and leg to advance or support
                    yourself.</p>
                <p>A very ancient and graceful mode of swimming, is that of swimming with the hands
                    joined. When you wish to put this in practice, join your hands, keeping the
                    thumbs and fingers towards heaven, so that they may appear above the water; then
                    draw them back and push them forwards alternately from your breast. This method
                    of swimming may be useful in several circumstances, but above all if you are
                    entangled with grass or weeds. Your hands will then open a passage for you.</p>
                <p>As a person may sometimes have occasion to carry something in his hand in
                    swimming, which he is anxious to preserve from the water, he may swim easily
                    with one hand and hold a parcel in the other, as Caesar swam with his
                    Commentaries at Alexandria; or one may swim with both hands elevated. To perform
                    this well, the swimmer must raise his breast, and keep it as much inflated as he
                    can, at the same time that he supports the arms above the water. It must not be
                    concealed that this method of swimming is attended with some danger to one who
                    is not dexterous at the art; for if one should imprudently draw in his breast<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0056-0042"/> when his arms are raised, he would immediately
                    sink to the bottom.</p>
                <p>When a man plunges into the water, and has reached the bottom, he has only to
                    give a small stroke with his foot against the ground in order to rise; but an
                    experienced swimmer, if he misses the ground, has recourse to another expedient,
                    which is very pretty, and which has not been much considered. Suppose him at a
                    considerable depth, when he perceives that he cannot reach the bottom. In such a
                    case, he first puts his hands before his face, at the height of his forehead,
                    with the palms turned outwardly; then holding the fore part of his arm
                    vertically, he makes them move backwards and forwards from right to left; that
                    is to say, these two parts of his arms, having the elbow as a kind of pivot,
                    describe very quickly, both the hands being open and the fingers joined, two
                    small portions of a circle before the forehead, as if he would make the water
                    retire, which he in fact does; and from these strokes given to the water, there
                    results an oblique force, one part of which carries the swimmer upwards.</p>
