                <p><label type="entry">GALL, <hi rend="smallcaps">John Joseph</hi></label>, the
                    founder of Phrenology, as it is now called, was descended of a respectable
                    family residing at Tiefenbrunn, two leagues distant from Pforzheim, in Suabia,
                    and born on the 9th of March 1757. His father was a shopkeeper or merchant, and
                    mayor of the village. His parents, who were of the Roman Catholic persuasion,
                    originally intended him for holy orders; but his natural dispositions were
                    adverse to such a destination. He pursued his studies first at Baden, then at
                    Brucksal, and afterwards at Strasburg, where he completed his literary
                    education. Having resolved to study medicine with a view to the practice of
                    physic, he, in 1781, proceeded to Vienna, the medical school of that capital
                    having acquired great celebrity, particularly since the times of Van Swicten and
                    Stoll; and, after passing through the ordinary course, he took his degree.</p>
                <p>Being early given to observation, Gall, whilst yet a boy, was struck with the
                    fact, that each of his companions and schoolfellows possessed some peculiarity
                    of talent which distinguished him from the others. One excelled in penmanship,
                    another in arithmetic, a third in the acquisition of languages. The compositions
                    of some were remarkable for elegance, whilst those of others were hard, stiff,
                    formal, and dry; several connected their reasonings in the closest manner, and
                    clothed their arguments in forcible language; many were devoid of the talent for
                    logical arrangement, and incapable of expressing themselves with clearness and
                    precision. Nor were their dispositions less various than their intellectual
                    endowments. Not a few manifested a capacity for employments which they had not
                    been taught, such as cutting figures in wood, or delineating them on paper; some
                    devoted their leisure to drawing or gardening, whilst others abandoned
                    themselves to noisy games, or traversed the woods to gather flowers, search for
                    birds’ nests, or catch butterflies. In short, each presented a character
                    peculiar to himself, and Gall did not observe that the individual who, one year,
                    displayed selfish or knavish propensities, became a kind and faithful friend the
                    next. Of ħis schoolfellows, those with whom he experienced the greatest
                    difficulty in competing, were the boys who committed their lessons to memory
                    with the greatest facility; and such individuals frequently gained from him by
                    their repetitions the places which he had obtained by the merit of his original
                    compositions. Several years afterwards, having changed his place of residence,
                    and still meeting with individuals possessed of the same faculty, he observed
                    that the individuals so gifted had all prominent eyes, and he also recollected
                    that his rivals in the first school had been distinguished by the same
                    peculiarity. On entering the university, he accordingly directed his attention
                    to those students who had large eyes, and, upon inquiry, he found that they all
                    excelled in committing pieces to memory and giving correct recitations, although
                    many of them were by no means remarkable for general talent. As the coincidence
                    thus observed was recognised by the other students in the classes, Gall
                    conceived that it could not be entirely accidental; and hence, from this period,
                    he seems to have come to the conclusion that they stood in an important relation
                    to each other. But if verbal memory was thus indicated by an external sign, it
                    required no great effort of generalization to conceive that the other
                    intellectual powers might have each its appropriate manifestation. Proceeding on
                    this idea or assumption, Gall now directed his attention to individuals
                    distinguished by any remarkable faculty; and, after a course of observation, he
                    conceived himself to have discovered and defined the external characteristics
                    indicative of decided talents for painting, music, and the mechanical arts.
                    Having also become acquainted with several persons remarkable for determination
                    of character, he observed that a particular part of their heads was largely
                    developed, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193517828" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7828-0297"
                    />this development he 8et down as the external sign or ma* nifestation of the
                    character referred to.</p>
                <p>His next step was to look in the head for the indications of the moral sentiments
                    as well as of the intellectual faculties; but here he experienced considerable
                    difficulties. Hitherto he had been ignorant of the opinions of physiologists
                    concerning the brain, and of metaphysicians respecting the menial faculties;
                    and, on turning to books, he became so much perplexed by the discordance of the
                    views therein inculcated, that, for a time, he hesitated as to the correctness
                    of his own observations. He found that, whilst Pythagoras, Plato, Galen, Haller,
                    and others, placed the sentient sou] in the brain, Aristotle fixed its residence
                    in the heart, Van Helmont in the stomach, Descartes in the pineal gland, and
                    Drelincourt in the cerebellum; that, according to many philosophers and
                    physiologists, all men are born with equal mental faculties; and that the
                    differences observable amongst mankind are not ascribable to any original or
                    constitutional inequality of powers, but the result partly of education, and
                    partly of the diversified circumstances in which individuals are placed. But if
                    all differences are accidental, it is evident that there can be no natural signs
                    of predominating faculties, and, consequently, that the project of attempting,
                    by observation, to discover the functions of the different portions of the
                    brain, must be abandoned as hopeless. Sensible of this, Gall combated the
                    difficulty by denying the truth of the doctrine of original equality on which it
                    is founded. He contended that persons who have all received the same or very
                    nearly the same education unfold each a distinct character, over which
                    circumstances appear to exercise only a limited control; that individuals, whose
                    education has been conducted with the greatest care, and on whom the labours of
                    instructors have been most freely lavished, frequently remain far behind their
                    companions in attainments; that many, even with the most ardent desire, followed
                    out by the most persevering efforts, cannot, in some pursuits, attain even to
                    mediocrity; that, in point of fact, instructors of youth do not appear to attach
                    much faith to the system which teaches the equality of mental faculties, and
                    think themselves entitled to exact more from one scholar and less from another;
                    that the doctrine of Scripture, according to which, each will be required to
                    render an account only in proportion to the gifts which he has received, serves
                    to confirm this view, and is, moreover, in accordance with observation and
                    experience. On these grounds, Dr Gall concluded that there is a natural and
                    constitutional diversity of talents and dispositions amongst men; and that,
                    supposing the exercise of the mental faculties dependent on the functions of the
                    brain, the external signs of these faculties may be determined by
                    observation.</p>
                <p>Abandoning every theory and preconceived opinion, therefore, he applied himself
                    to the discovery of those signs of the existence of which he had thus satisfied
                    his own mind. Being physician to a lunatic asylum at Vienna, he had
                    opportunities of making observations on the insane; he visited prisons, and
                    resorted to the seats of learning; he was introduced to the courts of princes
                    and the tribunals ofjustice; wherever he heard of an individual remarkable
                    either for his mental endowments or defects, he studied the development of his
                    head; and at length he conceived himself warranted in maintaining that
                    particular mental powers are indicated by particular configurationsof the shell
                    or case in which the brain is lodged. Hitherto he had resorted only to
                    physiognomical indications in order to discover the functions of the brain; but,
                    being convinced that physiology is imperfect when separated from anatomy, he
                    felt the necessity of instituting anatomical researches into the structure of
                    the brain.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Having
                    observed a woman, aged fifty-four years, who from her youth had been afflicted
                    with water in the head, yet possessed a mind as active and intelligent as that
                    of any other individual of her class, Dr Gall declared his conviction that the
                    structure of the brain must be different from what it was generally supposed to
                    be; a conclusion which Tulpius had already drawn from observing a hydrocephalic
                    patient, whose mental faculties remained unaffected by the disease under which
                    he was labouring. This, and other analogous cases, convinced Dr Gall of the
                    necessity of instituting minute anatomical researches into the structure and
                    fonctions of the brain.</p></note> Accordingly, in every instance where an
                    individual whose head he had examined whilst alive happened to die, he used
                    every means to obtain permission to examine the brain, and frequently did so;
                    and he states it as a general fact, that, on the skull being removed, the brain,
                    covered by the dura mater, presented a form corresponding to that which the
                    skull had exhibited in life. Thus, by successive steps, by first observing a
                    concomitance between particular talents and dispositions, and particular forms
                    of the head, and next by ascertaining that the figure and size of the brain were
                    indicated by these external forms, Dr Gall conceived that he had determined the
                    intellectual dispositions corresponding to about twenty organs, or, in other
                    words, ascertained the residences of as many intellectual faculties of the first
                    order; and these organs he named according to the faculty or propensity which he
                    attributed to each respectively. In short, he maintained that the intellectual
                    dispositions being innate, have their seats in the brain, where the organs of
                    the faculties are also situated; that the more prominent any isolated point on
                    the skull is, the greater is the activity of the faculty, the organ of which is
                    there placed; and that the part of the brain where such faculty resides and
                    acts, by pressing on the skull, forms, on its convex surface, a protuberance,
                    which indicates externally the organ, and is, in fact, its invariable sign.</p>
                <p>Dr Gall first became known as an author by the publication of two chapters of a
                    work entitled <hi rend="italic">Philosophisch-Meicinishe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Untersuchungen über Natur und Kunst im gesunden und krauken Zustande des
                    Menschen,</hi> Vienna, 1791. This work was not continued; but in the two
                    chapters published, Dr Gail evinced the spirit which subsequently guided his
                    researches into the intellectual and moral nature of man. The first written
                    notice of his inquiries respecting the differences of form observable in the
                    human head was contained in a familiar letter addressed to Baron Retzen, which
                    appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Deutschen</hi><hi rend="italic">Mercur</hi> of
                    December 1798; but two years before this Dr Gall had commenced giving courses of
                    private lectures at Vienna, where his doctrines soon attracted general
                    attention; and Fro-riep, Martens, and Walther, were among his hearers. He
                    continued his lectures for five years, with increasing success, when, at length,
                    upon the 8th of January 1802, the Austrian government issued an order,
                    interdicting them, on the ground that the doctrines therein promulgated were
                    dangerous to religion; and, in a general regulation which accompanied the order,
                    all private lectures were prohibited, unless specially permitted by the public
                    authorities. Dr Gall understood the object of this regulation, and never
                    solicited permission; but, as usually happens, the prohibition stimulated
                    curiosity, and the doctrines thus interdicted were studied with greater zeal
                    than before. It is difficult to perceive what object the Austrian government
                    proposed to attain by this foolish interposition, more especially as
                    publications on the subject continued to be permitted, provided they abstained
                    from reflecting on the government for issuing the order above mentioned. On the
                    6th March 1805, Dr Gall left Vienna, in company with Dr Spurzheim, whom he had
                    now associated with him in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193517841"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-7841-0298"/>his pursuits, and proceeded to Berlin, where he
                    remained a short time; he then visited all the principal towns and universities
                    of Germany, and in November 1807 repaired to Paris, where he established himself
                    as a medical practitioner, and remained till the time of his death. To the
                    charge of Spinozism or atheism, which was strongly urged against him,
                    particularly by some of the French scholars, Dr Gall replied in a work entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Des Dispositions</hi><hi rend="italic">innées</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de l’Ame</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Esprit, ou du Matérialisme,</hi> Paris, 1812, in 8vo,
                    which he seems to have intended as an authoritative exposition of the
                    metaphysics of the new science.. But a much ruder onset awaited it. In 1815, and
                    again in 1826, craniology was attacked in able articles inserted in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> where the united powers of argument and
                    ridicule were forcibly directed against it by writers possessing an equal
                    mastery over both; but the results of Dr Gall’s observations were not, in the
                    opinion of his followers, destroyed, nor even materially affected, by the
                    critical severity with which these had been examined in the Review; and their
                    confidence in the truth of the system, which to the uninitiated appeared to be
                    overthrown, gained strength from each successive shock to which it was exposed.
                    But whatever may be thought of Dr Gall’s discoveries, either in reference to the
                    philosophy of mind, or to the moral and religious opinions of mankind, it seems
                    to be pretty generally conceded, that, by his dissections and observations, he
                    has considerably advanced the knowledge of the cerebral system, and that, even
                    if he be accounted a bad philosopher, he has at least shown himself an able
                    anatomist. He demonstrated, what before was only conjectured, that cerebral
                    matter does not derive its origin from the brain, but from the spinal marrow;
                    which, expanding as it proceeds, at length forms the two hemispheres into which
                    the brain is divided. In conjunction with Spurzheim, Dr Gall published at Paris,
                    in 1810, <hi rend="italic">Anatomie et Physiologie du Système nerveux en
                    général, et du Cerveau en particulier;</hi> but of this work there only appeared
                    a volume and a half. The most elaborate of his productions, however, is <hi

                    was completed in 1825. His <hi rend="italic">Histoire des Fonctions du

                    Paris, where he had for many years practised medicine with success, leaving his
                    mantle to Dr Spurzheim, who had been long associated with him both in the
                    pursuit and the propagandism of phrenology. (See <hi rend="italic">Biographie

                    inhabitants, about equally Catholics and Protestants. It is divided into eight

                    land is mountainous; but the districts of Rhinethal, Norschach, and Gossau, have

                    None ol the mountain regions of Switzerland have been less explored, or are less
                    known, than those of this canton. From them issue many of those rivers which
                    increase the volume and the rapidity of the Rhine before’t enters into the Lake
                    of Constance.</p>

                    raised in large quantities and of excellent sorts, especially apples, which
                    furnish cider as the common drink. The milk of the cows is more used for butter
                    than for cheese. Some wine is made; but for want of care it will not bear to be
                    long kept.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of the canton are prosperous and increasing. The muslins,
                    printed calicoes, and cotton goods, find ready sale at the German fairs. There
                    are many large mills for spinning cotton and linen. The chief trade is in the
                    capital, at Etznach, and Sargans. The government is republican, residing in two
                    assemblies chosen by those who possess property to a stipulated amount, whilst
                    the members to be chosen must have a prescribed amount of capital. The canton
                    contributes to the general fund of the confederacy 39,450 francs yearly, and
                    furnishes for the general defence a contingent of 2630 men; but all the
                    population capable of bearing arms are regimented, and taught the use of
                    them.</p>
