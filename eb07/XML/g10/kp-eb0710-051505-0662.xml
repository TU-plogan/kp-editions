                <p><label type="entry">GIBRALTAR</label>, a famous promontory, or rather peninsula,
                    of Spain, situated in north latitude 36. 6., and west longitude 5. 17. To the
                    ancients it was known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Calpe,</hi> and was also
                    called one of the <hi rend="italic">Pillars of Hercules</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> by the Arabians it is called <hi rend="italic">Gebel Tarek,</hi> that
                    is, the Mount of Tarek, from the name of the Saracen general who conquered Spain
                    in the beginning of the eighth century. The whole is one immense rock. “It’s
                    form,” says Major Imrie, “is oblong; its summit a sharp craggy ridge; its
                    direction is nearly from north to south; and its greatest length, in that
                    direction, falls very little short of three miles. Its breadth varies with the
                    indentations of the shore, but it nowhere exceeds three quarters of a mile. The
                    line of its ridge is undulated, and the two extremes are somewhat higher than
                    its centre. The summit of the Sugar Loaf, which is the point of its greatest
                    elevation towards the south, is 1439 feet; the Rock Mortar, which is the highest
                    point to the north, is 1350; and the Signal House, which is nearly the central
                    point between these two, is 1276 feet above the level of the sea. The western
                    side of the mountain is a series of rugged slopes, interspersed with abrupt
                    precipices. Its northern extremity is perfectly perpendicular, except towards
                    the north-west, where what are called the Lines intervene, and a narrow passage
                    of flat ground that leads to the isthmus, and is entirely covered with
                    fortification. The eastern side of the mountain mostly consists of a range of
                    precipices; but a bank of sand, rising from the Mediterranean in a rapid
                    acclivity, covers a third of its perpendicular height. Its southern extremity
                    falls, in a rapid slope, from the summit of the Sugar Loaf, into a rocky flat of
                    considerable extent, called Windmill Hill.</p>
                <p>“The principal mass of the mountain rock consists of a gray dense (or what is
                    generally called primary) marble; the different beds of which are to be examined
                    in a face of 1350 feet of perpendicular height, which it presents to Spain in a
                    conical form. These beds, or strata, are of various thickness, from twenty to
                    upwards of forty feet, dipping in a direction from east to west, nearly at an
                    angle of thirty-five degrees. In some parts of the solid mass of this rock are
                    found testaceous bodies entirely transmuted into the constituent matter of the
                    rock, and their interior hollows filled up with calcareous spar; but these do
                    not often occur in its composition, and its beds are not separated by any
                    intermediate strata.” <hi rend="italic">( Transactions of the Royal Society of
                    Edinburgh,</hi> vol. iv.)</p>
                <p>The town lies along the bay upon the west side of the mountain, on a declivity;
                    by which, generally speaking, the rains pass through it, and keep it clean. The
                    old town was considerably larger than the new. Many of the streets are narrow
                    and irregular, and the buildings are of different materials; some of natural
                    stone, extracted from the quarries, others of a factitious or artificial stone,
                    and a few of brick. The people are supplied with fresh provisions, chiefly from
                    the coast of Barbary, as well as fruit, roots, and vegetables of all sorts.
                    Besides what is properly called the town, there are several spacious and
                    commodious public edifices erected, such as barracks for the soldiers, with
                    apartments for their officers, magazines of different kinds, storehouses for
                    provisions, &amp;c. The population of the town, exclusive of the garrison, is
                    above 12,000, being partly British, and partly Spaniards, Italians, Jews, and
                    even Moors, who are all attracted by mercantile enterprise. This town may be
                    said to have 6wo ports; the first lying to the north, which is proper only for
                    small vessels; the other very commodious for large vessels, which has a fine
                    stone quay. The bay is very beautiful and capacious, being in breadth about five
                    miles, and in length eight or nine, with several small rivers running into it.
                    It is very advantageous to the place. There is no ground to be found in the
                    middle of it at one hundred fathoms depth, so that a squadron may lie there in
                    great safety; the breezes from it are very refreshing; and it contributes
                    likewise to the subsistence of the inhabitants by supplying them with abundance
                    of fish.</p>
                <p>This important fortress seems to have been first particularly noticed as a place
                    of consequence in the year 712. At that time the general of the Caliph Alwalid
                    landed with an army of 12,000 men on the isthmus between Mount Calpe and the
                    continent; and, that he might secure an intercourse with Africa, he ordered a
                    casĭle to be built upon the face of the hill. Part of this building still
                    remains; and, from an inscription discovered above the principal gate, it
                    appears to have been finished in 725. It continued in the possession of the
                    Saracens till the beginning of the fourteenth century, when it was recovered by
                    Ferdinand king of Castille. In 1333, however, it was obliged to surrender to the
                    son of the Emperor of Fez, who came to the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520675"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-0675-0516"/>assistance of the Moorish king of Granada. An
                    attempt was made upon it in 1349, by Alonzo king of Castille; but when the
                    fortress had been reduced to the last extremity, a pestilential fever broke out
                    in the Spanish camp, which carried off the king himself, with great part of his
                    army; after which the enterprise was abandoned.</p>
                <p>The fortress continued in the possession of the Saracen descendants of the prince
                    of Fez until the year 1410, when it was taken possession of by Joseph III. king
                    of Granada. A design of attacking it was formed by Henry de Guzman in 1435; but
                    the enterprise having miscarried through his imprudence, he was defeated and
                    slain. However, it was at length taken after a gallant defence, by his son John
                    de Guzman, in 1462; and since that time it has remained in the hands of the
                    Christians. In 1540 it was surprised and pillaged by Piali Harnet, one of
                    Barbarossa’s corsairs; but the pirates having fallen in with some Sicilian
                    galleys, were by them defeated, and all either killed or taken.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Charles V. the fortifications of Gibraltar were modernized and
                    greatly strengthened. It yielded, however, to a British force sent against it
                    under Sir George Rooke in 1704, and has ever since remained subject to Britain.
                    Since the English became masters of it, its fortifications have been so much
                    improved as to render it impregnable. The memorable siege commenced by the
                    Spaniards in the course of the American war was signalized by the glorious
                    defence of General Elliot, and by the total destruction, in 1782, of an
                    apparatus of floating batteries, mounting above 200 pieces of cannon, from which
                    both France and Spain had anticipated the most splendid success.</p>
                <p>The possession of Gibraltar is esteemed of great consequence to Britain. It not
                    only gives us the command of the Straits, and their navigation, but affords
                    refreshment and accommodation to our fleets in time of war, and to our
                    merchantmen at all times; which, to a maritime power, is a great advantage. It
                    is otherwise highly favourable to our trade in the Mediterranean and Levant. It
                    saves us the expense of squadrons or convoys, upon any disputes or disturbances
                    that may happen among the neighbouring powers, and which would otherwise be
                    necessary for the protection of our navigation.</p>
