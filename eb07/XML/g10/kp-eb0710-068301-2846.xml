                <p><label type="entry">GRAMMATICAL ABSTRACT</label>, <hi rend="italic">Exhibiting a
                    Systematic View of Words, as they are commonly arranged into distinct Classes,
                    with the Subdivisions under each Class.</hi></p>
                <p>All language is composed of words, each of which may be defined, a sound
                    significant of some idea or relation. These words may be arranged into four
                    general divisions, namely,</p>
                <p>I. SUBSTANTIVES; which are all those words that are expressive of things which
                    exist, or are conceived to exist, of themselves, and not as the energies or
                    qualities of any thing else. These may be divided into two orders,</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Nouns,</hi> properly so called, being the names of all
                    those things which exist, or are conceived to exist. These may be divided into
                    three kinds, each of which admits of the subdivisions after mentioned, viz.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Natural,</hi> or those which are used as the names of natural
                    substances; such are (genus) <hi rend="italic">animal</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> (species) <hi rend="italic">man, dog</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>

                    rend="italic">Artificial,</hi> or the several names of artificial objects; such
                    as, (genus) <hi rend="italic">edifice</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> (species) <hi
                    rend="italic">house, church</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> (individuaD <hi
                    rend="italic">Vatican, St Peters, St Paul’s.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Abstract,</hi> or those which are the names of qualities considered as
                    abstracted from their substances; such as, (genus) <hi rend="italic"
                    >motion;</hi> (species) <hi rend="italic">flight, course</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> (individuaD the <hi rend="italic">falcons flight,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">greyhound’s course.</hi></p>
                <p>Nouns of all kinds admit of the following accidents, viz.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gender,</hi> which is a certain affection of nouns denoting the
                    sex of those substances of which they are the names. For as in nature every
                    object is either male or female, or neither the one nor the other, grammarians,
                    following this idea, have divided the names of beings into three classes. Those
                    which denote males are said to be of the <hi rend="italic">masculine</hi>
                    gender; those which denote females, of the <hi rend="italic">feminine</hi>
                    gender; and those which denote neither the one nor the other, of the <hi
                    rend="italic">neuter</hi> gender. The English is the only language of which the
                    nouns are, with respect to sex, an exact copy of nature.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Number.</hi> As there is no object in nature single and alone,
                    and as by far the greater part of nouns are the names ofwhole classes of
                    objects, it is evident that every such noun ought to have some variation, to
                    denote whether it is one individual of the class which is meant, or more than
                    one. Accordingly we find, that in every language nouns have some method of
                    expressing this. If one be mentioned, the noun is used in that form which is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">singular</hi> number; if more than one, it is used
                    in a different form, which is called the <hi rend="italic">plural</hi>
                    number.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cases.</hi> All nouns, excepting proper names, are general
                    terms; but it is often necessary to use those general terms for the purpose of
                    expressing particular ideas. This can be done only by connecting the general
                    term with some word significant of a quality or circumstance peculiar to the
                    individual intended. When that quality or circumstance is not expressed by an
                    adjective, it is in English and most modern languages commonly connected with
                    the noun by the intervention of a preposition; but in the Greek and Latin
                    languages the noun has cases to answer the same, and even in English the noun
                    has, besides the nominative, one case to denote possession.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Pronouns,</hi> which are a species of word invented to
                    supply the place of nouns in certain circumstances. They are of two kinds,
                    viz.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">First, the prepositive</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> so called
                    because they are capable of leading a sentence. These are divided into three
                    orders, called the pronouns of the <hi rend="italic">First person.</hi> The
                    pronoun of this person, in English <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> denotes the speaker
                    as characterized by the present act of speaking, in contradistinction to every
                    other character which he may bear. It is said to be of the first person, because
                    there must necessarily be a speaker before there can be a hearer; and the
                    speaker and hearer are the only persons employed in discourse.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Second person.</hi> The pronoun of this person, in English <hi
                    rend="italic">thou,</hi> denotes the person addressed as characterized by the
                    present circumstance of being addressed. It is said to be of the second person,
                    because in discourse there cannot be a hearer till there be a speaker. The
                    pronouns of the first and second persons have number and cases, for the same
                    reason that nouns have these accidents; but in no language have they any
                    variation denoting gender. The reason is, that sex, and all other properties and
                    attributes whatever, excepting those just mentioned as descriptive of the nature
                    of these pronouns, are foreign from <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522859"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-2859-0684"/>the mind of the speaker when he utters <hi
                    rend="italic">I</hi> or <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> in discourse.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Third person.</hi> The pronouns of this person, <hi
                    rend="italic">he, site, it,</hi> are employed to denote any object which may be
                    the subject of discourse different from the speaker and the hearer. They are
                    improperly said to be of any person; for there can be but two persons employed
                    in discourse, the speaker and the party addressed. They are, however, pronouns;
                    since they stand by themselves, and are the substitutes of nouns. <hi
                    rend="italic">He</hi> is the substitute of a noun denoting a male animal; <hi
                    rend="italic">she,</hi> of a noun denoting a female animal; and <hi
                    rend="italic">it,</hi> of a noun denoting an object which has no sex. All these,
                    like the pronouns persona), admit of number and cases; but there is this
                    peculiarity attending them, that though in every case of the singular number the
                    distinction of gender is carefully preserved, in the plural it is totally lost;
                    <hi rend="italic">they, theirs,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">them,</hi> being the
                    nominative, possessive, and accusative cases of <hi rend="italic">he,</hi> of
                    <hi rend="italic">she,</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">it.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Secondly, the subjunctive;</hi> so called, because they cannot lead a sentence,
                    but only serve to subjoin a clause to another previously enunciated. Of this
                    kind are <hi rend="italic">Which</hi> and <hi rend="italic">who.</hi> This
                    subjunctive pronoun may be substituted in the place of any noun whatever,
                    whether it be expressive of a genus, a species, or an individual; as, the animal
                    <hi rend="italic">which,</hi> the man <hi rend="italic">who,</hi> Alexander <hi
                    rend="italic">who,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, it may even become the substitute of the
                    personal pronouns themselves; as when we say, I <hi rend="italic">who</hi> now
                    write, you <hi rend="italic">who</hi> now read, thou <hi rend="italic">who</hi>
                    readest, he <hi rend="italic">who</hi> wrote, she <hi rend="italic">who</hi>
                    spoke; where it is observable, that the subjunctive <hi rend="italic">who</hi>
                    adopts the person of that prepositive pronoun which it represents, and affects
                    the verb accordingly. <hi rend="italic">Who</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >which,</hi> therefore, are real pronouns, from substitution; and they have this
                    peculiarity besides, that they have not only the power of a pronoun, but also of
                    a connective of the same import with that which in English is expressed by the
                    preposition <hi rend="italic">of.</hi> The word <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is
                    now used indifferently for <hi rend="italic">who</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >which,</hi> as a subjunctive pronoun; but it was originally used only as a
                    definitive, and as such it ought still to be considered in philosophical
                    grammar.</p>
                <p>II. ATTRIBUTIVES; which are those words that are expressive of all such things as
                    are conceived to exist, not of themselves, but as the attributes of other
                    things. These are divided into,</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Verbs,</hi> or those words which are expressive of an
                    attribute and an assertion; as, <hi rend="italic">I wrote.</hi></p>
                <p>The attributes expressed by verbs have their essence in motion or its privation;
                    and as motion is always accompanied by time, therefore verbs are liable to
                    certain variations called <hi rend="smallcaps">tenses,</hi> viz.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">present,</hi> which represents the action of the verb as
                    going on, and as contemporary with something else; as, <hi rend="italic">I
                    write,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lam writing,</hi> either just now, or when you
                    are reading. The <hi rend="italic">prater-imperfect,</hi> which represents the
                    action of the verb as having been going on but not finished in some portion of
                    past time; as, <hi rend="italic">I was writing,</hi> no matter when, yesterday,
                    last week, or last year. The <hi rend="italic">aorist of the past,</hi> which
                    represents the action of the verb as finished in some indefinite portion of past
                    time; as, <hi rend="italic">I wrote,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">did write,</hi>
                    yesterday, or last week. The <hi rend="italic">prater-perfect,</hi> which
                    represents the action of the verb as just <hi rend="italic">now</hi> finished,
                    or as finished in some portion of time within which the present instant is
                    comprehended; as, <hi rend="italic">I have written</hi> this day or this week.
                    The <hi rend="italic">plusquam-perfect,</hi> which represents the action bf the
                    verb as having been finished in some portion of time within which a determinate
                    past instant was comprehended; as, <hi rend="italic">I had written</hi> last
                    week before I saw you. The <hi rend="italic">first future,</hi> which represents
                    the action of the verb as to be going on at some indefinite future time; as, <hi
                    rend="italic">I shall write</hi> or <hi rend="italic">be writing</hi> to-morrow,
                    or next week. The <hi rend="italic">second future,</hi> which represents the
                    action of the verb as to be completed at some definite future time; as, <hi
                    rend="italic">I shall have written</hi> when you come to-morrow, next week, next
                    month, or next year.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Affirmation</hi> is the essence of every verb, insomuch that
                    all verbs may be resolved into the substantive verb <hi rend="italic">is,</hi>
                    and another attributive. But a man may affirm something of the action of the
                    verb directly, something of his liberty or capacity to perform that action, or
                    something of his wish that another should perform it, To denote diese several
                    kinds of affirmation, all verbs have what grammarians call <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >modes,</hi> viz. the <hi rend="italic">indicative,</hi> to denote the first
                    kind of affirmation; as, <hi rend="italic">I write</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">subjunctive,</hi> to denote the second; as, <hi
                    rend="italic">I may</hi> or <hi rend="italic">can write</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >:</hi> die <hi rend="italic">imperative,</hi> to denote the third; as, <hi
                    rend="italic">write thou,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">do thou write.</hi> Besides
                    these, grammarians have given to every verb a mode, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >infinitive</hi>; as, <hi rend="italic">to write.</hi> But this seems on every
                    account to be improperly styled a mode. Nay, if affirmation be the essence of
                    verb, die infinitive cannot be considered as any part of the verb at all, for it
                    expresses no affirmation. It is indeed nothing more than an abstract noun
                    denoting the simple energy of the verb in conjunction with time.</p>
                <p>Verbs have likewise been distinguished into the following kinds, according to the
                    nature of the attribute of which they are expressive, namely, 1st, <hi
                    rend="italic">Active-transitive,</hi> or those which denote an action that
                    passes from the agent to some external object; as Caesar <hi rend="italic"
                    >conquered</hi> Pompey: 2d, <hi rend="italic">Active-intransitive, or</hi> those
                    which express that kind of action which has no effect upon any thing beyond the
                    agent himself; as, Caesar <hi rend="italic">walked</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">3d, Passive,</hi> or those which express not action but
                    passion, whether pleasing or painful; as, Portia <hi rend="italic">was
                    loved,</hi> Pompey <hi rend="italic">was conquered</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >:</hi><hi rend="italic">Cth, Neuter,</hi> or those which express an attribute
                    that consists neither in action nor in passion; as, Caesar <hi rend="italic"
                    >stood.</hi></p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Participles,</hi> or those words which are expressive of
                    an attribute combined with time. In English there are only two participles; the
                    present, as <hi rend="italic">writing,</hi> which expresses the action of the
                    verb <hi rend="italic">to write,</hi> as going on; and the past, as <hi
                    rend="italic">written,</hi> which expresses the action of the same verb as
                    finished, and therefore past in time. In Greek and Latin there is a future
                    participle, by which the attribute is represented as being in a state of
                    exertion at some future time; as, 7jα∙ψu1, <hi rend="italic">scripturus,</hi>
                    about to write.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="smallcaps">Adjectives,</hi> or those words which express as inhering
                    in their substances the several qualities of things, of which the essence
                    consists not in motion or its privation; as, <hi rend="italic">good, bad, black,
                    white, large, small,</hi> and the like. As attributes are the same whether they
                    belong to males or females, to one object or to many, adjectives ought in
                    strictness to admit of no variation respecting sex or number; and in English
                    they actually admit of none. Some qualities, however, are of such a nature, that
                    one substance may have them in a greater degree than another; and therefore the
                    adjectives denoting these qualities admit in most languages of a variation which
                    grammarians call the degrees of comparison. Thus Plato was <hi rend="italic"
                    >wise,</hi> Socrates was <hi rend="italic">wiser</hi> than he, but Solomon was
                    <hi rend="italic">the wisest</hi> of men. There is a species of adjectives
                    derived from nouns, and even from pronouns; for we say, <hi rend="italic">the
                    Pompeian</hi> party, <hi rend="italic">a brazen</hi> trumpet, and <hi
                    rend="italic">my</hi> book, which are phrases equivalent to “the party of
                    Pompey, a trumpet of brass, and the book of me.”</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="smallcaps">Adverbs,</hi> or those words which, as they denote the
                    attributes of attributes, have been called <hi rend="italic">attributives of the
                    second order,</hi> to distinguish them from verbs, participles, and adjectives,
                    which denote the attributes of substances, and are therefore called <hi
                    rend="italic">attributives of the first order.</hi> Adverbs are divided into two
                    kinds, viz.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">First,</hi> Those which are common to all attributives of the
                    first order, that is, which coalesce equally with verbs, with participles, and
                    with adjectives. These may be divided into adverbs of <hi rend="italic"
                    >intension</hi> and <hi rend="italic">remission,</hi> or of <hi rend="italic"
                    >quantity continuous;</hi> as <hi rend="italic">moderately, vastly,
                    exceedingly,</hi> &amp;c. These, like adjectives of a similar nature, admit of
                    the different<pb break="no" facs="nls:193522872" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2872-0685"/>
                    degrees of comparison. Of <hi rend="italic">quantity discrete</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> as, <hi rend="italic">once, twice, thrice,</hi> &amp;c.
                    These are not, in strictness of speech, adverbs, being in reality the possessive
                    cases of one, two, three, &amp;c. Of <hi rend="italic">relation</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> as <hi rend="italic">more, most, less, least, equally,
                    proportionally,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Second,</hi> Those which are confined to verbs properly so
                    called, and which are of the following kinds: Of <hi rend="italic">time</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> as, <hi rend="italic">then, when, afterward, now,
                    Sic.</hi>: of <hi rend="italic">place</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> as, <hi
                    rend="italic">here, there, where, hence, whence, Sic.</hi>; and also adverbs
                    derived from prepositions; as, <hi rend="italic">upward, downward, Sic.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">:</hi> of <hi rend="italic">intensions</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >remissions peculiar to motion</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> as, <hi
                    rend="italic">speedily, hastily, slowly, Sec.</hi> We have given adverbs a place
                    amongst the parts of speech necessary for the communication of thought; but it
                    may be doubted whether they be entitled to this distinction. English adverbs at
                    least seem to be nothing more than corruptions of nouns, adjectives, and
                    verbs.</p>
                <p>III. DEFINITIVES; which are all those words that serve to define and ascertain
                    any particular object or objects as separated from others of the same class.
                    These are commonly called <hi rend="smallcaps">Articles,</hi> which are divided
                    into two kinds, viz.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Indefinite,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">a</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">an,</hi> which is prefixed to a noun or general term, to denote
                    that but one individual is meant of that genus or species of which the noun is
                    the common name. This article, however, leaves the individual itself quite
                    indeterminate. Thus, <hi rend="italic">man</hi> is the general name of the whole
                    human race; <hi rend="italic">a</hi> man is one individual, but that individual
                    is unknown. <hi rend="italic">Any</hi> is prefixed to a noun either in the
                    singular or plural number, when it is indifferent as to the truth of the
                    proposition what individual or individuals be supposed; thus, “<hi rend="italic"
                    >any</hi> man will be virtuous when temptation is away.” <hi rend="italic"
                    >Some</hi> is prefixed to nouns in the plural number, to denote that only part
                    of the species or genus is meant, leaving that part undetermined; thus, “<hi
                    rend="italic">some</hi> men are great cowards.”</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Definite,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">the,</hi> which is
                    prefixed to a noun, to denote one individual of the species of which something
                    is predicated that distinguishes it from every other individual. Thus, “<hi
                    rend="italic">the</hi> man that hath not music in himself is fit for treasons.”
                    It is used before nouns in both numbers, and for the same purpose; for we may
                    say, “<hi rend="italic">the men</hi> who have not music in themselves are fit
                    for treasons.” <hi rend="italic">This,</hi> prefixed to a noun in the singular
                    number, denotes an individual as present and near at hand; as, “<hi
                    rend="italic">this</hi> man beside me.” <hi rend="italic">That,</hi> prefixed to
                    a noun in the singular number, denotes an individual as present but at a little
                    distance; as, <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">that</hi> man in the
                    corner.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These two
                    articles have plurals; <hi rend="italic">thru</hi> is the plural of <hi
                    rend="italic">this,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> the plural of <hi
                    rend="italic">that.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>Besides these, there are many other articles both definite and indefinite.</p>
                <p>IV. CONNECTIVES, or those words which are employed to connect other words, and of
                    several distinct parts to make one complete whole. These may be divided into two
                    kinds, viz.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Conjunctions,</hi> by which name are distinguished all
                    those connectives which are commonly employed to conjoin sentences. These have
                    been divided into two kinds, called <hi rend="italic">conjunctives,</hi> or
                    those words which conjoin sentences and their meanings also; and <hi
                    rend="italic">disjunctives,</hi> or those words which, at the same time that
                    they conjoin sentences, disjoin their meanings. Each of these general divisions
                    has been again subdivided; the former into copulatives and continuatives, the
                    latter into simple disjunctives and adversative disjunctives. But the general
                    division is absurd, and the subdivisions are useless. Conjunctions never disjoin
                    the meaning of sentences, nor have any other effect than to combine two or more
                    simple sentences into one compound sentence. If those simple sentences be of
                    opposite meanings before their combination, they will continue so after it,
                    whatever conjunction be employed to unite them. In nature, different truths are
                    connected, if they be connected at all, by different relations; and therefore,
                    when the sentences expressive of those truths are connected in language, it must
                    be by words significant of those natural relations. Thus, accidental addition is
                    expressed by the conjunction <hi rend="italic">and</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    as when we say, “Lysippus was a statuary, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> Priscian
                    was a grammarian." The unexpected junction of contrary truths is expressed by
                    <hi rend="italic">but</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> as, “Brutus was a patriot,
                    <hi rend="italic">but</hi> Caesar was not." The relation of an effect to its
                    cause is expressed by <hi rend="italic">because;</hi> as, “Rome was enslaved <hi
                    rend="italic">because</hi> Caesar was ambitious.” The relation of an effect to a
                    cause of which the existence is doubtful, is expressed by <hi rend="italic"
                    >if;</hi> as, “you will live happily <hi rend="italic">if</hi> you live honestly
                    the relation of a cause to its effect, by <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> as, “Caesar was ambitious, <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi>
                    Rome was enslaved.” The idea of simple diversity is expressed by <hi
                    rend="italic">either</hi> and <hi rend="italic">or</hi><hi rend="italic">;
                    “</hi><hi rend="italic">either</hi> it is day <hi rend="italic">or</hi> it is
                    night.” Contrariety between two affirmations, which, though each may be true by
                    itself, cannot both be true at once, is expressed by <hi rend="italic"
                    >unless</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> as, “Troy will be taken <hi rend="italic"
                    >unless</hi> the Palladium be preserved.” Coincidence of two affirmations
                    apparently contrary to each other is expressed by <hi rend="italic"
                    >although</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> as, “Troy will be taken <hi rend="italic"
                    >although</hi> Hector defend it.”</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Prepositions,</hi> or those connectives of which the
                    common office is to conjoin words which refuse to coalesce; and this they can do
                    only by signifying those relations by which the things expressed by the united
                    words are connected in nature. The first words of men, like their first ideas,
                    had an immediate reference to sensible objects; and therefore there can be no
                    doubt but that the original use of prepositions was to denote the various
                    relations of body. Afterwards, when men began to discern with their intellect,
                    they took those words which they found already made, prepositions as well as
                    others, and transferred them by metaphor to intellectual conceptions.</p>
                <p>Prepositions viewed in this light are</p>
                <p>Either <hi rend="italic">proper,</hi> or those which literally denote the
                    relations subsisting amongst the objects of sense, such as the accidental
                    junction of two things between which there is no necessary connection; as, “a
                    house <hi rend="italic">with</hi> a party wall.” The separation of two things
                    which we should expect to find united; as, “a house <hi rend="italic"
                    >without</hi> a roof, a man <hi rend="italic">without</hi> hands.” The relation
                    subsisting between any thing and that which supports it; as, “the statue stands
                    <hi rend="italic">upon</hi> a pedestal." The relation of higher and lower; as,
                    “the sun is <hi rend="italic">above</hi> the hills,” “to support uneasy steps
                    <hi rend="italic">over</hi> the burning marl,” “the sun is set <hi rend="italic"
                    >below</hi> the horizon," “the shepherd reclines <hi rend="italic">under</hi>
                    the shade of a beech tree.” The relation between any thing in motion and that in
                    which it moves; as, “the rays of light pass <hi rend="italic">through</hi> the
                    air.” The relation between any thing continued, whether motion or rest, and the
                    point of its beginning; as, “the rays of light proceed <hi rend="italic"
                    >from</hi> the sun,” “these figs came <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Turkey,” “that
                    lamp hangs <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the ceiling.” The relation between any
                    thing continued and the point to which it tends; as, “he is going <hi
                    rend="italic">to</hi> Italy,” “he slept <hi rend="italic">till</hi> morning.”
                    The relation between an effect and its cause; as, “I am sick of my husband and
                    <hi rend="italic">for</hi> my gallant."<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p> Conjunctions and prepositions are indeed employed only to
                    connect sentences and words; but it may be doubted whether they be ]&gt;arts of
                    s)&gt;eech distinct from nouns, verbs, and adjectives.</p></note></p>
                <p>Or <hi rend="italic">metaphorical.</hi> For as those who are above others in
                    place have generally the advantage over them, the prepositions which denote the
                    one kind of superiority or in<pb break="no" facs="nls:193522885"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-2885-0686"/>feriority, are likewise employed to denote the
                    other. Thus <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> we say of a king, “he ruled <hi
                    rend="italic">over</hi> his people and of a soldier, “he served <hi
                    rend="italic">under</hi> such a general.’'</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Interjections</hi> are a species of words which are found
                    perhaps in all languages on earth, but which cannot be included in any of the
                    classes above mentioned; for they are not subject to the rules or principles of
                    grammar, as they contribute nothing to the communication of thought. They may be
                    called a part of that natural language with which man is endowed, in common with
                    other animals, to express or allay some very strong sensation; such as, αΛ ∕
                    when he feels pain. In this view the interjection does not owe its
                    characteristical expression to the arbitrary form of articulation, but to the
                    tone of voice, and the modifications of countenance and of gesture, with which
                    it is uttered; it is therefore universally understood by all mankind. In
                    discourse interjections are employed only when the suddenness or vehemence of
                    some affection returns men to their natural state, and makes them for a moment
                    forget the use of speech. In books they are thrown into sentences without
                    altering their form either in syntax or in signification; and in English this is
                    generally done with a very bad effect, though the writer no doubt employs them
                    with a view to pathos or embellishment.</p>
                <p>Unwilling to interrupt the continuity of the foregoing article, or to interpolate
                    any additions, however necessary in themselves, which might have the effect of
                    disturbing the logical sequence of the compiler’s expositions and illustrations,
                    we have thought it in many respects preferable to annex, under separate heads,
                    such further explanations on several points as may appear to be requisite for
                    their more complete elucidation, and also to supply some defects, particularly
                    on the subjects of the relative pronoun, of comparison, and of the verb, which
                    the learned reader will scarcely fail to detect in this elaborate treatise,
                    notwithstanding its great and acknowledged merits. And,</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Of the Relative Pronoun.</hi></p>
                <p>This subject has been pretty fully treated in the preceding article, and the
                    general principles there stated are clearly and correctly unfolded. But whilst
                    these principles are not always pursued to their consequences, and some
                    important views have been omitted, there are ako not a few points which seem to
                    require a more ample development, and which may probably be rendered more
                    distinct by a little diversity of illustration. In endeavouring to accomplish
                    these objects, however, we shall freely avail ourselves of the ingenious
                    speculations of one who has done more than any other philologist of this age, or
                    even of the last, excepting perhaps Mr Horne Tooke, to introduce the principles
                    of a sound philosophy into grammatical investigations; and to ourselves it is a
                    source of no ordinary gratification to think that we are enabled to do so with

                    responsibility upon his part for errors which may be committed by us in
                    attempting an exposition of his views.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    which agrees with it in the same manner as any adjective agrees with its
                    substantive. The relative, therefore, must be an adjective, expressing an
                    attribute of its antecedent, and representing it in some way or other. Again,
                    the application of the relative is universal. There is no object whatsoever to
                    which, in use, the relative may not refer, and which it may not represent. We
                    may say, the animal <hi rend="italic">which,</hi> the man <hi rend="italic"

                    instances. The attribute expressed by the relative is therefore extremely
                    general, such indeed as may belong to any object whatsoever. The first matter
                    for inquiry, then, is to endeavour to ascertain what the attribute in question
                    really is, or, in other words, to determine the signification of the relative
                    pronoun.</p>
                <p>On this branch of the subject, however, it is not necessary to enlarge, after
                    what has already been said respecting it. The analytical solution proposed by Mr
                    Harris, on the authority of Apollonius <hi rend="italic">De Syntaxi,</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>From his extensive
                    acquaintance with classical literature, and the philosophical bent of his mind,
                    Mr Harris was certainly aman eminently capable of making important philological
                    discoveries, had he chosen, like Mr Home Tooke and Dr Hunter, to think boldly
                    for himself, instead of esteeming it a sort of heresy to differ from the
                    opinions of the ancient grammarians. Of these, Apollonius was no doubt one of
                    the most learned and acute, as we shall have occasion afterwards to show; and in
                    a question <hi rend="italic">of fact,</hi> his authority is not to be disputed.
                    But the case is very diðėrent in regard to a <hi rend="italic">theory,</hi> the
                    truth or falsehood of which must be established by <hi rend="italic"
                    >evidence,</hi> derived not from the <hi rend="italic">dicta</hi> of
                    grammarians, but from the principles and usages of language. It is an excessive
                    and misplaced deference to authority, however, which has led Mr Harris to crowd
                    his <hi rend="italic">Herme</hi><hi rend="italic">I</hi> with a multiplicity of
                    uncouth terms and unnecessary distinctions, which, though they give an air of
                    learned precision to many of his propositions, have an obvious tendency to
                    darken rather than elucidate the subject which he professes to
                    explain.</p></note> namely, into the prepositive pronoun and the conjunction <hi
                    rend="italic">and,</hi> has already been noticed and refuted. The equation, as
                    stated by him, and also by Dr Beattie, who adopts his view, does not consist of
                    equivalents, either logical or grammatical. The solution is not, therefore, as
                    it ought to be, of universal application. In some instances, indeed, it may
                    appear to have the same effect in a sentence as the copulative conjunction and
                    prepositive pronoun; but in others, and by far the greater number, it will be
                    found that the effect produced by the substitution of the alleged equivalents is
                    altogether different. Thus, if the sentence, “Light is a body <hi rend="italic"
                    >which</hi> moves with great celerity,” be resolved into, “Light is a body, <hi
                    rend="italic">and it</hi> moves with great celerity,” as proposed by Mr Harris,
                    the result is <hi rend="italic">two</hi> distinct predications respecting light,
                    viz. first, that “it is a body,” and, secondly, that “it moves with great
                    celerity whereas, in the original sentence, “Light is a body <hi rend="italic"
                    >which</hi> moves with great celerity,” there is but <hi rend="italic">one</hi>
                    predication made concerning “light,” namely, that “it is a body of <hi
                    rend="italic">great or astonishing velocity."</hi> It is also to be observed,
                    that the prepositive pronoun in the one sentence, and the relative pronoun in
                    the other, refer to different antecedents. Thus, in the sentence, “The magnet is
                    a stone, <hi rend="italic">and it</hi> attracts iron,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >magnet</hi> is the antecedent to <hi rend="italic">it;</hi> but in the
                    sentence, “The magnet is a stone <hi rend="italic">which</hi> attracts iron,"
                    <hi rend="italic">stone,</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">magnet,</hi> is the
                    antecedent to <hi rend="italic">which.</hi> Nor is this all. There are many
                    instances where the resolution proposed, by introducing a double instead of a
                    single predication, would produce either nonsense or falsehood. We can say with
                    perfect truth, that “Legendre was the first mathematician <hi rend="italic"
                    >who</hi> remarked the coincidence of symmetrical magnitudes but if this be
                    converted into “Legendre was the first mathematician, <hi rend="italic">and
                    he</hi> remarked the coincidence of symmetrical magnitudes,” we obtain two
                    propositions, the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522898"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-2898-0687"/>former of which contains an affirmation erroneous
                    in point of fact. In like manner, if the expression, “Solomon was not the son of
                    David <hi rend="italic">who</hi> rebelled against his father,” be resolved into
                    “Solomon was not the son of David, <hi rend="italic">and</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >he</hi> rebelled against his father,” we have one negative proposition which is
                    historically true, converted into two propositions, the one negative and the
                    other affirmative, but both of them historically false. Mr Harris subjoins as a
                    specious confirmation of his theory, “that the Latins in the structure of the
                    relative seem to have well represented its compound nature, of part pronoun and
                    part connective, in forming their <hi rend="italic">qui</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">guis</hi> from <hi rend="italic">que</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >is, or,</hi> as Scaliger would have it, from xα∕ and <hi rend="italic"
                    >if,</hi><hi rend="italic">xa</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >i”</hi> But, whatever there may be in this, the foregoing examples prove that
                    the relative has often an effect very different indeed from that which is
                    produced by combining a connective with the prepositive pronoun.</p>
                <p>If, however, the connective (which is nothing but an arbitrary interpolation) be
                    kept out of view, and the relation between the different pronouns be carefully
                    considered, it will, on examination, be found that the relative is merely a
                    particular explanation of the demonstrative pronoun. That the article is really
                    a demonstrative pronoun, cannot be denied by any one who has attentively
                    considered its true nature and import. The common application of <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi><hi rend="italic">μtt, i</hi><hi rend="italic">òt,</hi> and
                    ro μιv, ro ðs, in Greek, renders this sufficiently obvious; and, besides, direct
                    evidence may be produced to establish the fact. In the expression TOI <hi
                    rend="italic">μtt</hi><hi rend="italic">iaι∕Mv</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi

                    instead of ro. Nor is this confined to Greek alone. In English also the article
                    is used as a demonstrative pronoun. Thus, when Nathan said unto David, “Thou art
                    <hi rend="italic">the</hi> man,” the expression is the same as if the warning
                    minister of heaven had said, “Thou art <hi rend="italic">that</hi> man.” And the
                    same practice likewise obtains in the Gothic and in the Anglo-Saxon, where,
                    according to Manning, the article put demonstratively has the same signification
                    as <hi rend="italic">hie,</hi><hi rend="italic">heec, hoc</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>But not only is the article employed as a demonstrative pronoun; in the more
                    ancient Greek writers, particularly in Homer and Herodotus, it is frequently
                    used as a relative pronoun. This has already been shown, and need not be further
                    illustrated by examples, which might be produced in any number required. <hi

                    manifestly the same as 0sβ∕ 'OI <hi rend="italic">Ολυμπο»</hi> iχotιΛ. And,
                    conversely, the relative is sometimes used as an article. “Imo, inquit Vigerus,

                    (whence τ,, <hi rend="italic">τ,u,</hi> v∙,, m∙, &amp;c.), with the final

                    ∙w∙&gt;, where ⅛, though it may be called a pronoun of the third person, is
                    plainly nothing but the article, and where, also, it appears that the
                    demonstrative, used in a particular wav, is in reality the relative
                    pronoun.</p></note> Anciently the article was used as tire relative pronoun in
                    English as well as in Greek. The Lord’s Prayer, in its older form, commenced
                    thus: “Our father <hi rend="italic">the</hi> art in heaven,” where <hi
                    rend="italic">the</hi> is obviously used as a relative pronoun. And the same
                    thing obtains in the Gothic and Anglo-Saxon, in which last, according to
                    Manning, <hi rend="smallcaps">the</hi> put after pronouns of all the persons
                    signifies <hi rend="italic">qui,</hi> who; as Ic <hi rend="smallcaps">the,</hi>
                    Ego <hi rend="italic">qui,</hi> I <hi rend="italic">who.</hi> The same author
                    adds, “Apud Gothos similiter <hi rend="italic">articulus,</hi> per omnes casus,
                    vicem gerit <hi rend="italic">pronominis relativi;</hi> ut <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >sa</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">in</hi> ΗΙΜΙΝΛΜ, ‘ <hi rend="italic">qui</hi> in
                    coelis.’” Again, the demonstrative pronoun <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> in
                    English, is used indiscriminately with the relative. Thus we say indifferently,
                    “The man <hi rend="italic">that</hi> endureth to the end,” or, “The man <hi
                    rend="italic">who</hi> endureth to the end “The messenger <hi rend="italic"
                    >that</hi> Alexander sent to Darius,” or, “The messenger <hi rend="italic"
                    >whom</hi> Alexander sent to Darius ;” “The mountain <hi rend="italic">that</hi>
                    overhangs the lake,” or, “The mountain <hi rend="italic">which</hi> overhangs
                    the lake and so universally. Upon the whole, therefore, it may be concluded that
                    the relative is merely a particular application of the demonstrative pronoun;
                    or, in other words, that the <hi rend="italic">signification</hi> of the
                    relative is radically the same with that of the demonstrative pronoun.</p>
                <p>But what, it may be asked, is the precise signification of the demonstrative
                    pronoun? When it is said, “Csesar Dumnorigem cepit atque interfecit <hi
                    rend="italic">eum,”</hi> it is evident that the <hi rend="italic">eum</hi>
                    refers to and represents Dumnorix. A question however arises, namely, under what
                    character does it represent him? Caesar took Dumnorix; but <hi rend="italic"
                    >cum</hi> does not represent him as a prisoner, and, there &gt; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> s no</hi> other circumstance connected with Dumnorix which
                    the pronoun can suggest to the mind, except the previous mention of his name.
                    From the reason of the thing, therefore, independently of any induction, it may
                    be concluded that <hi rend="italic">ewn</hi> can only be equivalent to the <hi
                    rend="italic">said</hi> or <hi rend="italic">before-mentioned;</hi> and,
                    accordingly, it will upon trial be found that, wherever the demonstrative
                    pronoun occurs, some such expression as <hi rend="italic">said</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">before-mentioned</hi> may be substituted in its stead. A nd’this
                    view is confirmed by the etymology of the demonstrative pronoun in as far as it
                    can be traced either in Greek or in any other language.</p>
                <p>For example, the Greek pronoun aùro¢, corresponding to the Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">ipse</hi> or <hi rend="italic">idem,</hi> and often to <hi
                    rend="italic">hie,</hi> appears to be the past participle of the old verb αυω,
                    <hi rend="italic">clamo</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dico</hi> formed upon the same
                    analogy with the Latin past participle;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The universal practice of the Latins in terminating their
                    past participle in TÜS, creates a strong presumption that such formerly was also
                    the practice of the Greeks; seeing that, at a remote period, the Latin language
                    was unquestionably a dialect, or, at least, little else than a dialect, of the
                    Greek. And this presumption, joined with the actual existence in Greek of a
                    numerous classof verbal adjectives in TO∑, having a passive signification, puts
                    it almost beyond a doubt that these verbals in τo∑ are just the old past
                    partidples of the verbs to which they respectively belonged, several of these
                    may indeed have undergone some change of signification, but their consequent or
                    secondary meaning may easily be traced to their primary import, in other words,
                    to that of the past participle. Thus E <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> a* <hi
                    rend="subscript"> l</hi>, <hi rend="italic">amo,</hi> forms the old past
                    participle ⅛a&gt;ror, <hi rend="italic">amatus,</hi> “that <hi rend="italic"
                    >hath</hi> been loved,” and consequently “that <hi rend="italic">may be</hi>
                    loved,” or, <hi rend="italic">amabilis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">l’taau, rideβ,</hi> forms the past participle yιλ*&lt;rτκ, <hi
                    rend="italic">risus,</hi> “that <hi rend="italic">hath been</hi> laughed at,”
                    consequently “that <hi rend="italic">may be</hi> laughed at,” and, by inference,
                    “that is <hi rend="italic">capable of exciting</hi> laughter,” or, in other
                    words, <hi rend="italic">ridiculus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and so of the
                    rest. The following examples, selected from many which might be produced, will
                    be sufficient to indicate the analogy upon which these verbals are formed, and
                    to show the propriety of regarding them as the past participles of their
                    respective verbs:</p><table cols="4" rows="21">

                    pronoun <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> anciently written <hi rend="italic">hit,</hi>
                    and still so pronounced in many parts of the country, to the past participle of
                    the Anglo-Saxon verb <hi rend="smallcaps">haitan,</hi><hi rend="italic">dicere,
                    nominare;</hi> whence it follows that <hi rend="italic">it</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">hit</hi> signifies <hi rend="italic">said</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">named.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>In legal phraseology <hi rend="italic">said</hi> is itself used as a
                    demonstrative pronoun; as <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">said</hi>
                    city” and “<hi rend="italic">laid</hi> seisin” for “<hi rend="italic">that</hi>
                    seisin.</p></note> It may, therefore, with some confidence be concluded that <hi
                    rend="italic">said</hi> was the original import of the demonstrative pronoun;
                    and, as the relative pronoun has been shown to be only a particular application
                    of the demonstrative, the signification of the former must, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ex</hi><hi rend="italic">paritate rationis,</hi> be identical or synonymous
                    with that of the latter, and, consequently, equivalent to <hi rend="italic"
                    >said</hi> or <hi rend="italic">named.</hi></p>
                <p>In a learned essay, to which Dr Gray’s prize was adjudged, on the import and
                    application of the relative pronoun, the author, Mr Ĳ. Carmichael, shows that
                    the apparent etymology of this pronoun, in the Gothic language, affords the
                    strongest possible corroboration of the truth of the above conclusion; inasmuch
                    as the Gothic relative is merely, with a slight change of the aspirate into
                    sigma,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This change,
                    natural in itself, is of frequent occurrence; thus ha <hi rend="italic">th</hi>
                    becomes ha <hi rend="italic">s</hi>, see <hi rend="italic">th</hi> becomes see
                    <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> doe <hi rend="italic">th</hi> becomes doe <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi>, speake <hi rend="italic">th</hi> becomes speak <hi
                    rend="italic">th</hi>, and speak <hi rend="italic">s</hi>, and send <hi
                    rend="italic">eth</hi> becomes send <hi rend="italic">th</hi>, send <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi>.</p></note> the past participle of the verb signifying <hi
                    rend="italic">dicere,</hi> to say. And the admitted connection traceable between
                    the Gothic and the ancient dialects of the Greek language suggests another
                    conjecture, which serves to strengthen the probability of the preceding
                    etymology, and also to confirm the truth of the general proposition above
                    enunciated. The observation of Mr Horne <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> Tooke, that
                    Anglo-Saxon verbs, having ι as their characteristic letter, change that letter,
                    in the formation of their past tense, into <hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi> broad, is
                    equally applicable to Maeso-Gothic verbs; thus <hi rend="smallcaps">quiman</hi>
                    makes <hi rend="smallcaps">quam,</hi> QUITHAN <hi rend="smallcaps">quath,</hi>
                    and so on. But as different persons pronounced differently, and also used
                    different written characters as representatives of their sounds, this change of
                    the characteristic letter was exhibited either by <hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi>
                    broad, or by o, or by u; and hence it may be inferred from analogy that <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">quath</hi> would also be pronoanced <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >quoth,</hi> which accordingly is still met with in the colloquial dialect of
                    several districts in Scotland. It would also appear that <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >quoth</hi> was sometimes pronounced and written <hi rend="smallcaps">quod</hi>;
                    thus, in Chaucer, “Sir Knight <hi rend="italic">(quod</hi> he), mymaister and my
                    lord.” <hi rend="smallcaps">Quod</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">quoth</hi> have
                    therefore been in use. But, in Anglo-Saxon, <hi rend="smallcaps">quid,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dictum,</hi> frequently occurs; and from the same analogy we may
                    infer that <hi rend="smallcaps">quith</hi> was also in use at one period. It
                    follows, then, that <hi rend="smallcaps">quoth</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >quith</hi> are in reality the past tense or past participle of the verb <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">quithan,</hi><hi rend="italic">dicere.</hi> But as the old form
                    of the Greek relative pronoun was xo¢, different parts of which, as κou, κη, <hi
                    rend="italic">xως,</hi> occur frequently in Herodotus, it may not unreasonably
                    be conjectured that the Gothic <hi rend="smallcaps">quoth</hi> formed the Greek
                    xo¢ (the <hi rend="italic">th</hi> becoming ♯ in the same manner as <hi
                    rend="italic">id)ι,</hi> in the imperative of the second aorist, becomes first
                    ood, and then ðo¢), and that <hi rend="smallcaps">quid</hi> formed the Greek
                    xz¢, afterwards written n¢, and the Latin <hi rend="italic">quis.</hi> Further,
                    it has been observed, that in the Maeso-Gothic, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >saei,</hi><hi rend="italic">qui,</hi> and the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >sa</hi> corresponding sometimes to the Greek í, and sometimes to oùro¢, bear
                    the strongest appearance of having formed part of a Gothic verb corresponding to
                    the Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="smallcaps">sachan,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >dicere</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a circumstance which serves to confirm the
                    truth of the position, that the real signification of the relative pronoun is
                    <hi rend="italic">said</hi> or <hi rend="italic">named.</hi></p>
                <p>From this induction, which appears to be conclusive, we now proceed to consider
                    the uses of this pronoun in language, and at the same time to inquire whether,
                    in the different examples produced, the relative corresponds, in effect, to the
                    signification which we have assigned to it. The principal uses of the relative
                    are, <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> when it renders the clause in which it
                    stands, in some respect or other, descriptive of its antecedent, or, in other
                    words, when the relative is equivalent to an <hi rend="italic">adjective
                    noun</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, <hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi> when it
                    intimates that the amount of the clause to which it is prefixed is to be taken
                    as a <hi rend="italic">substantive noun.</hi></p>
                <p>1. With regard to the first of these uses; namely, when the relative clause can
                    be expressed by a single term', every one must perceive that it describes or
                    qualifies the antecedent, and is therefore equivalent to an adjective noun.
                    Thus, in the sentence “vir sapit qui pauca loquitur,” the relative clause, <hi
                    rend="italic">qui pauca</hi><hi rend="italic">loquitur,</hi> may be expressed by
                    the term <hi rend="italic">pauciloquus,</hi> and “vir <hi rend="italic"
                    >pauciloquus</hi> sapit” is therefore exactly the same as “vir sapit <hi
                    rend="italic">qui pauca</hi><hi rend="italic">loquitur</hi> that is, <hi
                    rend="italic">qui pauca</hi><hi rend="italic">loquitur</hi> is precisely
                    equivalent to <hi rend="italic">pauciloquus,</hi> or, in other words, the
                    relative clause is equivalent to an adjective noun. But the relative is by no
                    means restricted, in its application, to those cases where the clause which it
                    introduces may be expressed by a single term; on the contrary, the latter may be
                    as long and as complex as the writer or speaker may chuse, although there be no
                    single term in the language expressive of the same combination of ideas. When,
                    for instance, we say, “He is the happy man, who, at any moment of his existence,
                    can reflect on a life which has been spent in the conscientious discharge of his
                    duty the clauses, “who can reflect on a life,” and “which has been spent in the
                    conscientious discharge of his duty,” may not be expressible by single terms;
                    but if they were, these terms would <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522924"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-2924-0689"/>universally be denominated adjective nouns. And
                    this leads us to observe that there are two ways by which the relative qualifies
                    the antecedent; the first, when the relative clause is merely descriptive of the
                    antecedent; and the second, when it ascertains to what particular class or
                    species the antecedent belongs. Thus, in the sentence, “The emperors, glorying
                    in nothing but oppression and cruelty, issued many tyrannical edicts, which, as
                    might be expected, fomented discontent and excited rebellion, instead of
                    enforcing submission to their authority it must be obvious that the whole of the
                    clause introduced by the relative is equivalent to a compound adjective
                    descriptive of “tyrannical edicts and that if the word <hi rend="italic">said
                    were</hi> substituted instead of <hi rend="italic">which</hi> (the noun “edicts"
                    being understood), the sense and effect of the sentence would remain unaltered.
                    Again, in the sentence, “homo, qui sapientia caret, nil profuit hominibus,” the
                    relative clause <hi rend="italic">qui sapientia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >caret,</hi> qualifies <hi rend="italic">homo</hi> by ascertaining to what
                    particular class or species <hi rend="italic">this</hi> “homo” belongs. But
                    though, in the former examples, it will readily be allowed that the word <hi
                    rend="italic">said</hi> may, with perfect propriety, supply the place of the
                    relative pronoun, yet they who have not been accustomed to make the substitution
                    may scruple to admit it in others, or to agree that the sentence “A man, who is
                    destitute of wisdom, is a cipher in society," is exactly equivalent to “A man,
                    said (man) is destitute of wisdom, is a cipher in society.” Still the
                    equivalence is undoubted; for the subject of the proposition, “a man,” is, in
                    both cases, qualified by words which have precisely the same effect in
                    ascertaining to what class of men he belongs; and although, in the latter case,
                    the relative clause assumes the form of a parenthetical sentence or interjected
                    affirmation, yet if, in pronunciation, the word <hi rend="italic">said</hi> be
                    slurred over unemphatically, or articulated in the very same manner as the
                    relative <hi rend="italic">who,</hi> every one must be sensible that these two
                    sentences are, in effect, identical. To prevent the appearance of violence in
                    the substitution, it is necessary to repeat the antecedent along with <hi
                    rend="italic">said;</hi> but this arises solely from our not being accustomed to
                    use <hi rend="italic">said</hi> disjoined from its substantive, as we have long
                    been accustomed to use the relative pronoun.</p>
                <p>2. The second use of the relative pronoun is, when it intimates that the clause
                    to which it is prefixed is to be regarded as the equation of a substantive noun;
                    as in the sentence, “That you are disappointed, gives me pain," where the clause
                    “that you are disappointed” is evidently the nominative to the verb “gives,” and
                    perfectly equivalent to “your <hi rend="italic">disappointment”</hi> It is true
                    that when the relative occupies this position, grammarians have been accustomed
                    to call it a <hi rend="italic">conjunction</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but
                    nothing, surely, can be more unphilosophical, or better calculated to produce
                    needless perplexity and destroy the primitive simplicity of language, than to
                    class the same word in different categories of speech according to its position
                    and effect in a sentence. Such a mode of procedure, whilst it is but a clumsy
                    method of screening ignorance, tends to retard a free investigation into the
                    real meaning of words, by deceitfully substituting a technical name instead of a
                    ra-tional explanation; and it insidiously attempts to wrest from etymology the
                    right of stamping upon terms their genuine signification. In opposition to the
                    commonly received notion, however, it may safely be affirmed that, in all known
                    languages, the neuter of the relative pronoun is prefixed to <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> nominative and a verb, and that the sentence thus formed is, in amount,
                    equivalent to a <hi rend="italic">substantive noun.</hi> Thus, when Homer says,
                    <hi rend="italic">Kwββιn γag Tcgι &lt;xa&gt;- rsf,</hi> 'O <hi rend="italic">μoι
                    γ</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">(ter iŗxfrai</hi> αλλp, “for you
                    all perceive this at least, <hi rend="italic">that my prize is going away to
                    another,"</hi> Ό <hi rend="italic">μu γcζa( i{χιraι aafy</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∣</hi> is evidently the <hi rend="italic">object</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >thing</hi> perceived by all; and hence, if this sentence could be expressed by
                    a single term, it would be universally denominated a noun substantive, and would
                    be in the accusative case governed by λ≡ufftfiri. The same observations are, <hi
                    rend="italic">mutatis</hi><hi rend="italic">mutandis,</hi> applicable to the
                    following sentence:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">∆ιtfi&lt;thκ</hi><hi rend="italic">T&gt;γt*rxtn</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ό</hi><hi rend="italic">ù emf bru(</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi

                    >∣</hi><hi rend="italic">χc %“l</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> a</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">í</hi><hi rend="italic">’Ατολλω»</hi> is a complete substantive
                    governed in the accusative by yi/rud’XAw. Again, <hi rend="italic">in,</hi> the
                    neuter of the relative pronoun <hi rend="italic">inn;</hi> (compounded of <hi
                    rend="italic">⅛,</hi><hi rend="italic">guis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >rις),</hi> is universally employed in the same manner. Thus, in the sentence,
                    <hi rend="superscript                         smallcaps"> ,</hi><hi

                    “even this alone, <hi rend="italic">that you have taken your head safe and sound

                    sua&gt;</hi> could be represented by a single word, every one would regard it as
                    a substantive noun, an¢ as the nominative to the verb <hi rend="italic"
                    >agxu.</hi></p>
                <p>In the Latin language, <hi rend="italic">quod,</hi> the neuter of the relative,
                    and <hi rend="italic">ut,</hi> which is just the Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >in,</hi> are used in precisely the same manner. Thus, in the passage, “Haec
                    nuncι-antes orabant, <hi rend="italic">ut</hi> opem ferret, hostemque haud
                    dubium Romanis terra aut maritimis viribus arceret; qui ob nullam aliam causam,
                    nisi <hi rend="italic">quod</hi> immincrent Italiae, peterentur it is obvious
                    that “<hi rend="italic">ut</hi> opem ferret” and “<hi rend="italic">ut</hi>
                    hostem arceret” are compound substantives governed in the accusative by
                    “orabant,” and also that “<hi rend="italic">quod</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >immincrent”</hi> may be considered as a substantive under the regimen of <hi
                    rend="italic">ob,</hi> and expressed thus: “Qui (scilicet <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oricini)</hi> ob nullam aliam causam, nisi (ob) <hi rend="italic"
                    >imminentiam</hi> Italiae, peterentur.” It is evident, therefore, that <hi
                    rend="italic">quod,</hi> when thus prefixed to a nominative and a verb, is not a
                    conjunction, but only the neuter of the relative pronoun; that when so used, the
                    sentence is, in amount, equivalent to a substantive noun; that no <hi
                    rend="italic">real assertion</hi> is intended to be made by the relative clause;
                    and that, on the contrary, the nominative and verb are merely an explanation of
                    the relative which precedes them. In the expression, “I know <hi rend="italic"
                    >that</hi> you are disappointed,” <hi rend="italic">that</hi> enunciates
                    indefinitely the <hi rend="italic">object</hi> known, and may apply to any
                    object of knowledge whatsoever; but when the clause “you are disappointed” is
                    subjoined, it limits the knowledge to a particular object, namely, <hi
                    rend="italic">your disappointment.</hi> It hence appears that, in making the
                    words which explain <hi rend="italic">that</hi> contain a real assertion, Mr
                    Horne Tooke has admitted a fallacy into his ingenious resolution of the relative
                    pronoun when thus employed; for, in such expressions as “I do not assert <hi
                    rend="italic">that</hi> you are disappointed,” or, “I do not believe <hi
                    rend="italic">that</hi> you are disappointed,” it would surely be absurd to
                    maintain that I <hi rend="italic">assert</hi> your disappointment, when I
                    expressly say that I <hi rend="italic">do not assert</hi> it, and do not even
                    <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> it. Upon the whole, then, it seems evident that,
                    in this use of the relative, the pronoun itself is merely a <hi rend="italic"
                    >general enuncialive</hi> of the proposition which follows; and that this
                    proposition being the equation of a substantive noun, or an explanation of the
                    pronoun, is to be taken abstractedly, or, in other words, to be considered not
                    as containing a formal assertion, but merely as something said or
                    enunciated.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Of Comparison.</hi></p>
                <p>Comparison, <hi rend="italic">comparatio,</hi> is derived from <hi rend="italic"
                    >comparo,</hi> to put together, a word literally intimating the mode in which
                    one thing is compared with another, namely, by collocation or juxtaposition; and
                    hence, in all languages, this process is expressed in nearly the same manner.
                    The degrees of comparison are commonly said to be three; the positive,
                    comparative, and superlative. But the positive can scarcely be denominated a
                    degree, as it simply states the epithet, and employs no comparison whatever;
                    thus, <hi rend="italic">albus,</hi> white, <hi rend="italic">pulcher,</hi> fair.
                    The comparative states <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522937"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-2937-0690"/>a comparison between two objects only; the
                    superlative between more than twx&gt;. It is impossible, however, to express by
                    different terms, or single words, the gradations or shades of difference which
                    may exist between objects, as, for instance, in colours; and hence necessity
                    obliged the framers of language to invent means by which these various
                    gradations or qualities might be generally expressed. With respect to those
                    words which admit of comparison, two things seem to be necessary; first, that
                    they represent general ideas; and, secondly, that they represent objects which
                    are capable of increase or decrease. In this view even nouns substantive, or
                    generic terms, may be compared. Thus it may be said of a person possessing in an
                    eminent degree those qualities which constitute a hero, that he is <hi
                    rend="italic">more</hi> a hero than another less liberally endowed in this
                    respect; and, upon the same principle, we find in Greek ∕3α&lt;r∣λju⅛
                    ∕3αΛλιursjoς, ∕3α&lt;r&lt;λwraroi. But the names of individuals, or, in other
                    words, proper names, do not admit of comparison,.because no individual can be
                    another, and consequently no man can be more himself than another. The same
                    observation extends to the personal pronouns, which, although in themselves
                    general, do not admit of comparison, because they are particular in their
                    application. Numbers, too, are the most general of all words; yet, as they do
                    not admit of any addition or diminution, they are not susceptible of comparison;
                    for, if we suppose two sets of any thing, each consisting of six, the one set
                    cannot be <hi rend="italic">more</hi> six than the other. Verbs, however, may
                    admit of comparison, thus, <hi rend="italic">amat</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >magis,</hi> he loves <hi rend="italic">more</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and so
                    also may participles as partaking of the nature of verbs. It is commonly
                    objected, indeed, that the latter then become adjectives; but this is extremely
                    incorrect; for, in such words as <hi rend="italic">servans,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">servantion;</hi><hi rend="italic">amans,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >amantion</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the meaning is hot “loving,” “more
                    observant of love,” but “loving <hi rend="italic">al present?</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">“</hi> more observant of love <hi rend="italic">at present”</hi>
                    Adverbs may also be compared; thus, <hi rend="italic">convenienter,
                    convenientius, convenientissime</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >eleganter, elegantius, elegantissime.</hi> Prepositions, being a species of
                    adjectives, and oblique cases of nouns, arelikewise susceptible of comparison;
                    thus we have in Greek <hi rend="italic">¶ţa, πgωraτι&gt;( now «įtsnį,</hi> and,
                    in English, <hi rend="italic">before, further, foremost</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">hind, hindmost.</hi> Interjections, if they be signs
                    significant of ideas or emotions of the mind, may, in like manner, be used in
                    degrees of comparison. The repetition of the same word denotes a comparison, as
                    <hi rend="italic">alas, alas</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the expression <hi
                    rend="italic">ter quaterque beali,</hi> indicates a degree of comparison,
                    perhaps the highest. Among the Hebrews the repetition of the same word, as <hi
                    rend="italic">good good,</hi> is employed to express the superlative, and hence
                    becomes synonymous with <hi rend="italic">optimus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >very</hi> good or best; and children make use of the same method to express the
                    degrees of comparison. Of conjunctions nothing positive can be said in this
                    respect. as their nature has not yet been satisfactorily ascertained.</p>
                <p>But there is a much more refined and less obvious view of the subject of
                    comparison, namely, that the comparative may be recompared, and so also may the
                    superlative; in other words, if language were fitted to express it, there may be
                    an ascending or descending series of successive comparisons of comparatives and
                    superlatives. Without attempting any thing of this sort, however, it may be
                    shown that from one comparative another may be formed, and from one superlative
                    another comparative and superlative, and so on to almost any extent whatever.
                    Suppose three persons, John, James, and Peter: John is tall, James is taller,
                    and Peter is tallest; but, instituting a second comparison, Peter is <hi
                    rend="italic">more</hi> taller than John than James is; that is, as Peter is the
                    tallest of the three, and as James is taller than John, Peter, with reference to
                    John, the common object, must be taller to a <hi rend="italic">greater</hi>
                    extent or degree than James, the intermediate subject of comparison, is. But
                    this, which it is difficult to state intelligibly in words, may be better
                    comprehended by the following simple diagram.</p>
                <p>Here D is tall, and C is taller than D, but B is <hi rend="italic">more</hi>
                    taller than D than C is; and of the three, A, B, C, it is obvious that A is <hi
                    rend="italic">most</hi> the taller than D. In the first case, when we said that
                    B is <hi rend="italic">more</hi> taller than D than C is, we formed a new
                    comparative of which the former comparative C is the positive; and, in the
                    second case, we formed a new superlative, of which the former comparative was
                    the positive. This may be visibly represented in the following manner:</p>
                <p>Here we have three distinct groups or classes of objects, and A, B, and C are
                    each the tallest of its respective class or group; yet these three in their
                    relative excess may again be recompared. Thus B may be <hi rend="italic"
                    >more</hi> the tallest of its group than A is of its group, and of the three, A,
                    B, and C, C may be <hi rend="italic">most</hi> the tallest of its group. This
                    process, it is obvious, might be carried to any length, and we might form a
                    triple, quadruple, quintuple, sextuple, &amp;c. comparison; nor is there any
                    logical incongruity in the expressions which we have employed, when these are
                    properly applied and understood.</p>
                <p>No limit is set to comparison in nature; the only boundary fixed is by our
                    confined faculties. If we were to advance beyond the first, or at most the
                    second step, we would become involved in relations so complicated that it would
                    be impossible to conceive them; and convenience, therefore, obliges us to stop
                    short. In English, we generally express such comparison by circumlocution. Thus,
                    instead of saying that B is <hi rend="italic">more</hi> greater than D than C
                    is, we commonly say, that B exceeds D more than C does. But instances of the
                    former are sometimes met with even in that language, and not unfrequently in
                    Latin. “The Romans,” says Mr Hume, in his <hi rend="italic">History of
                    England,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">were more</hi> inferior
                    to the Greeks in eloquence than in military glory that is, the Romans were <hi
                    rend="italic">inferior</hi> to the Greeks both in eloquence and in military
                    glory; but they were <hi rend="italic">more</hi> inferior in eloquence than they
                    were inferior in military glory. The language of the historian, therefore, is
                    both logically and grammatically correct, though its accuracy has been impeached
                    by persons ignorant of the principle on which the comparison is made. Priscian
                    the grammarian appears to have perfectly understood the <hi rend="italic"
                    >rationale</hi> of such expressions; but Ruddiman, with all his ingenuity and
                    erudition, seems to have been altogether in the dark respecting it, as is
                    evident from the manner in which he speaks, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Grammatica</hi><hi rend="italic">Major,</hi> of the instances of double
                    comparisons quoted from Priscian. The resolution of all such examples, however,
                    is, according to the principle here stated, equally certain and obvious. Thus,
                    “Achillee Aeneà <hi rend="italic">magis</hi> fortion quam justion fuit that is,
                    Achilles was <hi rend="italic">more</hi> braver than Aeneas, than he was juster
                    than Aeneas; in other words, Achilles <hi rend="italic">exceeded</hi> Aeneas
                    both in bravery and in justice, but he exceeded him <hi rend="italic">more</hi>
                    in the one (bravery) than in the other (justice). The expression, therefore, is
                    perfectly classical, and consistent with itself. Again, “Ajax est <hi
                    rend="italic">magis</hi> fortion Ulysse quam Diomede that is, Achilles is braver
                    than Ulysses, and he is also braver than Diomede, but he is <hi rend="italic"
                    >more</hi> braver than Ulysses, than he is braver than Diomede, or, in other
                    words, he exceeds Ulysses <hi rend="italic">more</hi> in bravery than he does
                    Diomede. There is a passage in the historian Florus, a writer of a vigorous
                    imagination, and whose writings accordingly exemplify that <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193522950" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2950-0691"/>characteristic, which, by
                    reason of a double comparison, has been completely misunderstood. It is to be
                    found in lib. iv. c. 46, of his history, and is as follows: “Sed nec <hi
                    rend="italic">minus</hi> admirabilior fuit illius exitus belli.” In none of the
                    editions of Florus is any notice taken of this passage; and upon consulting
                    Clarke’s translation it will be found that he has simply rendered <hi
                    rend="italic">minus</hi><hi rend="italic">admirabilior</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >“</hi> less admirable,” just as if it had been <hi rend="italic">minus
                    admirabilis.</hi> But it is not from the words themselves that we are enabled to
                    make out the passage; it is from the context. Throughout the whole of it there
                    is a train of closely-connected comparisons going on in the mind, and, in
                    particular, three circumstances are mentioned, each having a tendency to create
                    wonder in a greater degree, viz. Isí, “Nunquam ullo loco tantum virium populus
                    Romanus vidit,” the forces were <hi rend="italic">more</hi> numerous than at
                    other times; 2⅛ “Nunquam imminentis ruinae manifestiora prodigia,” the presages
                    of impending ruin were <hi rend="italic">more</hi> striking than at other times;
                    and, 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, “Nunquam <hi rend="italic">acrior</hi> neque <hi
                    rend="italic">alacrior</hi> exercitus Caesaris,” the army was <hi rend="italic"
                    >keener,</hi> and evinced <hi rend="italic">greater alacrity,</hi> than on
                    ordinary occasions. The circumstance, therefore, which led the author to use the
                    expression “Sed nec <hi rend="italic">minus</hi> admirabilior fuit illius exitus
                    belli,” was his having previously mentioned the three things first stated as <hi
                    rend="italic">more wonderful</hi> than at any other time. There is therefore a
                    double comparison here, <hi rend="italic">Sed nec</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >minus</hi><hi rend="italic">admirabilior,</hi> &amp;c. “But no <hi
                    rend="italic">less</hi> (or, in no less a degree) more wonderful was the issue
                    of this war,” viz. <hi rend="italic">than the issue of other wars.</hi> The
                    three particulars above stated were <hi rend="italic">more wonderful</hi> than
                    at any other time, and this was <hi rend="italic">no less</hi> more wonderful.
                    Without the double comparatives the real meaning of the author could not have
                    been expressed. But for the same reason that it was <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">minus</hi> admirabilior,” it might have been “<hi rend="italic"
                    >magis</hi> admirabilior,” <hi rend="italic">more</hi> more wonderful. <hi
                    rend="italic">Magis,</hi> however, though used as a comparative, is in truth
                    only a positive of which <hi rend="italic">major</hi> is the comparative, and
                    <hi rend="italic">magissimus,</hi> i. e. <hi rend="italic">maximus,</hi> the
                    superlative; it is derived from the Greek <hi rend="italic">μιγας,</hi> and
                    literally signifies <hi rend="italic">greatly</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> thus,
                    “more elegant,” was originally “greatly elegant.” The comparative, therefore,
                    produces a different effect in language from that which it did originally, when
                    its import was not “more,” but “greatly.”</p>
                <p>The intrepid apostle of the Gentiles, speaking of himself, in one of his
                    epistles, says, <hi rend="italic">tμoι rω tλaχurron1if&gt; m∙asrus rω&gt;
                    aγιωr,</hi> which is translated “<hi rend="italic">less than the least,”</hi>
                    probably because “<hi rend="italic">more</hi> the least” would have made but an
                    awkward appearance in English. The superlative here is formed into a new
                    comparative. But the Greek comparative ends in <hi rend="italic">-∏(0f,</hi>
                    which, when fully traced, seems to be <hi rend="italic">ιrtgtι,</hi> the
                    comparative of t⅛, one, joined to the word denoting the subject or thing
                    compared, and signifies not <hi rend="italic">more</hi> of one, but <hi
                    rend="italic">one of two</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for we find the
                    termination -rsjo; very frequently without any augment or increase of qualities,
                    as <hi rend="italic">ru</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">i,
                    ruriļoí,</hi> which of the two; <hi rend="italic">tif,</hi> one, <hi
                    rend="italic">trtiof,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">more</hi> of one, or <hi
                    rend="italic">more</hi> of unity, but one of two; άλλο;, another, αλλor∣foς, not
                    <hi rend="italic">more of another,</hi> but another of two; <hi rend="italic"
                    >iς,</hi> who, órfgo¢, which of the two, in Latin <hi rend="italic">uterus,</hi>
                    abridged into <hi rend="italic">uter</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, in the
                    same manner, *αλoj, fair, <hi rend="italic">xaaoreξoς,</hi> the fair of the two.
                    We may add, that <hi rend="italic">whether,</hi> in English, means <hi
                    rend="italic">which of the two.</hi> Agreeably to this notion, then, the
                    comparative being used as a partitive, <hi rend="italic">major fratrum</hi>
                    means the elder of the two brothers, or the one selected (on account of <hi
                    rend="italic">age)</hi> to the exclusion of the other.</p>
                <p>Of the termination of the superlative no certain account can be given; it is a
                    part of the subject on which all is conjectural; and although it could be
                    traced, this would be attended with no practical advantage. Its Greek
                    termination is in -ro¢, and there is some coincidence between this termination
                    and that of the ordinal numbers rŗ/ro¢, <hi rend="italic">nragrof, mμartς,
                    &amp;c.</hi> which do not mean the aggregate numbers <hi rend="italic">three,
                    four, five,</hi> but express each an ordinal <hi rend="italic">unity</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> thus <hi rend="italic">rg</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">rι&gt;i</hi> signifies the <hi rend="italic">third,</hi> and often
                    <hi rend="italic">one of the three.</hi> The same coincidence between the
                    superlative and the numerals is observable in Latin; thus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >optimus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">primus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >quintus,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fifth,</hi> always denoting <hi rend="italic">unity,</hi> that is, unity in a
                    numerical series or order. Now, since in these two languages there is such a
                    coincidence between the superlative and the numerals, let us for a moment
                    suppose the superlative to be made up of unity, or to contain in it unity; then
                    <hi rend="italic">doctissimus Romanorum,</hi> resolved on this assumed
                    principle, will be <hi rend="italic">doctus unus Romanorum,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">“</hi> the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> learned or learned <hi
                    rend="italic">one</hi> of the Romans,” making thus a selection of <hi
                    rend="italic">one</hi> to the exclusion of <hi rend="italic">all others.
                    Unus</hi> is taken two ways, either definitely or indefinitely; either as <hi
                    rend="italic">one only</hi> to the exclusion of all others, or as one of any
                    number. Horace has an example which seems to favour this view, and in which for
                    <hi rend="italic">unus potes,</hi><hi rend="italic">one</hi> that is powerful,
                    we might substitute <hi rend="italic">potissimus,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >most</hi> powerful. And Quintilian says, “Demosthenes eminens <hi rend="italic"
                    >unus</hi> in omni ge-ņere loquendi est,” in which expression <hi rend="italic"
                    >eminens unus</hi> is the equation of <hi rend="italic">eminentissimus.</hi> The
                    superlative, like <hi rend="italic">unus,</hi> is used both definitely and
                    indefinitely; definitely when <hi rend="italic">optimus,</hi> for instance,
                    means <hi rend="italic">the best</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and indefinitely
                    when it is rendered <hi rend="italic">very good.</hi> Horace, when inviting
                    Mecaenas to a feast, desires him to write back word, “Tu, quotus esse velis,
                    rescribe,” where <hi rend="italic">quot,</hi> combined with unity, signifies “of
                    <hi rend="italic">how many</hi> you wish to be <hi rend="italic">one ı”</hi> and
                    so perhaps the superlative is composed of unity and the word expressive of that
                    which is susceptible of comparison, namely, the positive.</p>
                <p>Lastly, the comparative is often expressed by <hi rend="italic">quam,</hi> as
                    “Virtus est praestantion <hi rend="italic">quam</hi> aurum.” But <hi
                    rend="italic">tam</hi> and <hi rend="italic">quam</hi> correspond to each other
                    as antecedent and relative, and are really such themselves; <hi rend="italic"
                    >tarn</hi> being the accusative of the Greek article rov, <hi rend="italic"
                    >rnr,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">quam</hi> the accusative of the relative, and
                    their effect being <hi rend="italic">tarn,</hi> to the degree, <hi rend="italic"
                    >quam,</hi> to which degree. Hence the expression may be resolved, “Virtue is
                    generally excellent to the degree to which gold is,” and <hi rend="italic"
                    >more.</hi> According to the idiom of the French language, it would have been
                    “quam aurum <hi rend="italic">non</hi> est,” to which degree gold is <hi
                    rend="italic">not.</hi> In certain cases of apparent comparison, it is said by
                    many that <hi rend="italic">potius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">magis</hi> are
                    understood, as “Res autem admonet cavere <hi rend="italic">quam</hi>
                    consultare,” where it is commonly said that <hi rend="italic">potius</hi> ought
                    to be supplied; but surely this would be a very violent supplement, and the more
                    natural one, undoubtedly, would be the antecedent of <hi rend="italic"
                    >quam.</hi> Thus, “Res autem admonet <hi rend="italic">tam</hi> cavere <hi
                    rend="italic">quam</hi> consultare,” “Circumstances warn us to be on our guard
                    <hi rend="italic">to the degree to which</hi> they warn us to consult” or
                    consider what is best to be done. The import of <hi rend="italic">than</hi> in
                    English, however, is not so easily ascertained as that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >quam</hi> in Latin. Where <hi rend="italic">potius</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >magis</hi> are used they seem to be of the same import with the Greek
                    prepositions &lt;rαjα and τgoj, and significant of apposition or juxtaposition.
                    <hi rend="italic">To</hi> in English denotes apposition and likewise comparison.
                    “These blunders are nothing to what we find in Grenada,” that is, <hi
                    rend="italic">compared with</hi> “what we find in Grenada.”</p>
                <p>Such is an abridged, and, we fear, very imperfect, view of the ingenious and
                    original speculations of Dr Hunter on the subject of comparison; speculations
                    with which all his pupils must be familiar, but which, notwithstanding their
                    extreme refinement, have not hitherto, so far as we know, been submitted to the
                    public, even in an intelligible abstract.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Analytical Resolution of the Moods and Tenses in the Greek
                    and Latin Verbs.</hi></p>
                <p>The subject of the verb, and of verbal forms, has already been treated of at
                    considerable length, but chiefly, as the reader will have perceived, with
                    reference to the English<pb break="no" facs="nls:193522963"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-2963-0692"/> language. It may not be improper therefore to
                    extend the application of the same principles to the resolution of the moods and
                    tenses of the Greek and Latin verbs, and to establish, both analytically and
                    inductively, their universality as laws of human speech, or rather of the human
                    mind adapting language to the expression of its thoughts.</p>
                <p>It occurred to Dr Hunter, early in life, that by separating the <hi rend="italic"
                    >time</hi> from the other circumstances involved in those forms of the Latin
                    verb called the tenses of the <hi rend="italic">indicative</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">subjunctive moods,</hi> the explanations of the tenses, and also
                    of these moods themselves, would be much simplified. The view which then
                    occurred to him he continued to give annually, in his grammatical prelections,
                    during a period of about half a century; and though, without calling in the aid
                    of <hi rend="italic">other principles,</hi> it is insufficient for the
                    explanation of certain uses of the moods and tenses, yet, as far as it goes, it
                    has contributed to the elucidation of a subject respecting which grammarians
                    had, with a few exceptions, being long accustomed to wander in the dark. Mr
                    Dawes, in his <hi rend="italic">Miscellanea</hi><hi rend="italic">Critica,</hi>
                    first published in 1745, reached the very verge of Dr Hunter’s opinion;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Miscellanea</hi><hi rend="italic">Critica,</hi><hi rend="italic">p. 85, Dr
                    Burgess*</hi> edition.</p></note> and Matthiae, in his copious grammar of the
                    Greek language,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Matthiae’s <hi rend="italic">Greek Grammar,</hi> sect. 522.</p></note>
                    published in 1809, explained some passages of the Greek authors conformably to a
                    general principle found exemplified in the structure of every language. But as
                    he does not seem to have been at all aware of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >principle</hi> itself, and of the <hi rend="italic">universality</hi> of its
                    application, Dr Hunter was induced, several years ago, to publish an
                    introductory view of the moods and tenses of the Greek and Latin verbs, in which
                    both the principle and its application are most clearly and beautifully
                    unfolded, and which, with his consent and approbation, we are enabled to
                    subjoin. Before entering on the discussion of the particular verbal forms,
                    however, this venerable patriarch of philology premises some general
                    observations connected with the subject, and necessary to a just view of it.</p>
                <p>Anderst, in the polished and refined state in which the Latin language has come
                    down to us, it is perhaps impossible to decompose tire various moods and tenses
                    of its verbs, so as to exhibit with certainty the elements, or the <hi
                    rend="italic">generic verbs,</hi> by the coalescence or combination of which
                    those moods and tenses have been originally formed. The surest, perhaps the
                    only, guide, to which we can have recourse, is furnished by the decomposed state
                    in which these moods and tenses are represented in our own or other modern
                    languages, by means of those generic verbs termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >auxiliary.</hi> Thus, <hi rend="italic">scripsero,</hi> when decomposed into
                    its simple elements, we represent, by recombining these elements in in this
                    manner, <hi rend="italic">I shall</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >have</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">written.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Secondly,</hi> whosoever, therefore, shall attempt a complete and
                    satisfactory explanation of the moods and tenses of the learned languages, which
                    is still a desideratum in our grammars, must attend particularly to the literal
                    import and meaning of those auxiliary verbs. But even this will not always be
                    sufficient. He will often find that more is meant than meets the ear; and that
                    it is further necessary to call to his aid our modes and habits of thinking, and
                    the inferences which mankind naturally and habitually draw from the verbal
                    statements given. In the expression <hi rend="italic">I will write,</hi> all
                    that is stated is my <hi rend="italic">present will, inclination,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">intention to write.</hi> There is nothing in it <hi rend="italic"
                    >expressive</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">future action ,∙</hi> yet every person
                    understands it as a declaration, or assertion, of <hi rend="italic">future
                    writing.</hi> Now, as this is not the amount of the statement literally taken,
                    the effect must be the consequence of an inference drawn from the present
                    volition to the future action. From the <hi rend="italic">present volition</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">future action</hi> is inferred.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Thirdly,</hi> The verbs which our grammarians have termed <hi
                    rend="italic">auxiliary</hi> are chiefly these: <hi rend="italic">am, do, have,
                    shall, will, may, can.</hi> One or other of these we employ, or may employ, in
                    rendering literally into English the moods and tenses of the Greek and Latin
                    verb. These verbs, however, when combined with a noun or subject, constitute,
                    each of them, the predicate of a proposition. They all of them express an <hi
                    rend="italic">assertion,</hi> affirmative or negative, and consequently they are
                    all verbs in the <hi rend="italic">indicative mood:</hi> as <hi rend="italic">I
                    am, I am not</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">I do, I do
                    not</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">I have, I have not</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">I shall, I shall not</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">I will, I will not</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">1 may, I may not</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">I
                    can, I cannot.</hi> From this view of the subject, some important consequences
                    seem deducible.</p>
                <p>1. These auxiliaries, being thus all verbs in the indicative mood, and all of
                    them, when combined with a noun or <hi rend="italic">subject,</hi> expressing an
                    assertion, it follows that the tenses of the Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >subjunctive,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">potential,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >optative,</hi> as in certain instances it has been called, as well as the <hi
                    rend="italic">subjunctive</hi> and <hi rend="italic">optative</hi> of the Greek
                    verb, which involve those auxiliaries, and are literally rendered into English
                    by means of them, are also <hi rend="italic">indicative.</hi> To consider
                    certain of those forms or tenses as exclusively indicative or assertive, and
                    others as not so, seems to be founded completely in misapprehension, and tends
                    to perplex and mislead. “I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> write,” “I <hi
                    rend="italic">might</hi> write,” are as much assertions, as “I <hi rend="italic"
                    >do</hi> write,” and “I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> write.” The thing indicated
                    or asserted is different; but, in as far as assertion is concerned, they are
                    completely similar, and stand upon precisely the same footing.</p>
                <p>2. Such expressions as, “I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> read,” “I <hi rend="italic"
                    >may</hi> write,” “I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> read,” “I <hi rend="italic"
                    >might</hi> write,” “I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have read,” “I <hi
                    rend="italic">may</hi> have written,” “I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have
                    read,” “I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have written,” are incorrectly and
                    improperly considered as <hi rend="italic">moods,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >modes,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> and of <hi rend="italic"
                    >writing.</hi> It is the verb <hi rend="italic">may</hi> that is <hi
                    rend="italic">generic,</hi> or the term to be modified, and the other verbs
                    annexed to it contain the modification. The verb <hi rend="italic">may</hi>
                    predicates <hi rend="italic">liberty</hi> in general of its nominative or
                    subject; <hi rend="italic">may read, may write,</hi> predicate liberty <hi
                    rend="italic">to read</hi> and <hi rend="italic">to write.</hi> They express not
                    <hi rend="italic">liberty in general,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">liberty
                    modified</hi> or particularized. They ought therefore to be considered as modes
                    or moods of the verb <hi rend="italic">may,</hi> not of the verbs <hi
                    rend="italic">read</hi> and <hi rend="italic">write.</hi> The same observations
                    are applicable to all our other auxiliaries. The verb <hi rend="italic">can</hi>
                    predicates <hi rend="italic">power</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ability</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">; “</hi><hi rend="italic">can</hi> read,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >“</hi><hi rend="italic">can</hi> write,” predicate particular power, the power
                    or ability to perform those particular actions; and so of the rest. What has now
                    been said of the English auxiliaries is applicable to the moods and tenses of
                    the learned languages. If the generic verb be prefixed, as it is in our own
                    language, it remains a separate word; and has been termed an <hi rend="italic"
                    >auxiliary</hi> verb. If it be subjoined, or annexed at the end, being
                    unemphatical, it becomes <hi rend="italic">enclitic</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and, adhering to the verbs to which it is thus annexed, comes at last to be
                    considered as a <hi rend="italic">flexion,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >termination.</hi> The French future <hi rend="italic">J</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ai à</hi><hi rend="italic">or de porter,</hi> is an instance of the one
                    process, and <hi rend="italic">Je</hi><hi rend="italic">porter-ai</hi> is an
                    instance of the other. And, in the progress of elision or abbreviation, the
                    auxiliary may be so disguised as to be no longer distinguishable. It may even be
                    doubted if <hi rend="italic">Je</hi><hi rend="italic">porter-ois</hi> will now
                    be recognised as a compound, or be believed to be the abbreviated form of <hi
                    rend="italic">Je</hi><hi rend="italic">porter-avois,</hi> “I had to carry.”
                    Similar to these last examples appear to be the moods and tenses of the Greek
                    and Latin verb. The auxiliaries, being annexed at the end, have come to adhere
                    to the verbs to which they were annexed, and to be considered as merely changes
                    of termination; and they are with difficulty, if at all, distinguishable as
                    having been separate verbs. Yet the foregoing considerations and examples render
                    it extremely probable that they were originally separate verbs, not prefixed,
                    like the English auxiliaries, but subjoined.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522976" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2976-0693"/>
                <p>and at last attached to and incorporated with the words to which they were
                    subjoined.</p>
                <p>But, whatever opinion may be adopted as to the origin and history of these
                    flexions, no doubt whatever can be entertained that they are similar in their
                    nature to our auxiliaries; that the terminations contain the generic part of the
                    expression, and are modified by the radical part of the verbs combined with
                    them. The forms <hi rend="italic">scrib-am, leg-am, teg-am,</hi> are therefore
                    improperly considered as <hi rend="italic">moods,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >modes,</hi> of the verbs <hi rend="italic">scribo,</hi><hi rend="italic">lego,
                    tego.</hi> It is the termination <hi rend="italic">•am,</hi> the common part,
                    that represents <hi rend="italic">I may,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">I can,</hi>
                    and which receives modification from <hi rend="italic">scrib-, leg-, teg-.</hi>
                    The general notion of <hi rend="italic">liberty</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >power</hi> is <hi rend="italic">modified</hi> by the notion of <hi
                    rend="italic">writing, reading,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">covering,</hi> with
                    which it is combined; the termination <hi rend="italic">-am,</hi> by the radical
                    part of the verbs, not the radical part by the termination.</p>
                <p>3. As the English auxiliary verbs determine the nature of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >moods</hi> of the learned languages, and, as has already been seen, lead us to
                    conclude, that, by whatever name they may have been distinguished, <hi
                    rend="italic">subjunctive, optative,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">potential,</hi>
                    they are all equally <hi rend="italic">indicative</hi> or assertive; so they
                    also, if we listen to their suggestions, will be found equally decisive as to
                    the <hi rend="italic">tenses</hi> or <hi rend="italic">times</hi> of those
                    moods. These auxiliaries are all verbs. They are all verbs of the indicative
                    mood; and they are all verbs of the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> time or
                    tense, each of them having a corresponding form appropriated to <hi
                    rend="italic">past</hi> time. Thus, <hi rend="smallcaps">Pres.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Am, do, have, shall, will, may, can.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Past.</hi><hi rend="italic">Was, did, had, should, would, might,
                    could.</hi></p>
                <p>The terminations or flexions of the verbs of the learned languages, which contain
                    or involve those auxiliaries, should therefore also be either of the <hi
                    rend="italic">present</hi> or of the <hi rend="italic">past time</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">tense.</hi> Whatever they predicate of their subject or
                    nominative, whether <hi rend="italic">existence, action, possession, duty</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">obligation, volition, liberty</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >possibility, ability</hi> or <hi rend="italic">power,</hi> they will be found,
                    like the auxiliaries which they involve, to have two corresponding forms, one
                    predicating those attributes of the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> time, the
                    other of the <hi rend="italic">past.</hi> If then we separate the <hi
                    rend="italic">time</hi> from the other circumstances involved in those forms of
                    the Greek and Latin verb called the <hi rend="italic">moods</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">tenses,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">time</hi> thus separated, or
                    separately attended to, will, in every one of them, be found to be either the
                    <hi rend="italic">present</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">past.</hi> One primary
                    object of these forms seems to have been to give the <hi rend="italic"
                    >present</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">past</hi> as two <hi rend="italic">fixed
                    points</hi> of time, with a reference to which all the other ideas involved in
                    them are to be estimated and determined. They are all <hi rend="italic">past,
                    present, future, contingent,</hi> &amp;c. with reference to one or other of
                    these two fixed points.</p>
                <p>These preliminary observations seemed necessary to prepare the way for the
                    proposed elementary view of the tenses of the Latin verb; and in the sequel that
                    view will be further illustrated and confirmed by the application of it to the
                    moods and tenses of the Greek verb'. The <hi rend="italic">tenses</hi> of the
                    Latin verb, arranged as <hi rend="italic">present</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >past,</hi> are as follow:</p>

                    rend="italic">may</hi> be. Although there may appear to be a marked difference
                    between these two when they are uttered separately, and not combined with
                    another verb, yet, when they are found in combination, as generally happens, the
                    effect of them is in most cases precisely the same. They equally present the
                    verbal state as <hi rend="italic">future,</hi> and equally present it as <hi
                    rend="italic">contingent</hi> or <hi rend="italic">possible.</hi> Thus, <hi

                    faciam,</hi> “If you order me, I will do it.” Both forms represent my doing it
                    as depending on your ordering me; and both, at the same time, mark the relation
                    of that order to the present time; the one as an event <hi rend="italic"
                    >now</hi> future, the other as an event <hi rend="italic">now</hi> contingent or
                    possible. <hi rend="italic">Jubebis,</hi> however, in this combination, leaves
                    it <hi rend="italic">uncertain</hi> whether you shall order me or not; and <hi
                    rend="italic">jubeas</hi> leads to the inference, that, if you order me at all,
                    that order is <hi rend="italic">future.</hi> What the one states as <hi
                    rend="italic">future,</hi> is at the same time stated by <hi rend="italic"
                    >si</hi> as <hi rend="italic">uncertain</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> what the
                    other states as <hi rend="italic">uncertain,</hi> is at the same time perceived
                    to be <hi rend="italic">fiiture.</hi> The two modes of conceiving the event are
                    so blended together, that it is often a matter of indifference whether we employ
                    the one tense or the other; and in numerous instances the present subjunctive
                    may be rendered by <hi rend="italic">shall.</hi> It is from th⅛ affinity or
                    similarity between these two modes of conceiving the action or verbal state,
                    that the terms expressing them often coincide in form. Thus scr⅛AM, <hi

                    both as futures of the indicative, and rendered <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> or

                <p>It is necessary further to observe, that all these forms contain only the

                    rend="italic">present</hi> time, and that all of them, excepting the first,
                    leave the <hi rend="italic">time</hi> of commanding, the time when the command
                    is actually given, completely indefinite. <hi rend="italic">Imperavit,</hi> for
                    example, merely states the act of commanding as <hi rend="smallcaps">now</hi><hi

                    unascertained. The command may have been given last moment, last week, last
                    month, last year, or last century. In the same manner, <hi rend="italic"
                    >imperabit</hi> states the act of commanding as <hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                    noví</hi><hi rend="italic">future.</hi> It expresses barely the relation of the
                    command to the present time, but leaves the time of commanding completely
                    indefinite. It may be next moment, next day, next week, next year, next age. If
                    the <hi rend="italic">time</hi> of the command be necessary to be ascertained,
                    an expression of future time, or the statement of a future event, with which it
                    shall be contemporaneous, is required for the purpose; as <hi rend="italic"
                    >to-morrow morning, next week, at sunset,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">at
                    sunrise,</hi> &amp;c.; or it may be obvious from other circumstances in the
                    context or narrative. In like manner, <hi rend="italic">imperaverit</hi> states
                    <hi rend="italic">the having commanded</hi> as an event <hi rend="italic"
                    >now</hi> possible, or <hi rend="italic">now</hi> future; but of itself it
                    indicates neither the time of giving the command, nor any time or event to which
                    the com mand shall be prior, or before which it <hi rend="italic">may</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> have taken place. From the desire, however, which
                    we have to obtain precise rather than vague information, we naturally avail
                    ourselves of the circumstances in the context or in the combination in which it
                    stands, to ascertain what the form itself leaves undefined. In the example given
                    above, <hi rend="italic">imperaverit</hi> may be considered as standing in a
                    twofold connection, and as having a double reference; one to the present time,
                    the time of the promise <hi rend="italic">(pollicentur),</hi> with respect to
                    which the act of commanding is stated as <hi rend="italic">contingent</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">future</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the other to the future
                    time of performing the promise <hi rend="italic">(facturas),</hi> with respect
                    to which the act of commanding shall be <hi rend="italic">past.</hi> The whole
                    statement may be fully brought into view by a paraphrastical or periphrastical
                    development, thus: “They promise that they will execute his commands, when the

                    as <hi rend="italic">then</hi> future, or as <hi rend="italic">then</hi>
                    contingent or possible. In the former case it may be considered as the <hi
                    rend="italic">past</hi> time of <hi rend="italic">imperabit</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">:</hi><hi rend="italic">imperabit</hi> stating the act of
                    commanding as <hi rend="italic">now</hi> future, or future at the present time;
                    <hi rend="italic">imperaret</hi> as <hi rend="italic">then</hi> future, future
                    at a <hi rend="italic">past</hi> time, which in this instance is the time of the
                    promise. They are therefore related to each other as <hi rend="italic"
                    >present</hi> and <hi rend="italic">past.</hi> On the other hand, if <hi
                    rend="italic">imperaret</hi> be considered as representing the act of commanding
                    as then contingent or possible, a thing that <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be, it
                    will be the <hi rend="italic">past</hi> time of <hi rend="italic"
                    >imperet</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the latter exhibiting the conception in
                    reference to the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> time, and the former exhibiting
                    the same conception in relation to <hi rend="italic">past</hi> time. The
                    affinity of signification between the future indicative and the present
                    subjunctive, as formerly observed, is so great, that their terminations often
                    coincide; and hence they always unite in one past form, the imperfect of the
                    subjunctive.</p>
                <p>What increases the difficulty of this part of the subject <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193523002" xml:id="kp-eb0710-3002-0695"/>is, that we have in English
                    no auxiliary verb so generalized, ' as, like the terminations of the Latin
                    imperfect subjunctive, to include the particular meanings expressed by <hi
                    rend="italic">should and might,</hi> so as to be equally applicable to both.
                    Neither does the English idiom always mark the relation of events to one another
                    in respect of time, as contemporaneous, or prior, or posterior, with the same
                    minuteness as the Latin. This last circumstance also increases the difficulty,
                    and adds to our embarrassment in our inquiries on this subject, as we are apt to
                    consider the different and often more vague statement of the English language as
                    an exact counterpart of that given by the Latin.</p>
                <p>It has already been observed, that the pluperfect subjunctive expresses precisely
                    the same conception as the perfect and the future subjunctive, differing from
                    these in no circumstance but that of <hi rend="italic">time,</hi> and expressing
                    the same thing with reference to <hi rend="italic">past</hi> time which they
                    express with reference to the <hi rend="italic">present.</hi> These two ought
                    therefore to be considered as <hi rend="italic">present</hi> forms, and the
                    pluperfect as the corresponding <hi rend="italic">past</hi> form. <hi
                    rend="italic">Imperaverit,</hi> for instance, states the having commanded as <hi
                    rend="italic">now</hi> contingent or future; <hi rend="italic">imperavisset</hi>
                    as <hi rend="italic">then</hi> contingent or future, contingent or future at a
                    <hi rend="italic">past</hi> time; but <hi rend="italic">of itself</hi> it
                    indicates neither the time of the actual command, nor any time or event to which
                    it was to be prior, or before which it was to have taken place.' <hi
                    rend="italic">Imperavisset,</hi> however, in the connection in which it stands
                    in the example given, is naturally, if not necessarily, conceived to have a
                    double reference; one to the time of the promise <hi rend="italic"
                    >{pollicebantur),</hi> with respect to which the commanding <hi rend="italic"
                    >iras</hi> future or contingent; the other to the execution of the command <hi
                    rend="italic">{facturos)</hi> which it was to precede, and with respect to which
                    it was to be <hi rend="italic">past.</hi> “They promised that they would execute
                    his commands, when the act of commanding, <hi rend="italic">then</hi> contingent
                    or future, should once be <hi rend="italic">past."</hi> This clumsy
                    circumlocution is in some degree requisite to bring fully into view what is so
                    concisely and neatly expressed in the Latin.</p>
                <p>Such are the views respecting the moods and tenses of the Latin verb which Dr
                    Hunter has unfolded in his invaluable disquisition on that subject, and which,
                    we need scarcely add, are expressed in his own clear and concise language; views
                    which might be illustrated by the usage of every known language, and which, in
                    fact, are based on principles of universal application. In a matter which
                    appears so clear, a wide range of induction was not called for, and might have
                    proved tedious; and hence, in the subsequent part of his disquisition, he has
                    confined himself to some illustrations drawn from the practice of the Greek
                    language.</p>
                <p>The indicative forms of the Greek verb, ro⅛rω, <hi rend="italic">irυτm,</hi>
                    rirψω, <hi rend="italic">τ↑nu,</hi> irυ-ψα, <hi rend="italic">iruvo&gt;,</hi>
                    rirupa, <hi rend="italic">irtrupin, &amp;c.</hi> seem to require no particular
                    discussion, except whether the aorist in “ought to be considered as a different
                    form of the preterperfect, as a learned professor seems to suspect. The
                    following observations shall therefore be restricted to those forms called the
                    <hi rend="italic">optative</hi> and <hi rend="italic">subjunctive,</hi> and are
                    intended to establish and illustrate these two positions:</p>
                <p>1. That in all the tenses of the Greek verb (except the <hi rend="italic"
                    >future,</hi> which has no subjunctive), the subjunctive is universally of the
                    <hi rend="italic">present</hi> time or tense, and the corresponding optative is
                    the corresponding <hi rend="italic">past</hi> ti <hi rend="subscript"> me</hi>.
                    And, 2. That the optative of the future is the <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> χ
                    <hi rend="subscript"> w</hi> &lt; ti <hi rend="subscript"> me</hi> of the
                    indicative of the future, which itself is of the <hi rend="italic">present</hi>
                    time.</p>
                <p>We shall begin with the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> position. In the preceding
                    observations we have endeavoured to show that all the forms of the Latin
                    subjunctive are really <hi rend="italic">indicative</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    that <hi rend="italic">Imay write</hi> is as much an assertion as <hi
                    rend="italic">Ido write,</hi> although the tiling asserted be different. It will
                    surely not be controverted, then, that <hi rend="italic">I will</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> wr</hi><hi rend="italic">ite, I shall write, or I am tn
                    write,</hi> have an equal title to be called <hi rend="italic">subjunctive
                    *'</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ,lh</hi><hi rend="italic">I may
                    write,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">I can write.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >As</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> 7</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">s,</hi> ⅛&gt;
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> jα√, “He <hi rend="italic">says</hi> that he <hi
                    rend="italic">will</hi> write,” is incontrovertibly classical Greek, the
                    expression having a reference to the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> time. Let λ∙
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> ∣ι be changed into iλ∙ <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi>
                    ι the past, <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> jα∙ψι&lt;, the indicative, must be
                    changed into the corresponding optative <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> jα∙ψ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> w</hi> ∙ Eλ∣ <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> w <hi
                    rend="italic">vπ</hi> yga∙ψω, “He <hi rend="italic">said</hi> that he <hi
                    rend="italic">would</hi> write.” The conception in both examples is exactly the
                    same, except as to time; the <hi rend="italic">former</hi> expressing it with
                    reference to the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> time, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >latter</hi> with reference to the <hi rend="italic">past.</hi> Should any doubt
                    be entertained as to what has now been stated, the following passage from the
                    second book of Xenophon’s <hi rend="italic">Hellenica</hi> will be found to
                    contain as many examples of the optative of the future as may perhaps establish
                    the point by induction. It is part of the defence made by Theramenes, one of the
                    Thirty Tyrants, when he was impeached by Critias, another of them, because he
                    would not concur in all their measures of cruelty and rapine.</p>

                <p>Let us now imagine that, instead of this narrative recital of his conduct and
                    sentiments, Theramenes deems it proper to urge the same considerations to his
                    colleagues in the direct or dramatic form. Every one of his statements must now
                    be made by verbs, not of the <hi rend="italic">past,</hi> but of the <hi

                    >verba</hi> supposed to have been spoken by him on the occasion. “It does not

                <p>This reply of Theramenes deserves to be particularly attended to, on account of
                    the transition from the <hi rend="italic">past</hi> to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >present</hi> which it contains, and the corresponding transition from the <hi
                    rend="italic">optative</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">subjunctive.</hi> Had the
                    author intended to exemplify the first of the above positions, he could not have
                    expressed himself in terms more appropriate, or more completely adapted to the
                    purpose.</p>
                <p>From what has been stated, it is easy to perceive why those statements, which, in
                    the direct or dramatic form, are given in the <hi rend="italic">subjunctive</hi>
                    or in the <hi rend="italic">future indicative,</hi> are in the indirect form, or
                    narrative recital of them, expressed by the <hi rend="italic">optative,</hi>
                    precisely in the same manner as in our own language we employ, in direct
                    statements, the present forms <hi rend="italic">may</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >shall,</hi> and in the narrative recital of those statements the past forms <hi
                    rend="italic">might</hi> and <hi rend="italic">should.</hi> Thus, the direct or
                    dramatic statements, “I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> perhaps go to London next
                    week,” and “I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> perhaps go to London next week,”
                    become in the narrative recital of them, I said that I <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >might</hi> perhaps <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to London next week,” and “I said
                    that I <hi rend="italic">should</hi> perhaps <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to London
                    next week.” So, when Agamemnon had retired wounded from the field of battle,
                    Hector, in addressing the Trojans and Lycians, employs the subjunctive, a
                    present form:</p>
                <p>I∕⅛ iλa <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>!,ιrι <hi rend="italic">μivι</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">χnt lrτ&gt;ι</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>“Drive <hi rend="italic">(now)</hi> your horses straight against the valiant

                    still greater glory.” But, when the statement is given in the narrative form, as
                    a past event, the subjunctive &lt;xgnra&lt; is changed into the optative ⅛o∕ro,
                    the corresponding form of the past time:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">T∙vf aĩ</hi> Tiíàŵ <hi rend="italic">AioµŕÌìu īlaXXìtļ</hi>

                <p>“Then Minerva gave strength and courage to Diomede, that he <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >might</hi><hi rend="italic">(may-ed) become</hi> eminently conspicuous, and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">might</hi><hi rend="italic">bear</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >away</hi> distinguished glory.”</p>
                <p>It is to be noticed, however, that Homer does not always observe this, the usual
                    and strictly grammatical, sequence of these moods. In the speech of Minerva to
                    Diomede, we find a <hi rend="italic">past</hi><hi rend="italic">tense</hi>
                    followed by the <hi rend="italic">subjunctive,</hi> “I <hi rend="italic"
                    >removed</hi> the mist from your eyes that you <hi rend="smallcaps">may</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">distinguish (iφga γι-</hi><hi rend="italic">vωsxr,ς)</hi> a <hi

                    battle.” But, in the indirect form, or narrative recital, of this speech of
                    Minerva, given by Plato,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">In Alcibiad.</hi> II. prope finem. These passages are
                    quoted both by Dawes and by Malthiae.</p></note> it is <hi rend="italic">iφga
                    γ</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">vωsxoι.</hi> His words are,
                    “Homer says that Minerva removed the mist from the eyes of Diomede, that he <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">might</hi><hi rend="italic">distinguish.”</hi> But even in
                    Homer the expression might have been, <hi rend="italic">iφga</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">γ</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">vω&lt;mω(.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Άφιλον</hi><hi rend="italic">iφga γιvω&lt;naus,</hi> I removed
                    that you <hi rend="smallcaps">might</hi><hi rend="italic">distinguish.</hi>
                    Wherein, it will be said, consists the difference? There is none in the ultimate
                    effect. <hi rend="italic">Tivωβxo</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ς</hi> would be used in reference to the time of removal, expressed by
                    dptao&gt;, a verb of thepost’ time, to which it would correctly correspond.
                    Homer has chosen, however, to change the reference, and to substitute the
                    subjunctive, a form of the present time, thereby marking a reference to the time
                    of Minerva’s speaking, not to that of the removal. I <hi rend="italic">(just
                    now) removed</hi> that you <hi rend="italic">may</hi> (now, or hereafter) <hi
                    rend="italic">distinguish.</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Aφtaov</hi> states the <hi
                    rend="italic">removing</hi> as <hi rend="italic">past,</hi> and may be used with
                    equal propriety, whether the removal took place a <hi rend="italic">moment</hi>
                    or a <hi rend="italic">century before.</hi> This appears to be a more correct
                    view of the passage than that given by Dawes, who, to preserve a correspondence
                    in the <hi rend="italic">times,</hi> is obliged to make <hi rend="italic"
                    >a&lt;pιλov</hi> a preterperfect. Such changes of reference are, we believe, to
                    be found in every language, and they are strikingly frequent in the Greek. A
                    person speaking of himself might say in English, “I <hi rend="italic"
                    >laboured</hi> hard in my youth, that I <hi rend="smallcaps">may</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">enjoy</hi> ease and repose in the evening of life.” These changes
                    of reference too are often alternate, as, in historical narrative, a transition
                    is often made from the past to the present time, and from the present to the
                    past.</p>
                <p>In the course of this discussion, it has been stated that all the tenses of the
                    subjunctive mood are indicative or assertive. If that observation be admitted to
                    be just, it will supersede the controversy, whether the futures in <hi
                    rend="italic">-ro</hi> belong to the indicative or the subjunctive mood. It has
                    also been suggested, that what have been considered as the modes or moods of the
                    Latin verb are incorrectly so conceived; that these <hi rend="italic"
                    >flexions</hi> are either generic verbs themselves, or equivalent to generic
                    verbs, indicating <hi rend="italic">liberty, power, &amp;c.</hi>; and that,
                    instead of modifying the <hi rend="italic">radical part</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193523028" xml:id="kp-eb0710-3028-0697"/>of the verbs to which they
                    are annexed, they are really modified by it. It has been shown, that all the
                    tenses, both of the <hi rend="italic">indicative</hi> and of the <hi

                    every one of them either of the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> or of the <hi
                    rend="italic">past time</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that they express of
                    themselves one or other of these times, and may be classed in <hi rend="italic"
                    >two</hi> sets, the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> containing those forms which are
                    of the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> time, and the <hi rend="italic">other</hi>
                    those of the <hi rend="italic">past</hi> time; that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >present</hi> and <hi rend="italic">past</hi> are two <hi rend="italic">fixed
                    points,</hi> with reference to which all the other ideas contained in those
                    complex forms, called <hi rend="italic">moods</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >tenses,</hi> are to be estimated; and that these other ideas are to be
                    estimated as <hi rend="italic">past, present, future, contingent, Sic.</hi> with
                    reference to these two fixed points.</p>
                <p>This is the elementary view which it was proposed to give of the tenses of the
                    Latin verb. It contains, as far as we are competent to judge, the only ground on
                    which a complete and satisfactory account of these tenses, in all their various
                    occurrences and applications, can be raised as a superstructure; and, if
                    admitted, it will enable us to decide several grammatical-controversies; as
                    that, for example, between the acute and bold Sanctius and his learned editor
                    Ferizonius, concerning the tenses of the infinitive and the participles, in
                    which the former maintained, that, strictly speaking, <hi rend="italic"
                    >time</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tense</hi> does not belong to these, and that
                    they are found of <hi rend="italic">all limes.</hi> It is obvious that the
                    infinitive and participles do not, like the definitive forms, contain in
                    themselves the two fixed points of estimation above mentioned; but, on the
                    contrary, that their statements, when they are estimated at all, are to be
                    estimated either from the verb with which they stand connected, or from some
                    circumstance given in the context. They are always estimated from something
                    extraneous, and not, like those of the definitive forms, from any fixed point of
                    time which they themselves express. Thus <hi rend="italic">scribere</hi>
                    represents the act of writing as <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> or in progress,
                    but contains in itself no expression of the time <hi rend="italic">when</hi>
                    doing. The time may be any whatsoever. <hi rend="italic">past, present,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">future.</hi> It is generally, but not always, determined by
                    that of the verb with which the infinitive is combined. Thus, in <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">dico</hi><hi rend="italic">te scribere,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">dixi</hi><hi rend="italic">te scribere,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">dicam</hi><hi rend="italic">te scribere,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">time</hi> of the writing is determined, not by the infinitive
                    itself, but by that of <hi rend="italic">dico dixi,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >dicam,</hi> the verbs with which it is here combined, and is different in each
                    of these examples. The same observation is equally applicable to the
                    participles, as is manifest from the following examples: <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >video</hi> to <hi rend="italic">scribentem,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">vidi</hi>
                    to <hi rend="italic">scribentem, cras</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">videbo</hi> to
                    <hi rend="italic">scribentem.</hi> It has been said above, that the <hi
                    rend="italic">time</hi> of the infinitive is not always determined by that of
                    the verb with which the infinitive stands combined. Dico<hi rend="italic">te
                    scribere</hi> may equally signify, <hi rend="italic">1 say that you</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">were then</hi><hi rend="italic">writing,</hi> as that <hi
                    rend="italic">you</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">are now</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >writing</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">dico</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">te scripsisse</hi> may equally signify, <hi rend="italic">I say
                    that you</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">had then</hi><hi rend="italic">written,</hi>
                    as <hi rend="italic">I say that you</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">have now</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">written,</hi> if any circumstance in the context require it to be
                    so understood.</p>
                <p>In further illustration of the subject, it has been stated, that through the
                    whole of the Greek verb except the future, the subjunctive and corresponding
                    optative differ only as present and past; consequently, if the subjunctive be
                    rendered by <hi rend="italic">may,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">may have,</hi> the
                    optative will be rendered by <hi rend="italic">might,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >might have</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and when the subjunctive is rendered by
                    <hi rend="italic">shall,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">shall have,</hi> as
                    frequently happens, the optative will be rendered by <hi rend="italic"
                    >should,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">should have.</hi> It also appears that the
                    future of the Greek verb may be considered as itself subjunctive, and of the
                    present time, and the optative of the future as the corresponding past time.</p>
                <p>These views the very learned and ingenious author has sought to establish by <hi
                    rend="italic">facts;</hi> and if the inductive conclusion appear to be founded
                    on too limited a number of examples, the number of these may be increased by any
                    person <hi rend="italic">ad libitum.</hi> He proceeds:</p>
                <p>The celebrated Matthiae has attempted to explain the common use of the
                    subjunctive mood, when combined with certain particles of time, by the
                    hypothesis, that it then expresses an <hi rend="italic">action frequently
                    repeated at the present time.</hi> But meeting in Homer with these words,
                    addressed by Andromache to Hector, <hi rend="italic">A γ∙(</hi> i√ ∙λλs</p>
                <p>Emu <hi rend="italic">3nλro(n, iru it rυγι wtτμet i&lt;rwwyt,</hi> he is obliged
                    to admit, that the subjunctive with these particles does not <hi rend="italic"
                    >always</hi> express an action frequently repeated; and for this good reason,
                    that a person can die but <hi rend="italic">once.</hi> Yet that learned author
                    does not seem to perceive that this single instance in Homer is fatal to his
                    hypothesis.</p>
                <p>Mr Seyer of the university of Oxford, in his work on the syntax of the Latin
                    verb, has assumed, that, in certain cases, the subjunctive is strictly
                    synonymous with the indicative, and has proposed to distinguish it in such cases
                    by the appropriate name of the <hi rend="italic">False Subjunctive.</hi> Nothing
                    could have been devised more unphilosophical than this proposal, which, had it
                    been successful, and generally adopted, would have effectually dashed all spirit
                    of inquiry, and prevented all further investigation of the subject. Can it for a
                    moment be supposed that an enlightened people, provided with two forms of the
                    verb for the expression of two different and distinct conceptions, should reject
                    the form appropriate to one of them, and employ in preference the other form,
                    Which did not correctly and adequately express the conception? If the learned
                    author had seen the following example, of authority that will not be questioned,
                    “I regret that it <hi rend="italic">should have been found</hi> necessary to add
                    to the burdens of the people,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    occasion, may not have led him to employ the subjunctive form, <hi rend="italic"

                    Disquisition on the Latin and Greek verbs.</p><p>“Mr Dunbar, the learned
                    professor of Greek in the university of Edinburgh, in a work entitled An <hi
                    rend="italic">Inquiry into the Structure and Affinity of the Greek and Latin
                    Language·</hi> (p. 250), has made some animadversions on one part of the
                    foregoing essay. I subjoin the passage in his own words :—‘ I must here state
                    that Dr Hunter’s ideas respecting the subjunctive mood appear to me not well
                    founded. He has derived ids notions of it from the English auxiliary verbs <hi
                    rend="italic">may, can, &amp;c.</hi> which he says are all <hi rend="italic"
                    >indicative</hi> or <hi rend="italic">aeicrtive.</hi> This is no doubt true of
                    these verbs when taken by themselves; but when joined with others, they
                    evidently convey the notion of some <hi rend="italic">condition or
                    contingency,</hi> arising either from <hi rend="italic">ability, inclination,
                    duty,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">obligation,</hi> in the same manner as those
                    parts of Latin verbs that are subjoined to the tenses of the indicative, and
                    give them a conditional meaning. It is surely not the same thing to say, <hi
                    rend="italic">I am writing,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">I may</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">can write.</hi> The one implies the <hi rend="italic"
                    >prêtent</hi><hi rend="italic">act</hi> unconditionally; the other, a <hi
                    rend="italic">future act,</hi> and conditional. I <hi rend="italic">may</hi>
                    write <hi rend="italic">if</hi> I please. I <hi rend="italic">can write</hi> to
                    him, »/you wish it,’ &amp;c.</p><p>“I must observe, that there is nothing in
                    language more subtle than the use of our auxiliary verbs, and of the verbal
                    forms of the Greek and Latin which contain or involve them. They require more
                    depth of thought, and more patient investigation, than yet appears to have been
                    bestowed upon them. I cannot, therefore, at present enter on the subject further
                    than to observe, that, as far as I am competent to judge, the strictures of my
                    learned critic are founded in misapprehension, and completely erroneous. The sen
                    <pb break="no" n="698"/>tence, <hi rend="italic">I may write,</hi> states my <hi
                    rend="italic">present liberty</hi> to write. It states that there is at present
                    no <hi rend="italic">external</hi> hindrance to prevent my writing. The words
                    contain a proposition true and complete in itself, without further addition; and
                    my learned critic is obliged to annex to it the conditional clause, <hi
                    rend="italic">if I please,</hi> to make it suit his purpose; not aware, it
                    should seem, that it is the <hi rend="italic">actual writing</hi> that is
                    dependent on my pleasure, not the present <hi rend="italic">liberty</hi> to
                    write. In like manner, 7 con <hi rend="italic">write,</hi> states my present <hi
                    rend="italic">power</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ability</hi> to write; and this
                    capacity exists independently of your wishes. My <hi rend="italic">actual
                    writing</hi> may depend on your <hi rend="italic">wish,</hi> but not my <hi
                    rend="italic">ability</hi> to write. 7 con <hi rend="italic">write</hi> whether
                    you wish it or not. The freedom from external preventive and the inherent power
                    or capacity frequently exist together; but either may exist without the other.

                    misapprehension for which it is difficult to account, has found fault with my
                    calling the future in <hi rend="italic">-ro</hi> the future of the subjunctive,
                    imagining, from my employing that designation of it, that <hi rend="italic"
                    >I</hi> intended to exclude that future from the indicative mood. 1 must
                    observe, however, that although, to prevent being misunderstood, I was obliged
                    to call the future in <hi rend="italic">-rv by</hi> the name by which it was
                    generally known, and by which it is distinguished in our elementary books; yet
                    the general tenor of my essay, and even the following paragraph of it alone,
                    ought to have prevented all possibility of misapprehension on the subject: ‘ ín
                    the course of this discussion it has been stated that all the tenses of the
                    subjunctive mood are indicative or assertive. If that observation be admitted to
                    be just, it will supersede the controversy, whether the futures in -ro belong to
                    the <hi rend="italic">indicative</hi> or to the <hi rend="italic">subjunctive
                    mood.'</hi> P. 14.</p><p>“I have stated (p. 4) that ‘ one primary object of
                    these forms called the <hi rend="italic">moods</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >tenses</hi> seems to have been to give the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">past</hi> as two <hi rend="italic">fxed points</hi> of
                    time, with reference to which all the other ideas involved in them are to be
                    estimated and determined. They are all <hi rend="italic">past, present, future,
                    contingent, &amp;c.</hi> with reference to one or other of these two fixed
                    points.’ And I have there given a scheme of the tenses of the Latin verb
                    arranged, agreeably to that principle, as present and past. This unfortunate
                    future in <hi rend="italic">-ro,</hi> however, Professor Dunbar has, in
                    exhibiting that scheme, studiously transferred from the class of <hi
                    rend="italic">presents</hi> to that of <hi rend="italic">pasts,</hi> and has
                    thereby marred instead of mending the consistency of the scheme of arrangement.
                    For it is quite evident that, as <hi rend="italic">ιerib-am</hi> states my <hi
                    rend="italic">writ-ing</hi> as <hi rend="smallcaps">now</hi> future, and
                    therefore, as he admits, is properly arranged as <hi rend="italic">n
                    present</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> so, for the same reason, <hi rend="italic"
                    >scrips-ero,</hi> which states my <hi rend="italic">having written, or</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">completion of my writing,</hi> as <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >now</hi><hi rend="italic">future,</hi> must also be arranged in the class of
                    <hi rend="italic">presents</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >completion</hi> of my writing being <hi rend="italic">future</hi> relatively
                    not to the <hi rend="italic">past,</hi> but to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >present</hi> time.”</p><p>We have only to add, that when Professor Dunbar says,
                    “It is surely not the same thing to say, 7 <hi rend="italic">am writing,</hi>
                    and 7 <hi rend="italic">may</hi> or <hi rend="italic">can write,”</hi> he not
                    only misunderstands Dr Hunter, but confounds two things not very difficult to
                    distinguish; namely, <hi rend="italic">assertion</hi> generally, and the thing
                    <hi rend="italic">asserted</hi> or <hi rend="italic">indicated</hi> in
                    particular verbal forms. Dr Hunter never said or imagined that, “I am writing,”
                    and “I niay or can write,” are identical propositions, what he really stated,
                    and has always maintained, is, that “I may write,” “I might write,” are equally
                    <hi rend="italic">assertions</hi> as “I do write,” “I did write.” The thing <hi

                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">On tin Analogy observed in the Formation of some Tenses of
                    die Greek Verb.</hi></p>
                <p>Of all the philological speculations of Dr Hunter, one of the most beautiful,
                    perhaps, is that concerning the analogy observed in the formation of some of the
                    tenses of the Greek verb, of which, under the modest title of “Conjectures,” he
                    published an outline in the ninth volume of the Transactions of the Royal
                    Society of Edinburgh. The importance of this speculation, which, notwithstanding
                    the beading given to it, is very far indeed from being merely “conjectural,"
                    consists in the advance it makes towards establishing juster rules for the
                    formation of the tenses in some instances, and particularly in accounting for
                    certain forms of the verb in Homer and Hesiod, which, being apparent violations
                    of the usual analogy, have perplexed grammarians, and reduced them to the
                    necessity of imagining <hi rend="italic">new presents,</hi> without authority,
                    and for no other reason but to account for such anomalous forms. The following
                    is the clear and concise statement of his views on this matter, given by Dr
                    Hunter himself.</p>
                <p>“1. The perfect middle has not a middle signification. (See Küster <hi
                    rend="italic">De Voce Media,</hi> sect, i.) Its form, too, is active; and
                    therefore it probably belongs to the active voice, which, on this supposition,
                    becomes more regular and uniform, having a double preterite, as well as a double
                    future and aorist. Thus,</p>
                <p>í rvψω fr-j∙ψα <hi rend="italic">τιτjφa</hi> 1. Prêt.</p>
                <p>ļ ru¢r¢u frικrαικ vsswa 2. Prêt.</p>
                <p>“It is no objection to this account, that the second preterite may sometimes be
                    found in a middle signification; for active verbs in all languages are sometimes
                    used as middle, the reciprocal pronoun being <hi rend="italic">conceived,</hi>
                    though not <hi rend="italic">expressed.</hi> Thus <hi rend="italic"
                    >μιταβαλλω</hi> in Greek, <hi rend="italic">accingo</hi> in Latin, <hi
                    rend="italic">prepare</hi> in English: ‘ omnes accingunt operi,’ they all
                    prepare (themselves) for the work.</p>
                <p>“2. Ο in the second preterite, or preterite middle, uniformly arises from t in
                    the present, and from nothing else, asyω, λtaoya--∣3λsirω, <hi rend="italic"
                    >βtβλ&lt;,era.</hi><hi rend="italic">atiarω, λtλoκra</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi><hi rend="italic">trιι6ω, πtnoit&gt;a.</hi></p>
                <p>That <hi rend="italic">φititω, μιiξω, aγι</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">gω,</hi> and other such verbs having a liquid before <hi
                    rend="italic">ω,</hi> make <hi rend="italic">iφ</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">)wa, μtμoξa, ∙f</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >γoξa,</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">µiµoiea,</hi><hi rend="italic">iφ6ωξa,
                    r</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">γo</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∣</hi><hi rend="italic">ξa,</hi> is no exception from the rule. For all such
                    verbs probably had of old not <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∣</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> but t only, in the penult. Thus <hi
                    rend="italic">φ6ιiξω</hi> seems to have been of old p0sjjω, whence the old or
                    Aeolic future <hi rend="italic">φDtoβw.</hi> So <hi rend="italic">µiiiu</hi> was
                    <hi rend="italic">μtigω,</hi> whence <hi rend="italic">µtįo;, pars</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and the old or Aeolic form <hi rend="italic">aγt⅛a&gt;</hi>
                    is still to be found. In like manner, <hi rend="italic">βtβoλa</hi> seems, as Dr
                    Moor has observed, to be formed, not from βαλλa∣, but from the old verb βfλλa∣,
                    whence <hi rend="italic">βιλoς,</hi><hi rend="italic">jaculum.</hi></p>
                <p>“3. Although the first preterite, or perfect active, generally follows the
                    analogy of the first future, yet it sometimes, too, observes that of the second.
                    Thus,</p>
                <p>, ∫ not ⅛rtaxα, from βnλω, 1. Fut.</p>
                <p>-r≡λλω makes <hi rend="subscript"> ( bu1</hi>, <hi rend="subscript"> ιβτaλχa1
                    from tfraλi</hi>, <hi rend="subscript"> g Fut</hi> In the same manner, <hi

                    rend="italic">ξω,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>“4. On the other hand, although the second preterite, or perfect middle,
                    generally follows the analogy of the second future, yet it sometimes, too,
                    observes that of the first. Thus, <hi rend="italic">_ ,.</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">f</hi> not <hi rend="italic">tdrr</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">λa,</hi> from <hi rend="italic"
                    >&lt;rraau,</hi> 2. Fut.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> 2πλλ</hi> " makes ļ <hi rend="subscript"> but fr</hi> θ
                    <hi rend="subscript"> m; Fut</hi></p>
                <p>In the same manner, rs∕vw, xnnω, <hi rend="italic">xιιgω, etrtiļw,</hi>
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Nay, from t in the penult, there often arises o in the first preterite, or
                    perfect active. Thus, <hi rend="italic">&lt;xtmμφa,</hi> λ∣λoχα, x«x-λofa,
                    óeao/xoe. from <hi rend="italic">&lt;xιμeros,</hi> λtχω, xλκrrω, <hi
                    rend="italic">iιιiω,</hi> &amp;c. And this seems of old to have been still more
                    frequent, and to have extended also to the passive voice. Thus, <hi
                    rend="italic">µiµoijat, Ttircįåai,</hi> in the old or Aeolic dialect, from <hi
                    rend="italic">µthu</hi> (t. <hi rend="italic">e. μι</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∣</hi><hi rend="italic">ξu)</hi> and <hi rend="italic">σιοΰω.</hi></p>
                <p>“5. In the same manner, although the first aorist generally follows the analogy
                    of the first future, yet it also seems, particularly in the more early periods
                    of the language, to have sometimes followed that of the second future. Thus,
                    χιω, <hi rend="italic">iyta</hi>; so <hi rend="italic">item, r</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">nγ×a,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >nvtixa,</hi> αλeυα- <hi rend="italic">μwoς, ixr</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">a, &amp;c.</hi></p>
                <p>“Since, then, there are in the Greek verb two futures, and two preterites, each
                    of which preterites follows the analogy of either future, and since there are
                    two aorists, and that the first aorist also follows the analogy of either
                    future; would it not, from these facts, be rather probable than otherwise, that
                    the second aorist should also follow the analogy of either future; that, as from
                    rwa) there is formed {rυ&lt;ro&gt;, so from rυ∙ψω there should be formed
                    irvψ&lt;n? And, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193523054" xml:id="kp-eb0710-3054-0699"
                    />if this were admitted, would it not account for such words ' as <hi
                    rend="italic">xaraβ∏mo, touetn, λιξto, iļdio, iitι, hifιτω, aξt-rω, &amp;c.</hi>
                    which have so much perplexed the celebrated Dr Clarke (see Notes on <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> B. 35. E. 109; I. 613), in a manner more satisfactory
                    than is done by the arbitrary method of imagining new presents in -&lt;r⅛∣, from
                    which these forms may be deduced? For it is only to account for such anomalous
                    forms that these new presents have been imagined; and the grammarians would no
                    doubt have assumed imaginary new presents also, to account for such first
                    aorists as tχια, <hi rend="italic">ixr,a,</hi> if, by so doing, these aorists
                    could have been reduced to the usual analogy.</p>
                <p>“Now this supposition, namely, that the <hi rend="italic">second aorist,</hi> as
                    well as the first, follows the analogy of either future, which is thus rendered
                    in some degree probable, has actually taken place, at least in some instances.
                    Thus the compounds of <hi rend="italic">τsμrω,</hi></p>
                <p>from the first future <hi rend="italic">αποτιμώ</hi> has in <hi rend="italic"
                    >τoτιμvω</hi> √ the second aorist part, <hi rend="italic">άποτιμων,</hi> as
                    well</p>
                <p>as from the second fut. <hi rend="italic">άποταμω, άποταμων.</hi></p>
                <p>So ∕ξo&gt;, they came, <hi rend="italic">II.</hi> 23, v. 38; <hi rend="italic"
                    >xanβηβιn, II.</hi> 24, v. 191, both of which follow the analogy of the first
                    futures, viz. <hi rend="italic">iζω</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">ixω,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">venio)</hi> and <hi rend="italic">xaraβη&lt;roμas.</hi> And every
                    person acquainted with the elements of Greek is aware, that, as <hi
                    rend="italic">μnω</hi> is the primary form, whence, by the common reduplication,
                    arises, first, <hi rend="italic">μtμιιω,</hi> and then, dropping the short ι, by
                    what the grammarians call <hi rend="italic">syncope, μιμvω,</hi> and as <hi
                    rend="italic">γms</hi> is the primary form, whence, in like manner, is derived
                    <hi rend="italic">γιγιω</hi> (Latin <hi rend="italic">gigno)</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">yιγnμaι</hi>; so &lt;nra&gt; is the primary form, which, by like
                    reduplication and syncope, gave birth to ¢n¢rr¢u, <hi rend="italic">cado,</hi>
                    from which primary form <hi rend="italic">itirω,</hi> making in the first future
                    <hi rend="italic">&lt;snβω,</hi> there is formed the second aorist “re«», in
                    common use; which, in so far, both illustrates and confirms the foregoing
                    hypothesis.”</p>
                <p>These observations were written about thirty years anterior to the date of their
                    publication in the Edinburgh Transactions (1823), and, of course, before either
                    Villoison’s or Heyné’s editions of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> were
                    published. Subsequently to their appearance. Dr Hunter judged it proper to
                    subjoin some facts contained in these two celebrated editions, together with a
                    few observations suggested by these facts, and tending to confirm the opinion
                    which he had been led to form of the anomalous flexions above mentioned of the
                    Greek verb. The additional illustrations, derived from these sources, together
                    with the critical remarks by which they are accompanied, we shall now place
                    before our readers. (See Edinburgh Transactions, <hi rend="italic">ubi
                    supra.)</hi></p>
                <p>“From the ancient scholia, quoted by Heyné in his observations on the various
                    readings of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> and from the large volume of
                    scholia published by Villoison (as well as from those contained in Barnes’s
                    edition of the poems of Homer, published in 1711), it seems to be clearly
                    established, that, in the days of the Ptolemys, this form of the second aorist,
                    following the analogy of the first future, was more frequent in the writings of
                    Homer than that of the first aorist, formed upon the analogy of the same future;
                    and that it was the reading received and approved by the most eminent of the
                    Alexandrian grammarians, by Zenodotus, the keeper of the Alexandrian library,
                    and by Aristarchus himself.</p>
                <p>“Whilst, however, the Greek scholiasts have recorded these as the ancient and
                    genuine forms used by Homer, they have, I suspect, greatly erred in their manner
                    of accounting for them. After the lapse of so many centuries, these Homeric
                    forms had, in a great measure, become obsolete,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>' ϊ.θΐθ instance, however, of this ancient
                    <hi rend="italic">Homeric second aorist</hi> occurs in Theocritus, and another
                    in Callimachus; and perhaps by an attentive observer more might be
                    found.”</p></note> and the other form, that of the first aorist, had come into
                    general use; and those grammarians could devise no other method of accounting
                    for these old and now obsolete forms, but by imagining <hi rend="italic">new
                    presents</hi> in <hi rend="italic">-βω,</hi> of which they supposed these forms
                    to be the regular imperfects. This manner of solving the difficulty has been
                    implicitly followed by Eustathius, in his Greek Commentary on the Poems of
                    Homer, and (lam sorry to be obliged to add) by my late invaluable friend Lord
                    Monboddo; of whom, and of the <hi rend="italic">dies</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Attici,</hi> now long gone by, in which I enjoyed his learned and elegant
                    society, I never can think but with an indescribable feeling of satisfaction and
                    regret.</p>
                <p>“If, however, we acquiesce in this solution of the difficulty, we must be content
                    to abate somewhat of our admiration of the Greek language, which has been
                    heretofore held to express, with the utmost clearness and precision, all the
                    various and diversified conceptions of the human mind, even to their minutest
                    shades of difference. Indeed, that the Greeks, or any enlightened people, should
                    employ those forms of their verbs as <hi rend="italic">presents,</hi> which were
                    familiar to every ear as appropriate expressions of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >future,</hi> or, as Eustathius often expresses it, should <hi rend="italic"
                    >draw back</hi> the <hi rend="italic">future</hi> to express the <hi
                    rend="italic">present,</hi> is, when duly considered, a supposition in itself so
                    unreasonable, not to say absurd, that it would require better and more
                    conclusive evidence to support it, than has yet been produced. Besides, where
                    was the necessity of such an innovation? what advantage was to be gained by it?
                    The original presents remained in common use. Why then employ the <hi
                    rend="italic">futures, iι&gt;βoμa</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">iξoμaι,</hi> for example, as <hi rend="italic">presents,</hi> when
                    <hi rend="italic">iuω</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ivoμa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∣</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ixω</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ìxoµou,</hi> present forms in common use, would answer the same
                    purpose?</p>
                <p>“There is still another consideration, to which, in a question like this, due
                    weight ought to be given. There is no evidence whatever that those <hi
                    rend="italic">present-futures,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">future-presents,</hi>
                    in <hi rend="italic">-βω</hi> and <hi rend="italic">-eoµas,</hi> ever existed.
                    They are not to be found in the poems of Homer or Hesiod. They are not to be
                    found in the Greek authors posterior to Homer and Hesiod; and of Greek authors
                    prior to the age of Homer and Hesiod we know absolutely nothing.</p>
                <p>“From these considerations, it seems to be evident that the existence of these
                    <hi rend="italic">future-presents</hi> is merely a gratuitous assumption of
                    grammarians, to account for the Homeric forms <hi rend="italic">βf</hi><hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">This,</hi> however, the learned Dr
                    Clarke had too much acuteness and good sense to admit; and, accordingly, we find
                    him regarding these presents as altogether <hi rend="italic">fictitious.</hi>
                    His words on the passage '∩; ⅛α <hi rend="italic">φomιβat, aπ∙.3r</hi><hi

                    when <hi rend="italic">βηιnτo, or</hi> any of its compounds, occurs, his general
                    practice is to substitute the form of the first aorist, <hi rend="italic"
                    >βη&lt;raro.</hi> But, even if it would remove the difficulty, this change is
                    unauthorized. The other form in <hi rend="italic">-in</hi> is attested as
                    genuine by the Alexandrian grammarians, is supported by the Greek scholiasts, by
                    the ancient manuscripts of the highest authority, and by the early editions. In
                    Villoison’s edition of the Iliad, which bears to be an exact transcript of a
                    manuscript of the tenth century, in the library of St Mark at Venice, the form
                    is uniformly <hi rend="italic">-tn,</hi> except in a single instance, and in
                    that one instance I suspect <hi rend="italic">-an</hi> to be an error of the
                    press.</p>
                <p>“Dr Clarke, however, soon finds that this change of -sro into -are, violent and
                    unauthorized as it is, will not remove the difficulty. In the address of Diomede

                <p>which he attempts to account for in this manner: ‘ Videtur mihi <hi rend="italic"

                    more strongly the difficulty which Dr Clarke must have fielt in accounting for
                    these forms, than that he is here obliged to have recourse to another gratuitous
                    assumption of an imperative of the future, a thing unheard of before; and almost
                    to admit <hi rend="italic">ňusoµai</hi> as a present, from which to deduce <hi
                    rend="italic">lδuβtn</hi> as an imperfect. The fact is, that he found the
                    authorities in favour of <hi rend="italic">δuβtn</hi> and ε0⅛&lt;rεro to be so
                    numerous, and of such weight, that he did not venture, in these examples, to
                    change <hi rend="italic">-tn</hi> into <hi rend="italic">-an.</hi></p>
                <p>“Afterwards, however, he found himself obliged to abandon this hypothesis of an
                    imperative of the future, as well as his original position, that these new
                    presents in -σa and <hi rend="italic">-st&gt;μa</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi> are
                    imaginary; and he appears at last (he or his son, it is uncertain which) to
                    adopt, in its full extent, the explanation given by Eustathius. That
                    commentator, whose remarks would have been invaluable had his taste and judgment
                    been equal to his means of information, if I rightly understand him, has this
                    observation on v. 154 of the 20th book of the Odyssey: ‘ <hi rend="italic"

                    partial and unsatisfactory. As the facts to be accounted for are all similar,
                    the true solution must be <hi rend="italic">general,</hi> and such as will
                    embrace them all. Whether the method which f have ventured to suggest be of this
                    description, does not belong to me to determine. It possesses at least this
                    indispensable requisite, that it accounts for all the phenomena in question.</p>
                <p>“It would be tiresome to enter upon a particular examination of every individual
                    verb of the kind which we are considering. It may not be improper, however, to
                    select one example for the purpose of illustration.</p>
                <p>“There are not many verbs of more frequent occurrence in Homer than <hi

                    times in Homer; and, in not one of these instances, can it by any sophistry be
                    tortured into a <hi rend="italic">present,</hi> or forced into an expression of
                    <hi rend="italic">present time,</hi> in the sense in which present time is
                    generally understood. I shall note the places of occurrence, that any person
                    may, if he chuses, examine them, and judge for himself. They are these: <hi

                    And yet a new present, <hi rend="italic">iξω,</hi> is equally necessary in this,

                <p>“Nor is there a single unequivocal example of the first aorist of this verb to be
                    found in the poems either of Homer or of Hesiod, except one, viz. <hi
                    rend="italic">iξaς,</hi> which occurs in the Hymn to Apollo, v. 223. In that
                    same hymn, however, there are no fewer than four examples of the form in <hi
                    rend="italic">-o&gt; (iξw),</hi> and another still in the Hymn to Mercury, v.
                    398.</p>
                <p>“This instance of <hi rend="italic">iξw,</hi> so frequent in Homer, may therefore
                    be fairly admitted to be, in the language of the celebrated Bacon, an <hi

                    the true method of accounting for all the other Homeric forms of the same
                    description. If so, there will no longer be any necessity for the gratuitous
                    assumption of new presents in <hi rend="italic">-βa&gt;</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">-soμaι,</hi> to account for these forms; nor for supposing, with
                    Dr Clarke, that <hi rend="italic">xaraβηβu</hi> is an imperative of the <hi
                    rend="italic">future</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> nor for changing, as he has
                    generally done, the second aoriste <hi rend="italic">βηβtn, xaraβr</hi><hi

                    second aorists in <hi rend="italic">-tn,</hi> recognised as the genuine readings
                    by the grammarians of Alexandria, and the Greek scholiasts, and confirmed by the
                    ancient manuscripts of highest authority, and the early editions.</p>
                <p>“If the view which I have ventured to give of these Homeric forms in -ιrs be well
                    founded, it will hardly be necessary to notice the canon of criticism attempted
                    to be established by the learned Heyné, in his voluminous edition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> as to <hi rend="smallcaps">-eto</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">-an,</hi> and the reasons for preferring the one to the other in
                    particular passages. Of the futility of that attempt every classical scholar who
                    will read with sufficient attention the last seventeen verses of the third book
                    of the Odyssey, will be fully convinced. The learned German has adopted, without
                    scruple or hesitation, the explanation of these Homeric forms given by the Greek
                    scholiasts; and, in allusion, I presume, to the difficulty felt by Dr Clarke, in
                    admitting the existence of new presents in <hi rend="italic">-sa&gt;</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">-βoμaι,</hi> he states his opinion, and the grounds of it,
                    with decisive confidence, in the following words: “Esse autem talem formam

                    he makes the following remark, not quite consistent with itself: ‘ Quid hoc loco
                    intersit, non video; nisi quod <hi rend="italic">aitiβrμnn</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >antiquioris vocis</hi> speciem habet: <hi rend="italic">nova</hi><hi

                    et alia.’ How the <hi rend="italic">nova forma</hi> should have <hi
                    rend="italic">antiquioris vocis speciem,</hi> I do not clearly comprehend. But a
                    gleam of truth will sometimes burst through the darkness of inveterate
                    prejudice.”</p>
                <p>These views, which to most persons will probably appear to carry their own
                    evidence along with them, have, however, had the misfortune to incur the
                    disapprobation and censure of Professor Dunbar, who, in his very meritorious
                    work on the Greek and Latin languages (p. 188, <hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">seqq.</hi> Edinburgh, 1827, in 8vo), has treated “one of the most
                    acute scholars and grammarians of the present day” (these are his own words)
                    with far less consideration than might have been expected from such an
                    admission, and who contradicts speculations which it is impossible to refute, in
                    a peremptory tone, neither called for by the subject itself, nor much in keeping
                    with the courtesy <pb break="no" facs="nls:193523080"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-3080-0701"/>that usually obtains amongst men of letters. It
                    may not ' be improper or unnecessary, therefore, to show,’ by a few examples,
                    that the critical strictures of Professor Dunbar are as deficient in point of
                    accuracy, as his mode of expressing himself is, we are sorry to say, wanting in
                    that respect which is due to the venerable age and to the great attainments
                    of“the most acute scholar and grammarian” of his time.</p>
                <p>1. After citing the greater part of the fifth paragraph of the first quotation
                    above introduced, Mr Dunbar observes, “Dr Hunter then gives as an example the
                    compound verb <hi rend="italic">à¶artµvu,</hi> from the first future of which,
                    says he, comes the second aorist participle <hi rend="italic">åvronµw,</hi> as
                    well as from the second future <hi rend="italic">aroraμω, airoraµon. Where Dr
                    Hunter found, the second aorist participle</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >άτοημων,</hi><hi rend="italic">I do not know, as I never observed it;</hi> the
                    other form, dworaμw, occurs often in the Greek authors." Now, it will not be
                    very difficult to show where Dr Hunter found cùrenµaiv, or at least sufficient
                    authority for employing it, and where Mr Dunbar might have made the discovery.
                    In the <hi rend="italic">Cyropoedia</hi> of Xenophon (lib. v. c. 2, 1. 29),
                    there is the following passage :—’ Αλλα rouς <hi rend="italic">µm àŴHŨora;

                    >r.</hi> λ. for a reason which will be obvious to every scholar, we abstain from
                    translating this passage, in which Gobryas describes the treatment to which a
                    certain ancient lover of surgery was in the habit of subjecting some of his boon
                    companions. But as we have here ∙ξmμ∙, the participle of which is iξsrtμω*, it
                    is difficult to conceive why Mr Dunbar should proscribe α%oπμs, or at least <hi
                    rend="italic">àmriµun,</hi> which only differs from the word employed by
                    Xenophon in having the preposition <hi rend="italic">àsn</hi> instead of the
                    preposition <hi rend="italic">ix or tξ</hi> prefixed to it. ’ Airorιμκr means
                    <hi rend="italic">to cut away</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cut off; iξιnμtiv</hi>
                    signifies <hi rend="italic">to cut</hi><hi rend="italic">mit,</hi> or, in other
                    words, indicates a somewhat more radical and complete form of the operation. If
                    it be good Greek to use such a form of the verb as <hi rend="italic"
                    >iξιτι-μιo,</hi> it can scarcely, we should imagine, be bad Greek to employ <hi
                    rend="italic">àmrtµtio,</hi> the same verb, in the same tense, varied only in
                    its sense by the preposition prefixed.</p>
                <p>2. “I am, however, <hi rend="italic">decidedly</hi> of opinion,” continues Mr
                    Dunbar, “that no first aorist was ever formed from a second future; and in the
                    examples which the doctor has given, <hi rend="italic">he has assumed what never
                    existed"</hi> Here again the learned professor cuts a little before the point;
                    for the “assumption” on which Dr Hunter has grounded his ingenious solution of
                    these apparent anomalies, so far from being gratuitous and unauthorized, as Mr
                    Dunbar asserts, is distinctly countenanced by Apollonius of Alexandria, whom
                    Priscian calls <hi rend="italic">summus auctor artis grammatica,</hi> and Mr
                    Harris, in his <hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> describes as “the most acute
                    author that ever wrote on grammar.” In his treatise <hi rend="italic">De
                    Syntaxi</hi> (lib. i. c. 36, p. 76), this learned and acute grammarian, speaking
                    of imperatives, says,</p>
                <p>“Quid est igitur cur non ridiculi existimentur, qui negant esse verba imperativa

                <p>From what is here stated by Apollonius, particularly if it be taken in connection
                    with other parts of his work, to which reference is expressly made by him, and
                    in which his views are more fully explained, it appears that, according to this
                    learned grammarian, the circumstance which has misled those who admit
                    imperatives of the fiiture is the occurrence of such forms as <hi rend="italic"
                    >γξa∙⅛trω</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lift</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that <hi
                    rend="italic">γpa∙↑aτω</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bβι,</hi> though used, <hi

                    undergoing any change in point of <hi rend="italic">time,</hi> but merely as
                    variations in the form of expression, and perfectly equivalent in their effect
                    <hi rend="italic">(non</hi><hi rend="italic">diverso</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tempore, sed</hi><hi rend="italic">dilectu</hi><hi rend="italic">verbi, quod,
                    utraque voce</hi><hi rend="italic">velis, recte profertur)</hi>; that, in short,
                    between ∕jαψsrw and <hi rend="italic">γgaψaτω, iγga∙ψ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∣</hi><hi rend="italic">i</hi> and b ’ f≈∙ψ-αj, there is no difference whatever
                    in point of <hi rend="italic">time (nullum</hi><hi rend="italic">discrimen
                    temporis),</hi> but only in the writing: and that those verbal forms which Mr
                    Dunbar has arbitrarily denominated imperfects, are truly aorists in the
                    strictest acceptation of the term. With regard to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ratio</hi><hi rend="italic">probabilis</hi> here alluded to as explained in the
                    chapter on Verbs, though it is not very clearly developed by the Alexandrian
                    grammarian, it seems, in effect, to be nearly the same with the principle so
                    distinctly brought out by Dr Hunter; namely, that the second aorist, as well as
                    the first, follows the analogy of either future, and that, in some instances at
                    least, second aorists have been formed upon the analogy of the first future, as
                    stated by Dr Hunter. Mr Dunbar, however, is “decidedly of opinion" that no
                    second aorist was ever formed from the first future, and conversely; in other
                    words, he is at issue with Apollonius, who states facts to the contrary, as well
                    as with Dr Hunter, who unfolds the only principle on which these facts can be
                    accounted for, consistently with the genius and idiom of the Greek language.</p>
                <p>3. Professor Dunbar proceeds thus: “The whole <hi rend="italic">mistake</hi> has
                    arisen from not considering, or <hi rend="italic">not knowing,</hi> the genuine
                    form of the second future. But, says Dr Hunter, how are we to account for such
                    forms as <hi rend="italic">xaraZnβn,</hi> iownro, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >ojao,</hi><hi rend="italic">list, iξ&lt;n,</hi> and some others, if these are
                    not to be considered as second aorists derived from first futures; because no
                    person can show that the futures of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193523093"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-3093-0702"/>such verbs were ever employed as presents? I hope
                    to be able to prove, both from <hi rend="italic">example» and analogy,</hi> thaï
                    the old established opinion, viz. that the futures of certain verbs, whose
                    original presents had become obsolete, were sometimes used as presents, and that
                    those forms which the doctor supposes to be second aorists, were imperfects, <hi
                    rend="italic">used, however, as aorists,</hi> i. e. <hi rend="italic">with
                    indefinite</hi><hi rend="italic">time?'</hi> We shall have occasion immediately
                    to examine some of the “examples” and “analogies” by means of which the learned
                    professor labours to establish his position. It will be sufficient here to
                    advert to the confusion of ideas which reigns in the passage we have just cited.
                    How, says Dr Hunter, can you account for such forms as <hi rend="italic"
                    >xaraβnmo, ìiusvro, òįfte, òiffi, iξm,</hi> and the like, if they are not to be
                    considered as second aorists formed on the analogy of the first futures of the
                    verbs to which they belong? Perfectly, responds Mr Dunbar; they are neither
                    first nor second aorists (Apollonius, as we have just seen, thought otherwise),
                    but only <hi rend="italic">imperfects,</hi> “used, however, <hi rend="italic">as
                    aorists,"</hi> and performing all the functions of these particular verbal
                    forms; that is, they are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> aorists, but imperfects,
                    which imperfects, however, <hi rend="italic">are in reality</hi> aorists. Nor is
                    even this all. The learned professor, misled apparently by the literal meaning
                    of the term, is betrayed into an entire misconception in regard to the <hi
                    rend="italic">time</hi> indicated by the aorist, which he considers as
                    “indefinite.” He could not easily have committed a greater mistake, as has
                    already been shown in treating of the verb. The <hi rend="italic">time</hi> of
                    the aorist, strictly considered, is <hi rend="italic">absolute past,</hi> and if
                    it ever <hi rend="italic">appear to</hi> be “indefinite,” as it unquestionably
                    in some instances does, that arises, not from any vagueness or uncertainty in
                    the tense itself, but from an <hi rend="italic">inference</hi> drawn by the mind
                    from those particular predications which it is employed to express. Thus, όλ/yo¢
                    χgow{ ra¢ r*w <hi rend="italic">φαύλων</hi><hi rend="italic">euv¶ùnai
                    inauβi,</hi> “A short time <hi rend="italic">dissolved</hi> (or <hi
                    rend="italic">did dissolve)</hi> the associations of bad men.” This is all that
                    the words actually express. But, as we know from experience that the laws of
                    nature, moral as well as physical, are uniform, we <hi rend="italic">infer</hi>
                    that what occurred <hi rend="italic">formerly,</hi> happens <hi rend="italic"
                    >now,</hi> and will take place <hi rend="italic">hereafter</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and hence, by an easy and gradual coalition of the secondary inference
                    with the primary and invariable signification of the verb, we come at length to
                    say that “a short time <hi rend="italic">always dissolves</hi> the associations
                    of the wicked.” The expression in Scripture, 'Oι∕roς <hi rend="italic">ten
                    i</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> İm; ijmj</hi><hi rend="italic">0.γa.'rr,πς

                    version, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am <hi rend="italic">always well
                    pleased”</hi> and all others of a similar description, are to be resolved and
                    explained upon precisely the same principle.</p>
                <p>4. In rejecting Dr Hunter’s solution, which proceeds upon ascertained and
                    determinate <hi rend="italic">data,</hi> Professor Dunbar adopts one which he
                    admits to be <hi rend="italic">purely imaginary.</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">I</hi> believe,” says he, “the present of <hi rend="italic"

                    in the language,</hi> because it must have been the same in appearance and sound

                    >:</hi><hi rend="italic">φtgω</hi> is commonly used instead of it. But Pindar,
                    in his fourth Pythian Ode (v. 181), employs <hi rend="italic">o!eι</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">&gt; as a present.</hi></p>

                    rend="italic">I say that I obtain instruction from Chiron,”</hi> &amp;c. In this
                    passage Professor Dunbar appears to have committed several mistakes. Without
                    adverting to his contradictory expressions in regard to <hi rend="italic"
                    >dβω,</hi> we may observe, in the first place, that if Pindar had really
                    employed ω&lt;rs∕v here “as a present,” the language which he puts into the
                    mouth of Jason would, upon that supposition, have conveyed a statement contrary
                    to the fact. Jason, it is true, was educated by Chiron; but long before the
                    period referred to in this passage, his education had been <hi rend="italic"
                    >concluded;</hi> and there is nothing said to warrant the assumption that, on
                    his return from the Argonautic expedition, which is celebrated in this ode, he
                    had resumed his studies under the Centaur, and was, at the time of speaking,
                    actually “obtaining” or receiving “instruction from Chiron.” He had no doubt,
                    according to his own statement, been to visit that famous personage; but his
                    object, as we shall presently show, was not for the purpose of being taught,
                    instructed, or educated by Chiron <hi rend="italic">(that</hi> had been
                    accomplished long before), but to obtain <hi rend="italic">information</hi> from
                    the Centaur to enable him to make good his claims, which, it seems, had been
                    disputed. Adjured to speak the truth, Jason accordingly says, “I <hi
                    rend="italic">will relate</hi> what I have learned <hi rend="italic"
                    >(òibu¢-</hi><hi rend="italic">xaaιav)</hi> from Chiron: for I have just come
                    from the cave near Chariclo and Philyrae and, in conformity with this
                    declaration, he proceeds to state the substance of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >information</hi> he had obtained from the Centaur respecting his rights. In
                    what follows there is not a word said respecting “instruction" or education. The
                    narrative of Jason relates to a subject of more immediate interest to him, one
                    indeed in regard to which he had engaged that he would <hi rend="italic"
                    >produce</hi><hi rend="italic">(iιβιιv)</hi><hi rend="italic">what he had
                    learned (iuiiaoxaajav) from Chiron</hi> during the visit to his cave, and tell
                    nothing except on the authority of his old master, or in accordance with the <hi
                    rend="italic">information</hi> which he had received from him. In our view,
                    therefore, the common interpretation of this passage, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Institutus</hi><hi rend="italic">sum</hi><hi rend="italic">a Chirone,</hi> is
                    erroneous, notwithstanding it has been adopted by so distinguished a scholar as
                    Heyné, who conceives <hi rend="italic">0</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ba,β×aλ</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">av</hi>
                    Xs/jtone; <hi rend="italic">tient</hi> equivalent to ⅛aαχi⅞ra∕ ∙ταjα <hi
                    rend="italic">Xιιgωκ&gt;(.</hi> But, however this may be, it is evident from the
                    words here quoted, that the celebrated German scholar does not consider <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">t</hi> “as a present” tense; and that,
                    whether our interpretation of the passage be right or wrong, Heyné, in adopting
                    the ordinary one, has distinctly corroborated the view which we have taken of
                    <hi rend="italic">iιeto.</hi></p>
                <p>But, not to dwell longer on this, other examples of the nature of <hi
                    rend="italic">instantiae</hi><hi rend="italic">crucis</hi> may be produced to
                    disprove Mr Dunbar’s assertion that <hi rend="italic">ωβt&gt;</hi> is used “as a
                    present.” In the ninth Pythian Ode of Pindar (1.104) we meet with the following
                    passage :—</p>
                <p>Tu£h τ&lt;i^3β <hi rend="italic">τtζιrΛ</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">, if κλυrβt,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">'E¢ąã?</hi><hi rend="italic

                    fAΛTtζ9g</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> ’ OI2EΓ.</p>
                <p>In this sentence, if <hi rend="italic">iιβt</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi> be a <hi
                    rend="italic">present,</hi> as Mr Dunbar contends, how is its <hi rend="italic"
                    >time</hi> to be reconciled with that of πξtra∕p If the learned professor be
                    right, Pindar has, in this case at least, been guilty of a gross anachronism.
                    Again, in the seventh book of the Iliad (1. 81), Hector says, ’ E,Jl »’ 1y∙, <hi
                    rend="italic">rn</hi> iλ∙&gt;, iţ. <hi rend="italic">il</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    >iaaraι,.</hi></p>
                <p>“Sin ego illum <hi rend="italic">interfecero,</hi> dederitque mihi gloriam
                    Apollo, arma detracta <hi rend="smallcaps">feram</hi> ad Ilium sacrum, et <hi
                    rend="italic">suspendam</hi> ad templum Apollinis longe jaculantis “But if I
                    shall be fortunate enough to slay him, and Apollo give me the glory of such a
                    victory, <hi rend="italic">then,</hi> having stripped him of his arms, <hi
                    rend="italic">I will carry</hi> them to sacred Ilium, and will hang them up at
                    the temple of the far-darting Apollo." By no sophistry can the verb o⅛w in this
                    passage be tortured into a present; and the same observation equally applies to
                    <hi rend="italic">ùsu</hi> in the foregoing extract from Pindar. But if w⅛ω be a
                    first future, as it undoubtedly is, can it for a moment be doubted that o⅛s is
                    an aorist formed upon the analogy of that future; and if so, is it not clear
                    that, in some instances at least, the second aorist follows the analogy of the
                    first future?</p>
