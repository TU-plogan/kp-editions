                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">GLAUBER, <hi rend="smallcaps">John Rodolph</hi></label>, a
                    German chemist, born at the commencement of the sixteenth century, was one of
                    those who were most ardently occupied with “the great work,” namely, the
                    discovery of the philosopher’s stone. Full of love and enthusiasm for the
                    marvellous, he abandoned himself without reserve to the extravagant ideas which
                    then prevailed in chemistry. His long and painful labours, pursued with
                    indefatigable perseverance, and an energy worthy of a nobler object, were almost
                    always directed towards the discovery of the panacea, the philosopher’s stone,
                    and other chimeras with which the alchymists amused the imagination. Infatuated
                    with the doctrine of the adepts, he may be said to have passed his life over
                    alembics and furnaces, and, in fact, he is regarded as a second Paracelsus. Not
                    less presumptuous than his model, he boasted of the discovery of several
                    wonderful secrets. Whether he was truly convinced of the reality <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193521533" xml:id="kp-eb0710-1533-0582"/>of his inventions, or
                    whether, like empirics of all classes, he proposed to profit by the ignorance
                    and blind credulity of men, he had the art to seduce many persons by promises as
                    vain as they were exaggerated. He is even reproached with having carried on a
                    vile traffic in pretended secrets, which he sometimes sold at an exorbitant
                    price to different individuals, and afterwards published with his name in order
                    to enhance his reputation. Devoid of the instruction and force of mind necessary
                    to enable him to deduce just inferences from the numerous experiments which he
                    had performed with ability and address, Glauber only attained a subaltern or
                    secondary rank amongst the chemists. But he, nevertheless, discovered several
                    important facts, which have materially contributed to make better known certain
                    salts and some metals, which, eventually, had a marked influence on the progress
                    of chemistry and materia medica. Thus, in examining the residue of the
                    decomposition of sea-salt by the sulphuric acid, this laborious chemist
                    discovered the sulphate of soda, to which his name is irrevocably attached under
                    the denomination of Glauber’s Salt. His writings on dry baths and sulphurous
                    fumigations entitle him, in certain respects, to be regarded as the inventor of
                    confined vapour baths, which have been latterly brought forward as a new
                    discovery; and he is equally the inventor of several chemical medicaments, the
                    use of which is still preserved in most of the pharmacopoeias. We are also
                    indebted to him for a great number of works (thirty in alD, an exact list of
                    which may be found in the curious article entitled Glauber, in the fourth volume
                    of Adelung’s <hi rend="italic">History of Human Folly.</hi> A collection of them
                    was printed in several volumes 8vo, and in two volumes 4to, at Frankfort, 1658,
                    1659, and translated into English by Pack, London, 1689, in folio. Of these the
                    principal are, 1. <hi rend="italic">Deutschlands Wallfahrt,</hi> or Prosperity
                    of Germany, Amsterdam, 1656, often reprinted; 2. <hi rend="italic">Fumi
                    Nσυi</hi><hi rend="italic">Philosophici,</hi> or Description of a new Method of
                    Distilling, Amsterdam, 1648, in 8vo, translated into French by Duteil, Paris,
                    1659, in 8vo; 3. De Medicina Universali, sive de Auro potabili vero, Amsterdam,
                    1658, in 8vo;</p>
                <p>4. Miraculum Mundi, Amsterdam, 1653, in 8vo; 5. Pharmacopoeia Spagyrica,
                    Amsterdam, 1654, in 8vo; 6. De Tartaro ex Vini foecibus, 1655, in 8vo; 7.
                    Dissertatio Medica Hermetica et Catholica magni Naturae magiste-rialis Mysterii,
                    Frankfort, 1656, in 8vo; 8. Consolation of Navigators, Amsterdam, 1659, in 8vo;
                    9. Opus Minerale, Amsterdam, 1651, in 8vo; 10. De Elia Artiste, Amsterdam, 1668,
                    in 8vo. Glauber published many other alchy-mical productions, which are neither
                    less obscure nor less enigmatical than the preceding, and in which vague
                    hypotheses and chimerical conceptions supply the place of facts and of
                    reasoning. All his works are in German; and although most of them have the first
                    words of the title in Latin, there is good ground for believing that Glauber did
                    not understand that language. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
