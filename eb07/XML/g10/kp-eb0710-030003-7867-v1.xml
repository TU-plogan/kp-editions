                    founders of the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">des Savons,</hi>
                    was born at Paris on the ∏th of June 1632. From his infancy he evinced a strong
                    inclination for learning, which his father, an advocate in the parliament,
                    cultivated with the greatest care. Having embraced the ecclesiastical state, he
                    turned his studies towards theology, and at the same time endeavoured to perfect
                    himself in the knowledge of Greek and of Hebrew, that he might be able to read
                    the sacred books in the originals; he also devoted his leisure hours to
                    literature and the sciences; and as he was endowed with an excellent memory, as
                    well as a sound judgment, his different acquisitions arranged themselves without
                    confusion or disorder in his mind. To learning equally solid and various he
                    joined the talent, then rare among scholars, of writing his mother tongue with
                    precision and elegance; and hence no one could be better qualified than he for
                    conducting a work having for its object to make known the literary and
                    scientific productions of other nations. Such was the object of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">des Savons;</hi> and as the
                    privilege had been withdrawn from Sallo, on the complaints of some writers whom
                    he had censured with too great bitterness, Colbert bestowed it on the Abbé
                    Gallois in 1666. The latter had the sole charge of this journal till 1674, when
                    the amount of labour which it imposed, and his other avocations, forced him to
                    abandon it altogether. Colbert, who had appreciated the merit of Gallois, gave
                    him at first an apartment in his hôtel, and afterwards, during his journeys to
                    Versailles, intrusted it entirely to his care. It has been alleged that this
                    great minister desired to leant Latin, and that he retained the Abbé Gallois<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193517880?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7880-0301"/> for
                    the purpose of instructing him in that language. But, however this may be, it is
                    certain that, while Colbert lived, Gallois enjoyed the highest favour, although
                    he never took advantage of it to promote his own advancement or fortune. On the
                    contrary, he was singularly moderate and disinterested; the only benefice he
                    possessed was the abbey of Corres, the revenue of which was so small that he
                    resigned it because it had become chargeable to him, and never thought of asking
                    another. But if he was careless of all that concerned himself, none was more
                    active or more indefatigable in soliciting assistance for unfortunate men of
                    letters. It is believed that it was he who gave to the minister the plan of the
                    Academy of Inscriptions, although he did not become a member; but he had been
                    admitted into the Academy of Sciences in 1668, and in 1673 he filled the place
                    of Bourzéis in the French Academy, being admitted the same day with Fléchier and
                    Racine. After the death of his illustrious protector, he obtained the place of
                    keeper of the king’s library; and, some years afterwards, when he lost this
                    situation, he was, by way of compensation, appointed professor of the Greek
                    language in the Royal College. After the remodelling of the Academy of Sciences,
                    he was placed in the class of geometry; and he then proposed to publish the
                    treatise of Pappus, of which there only existed a defective Latin translation;
                    but this design was not carried into execution. The Abbé Gallois died on the
                    19th of April 1707, in the fifty-seventh year of his age. Notwithstanding the
                    extreme mediocrity of his fortune, he had collected more than twelve thousand
                    choice volumes, a catalogue of which was printed in 1710. Besides his
                    contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Satans,</hi> the Abbé Gallois wrote, 1. Traduction Latine du Traité de Paix des
                    Pyrenées, Paris, 1659, in fol.; 2. Remarques sur le projet de l’Histoire de
                    France, dressé par Ducange, printed in the new edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliothèque Historique de France,</hi> tome iii.; 3. Réponse à l’écrit de
                    David Gregory, touchant les lignes appelées Robervalliennes, qui servent á
                    transformer les figures, Mém. de l’Acad. des Sciences, 1692; with some others of
                    less note. The éloge of Gallois was pronounced by Fontenelle. <hi
