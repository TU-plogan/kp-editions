                <p>HISTORY OF THE SCIENCE.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> properties of bodies may be resolved into two
                    classes; one comprehending those which belong to all bodies whatsoever, and
                    another, such as belong only to particular bodies. Amongst the properties of the
                    first class we may consider extension, magnitude, figure, divisibility,
                    impenetrability, inertia, weight, mobility, &amp;c. Some of those of the second
                    are solidity, liquidity, transparency, and the like. Of these properties, <hi
                    rend="italic">extension, magnitude, figure,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >divisibility,</hi> are the subject of Geometry. The discussion of other
                    properties of body belongs to Physics, called also Natural Philosophy</p>
                <p>The objects of geometry having been continually presented to the human mind, and
                    being of such a nature as could at all times be perfectly comprehended, it may
                    be supposed that the science would in some form or other exist from the very
                    beginning of society. Indeed there is a natural geometry which all possess, and
                    which must have been employed in the divisions of property and the erection of
                    dwellings in every age. The name of the science indeed indicates its origin, for
                    it is derived from <hi rend="italic">γιωμ,ιrξia,</hi> the science of
                    land-measuring.</p>
                <p>According to the testimony of Herodotus, the science was first cultivated in
                    Egypt. He had been informed at Memphis and Thebes, that Sesostris the king had
                    divided the lands amongst his subjects, giving to each an allotment, for which
                    an annual tribute was to be paid. The overflowing of the Nile, however,
                    disturbed the landmarks, and rendered it necessary to re-adjust them by
                    measurement; and hence the origin of geometry, which in the course of time
                    passed from Egypt into Greece. There are two things to be here noticed; the
                    assertion of a verification depending on geometry, and the particular opinion of
                    Herodotus as to the origin of the science. If, as some chronologers have
                    supposed, Sesostris be the same as the King Sesac, or Shi-shac, who made war on
                    Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, it would follow from Herodotus, that geometry had
                    its origin not more than about a thousand years before the Christian era. It
                    might, however, be earlier; for the operation of measuring the land indicated a
                    science which had made some progress. Aristotle has attributed the invention of
                    geometry to the Egyptian priests, who, living secluded from the world, had
                    leisure for study· But however this might be, all ancient writers are agreed in
                    giving the Egyptians the credit of having been the earliest cultivators of
                    geometry.</p>
                <p>The philosopher Thales, who lived 640 years before Christ, brought the sciences,
                    and particularly mathematics, into Greece from Egypt, whither he had gone in
                    quest of knowledge at an advanced period of life. Diogenes Laertius relates that
                    he there measured the height of the obelisks by means of their shadows; and
                    Plutarch says, that this display of skill in geometry astonished the king
                    Amasis. This shows that the Egyptians had not then advanced far in geometrical
                    knowledge. Proclus also has recorded that Thales, by geometrical principles,
                    determined the distance of vessels remote from the shore. On his return to
                    Greece he founded the Ionian school, so called from Ionia, his native country.
                    His celebrity for learning excited the attention of his countrymen, and drew to
                    him disciples.</p>
                <p>There appears to have been some slight traces of geometry in Greece at a still
                    earlier period. We allude to the geometrical construction of a triangle by
                    Euphorbus of Phrygia, and the discovery of some properties of figures. These,
                    however, were probably just the natural geometry common to all ages. The rule
                    and compasses, most important instruments, have been referred to the ages of
                    fable, the honour of the invention of the latter having been ascribed to the
                    nephew of Daedalus, and that of the square and level to Theodorus of Samos, one
                    of the architects of the temple of Ephesus. But there are no certain indications
                    of geometry as a science before Thales. He laid its foundation in Greece, and
                    infused into his countrymen a taste for the science. He is said to have applied
                    a circle to the measurement of angles, and to have discovered various properties
                    of triangles, by comparing them one with another. In particular, he discovered
                    the important proposition that all angles in a semicircle are right angles, a
                    discovery which greatly delighted him, and for which he expressed his gratitude
                    to the Muses by a sacrifice. Proclus has recorded that he made many discoveries
                    in the science, which, however, have gone to the common stock of geometrical
                    knowledge that had accumulated before Euclid collected it into a system, and the
                    authors of which are unknown. It is probable that the greater part of the
                    disciples of Thales were geometers, but few of their names have descended to us.
                    Ameristus and Anaximander are the only ones now known. Of the former we only
                    know that he was a skilful geometer. The latter wrote a kind of elementary
                    treatise or introduction to geometry, the earliest work of the kind that is
                    known to have existed.</p>
                <p>Thales was succeeded in his school by Anaximander, who is said to have invented
                    the sphere, the gnomon, and geographical charts. These required a considerable
                    knowledge of geometrical science. It has been said that he attempted the grand
                    practical geometrical problem of measuring the magnitude of the earth. This
                    probably has originated in his being the inventor of representations of its
                    surface. The honour of being the first to measure the earth seems to belong to
                    another. Anaximander was followed by Anaximenes, born at Miletus 540 years <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> He is said to have invented sun-dials, and thus must
                    have known both astronomy and geometry; indeed a desire to understand the former
                    would prove a strong stimulus to the study of the latter. He had as his disciple
                    and successor Anaxagoras, who being persecuted for his opinions, employed
                    himself in prison in trying to square the circle. This is the first notice on
                    record of an attempt to resolve what appears now to be an insoluble problem, on
                    which no modern geometer will spend his time. It might, however, have a very
                    different aspect to the ancient mathematicians.</p>
                <p>Pythagoras, born about 580 years <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi> was one of the
                    greatest men of antiquity. According to some he was a Tuscan, whilst others say
                    he was a Tyrian; but his name is better known than his origin. At the age of
                    eighteen he became the disciple of Thales, and imbibed deeply his opinion of the
                    importance of temperance and economy of time as necessary to success in the
                    study of philosophy. In the infancy of science knowledge was only to be acquired
                    by travel, the men of different countries standing in the place of our modern
                    books as the depositories of learning. Pythagoras visited Phoenicia, Chaldea,
                    and India. In the annals of this last country the remembrance of the
                    philosophical traveller is still preserved. He afterwards went into Egypt, where
                    he is said to have remained twenty-two years, holding intercourse with the
                    priests. The long duration of his abode is not probable, as the knowledge he
                    seems to have acquired did not correspond to so protracted a residence. Whilst
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193519466" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9466-0423"/>in Egypt, he
                    is said to have consulted the columns of Sothis, on which that celebrated person
                    had inscribed the principles of geometry. He returned to Samos, his adopted
                    country, and there opened his school; but not finding auditors, he removed to
                    Italy, and took up his abode in Cortona, a town in the territory of Tarentum,
                    where he found many disciples, and acquired a great reputation. He is said to
                    have discovered the important theorem in geometry, that in a right-angled
                    triangle the squares on the sides containing the right angle are together equal
                    to the square on the side opposite to it; and on this account he is said to have
                    sacrificed an hundred oxen in gratitude to the Muses. The sacrifice is probably
                    a fable. The shedding of blood was contrary to his moral principles, and so many
                    oxen were not likely to be at the disposal of a philosopher. In his school,
                    geometry made great progress, and was augmented by several new theories, such as
                    that of the incommensurability of certain lines, in particular that of the side
                    of a square to its diagonal. The theory of the regular solids had its origin
                    also in the Pythagorean school, a doctrine which requires an extensive knowledge
                    of geometry. This subject, now neglected amidst the riches of modem mathematics,
                    because of its small utility, was in the beginning of great importance, on
                    account of other discoveries which must have been incidentally made in its
                    prosecution. Diogenes Laertius has attributed to Pythagoras the discovery that
                    of all figures having the same boundary, the circle among plane figures, and the
                    sphere among solids, are the most capacious. If this was so (a thing doubtfuD,
                    he is the first on record who considered isoperimetrical problems.</p>
                <p>The Pythagorean school sent forth many philosophers and mathematicians: amongst
                    the latter, Philolaus and Archytas held a distinguished rank. Of Philolaus we
                    know but little. He held to its full extent the Pythagorean doctrine of the
                    motion of the earth round the sun as a centre, and was the first to unveil it.
                    He composed a work on Mechanics, and thus has a claim to be associated with
                    Eudoxus and Archytas as inventors of that part of mathematics. He had a tragical
                    end, having been massacred by the people of the small republic of which he had
                    been a legislator. We know more of Archytas. He was the author of a solution of
                    the problem of two mean proportionals. He was also one of the first who made use
                    of the geometrical analysis, which, according to Proclus, he had learned from
                    Plato, and by its assistance he made many discoveries in geometry. We pass over
                    his mechanical inventions, one of which, the artificial pigeon, which winged its
                    way through the air, certainly savours of the marvellous. Archytas is said to
                    have been blamed by Plato for applying geometry to mechanics; but if this was
                    so, it might be for the manner of the application. His solution of the problem
                    of finding two mean proportionals gives support to this conjecture; for although
                    ingenious, it has the defect of requiring a motion which cannot be executed.</p>
                <p>Democritus of Abdera cultivated geometry extensively. It has been conjectured
                    that he was one of the first who treated of the contact of circles and spheres,
                    and of irrational lines and solids.</p>
                <p>Hippocrates, who lived about the year 380 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> was
                    originally a merchant; but having no turn for commerce, he did not prosper. To
                    renovate his affairs, he went to Athens, and there for the first time became
                    acquainted with geometry, which seemed to suit his particular turn of mind. In
                    the prosecution of this study he discovered that the curvilineal space, called
                    from its form a <hi rend="italic">lutte,</hi> comprehended by half the
                    circumference of one circle and the fourth of the circumference of another
                    (their concavities being turned the same way), was equal to a rectilineal space,
                    viz. the area of a right-angled triangle, whose hypothenuse was the diameter of
                    the circle, and its sides each equal to the radius of the quadrantal arc. This
                    could not be considered as a true quadrature of a curvilineal space; it was
                    merely a geometrical juggle, by which a common space being taken from two equal
                    curvilineal figures, one of the remainders was by a sort of chance a rectilineal
                    figure. The first true quadrature of a curvilineal space is due to Archimedes.
                    Hippocrates attempted the quadrature of the circle; but, if his mode of
                    reasoning has been truly handed down to us, he committed a great oversight. This
                    is the first recorded paralogism in geometry. He was more successful in treating
                    of the duplication of the cube, which he showed to depend on the finding of two
                    mean proportionals between two given lines. He was also the first who composed
                    elements of geometry, but these have been lost. He appears to have retained the
                    mercantile spirit, insomuch that he accepted money for teaching geometry. On
                    this account he was expelled the Pythagorean school; a measure somewhat hard,
                    considering his reduced circumstances.</p>
                <p>Two geometers, Bryson and Antiphon, appear to have lived about the time of
                    Hippocrates, and a little before Aristotle. They are only known by some
                    animadversions of the latter on their attempts to square the circle. Before this
                    time geometers knew that the area of a circle was equal to a triangle whose base
                    is eaual to its circumference, and altitude equal to its radius. This truth
                    could not escape the observation of the early geometers. Bryson erroneously
                    believed that, by a geometrical construction, he could find the circumference,
                    in which case the quadrature would have been easy. Antiphon, it appears,
                    proceeded by increasing continually the number of sides of an inscribed regular
                    polygon, and considered the circle to be equal to the ultimate result; a process
                    perfectly correct, and the same in effect as that by which Archimedes found the
                    area of the parabola.</p>
                <p>From this brief view of the progress of geometry during the first two centuries
                    after its introduction into Greece, we pass to the school of Plato, in which
                    geometry completely changed its character, and advanced with increased vigour
                    and more rapid strides. Hitherto its subjects had been of the most elementary
                    nature; now, however, the views of geometers became more enlarged, and a new era
                    in the science commenced. Although the disciple and successor of Socrates, who
                    had no taste either for mathematical or physical science, Plato held them in the
                    highest estimation; and, imitating the earlier sages of Greece, he undertook
                    voyages and journeys to improve his mathematical knowledge. He visited Egypt to
                    converse with the priests, and Italy to consult with the celebrated Pythagoreans
                    Philolaus, Timaeus of Locris, and Archytas. With the last of these he contracted
                    a particular friendship. He went also to Cyrene to hear the discourses of the
                    mathematician Theodorus; and on his return to Greece, when he had founded his
                    school, he made the mathematics, particularly geometry, the basis of his
                    instructions; and his disciples, encouraged by his example and his exhortations,
                    applied with ardour to the study of that science. He never allowed a day to pass
                    without making his disciples acquainted with some new truth. He placed over his
                    school this inscription, <hi rend="italic">Let no one ignorant of geometry enter
                    here.</hi> He held that the Divinity continually geometrizes; meaning thereby,
                    no doubt, that the laws by which the universe are governed are in accordance
                    with the doctrines of mathematics. It does not appear that Plato composed any
                    work expressly on the mathematics; but his invention of the geometrical analysis
                    may be considered as one of the greatest improvements the science has received.
                    The theory of Conic Sections originated in the Platonic school; and a third
                    discovery was that of Geometrical Loci, a theory not only beautiful and
                    interesting on account of the abstract truths which it unfolds, but also by
                    reason of its great importance in the resolution of geometrical problems. The
                    celebrated problem<pb break="no" facs="nls:193519479"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-9479-0424"/> concerning the duplication of the cube was
                    agitated about his time; but its origin was earlier; for Hippocrates, as has
                    been already stated, had reduced it to the finding of two continued mean
                    proportionals. Plato himself gave a solution of the problem; and it was also
                    resolved by Archytas, Eudoxus, Eratosthenes, and Menaechmus. The solutions of
                    eleven of the ancient geometers have been preserved in the Commentary of
                    Eutocius on Archimedes’ Treatise concerning the Sphere and Cylinder. It is
                    probable that the trisection of an angle, a problem of the same degree of
                    difficulty as the duplication of the cube, excited the efforts of the Platonic
                    school. We have indeed no positive testimony in favour of this conjecture; but
                    the progress of the human mind does not allow us to doubt that the problem was
                    of great antiquity. After the solution of the very simple problem, the bisection
                    of an angle, it was natural to think of dividing it into three equal angles; and
                    those who first thought of the latter problem would no doubt be astonished to
                    find, that two problems so like in appearance should yet differ so much in the
                    difficulty of their solution. The trisection of an angle, and the duplication of
                    a cube, are in fact problems of such a nature that they cannot be resolved by
                    straight lines and circles alone, the only lines admitted by the ancients into
                    their elements of geometry. The reason of this impossibility would not be
                    apparent to the ancient geometers, although it is made evident by the modern
                    doctrines of algebra.</p>
                <p>The names of the individuals to whom we owe the particular discoveries which have
                    been specified have not come down to us; they must therefore be regarded as
                    belonging to the Platonic school generally. Proclus has recorded the names of a
                    number of the geometers of that school. Some of advanced years attended it as
                    friends of its celebrated head, or from respect to his doctrines; others,
                    chiefly young persons, as disciples. Of the first class were Laodamus, Archytas,
                    and Theaetetus: Laodamus was one of the earliest to whom Plato communicated his
                    method of analysis before he made it public, and he is said to have profited
                    much by the possession of this instrument of discovery. Archytas was a
                    Pythagorean, having extensive knowledge in geometry and mechanics. He frequently
                    visited Plato at Athens; but in one of his voyages he perished by shipwreck.
                    Theaetetus was a rich citizen of Athens, who had studied along with Plato under
                    Socrates. He appears to have cultivated the theory of the regular solids, called
                    now the Platonic bodies. '</p>
                <p>The progress of geometry now required that its elements should be new modelled.
                    This was done by Leon, a scholar of Neoclis, or Neoclides, a philosopher who had
                    studied under Plato. To Leon has been ascribed that part of the solution of a
                    problem called its <hi rend="italic">determination,</hi> which treats of the
                    cases in which the problem is possible, and of those in which it cannot be
                    resolved. Eudoxus of Cnidus was one of the friends and contemporaries of Plato;
                    he generalized many theorems, and thereby greatly advanced geometry. It is
                    believed that he cultivated the conic sections; and even the invention of these
                    has been ascribed to him. He resolved the problem of the duplication of the cube
                    ∙ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and it is to be regretted that Eutocius, who
                    speaks with contempt of his solution, has not recorded it with others in his
                    Commentary on Archimedes. Diogenes Laertius has attributed to him the invention
                    of curve lines in general; from which we may infer, that other curves besides
                    the conic sections were known in the school of Plato. Archimedes, in his
                    Treatise on the Sphere and Cylinder, says that Eudoxus found the measure of the
                    pyramid and cone, and that he was especially occupied with the contemplation of
                    solids. Some have given him the credit of being the writer of the fifth book of
                    Euclid, which treats of proportion. Amongst the numerous mathematicians of the
                    Platonic school, there was one, Cra-tistus, who is particularly mentioned by
                    Proclus. He was a remarkable person; for his knowledge of his science was in a
                    manner innate. There was no problem of that time, however difficult, which he
                    could not resolve by his natural geometry. He was the Pascal of antiquity. There
                    were two brothers, Menaechmus and Dinostratus, who also greatly distinguished
                    themselves. The former, a particular disciple of Plato, extended the theory of
                    the conic sections. Eratosthenes seems to attribute to him the merit of having
                    invented them; at any rate, he was the first who solved the problem of doubling
                    a cube by means of these curves. Dinostratus followed in the path of his
                    brother, and advanced geometry by his discoveries. He is particularly known as
                    the reputed inventor of a curve called the <hi rend="italic">quadratrix,</hi> by
                    which he seems to have intended to divide an angle or an arc of a circle in any
                    gi ven ratio. The curve takes its name from a property by which, could it be
                    constructed geometrically, the quadrature of the circle would be obtained.
                    According to Pappus, Dinostratus discovered this property of the curve; and
                    probably this is the reason why it has been called the quadratrix of
                    Dinostratus, just as we say the spiral of Archimedes. Indeed there is some
                    ground for believing that the curve was invented by Hippias, a philosopher and
                    skilful geometer, contemporary with Socrates.</p>
                <p>It was chiefly in geometry that the followers of Plato excelled. In this they
                    imitated their leader, who directed his attention to abstract speculations,
                    rather than to the study of nature. The conic sections, one of their most
                    refined and profound geometrical theories, remained merely an intellectual
                    speculation from its first invention till the days of Kepler and Newton, when it
                    acquired a high importance on account of the discovery that the orbits of the
                    planets are conic sections.</p>
                <p>The school of Plato, after the death of its founder, was divided into two others,
                    which, although opposed to each other on various points, yet agreed in holding
                    the mathematics in esteem, and in regarding them as an indispensable preparation
                    for the study of philosophy. It is recorded, that a person ignorant of geometry
                    and arithmetic having presented himself for admission into the school of
                    Xenocrates, the successor of Plato after Speusippus, he was repelled by its
                    chief, with an intimation that he was not properly prepared for the study of
                    philosophy: <hi rend="italic">Ansas philosophorum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >non</hi><hi rend="italic">habes,</hi> said the philosopher.</p>
                <p>The mathematics, thus encouraged and protected, continued to be cultivated and
                    improved. The celebrated geometer Euclid was of this school; and it may be
                    conjectured, from the age in which he lived, that he had acquired his knowledge
                    under the tuition of the first successors of Plato. So also, we may presume, was
                    Aristaeus, another celebrated geometer of antiquity, though little known in our
                    time, because his works have perished. We learn, however, from Pappus, that he
                    was one of the ancients who contributed the most to the progress of the sublime
                    geometry. He was the author of two excellent works; one a treatise on <hi
                    rend="italic">The Conic Sections,</hi> in five books, which contained a great
                    part of what Apollonius ha» given in the first four books of his work; the
                    other, also in five books, treated of <hi rend="italic">Solid Loci.</hi> Pappus,
                    in prescribing a course of study to his son, places this last work next in order
                    after the Conics of Apollonius. Hence we may infer that the propositions which
                    it contained were of a higher order of difficulty, and required a previous
                    knowledge of the conic sections. Euclid entertained great esteem for Aristaeus.
                    We may hence conclude that he was either his disciple or his intimate
                    friend.</p>
                <p>The pure mathematics were less cultivated in the school of Aristotle than they
                    had been in that of Plato; they were not, however, neglected; for, unlike the
                    modern peripatetics, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193519492"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-9492-0425"/>who discouraged the study of geometry, Aristotle
                    was deeply versed in the science, as may be inferred from his writings, which
                    abound in examples drawn from geometry.</p>
                <p>Although the mathematics received but little addition in the Aristotelian school,
                    still they had some cultivators. Of these, Theophrastus was the principal. He
                    wrote some treatises relating to them, particularly a complete history of these
                    sciences down to his time, a work which has unfortunately been lost. It
                    consisted of four books on the history of geometry, six on that of astronomy,
                    and one on that of arithmetic. We have great reason to regret the want of the
                    sure light which this work, had it come down to our times, would have thrown on
                    the origin and progress of these sciences, instead of which, we have only a few
                    glimmerings, that serve to make the darkness sensible, but not to dissipate the
                    obscurity. Another disciple of Aristotle, Eudemus, composed a history of the
                    mathematics. This consisted of six books on the history of geometry, and as many
                    on that of astronomy. We owe to these all we now know concerning the origin of
                    those sciences; for it Is from this source that Proclus, Theon, and Diogenes
                    Laertius have drawn the few notices which they have transmitted to us.</p>
                <p>We come next to a new epoch in the history of the ancient mathematics. This was
                    the institution of the school of Alexandria. However memorable this event may
                    have been in the history of general literature, it is more especially remarkable
                    in that of the mathematics; for in this celebrated school all the mathematical
                    sciences were cultivated with a degree of care not inferior to that which had
                    been bestowed on pure geometry in the school of Plato, and with corresponding
                    success.</p>
                <p>The period which immediately followed the death of Alexander proved one of
                    trouble and confusion. The vast empire founded by that conqueror was dismembered
                    by his principal captains; and Egypt was the portion which fell to one of them,
                    Ptolemy Lagus. As soon as he had established tranquillity in his dominions,
                    Lagus turned his attention to the sciences; and by his encouragement of their
                    cultivators, he drew to him many of the learned of Greece; and his capital soon
                    rivalled Athens as the resort of men of knowledge and talent. These constituted
                    the Alexandrian school. The perfection of this celebrated establishment is
                    mainly due to his son and successor Ptolemy Philadelphus, who bestowed on the
                    learned men he had induced to settle in his capital, protection and liberal
                    encouragement. Amongst those who resorted to this institution, none has been
                    more celebrated than the Greek geometer Euclid. His country is unknown; and of
                    the events of his life no notice has reached us. It appears that he had resided
                    in Greece, and studied geometry under the disciples of Plato. Thence he went to
                    Alexandria, induced probably by the liberality of the first Ptolemy. Pappus has
                    described him as gentle and modest, and entertaining a particular regard for
                    those who could contribute to the progress of the mathematics. His character
                    formed a contrast to that of Apollonius, another geometer, who was vain, and
                    delighted in depreciating his contemporaries. We may suppose that Euclid was not
                    much of a courtier, from his reply to Ptolemy, who inquired of him whether there
                    was not an easier way to a knowledge of geometry than the study of his Elements.
                    “There is no royal road to geometry,” was his answer. We have elsewhere (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Euclid)</hi> given a full account of this distinguished
                    geometer and his writings.</p>
                <p>The great excellence of the Elements of Euclid must increase our regret for the
                    loss of a treatise which he composed on <hi rend="italic">Porisms.</hi> Of this
                    work, all that has come down to modern times is an abstract, inserted by Pappus
                    Alexandrinus in his Mathematical Collections. This, however, has suffered so
                    much from time, that all we can immediately learn from it is, that the ancients
                    put a high value on porisms, and regarded them as an important part of their
                    analysis. The efforts of modern geometers had been exerted in endeavouring to
                    discover the nature of porisms, but without much success. At length Dr Robert
                    Simson, with a zeal and perseverance not to be surpassed, succeeded in divining
                    their nature, and even in restoring a great number of Euclid’s propositions.
                    These form a part of the posthumous works of this distinguished geometer.</p>
                <p>Leaving the Alexandrian school, our attention is drawn to Sicily, which gave
                    birth to Archimedes, a geometer whose genius has been the admiration of all who
                    have come after him. His life was written by Heraclides; but this precious piece
                    of biography, so well calculated to interest our curiosity, has unfortunately
                    perished. Archimedes was born 287 years before our era. He was the relation and
                    friend of Hiero, king of Syracuse. His skill as a mechanician is universally
                    known; but it is only as a geometer that we shall speak of him here. Endowed
                    with a mind of the highest order, he exerted it in the extension of mathematical
                    science. The measure of curvilineal magnitude was a subject new in his time,
                    concerning which but little was known. Archimedes attached himself to this
                    branch by predilection, and opened new views, which have engaged the attention
                    and exercised the genius of such men in modern times as Kepler, Cavalieri, and
                    Dr Wallis. The last of these has called him a man of prodigious sagacity, who
                    first laid the foundations of almost all that had given celebrity to the
                    seventeenth century of our era.</p>
                <p>The writings of Archimedes were numerous. We have two books by him on the sphere
                    and cylinder, which terminate in the fine geometrical discoveries, that the
                    solidity and surface of the sphere are respectively two thirds of the solidity
                    and surface of the circumscribing cylinder, with which he was so much delighted,
                    that he desired that these figures should be inscribed on his tomb. His book on
                    the measure of the circle is a kind of supplement to his treatise on the sphere,
                    which supposed a knowledge of that measure. The determination of the exact ratio
                    of the diameter to the circumference was, as at present, a problem not to be
                    resolved; but he found limits to that ratio, and an approximation to it
                    sufficiently accurate for the ordinary wants of the arts, which was all that he
                    attempted. He might, however, have carried his approximation farther, as was
                    afterwards done by Apollonius, and by Philo, another geometer less known.</p>
                <p>Archimedes having succeeded in measuring the sphere and cylinder, bodies long the
                    study of geometers, he opened a new field of inquiry in his Treatise on Conoids
                    and Spheroids. All his determinations are now familiar to geometers; his
                    processes of reasoning are highly ingenious, but withal somewhat intricate.
                    Indeed we question whether many modern mathematicians have had patience to go
                    through his investigations, considering that the same conclusions can now be
                    reached by much shorter methods.</p>
                <p>The properties of the spiral, invented by his friend Conon, and the quadrature of
                    the parabola, are among the additions made to the ancient geometry by
                    Archimedes. This last was a grand step in the progress of geometry; because it
                    was the first curvilineal space legitimately sq*uared, and the only one, until
                    the application of the modern methods of analysis. In latter times the notion of
                    infinity has been introduced into geometry, and has contributed greatly to its
                    extension. The ancients, however, carefully avoided this term, which might have
                    injured the stability of the science. Their theory of exhaustions supplied its
                    place, and was a safe, although a laborious and indirect way of establishing
                    truth. The writings of Archi-medes<pb break="no" facs="nls:193519505"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-9505-0426"/> give the finest examples of its application. We
                    pass over the mechanical and optical inventions of this great man, and only
                    observe that they indicate a state <hi rend="italic">of</hi> considerable
                    perfection in the geometrical science of that period.</p>
                <p>The writings of Archimedes are the most important of the few classic remains of
                    ancient geometry which we now possess. The subjects of which they treat, being
                    less elementary, are now less studied than those in the Elements of Euclid.
                    Every geometer, however, should have read them at least once in his life. The
                    earliest edition of his writings was published at Basle in 1644. It was in
                    Greek, with a· Latin translation by Venatorius, the two versions being printed
                    as separate volumes, and accompanied by the Commentary of Eutocius. There have
                    been many eth-tions of his works. Of these we shall only notice two; that of
                    Torelli, in Greek and Latin, published at Oxford in 1792, and a French
                    translation of his writings by Peyrard, the learned editor and translator of
                    Euclid’s works.</p>
                <p>Returning to the school of Alexandria, we have to mention Eratosthenes, a
                    geometer as well as an astronomer. Indeed he was one of those uncommon men,
                    whose genius embraces all subjects; for he was also an orator, a poet, an
                    antiquary, and a philosopher. His extensive knowledge induced the third Ptolemy
                    to make him his librarian. He chiefly cultivated geometry and astronomy, and has
                    been classed with the three great geometers of antiquity, Aristaeus, Euclid, and
                    Apollonius, who had improved geometrical analysis. Pappus mentions a work by
                    Eratosthenes on this subject, in two books. He has told us its title, but has
                    not described its exact object, which can therefore only be conjectured. He gave
                    a solution of the problem of the duplication of the cube, which Eutocius has
                    preserved in his Commentaries on Archimedes; and he applied his geometrical and
                    astronomical science to the solution of the grand problem, the measurement of
                    the magnitude of the earth, which, however, had been attempted before his
                    time.</p>
                <p>Apollonius of Perga appeared as a geometer in the Alexandrian school, about the
                    time when Archimedes had finished his career. It might be a question which of
                    these two great men was endowed with the higher genius; for such was the
                    estimation in which Apollonius was held at the period in which he lived, that he
                    obtained the appellation of the <hi rend="italic">great geometer.</hi> He was
                    the most profound and fertile writer that has ever treated of geometry. His
                    works which have survived the ravages of time, or have been restored by modern
                    geometers, with the addition of the Data and Porisms of Euclid, this last also a
                    restoration, constitute nearly all which we now know of that beautiful subject,
                    the ancient geometrical analysis. Whoever would understand it, and acquire skill
                    and facility in its application, would do well to study with care the various
                    works of Apollonius which have been restored, if not exactly according to the
                    letter, at least in the true spιπt of the originals. A full account of the
                    writings of this distinguished geometer has been given as an article of
                    biography (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Apollonius)</hi>; it is therefore
                    unnecessary to enumerate them here.</p>
                <p>The ancient mathematicians addressed their writings to others, their particular
                    friends. It is in this way that the names of some of their contemporaries have
                    descended to us, although their writings have been lost. Apollonius dedicated
                    the first three books of his Conics to Eudemus, a geometer, and in such terms as
                    show that he addressed himself to one wel! acquainted with the subject He says
                    that he had been encouraged to study the subject by Naucrates; and he requests
                    Eudemus to communicate what he had written to Philonides, also a geometer.
                    Eudemus having died, he addressed the fourth book to Attalus, and speaks of
                    Thrasydeus, with whom Conon of Samos, a little anterior to his time, had held a
                    correspondence on the conics; also of Nicoeles the Cyrenean, who it seems had a
                    controversy with Conon. The regret which Archimedes expresses for the loss of
                    Conon gives us reason to believe that he was a profound geometer. We know also
                    that he was an astronomer. Archimedes dedicated several of his works to
                    Dositheus, another geometer, whose name has thus become known to us.</p>
                <p>It was about this period that the geometer Nicoedes lived. He was the inventor of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Conchoid,</hi> a curve which served to resolve two
                    remarkable problems, the duplication of the cube, and the trisection of an
                    angle.</p>
                <p>The period which comprehended the ages of Euclid, Archimedes, and Apollonius, was
                    that in which the science of geometry shone forth with the greatest splendour.
                    It had been in a state of gradual improvement from the time of Thales. Now,
                    however, it seems to have arrived at a degree of perfection beyond which its
                    cultivators did not carry it. We may suppose that the science of astronomy took
                    its place, and presented a new and more inviting field of discovery. Hipparchus,
                    the father of astronomy, was also a geometer; for we find him applying its
                    principles, combined with arithmetic, to his science.</p>
                <p>There were geometers who were also mechanicians. These, as well as the
                    astronomers, probably cultivated geometry alone as connected with their own
                    science. Gemimus of Rhodes lived between the time of Hipparchus and the
                    beginning of our era. He was the author of a work on geometry, and another on
                    astronomy. The former, which is lost, was probably a historical commentary, a
                    sort of development of geometrical discoveries. Proclus seems to have drawn from
                    it all that he has said on the history and metaphysics of geometry. Its loss is
                    matter of regret. Ctesibius, and Hero his disciple, were celebrated as
                    mechanicians. The former lived in the middle of the second century before
                    Christ. Philo of Byzantium was also a celebrated mechanician. Posvdo-nius was at
                    once geometer, astronomer, mechanician, and ge <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    ographer. He deserved well of geometry, for having repelled the attack of Zeno
                    the Epicurean, who had attempted to invalidate its principles and certainty.
                    Dio-nysiodorus was a skilful geometer, as appears by his solution of a difficult
                    problem of Archimedes. Theodosius was the author of a work on the geometry of
                    the sphere, which has descended to our times. It appears to have been studied as
                    a classic in the English universities. Dr Barrow gave an edition of it, along
                    with the writings of Archimedes, and the four books of the Conics of Apollonius,
                    in 1615. The best edition is that of Hunt, printed at Oxford 1707.</p>
                <p>The study of the mathematical sciences, which languished in the first century of
                    the Christian era, revived a little in the beginning of the second. Menelaus, an
                    astronomer, wrote on trigonometry and spherical geometry. This work has reached
                    our times by a translation from the Arabic. Dr Halley, holding in high esteem
                    every vestige of the ancient geometry, had prepared a new edition of this
                    geometer, corrected from a Hebrew manuscript. It did not appear, however, until
                    1758, by the care of Costard, the author of a history of astronomy. Menelaus, as
                    we learn from Pappus, cultivated the theory of curve lines; a subject which may
                    be regarded as belonging to the higher geometry among the ancients.</p>
                <p>Ptolemy, if not an inventive geometer, must at least have been perfectly
                    acquainted with its theories, for he had the merit of applying them to
                    astronomy. His Almagest has handed down from antiquity a beautiful geometrical
                    theorem, the foundation of the Greek trigonometry. It is this; the rectangle
                    contained in the diagonals of a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle, is equal to
                    both the rectangles contained by tire opposite sides.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193519518" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9518-0427"/>
                <p>Several mathematicians of no great note lived in the third and fourth centuries
                    of the Christian era. Such were Serenus, who wrote two books on cones and
                    cylinders; Ĳypsicles of Alexandria, the supposed author of two books on regular
                    solids, sometimes ascribed to Euclid; and Perseus Citticus, who wrote on certain
                    lines called. <hi rend="italic">Spiriques,</hi> formed from a solid generated by
                    an arc of a circle revolving about a fixed axis. Philo of Thyaneus, and
                    Demetrius of Alexandria, both wrote on curve lines.</p>
                <p>We are now come to a period in which the sciences had begun to decline; when,
                    instead of original treatises, writers were content to compose commentaries and
                    annotations on the works of their more illustrious predecessors. It was in this
                    way that Pappus and Theon of Alexandria, who lived towards the end of the fourth
                    century, rendered service to the mathematical sciences. The first, however, must
                    not be classed with the ordinary scholiasts; for in his Mathematical Collections
                    he has shown that he was an expert geometer. His object in composing this work
                    was to collect into one body many scattered discoveries, and to illustrate and
                    supply deficiencies in the writings of the celebrated mathematicians who had
                    preceded him. He has done this in regard to Apollonius, Archimedes, Euclid, and
                    Theodosius, by a number of lemmas and important propositions which they had
                    assumed as known. His writings have made us acquainted with the various attempts
                    made by the ancients to double the cube, and to divide an angle into three or
                    more equal parts. We are indebted to him for almost all we know of these and
                    other important matters in the ancient geometry; and it is through his writings
                    that the names of many geometers have come down to our days, which, but for him,
                    would have been lost in the obscurity of time. The preface to his seventh book
                    is of inestimable value, inasmuch as it has preserved from oblivion many of the
                    analytic works of the ancients. His brief analysis of these works, for that is
                    all we have, has given continuity to the history of geometry; and his
                    indications have served as vestiges of the steps by which the ancients proceeded
                    in their discoveries. Guided by these brief notices, the ingenuity of the
                    moderns has succeeded in restoring the writings of Apollonius and Euclid, which
                    had disappeared for ages. It is not improbable, that in this renovated form, the
                    works of these geometers surpass in excellence the originals. The restorers have
                    had the advantage of an improved state of the science, and the works of later
                    geometers, to assist them in their researches.</p>
                <p>It is probable that at this time there is not an entire copy of the eight books
                    of Pappus in existence; certainly there is none in Britain. In a catalogue of
                    the manuscripts of England and Ireland, published at Oxford in 1698, there is
                    mention made of two copies in the Savilian library. These have been more than
                    two centuries in Oxford. One, marked No. 3, is in folio, and is well written on
                    paper; it contains the Greek text of the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh,
                    and eighth books, and in addition some works of Theodosius and Autolycus. There
                    is no memorial to indicato when it was written, or by whom. The other copy, with
                    a mark No. 9, is not so well written; it has been copied by various hands, on
                    separate sheets of paper. This copy, besides the books preserved in the former,
                    contains also a part of the second book. Dr Wallis has spoken of three
                    manuscripts of Pappus at Oxford, one in the Bodleian and two in the Savilian
                    library. No traces of a third copy can now be found in the Bodleian library. The
                    late Dr Trail, in his life of Dr Robert Simson, has described a manuscript now
                    in the Advocates’ Library, Edinburgh. It contains five books of Pappus, viz. the
                    third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and eighth; but unfortunately the seventh, the most
                    valuable portion of the work, is wanting. This was purchased at Paris by Dr
                    James Moore in 1748.</p>
                <p>The British Museum possesses a manuscript Copy of</p>
                <p>Pappus, which had been the property of the Saliante family at Verona. None of the
                    manuscripts of which we have any details are of a very early date. There are
                    some points of resemblance in all that have been examined, which seem to
                    indicate a common origin. It is well known that early manuscripts are few in
                    number; sometimes only one is known. This may have been the case in regard to
                    the text of Pappus, and will account for the agreement of all the manuscripts in
                    particular places. We owe the edition which we possess of this ancient work to
                    the labour of Commandine, who translated and enriched it with notes, but died
                    when he was about to give it to the world. It afterwards appeared in 1588, under
                    the patronage and by the pecuniary aid of Francisco Maria, duke of Urban. That
                    part of the second book which has been preserved was published in the third
                    volume of the works of Dr Wallis: it treats of the ancient arithmetic.</p>
                <p>We had formerly .occasion to mention Hypatia, the daughter of Theon, as a
                    commentator on Diophantus, in our account of the progress of Algebra. She has a
                    claim to our notice also in the history of geometry, by her having composed a
                    commentary on the writings of Apollonius.</p>
                <p>The philosopher Proclus, the chief of the Platonic school at Athens, made it in
                    some measure the seat of the mathematical sciences about the middle of the fifth
                    century. In imitation of the chief of his sect, he held the sciences in great
                    estimation. He was not, however, distinguished for original discoveries; but his
                    commentary on the first book of Euclid, setting aside the fault of its
                    prolixity, is valuable, because of the information it contains on the history
                    and metaphysics of geometry at a remote period.</p>
                <p>We pass over several geometers of this period, of whom hardly any thing but their
                    names is known. We mention, however, Diodes as the inventor of a curve called
                    the cissoid, contrived for the solution of the celebrated problem, to find two
                    mean proportionals.</p>
                <p>Geometrical science had by this time been long on the decline. The Alexandrian
                    school, however, still existed; and a repetition of such a period as that in
                    which Apollonius and Euclid flourished might have been hoped for, had it not
                    been for the troubles which agitated the East. The taking of Alexandria by the
                    Saracens in the year 640 gave a deathblow to the sciences, not only in that
                    celebrated city, but throughout the Greek empire. The library was delivered over
                    to destruction by the command of the ignorant fanatic Omar; and this, the finest
                    monument of human genius, the accumulated store of knowledge that had been
                    collecting for ages, was employed during six months in warming the four thousand
                    baths of Alexandria. Such was the end of the Alexandrian school, which had for
                    nearly ten centuries contributed to the advancement of the human mind in
                    knowledge.</p>
                <p>About the eighth century we find Hero, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >theyouιuj-er,</hi> an engineer and mathematician. He wrote a treatise on <hi
                    rend="italic">Geod&lt;εsia</hi> (so practical geometry was called), which had no
                    great merit; it is, however, remarkable for containing, without demonstration, a
                    rule for finding the area of a triangle when its three sides are known. There is
                    no notice of this important theorem in the writings of the ancients which have
                    come down to us. It was, however, probably found by some geometer earlier than
                    Hero. It appears to have been afterwards lost, and rediscovered by Tartalea.</p>
                <p>We have an unfavourable opinion of the modern Arabians, but there was a period
                    when they had a very different character. When the sciences were neglected by
                    the Greeks, and existed only in manuscripts buried in the dust of libraries, the
                    Arabians brought them forth from obscurity, and gave them an honourable asylum.
                    They were the depositaries of knowledge during the ages of barbarism and
                    ignorance which overspread Europe; and we owe to our <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193519531" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9531-0428"/>intercourse with them the
                    first glimpses of light which penetrated the obscurity of the eleventh, twelfth,
                    and thirteenth centuries. The Arabians diligently cultivated the science of
                    astronomy; and as a corresponding knowledge of other branches of science was
                    necessary to success, they became geometers, opticians, and even algebraists.
                    The greater part of the Greek geometers, particularly those necessary to the
                    study of astronomy, as Euclid, Theodosius, Hypsicles, Menelaus, were translated
                    into the Arabic language in the time of Almamon, or soon after him. They even
                    began to cultivate the sublime geometry of the ancients, for the four first
                    books of the Conics of Apollonius were translated by order of that prince. They
                    added to their literature the writings of Archimedes, and at least three of the
                    last books of the Conics of Apollonius; and all these works are to be found in
                    libraries rich in oriental manuscripts. It is from the last-mentioned work,
                    corrected and augmented by the notes of Nassireddin, a Persian geometer, that Dr
                    Halley has enriched our geometry with the fifth, sixth, and seventh books of the
                    ancient Greek author; the remaining books, viz. the eighth, appear however to
                    have been entirely lost The Arabian writers quote the writings of several Greek
                    geometers of which we know nothing, such as a treatise on parallel lines,
                    another on triangles, and a third on the division of the circle. We must allow
                    to the Arabians the merit of having given to our trigonometry its present form.
                    They also simplified the practice of its operations, by employing the sines of
                    the arcs instead of the chords of the double arcs employed by the Greeks. This
                    was even one of their earliest inventions, for we find it in the writings of
                    their astronomer Albatenius.</p>
                <p>The Arabian historians have recorded the names of several of their cultivators of
                    geometry; but these may be passed over, ignorant as we are of their
                    contributions to the science. The optician Alhazen however deserves notice,
                    because of the knowledge of geometry shown in his writings, and also on account
                    of a geometrical problem applicable to optics which bears his name. The solution
                    he gives was probably derived from the Greek geometers. It must be confessed the
                    Arabians do not appear to have been an inventive people; almost always
                    commentators or compilers, they seldom rose higher than the labours which such
                    functions impose.</p>
                <p>The Persians have also had their geometers. The most celebrated was Nassir-Eddin
                    Al-Tussi. The science is indebted to him for some good works, particularly a
                    learned commentary on Euclid, which was written in Arabic, and printed in 1590
                    in Italy. Another geometrical work is a revision of the Conics of Apollonius,
                    with a commentary. Dr Halley found this useful in remodelling the fifth, sixth,
                    and seventh books of that precious treatise. The Persian geometers have long
                    known the principal Greek writers; and they even profess to have some of their
                    writings which we have not known. It appears that their geometers had a peculiar
                    taste in treating the doctrines of abstract science, for they have given every
                    proposition of the elements a name expressive of one of its uses, or of some
                    fanciful analogy it may have to things foreign to geometry. The forty-seventh of
                    the first book of Euclid, for example, they call the <hi rend="italic">figure of
                    the bride,</hi> and the forty-eighth the <hi rend="italic">bride’s
                    sister</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, with some reason, they call the
                    mathematics the <hi rend="italic">difficult science.</hi> Mathematical knowledge
                    among the Turks has been nearly in the same state as among the Persians. The
                    libraries of Constantinople contain Arabic and some Turkish translations of the
                    Greek writers. Geometry is taught in their schools, but it does not appear that
                    they go beyond the Elements of Euclid. There are hardly any traces of geometry
                    amongst the Hebrews. We know that when Solomon’s temple was built, Hiram king of
                    Tyre furnished architects and navigators. From this we may infer that the Jews
                    had no geometry at that period. It was not before their second dispersion that
                    they took an interest in the sciences. However, when mixed with other nations,
                    some of their learned men cultivated geometry, but never proceeded beyond the
                    elements. About the time of Almamon, in imitation of the Arabians, they
                    translated the writings of some of the Greek mathematicians into their language,
                    in particular those of Euclid and Archimedes. They however made no addition
                    themselves to geometrical science.</p>
                <p>The researches of Europeans concerning the mathematical and astronomical science
                    of India have discovered among the Hindus some works on geometry of great
                    antiquity. We have already given some account of these interesting writings in
                    our sketch of the history of Algebra; and we have there described the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lilavati,</hi> a work on arithmetic and geometry by l}hascara
                    Acharya, a Hindu mathematician, who lived about the year 1150 of the Christian
                    era. In another work, reputed more ancient, viz. the Surya Siddhanta, we find a
                    rational system of trigonometry combined with fable and absurdity. There has
                    been great difference of opinion as to the time when this last treatise, the
                    most ancient on the Indian astronomy, was written. The French astronomer Bailly
                    believed it to have been composed more than 3000 years before the Christian era;
                    but more sober inquirers have judged it to be about 750 years old. The
                    trigonometry it contains is probably much older. The Hindu books on geometry are
                    remarkable for not containing demonstrations. The writers knew the celebrated
                    proposition concerning the squares on the sides of a right-angled triangle, the
                    discovery of which is ascribed to Pythagoras; and they also knew the rule for
                    finding the area of a triangle from its sides, which was not known to the early
                    Greeks. It appears from the Institutes of Akbar, that the Indians supposed the
                    diameter of a circle to be to its circumference as 1250 to 3927; which is the
                    proportion of 1 to 3*1416, and is more accurate than the determination of
                    Archimedes, or indeed than any known before the sixteenth century.</p>
                <p>The Chinese have cultivated astronomy from a remote antiquity, yet it does not
                    appear that they have made any progress in geometry. They knew the proposition
                    of Pythagoras, it would seem, earlier than it was known to the Greeks, yet it
                    remained sterile in their hands. They had no spherical trigonometry before the
                    thirteenth century, and then it was not of native growth; it was probably
                    derived from the Arabians or Persians.</p>
                <p>The Romans, unlike the Greeks, gave little attention to the sciences. The
                    mathematics in particular were disregarded at Rome; and geometry, scarcely known
                    there, did not extend beyond the art of measuring land and of fixing boundaries.
                    The mathematics were, however, not unknown to Cicero. The respect with which he
                    speaks of them, and the veneration he manifested for the memory of Archimedes in
                    searching for his tomb, on which he knew were inscribed a sphere and cylinder,
                    indicate that he had given some attention to the subject of geometry.</p>
                <p>The Roman geographer Strabo must be numbered amongst the geometers of his day:
                    and Cicero mentions another, Didymus, who was blind; but he was a Greek by
                    birth. Vitruvius has given much information, in his architecture, on matters
                    connected with geometry.</p>
                <p>We pass over those ages in which the sciences had nearly disappeared in Europe,
                    and hail with satisfaction their revival in the eighth century. Mathematical
                    science was at first dimly recognised, like the dawn of a new day after a gloomy
                    night, in the writings of Boethius, Bede, his disciple Alcuin, and Gerbert, who
                    travelled into Arabia, the only country where a knowledge of the mathematical
                    sciences could be acquired. In this he was imitated by the English monk Adelard,
                    or Athelard, in the twelfth century, who went into Spain and Egypt; also by
                    other <pb break="no" facs="nls:193519544" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9544-0429"
                    />Englishmen, such as Daniel Morlay, Robert of Reading, William Shell or William
                    de Conchis, Clement Langton, &amp;c. Adelard on his return translated Euclid,
                    and he appears to have been the first who made this writer known in the West.
                    His work was never printed. Plato of Tivoli translated the Spherics of
                    Theodosius into Latin about 1120; but this translation was not printed before
                    1518. It is worthy of remark, that almost all the restorers of the sciences were
                    ecclesiastics, who in the seclusion of the cloisters studied the works of the
                    ancients which had been preserved in the monasteries. This at. least is one
                    benefit the world has received from the leisure of the monks of that period,
                    which all of them did not spend in idleness.</p>
                <p>The sciences found many cultivators, and much encouragement from sovereigns, in
                    the thirteenth century; Jordanus Nemorarius, who lived about 1230, was well
                    versed in geometry and arithmetic. John of Halifax, known also by the name of
                    Sacro-Bosco, his contemporary, was a mathematician. Campanus of Navarre, the
                    celebrated translator and commentator of Euclid’s Elements, was of this age.
                    Almost all the early editions of this work were made from his version and his
                    manuscript commentary. We have a treatise by him on the Quadrature of the
                    Circle. But he deviates from geometrical accuracy, by mistaking the approximate
                    ratio found by Archimedes for the true and exact ratio. The paralogism which he
                    gives for a demonstration may, however, be excused in the geometers of his time.
                    They were few, and their writings must not be too nicely scanned. The name of
                    Roger Bacon is so identified with the progress of science, that we must reckon
                    him among the geometers of his day. In support of this claim we record his
                    treatise on Perspective, a geometrical theory.</p>
                <p>Leonardus of Pisa, who in the fifteenth century brought algebra into Italy, was
                    also known as a cultivator of geometry. He composed a treatise on the subject,
                    which Commandine thought worthy of publication, and had prepared it for the
                    press; but his death prevented its appearance.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of this century, Cardinal Cusa acquired reputation in geometry,
                    by a pretended quadrature of the circle, and other writings. These, however,
                    were only a tissue of paralogisms. It appears from the introduction to a tract
                    of this writer, that Pope Nicoas V. who occupied the pontifical throne from 1447
                    to 1455, was a geometer, and had translated the works of Archimedes from Greek
                    into Latin. The true restorers of mathematical science in the fifteenth century
                    were Purbach and Regiomontanus. Purbach banished the use of sexagenary
                    calculation from trigonometry, which he enriched with several new propositions.
                    He supposed the radius divided into 600,000 parts, instead of the divisions used
                    by the ancients; and in place of the chords of the double arcs, expressed in
                    sexagenary parts of the radius, he calculated the sines in 600,000ths of the
                    radius. He was the inventor of the geometrical square, an instrument used in
                    practical geometry; and he appears to have been the first who applied the
                    plumb-line to mark the divisions of an instrument. Regiomontanus, whose true
                    name was John Muller (called also <hi rend="italic">John of Mont-RoyaD,</hi> was
                    born in 1436. At the age of fourteen he was captivated with the mathematical
                    sciences, and put himself under the guidance of Purbach. The preceptor and his
                    pupil made a journey into Italy to study Greek, in order that they might draw
                    their knowledge from the pure sources of antiquity. Purbach died there, but his
                    disciple followed out his purpose. He afterwards translated the Spherics of
                    Menelaus and Theodosius into Latin; he corrected from the Greek text the ancient
                    version of Archimedes made by Gerard of Cremona; he translated the Conics of
                    Apollonius, and the Cylindrics of Serenus, besides other works on mixed
                    mathematics; he commented on the books of Archimedes, which Eutocius had not
                    touched. He defended Euclid against the imputations of Campanus, and he confuted
                    the pretended quadrature of Cardinal Cusa. We pass over for the present his
                    improvements in trigonometry.</p>
                <p>Lucas Paciolus, or Lucas de Burgo, the author of the earliest printed book on
                    algebra, contributed by the same work to the establishment of geometry. It was
                    first printed in 1494, and was therefore one of the early printed books on the
                    science, but not the earliest, for the first edition of Euclid was in 1482.</p>
                <p>The decline of the Greek empire, and the taking of Constantinople, which happened
                    in 1453, scattered the learned men of that country, many of whom took shelter in
                    Italy, and brought with them their language, and the precious remains of ancient
                    learning. The art of printing soon spread abroad these treasures, and in the
                    sixteenth century geometry was very generally cultivated. Amongst the writers on
                    the science in this century we may, in particular, reckon Zamberti, John
                    Baptiste Memmius, Commandine, Guido Ubaldo, Maurolycus, and Tartalea. These and
                    others laboured usefully on the ancients, by translations and commentaries. The
                    Jesuit Clavius deserves particular mention. Besides his labour on Euclid, we owe
                    to him a good work for the time on practical geometry in eight books.</p>
                <p>We pass a multitude of names, and come to the French geometer Vict., who was
                    deeply versed in the ancient as well as in the modern geometry, and the restorer
                    of the tangencies, one of the lost works of Apollonius. Adrian Metius, a Dutch
                    geometer, deserves to be mentioned for his convenient and accurate approximate
                    ratio (113 to 355) of the diameter to the circumference of a circle, given in a
                    work on practical geometry. At this period the geometer Nonius, a professor at
                    Coimbra, laboured with zeal in spreading a knowledge of the science in
                    Portugal.</p>
                <p>The seventeenth century opened propitiously for the progress of geometry'. Lucas
                    Valerius, an Italian, took up a subject which Archimedes had neglected, namely,
                    the centre of gravity of solids; and Marinus Ghetaldus, another Italian, made an
                    attempt to restore the lost book of Apollonius, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Inclinationibus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but he
                    left the labour incomplete. He also composed a work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Resolutione</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Compositione Mathematica,</hi> which proves him to have imbibed the true spirit
                    of the ancient geometry. A Scottish geometer, Alexander Anderson, lived at this
                    time. He had a decided taste for the ancient analysis, of which he gave an essay
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Supplementum Apollonii Redivivi,</hi> in which he
                    supplied what Ghetaldus had left imperfect. The Netherlands could boast of some
                    geometers who did credit to their time. Ludolph Van Ceulen has been celebrated
                    for his approximation to the ratio of the diameter of a circle to its
                    circumference <hi rend="smallcaps">(Algebra,</hi> art. 272), a prodigious effort
                    of labour, but requiring little genius. Willebrord Snellius was a more
                    distinguished geometer. He undertook the restoration of the lost book <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Sectione Determinata</hi> of Apollonius,
                    and accomplished his task creditably. He improved greatly the way in which
                    Ceulen had approximated to the ratio of the diameter to the circumference, and
                    verified the labour of that model of patience in calculation. Albert Girard has
                    acquired great reputation in geometry by his supposed divination of the Porisms
                    of Euclid; for in his edition of Stevinus he positively avers that he had
                    restored the three books, which, however, never appeared; and indeed it may be
                    doubted whether he understood the true nature of porisms. John Neper might be
                    reckoned amongst geometers, but he has still higher claims to the notice of
                    posterity for his invention of logarithms.</p>
                <p>The science was sedulously cultivated in England at this period by Robert Record,
                    John Dee, Leonard and Thomas Digges. and Henry Billingsley. Record was the
                    author of the <hi rend="italic">Pathway of Knowledge,</hi> the earliest book in
                    the English language on geometry. It was first printed in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193519557" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9557-0430"/>1551, and is dedicated to
                    Edward VI. Edward Wright the inventor of what is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mercators Chart,</hi> was ar English geometer whose knowledge of the science
                    greatl; exceeded what was common in his time.</p>
                <p>Germany had many geometers at this period, but none of a high order. John Werner
                    of Nuremberg cultivated the ancient geometry, and excelled in a knowledge of its
                    analysis. Every writer on geometry at this period gave a system of trigonometry
                    nearly the same as we now have it in its most elementary form. To George Joachim
                    Rheticus mathematical science is particularly indebted for a trigonometrical
                    table, more extensive than any that had been given before him. It was printed in
                    1594·, with this title, <hi rend="italic">Opus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Palatinum</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Triangulis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but the author was then dead. The work was published by

                <p>Pitiscus, another German geometer, extended and reprinted this work in 1613, with
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus</hi><hi rend="italic">Mathematicus,

                    and one of the most remarkable monuments of human patience extant.</p>
                <p>Want of space compels us to pass in silence many names not less celebrated than
                    some we have given, but less remarkable, because of their abundance in respect
                    of the age to which they gave splendour. Indeed we may reckon that every
                    astronomer and algebraist was then a geometer.</p>
                <p>Kepler opened an unexplored way into the field of geometry, by boldly introducing
                    the notion of infinity into that science. We may suppose that Archimedes must
                    have entertained in effect the same idea in his speculations on the sphere and
                    cylinder, but was prevented from following it to its full extent by the strict
                    laws according to which the early mathematicians had constructed their
                    demonstrations. The views of Kepler were eagerly seized by Roberval in France,
                    and by Cavalieri in Italy. They were the fertile germs which, under the culture
                    of such men, led, in the course of the seventeenth century, to a rich harvest of
                    discoveries.</p>
                <p>We have now arrived at a period at which the discoveries of the ancients formed
                    but a small part of the whole body of geometrical science, augmented as it had
                    been by the moderns, and which was continually increasing. The new views which
                    were opened soon produced the methods of indivisibles of Cavalieri and Roberval,
                    the theory of tangents of Fermat, the arithmetic of infinites of Wallis, the
                    geometry of curve lines of Descartes, and, finally, the method of fluxions of
                    Newton, and the differential calculus of Leibnitz. The origin and progress of
                    these have been fully explained in our introductions to <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Algebra</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Fluxions,</hi> and require not to be here
                    repeated. The ancient geometry, however, still had great value. Huygens and
                    Newton delivered their sublime discoveries in its language, and represented the
                    relations of time, space, velocity, force, the objects of their physical
                    inquiries, by geometrical diagrams. The rigorous mode of ancient demonstrations
                    served likewise as a model on which to form the processes of reasoning by which
                    the new truths in geometry and physics were to be established. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i t’</hi></p>
                <p>Not to pass altogether in silence the names of geometers whose discoveries have
                    made the seventeenth century ever memorable, we observe, that to Guildin, a
                    Jesuit, we owe the discovery of a property of the centre of gravity applicable
                    to the measurement of solids formed by revolution; and to Descartes, Fermat,
                    Roberval, and Barrow, a method of determining the tangents of curves. Galileo
                    first suggested the <hi rend="italic">cycloid,</hi> the nature of which was
                    afterwards fully disclosed by the investigations of Roberval, Fermat, Pascal,
                    Huygens, Wren, and Wallis. James Gregory first suggested the logarithmic curve;
                    and John Bernoulli and Leibnitz showed the true nature of the catenary, which
                    Galileo could not discover; afterwards, David Gregory demonstrated <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ts properties by the new geometry.</p>
                <p>The ancient geometry came in for a share of that general attention which was
                    bestowed on the modem theories. Newton, as has been already stated, held it in
                    high esteem -, and David Gregory and Dr Halley employed their genius and
                    learning in restoring to their pristine excellence the precious remains of
                    Euclid and Apollonius.</p>
                <p>Previously to the time of Newton, pure geometry and algebra were the only
                    subjects which mathematicians had for the exercise of their genius; but his
                    sublime discoveries presented a new and an immense field for investigation. The
                    fact that the orbits of the planets are ellipses, naturally connected the
                    doctrines of astronomy with the conic sections; and the two were wrought up into
                    the beautiful physicomathematical theory of central forces delivered in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Principia.</hi> When this came to be fully understood, it served
                    as a model of reasoning in all speculations on physics, and the geometrical
                    method of Newton was adopted and imitated by his followers. Thus, we have the
                    <hi rend="italic">Elements of Physical and Geometrical Astronomy</hi> of David
                    Gregory, and the <hi rend="italic">Phoronomia</hi> of Herman, and many other
                    like treatises, composed in the geometrical style. It was, however, soon
                    discovered, and first by foreign mathematicians, that the geometrical method,
                    which, when carried a certain length, is perspicuous and easy, is yet unsuitable
                    to the more difficult speculations of mechanical philosophy, by reason of its
                    cumbersomeness. It was therefore abandoned by Leibnitz, the Bernoullis, Euler,
                    and their followers, and the greatly more manageable modern methods of the
                    fluxional or differential calculus adopted in its stead. The mathematicians in
                    Britain, who had imbibed deeply and acquired a relish for the spirit of the
                    geometrical method, however, still adhered wholly or in part to that method.
                    Maclaurin, the expositor of Newton’s calculus of fluxions, defended its
                    principles, and delivered many of his own fine speculations in the pure and
                    mixed mathematics, in the prolix style of the ancient geometry. But he also gave
                    a theory of the fluxional calculus in the more concise language of the modern
                    analysis, which served as a practical example of the advantage which the latter
                    has over the former as an instrument of invention. Dr Robert Simson, the editor
                    of Euclid, greatly preferred the geometrical to the modern analysis; and his
                    disciple, Dr Mathew Stewart, the author of <hi rend="italic">General Theorems,
                    Tracts relating to Physical Astronomy,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Propositiones
                    Geometricas</hi><hi rend="italic">more</hi><hi rend="italic">Veterum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Demonstrates,</hi> fully agreed with him in this sentiment. At a
                    later period another Scottish professor, the late Mr Playfair, with a profound
                    knowledge of both the ancient and modem analysis, and with no prejudice in
                    favour of the former, yet gave an elegant example of its beauty, in his paper on
                    the origin and investigation of porisms.</p>
                <p>These distinguished Scottish mathematicians, by their writings, contributed
                    greatly to keep up the taste for geometry in Britain during the last century. It
                    is proper to acknowledge also, that much is due to Dr A. Robertson, the late
                    professor of astronomy at Oxford, to Dr Horsley, bishop of Rochester, and
                    others, for the estimation in which the geometrical analysis is now held in
                    Britain.</p>
                <p>The nature and objects of the ancient geometry have been fully understood for a
                    century past, and the only question now is, how it ought to be studied. There
                    have been a great variety of treatises within that time sent into the world. We
                    do not, however, suppose that the science has gained by this diversity of
                    guides. The settled public opinion seems to be in favour of some standard book;
                    and Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> have been, by almost universal
                    consent, chosen as that standard in this country. There is another work of great
                    excellence in the French language, <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Géométrie,</hi> by the late Legendre, a mathematician of the
                    highest celebrity. Were we to chuse a book different from Euclid for purposes of
                    instruction, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193519570" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9570-0431"
                    />it would be Legendre’s Geometry, of which there is an English translation. It
                    may be useful to read more than one book on a subject which we wish to
                    understand thoroughly, and those who hold this opinion can find no better book
                    than that of the French geometer. We have kept him constantly in view in
                    composing this treatise.</p>
                <p>In tracing the progress of a science, it is always interesting to know by what
                    steps it has advanced in the career of improvement. These may be well
                    ascertained by consulting the authors who have written on the science, from its
                    infancy downwards. With this view we have given a catalogue of writers on
                    algebra and fluxions, and we now do the same in regard to geometry. The early
                    writers are not so much mentioned for their excellence, as from a wish to give a
                    faithful portraiture of the state and progress of the science at different
                    periods. The works on geometry in the last century are too numerous to be all
                    specified. Many have fallen into obscurity. Almost all are mere transcripts from
                    Euclid; indeed, generally speaking, their excellence is in proportion to the
                    fidelity with which they have copied the ancient.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">General Notions of Geometrical Magnitude.</hi></p>
                <p>Our notions of geometrical magnitudes are obtained by the contemplation of a <hi
                    rend="italic">body,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">solid.</hi> We readily understand
                    that this is extended in three directions; that is, it has length, breadth, and
                    thickness. The outside or boundary of a solid, that which separates the
                    particular space it occupies from space in general, is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">surface</hi> or <hi rend="italic">superficies.</hi> A surface,
                    then, is not conceived as having any thickness; it has only length and
                    breadth.</p>
                <p>A surface has a boundary; something which encloses it, or separates any portion
                    of it from the remainder. This boundary, which has no thickness, nor breadth,
                    but length only, is a <hi rend="italic">line.</hi></p>
                <p>Again, there is something which terminates a line, indicating where it begins and
                    where it ends, or which may <pb break="no" facs="nls:193519583"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-9583-0432"/>separate it into distinct portions. This is a
                    point, which has neither thickness, length, nor breadth. These three kinds of
                    magnitude, viz. solids, surfaces, and lines, are the objects of geometrical
                    discussion.</p>
                <p>There is no limit to the number of lines, and surfaces, and solids, which may be
                    considered in geometry. The elements of the science, however, treat only of a
                    few of these: Straight lines, circles, rectilineal plane figures, and their
                    affections, constitute one part of geometry; another treats of the intersections
                    of planes, of solids bounded by planes, and of the three round bodies, viz. the
                    cylinder, the cone, and the sphere. This diversity of objects leads to the
                    division of the subject into two parts, one which treats of figures on a plane,
                    and another the geometry of solids.</p>
                <p>PART I.—OF LINES AND FIGURES UPON A PLANE.</p>
                <p>SECT. I—PRINCIPLES OF GEOMETRY.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Definitions.</hi></p>
                <p>I. Geometry is a science which treats of the properties and relations of
                    quantities having extension, and which are called magnitudes. Extension is
                    distinguished into length, breadth, and thickness.</p>
                <p>II. A <hi rend="italic">Point</hi> is that which has position, but not
                    magnitude.</p>
                <p>III. A <hi rend="italic">Line</hi> is that which has only length. Hence the
                    extremities of a line are points, and the intersections of one line with another
                    are also points.</p>
                <p>IV. A <hi rend="italic">Straight or Right Line</hi> is the shortest way from on
                    point to another.</p>
                <p>V. Every line which is neither straight nor composed of straight lines is a <hi
                    rend="italic">Curve Line.</hi> Thus AB is a straight line, ACDB is a line made
                    up of straight lines, and AEB is a curve line.</p>
                <p>VI. A <hi rend="italic">Superficies</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Surface</hi> is
                    that which has only length and breadth. Įlence the extremities of a superficies
                    are lines, and the intersections of one superficies with another are also
                    lines.</p>
                <p>VII. A <hi rend="italic">Plane Superficies</hi> is that in which any two points
                    being taken, the straight line between them lies wholly in that superficies.</p>
                <p>VIII. Every superficies which is neither plane nor composed of plane superficies,
                    is a <hi rend="italic">Curve Superficies.</hi></p>
                <p>IX. A <hi rend="italic">Solid</hi> is that which has length, breadth, and
                    thickness. Hence the boundaries of a solid are superficies; and the boundary
                    which is common to two solids which are contiguous, is a superficies.</p>
                <p>X. A <hi rend="italic">Plane Rectilineal Angle</hi> is the inclination of two
                    straight lines to one another, which meet together, but are not in the same
                    straight line. The point in which the lines meet one another is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vertex</hi> of the angle.</p>
                <p>When there is only one angle at a point, it may be expressed by the letter placed
                    at that point; thus the angle contained by the lines EF and EG may be called the
                    angle E. If, however, there be several angles, as at B, then each is expressed
                    by three letters, one of which is the letter that stands at the vertex of the
                    angle, and the others are the letters that stand somewhere upon the lines
                    containing the angle, the letter at the vertex being placed between the other
                    two. Thus the angle contained by the lines BA and BD is called the angle ABD or
                    DBA.</p>
                <p>Angles, in common with other quantities, admit of addition, subtraction,
                    multiplication, and division. Thus the sum of the angles ABD and ABC is the
                    angle DBC; the difference of the angles DBC and ABD is the angle ABC.</p>
                <p>XI. When a straight line standing on another straight line makes the adjacent
                    angles equal to one another, each of them is called a <hi rend="italic">Right
                    Angle,</hi> and the straight line which stands on the other is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">Perpendicular</hi> to it. Thus, if DC meet AB, and make the angles
                    ACD, DCB equal to one another, each of them is a right angle, and DC is a
                    perpendicular to AB.</p>
                <p>XII. An <hi rend="italic">Obtuse Angle</hi> is that which is greater than a right
                    angle, and an <hi rend="italic">Acute Angle</hi> is that which is less than a
                    right angle. Thus ABC being supposed a right angle, DBC is an obtuse angle, and
                    EBC an acute angle.</p>
                <p>XIII. <hi rend="italic">Parallel Straight Lines</hi> are such as are in the same
                    plane, and which being produced ever so far both ways, do not meet.</p>
                <p>XIV. A <hi rend="italic">Plane Figure</hi> is a plane terminated everywhere by
                    lines.</p>
                <p>If the lines be straight, the space which they enclose is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">Rectilineal</hi> figure, or a <hi rend="italic">Polygon,</hi> and
                    the lines themselves constitute the <hi rend="italic">Perimeter of</hi> the
                    polygon.</p>
                <p>XV. When a polygon has three sides (which is the smallest number it can have), it
                    is called a <hi rend="italic">Triangle</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> when it has
                    four, it is called a <hi rend="italic">Quadrilateral;</hi> when it has five, a
                    <hi rend="italic">Pentagon</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> when six, a <hi
                    rend="italic">Hexagon, &amp;c.</hi></p>
                <p>XVI. An <hi rend="italic">Equilateral</hi> triangle is that which has three equal
                    sides (fig. 7); an <hi rend="italic">Isosceles</hi> triangle is that which has
                    only two equal sides (fig. 8); and a <hi rend="italic">Scalene</hi> triangle is
                    that which has all its sides unequal (fig. 10).</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193519596" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9596-0433"/>
                <p>XVII. A <hi rend="italic">Right-angled</hi> triangle is that which has a right
                    angle; the side opposite to the right angle is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hypothenuse.</hi> Thus in the triangle ABC, having the angle at B a right
                    angle, the side AC is the hypothenuse.</p>
                <p>XVIII. An <hi rend="italic">Obtuse-angled</hi> triangle is that which has an
                    obtuse angle (fig-10); and an <hi rend="italic">acute-angled</hi> triangle is
                    that which has three acute angles (fig. 11).</p>
                <p>XIX. Of quadrilateral figures, a <hi rend="italic">square</hi> is that which has
                    all its sides equal, and all its angles right angles (fig. 12). A <hi
                    rend="italic">Rectangle</hi> is that which has aD it≡ angles right angles, but
                    not all its sides equal (fig. 13). A <hi rend="italic">Rhombus</hi> is that
                    which has all its sides equal, but its ang es are not right angles (fig- ∏)∙ A
                    <hi rend="italic">Parallelogram, or ^omboul,</hi> is that which has its opposite
                    sides parallel (tig. lö). A <hi rend="italic">Trapezoid</hi> is that which has
                    only two of i« opposite sides parallel (fig· 1 <hi rend="superscript">
                    6</hi>)∙</p>
                <p>XX. A <hi rend="italic">Diagonal</hi> is a straight line which joins the vertices
                    of two angles, which are not adjacent to each other, such as AC in fig. 42.</p>
                <p>XXI. An <hi rend="italic">Equilateral Polygon</hi> is that which has all its
                    sides equal; and an <hi rend="italic">Equiangular Polygon</hi> is that which has
                    all its angles equal. If a polygon be both equilateral and equiangular, it is
                    called a <hi rend="italic">Regular Polygon.</hi></p>
                <p>XXII. Two polygons are <hi rend="italic">equilateral</hi> between themselves when
                    the sides of the one are equal to the sides of the other, each to each, and in
                    the same order; that is, when in going about each of the figures in the same
                    direction, the first side of the one is equal to the first side of the other;
                    the second side of the one is equal to the second side of the other; the third
                    to the third, and soon. The same is to be understood of two polygons which are
                    <hi rend="italic">equiangular</hi> between themselves.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Explanation of Terms.</hi></p>
                <p>An <hi rend="italic">Axiom</hi> is a proposition the truth of which is evident at
                    first sight.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">Theorem</hi> is a truth which becomes evident by a process of
                    reasoning called <hi rend="italic">Demonstration.</hi></p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Explanation of Signs.</hi></p>
                <p>That the demonstrations may be more concise, we shall make use of the following
                    signs borrowed from algebra; and in employing them we shall take for granted
                    that the reader is acquainted with at least the notation and first principles of
                    that branch of mathematics.</p>
                <p>To express that two quantities are equal, the sign = is put between them; thus A
                    = B signifies that the quantity denoted by A is equal to the quantity denoted by
                    B.</p>
                <p>To express that A is less than B they are written thus, A-≤.B.</p>
                <p>To express that A is greater than B they are written thus, A B.</p>
                <p>The sign + (read <hi rend="italic">plus')</hi> written between the letters which
                    denote two quantities, indicates that the quantities are to be added together;
                    thus A + B means the sum of the quantities A and B.</p>
                <p>The sign — (read <hi rend="italic">minus)</hi> written between two letters means
                    the excess of the one quantity above the other; thus A — B means the excess of
                    the quantity denoted by A above the quantity denoted by B. The signs + and —
                    will sometimes occur in the same expression; thus A + C — D means that D is to
                    be subtracted from the sum of A and C; also A — D + C means the same thing.</p>
                <p>The sign × put between two quantities means their product if they be considered
                    as numbers; but if they be considered as lines, it signifies a rectangle having
                    these lines for its length and breadth; thus A × B means the product of two
                    numbers A and B; or else a rectangle having A and B for the sides about one of
                    its right angles. We shall likewise indicate the product of two quantities, in
                    some cases, by writing the letters close together; thus mA will be used to
                    express the product of m and A, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193519609"

                    common notation in algebra.</p>
                <p>The expression A <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> means the square of the quantity
                    A, and A’ means the cube of A; also PQ <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> and PQ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> mean, the one the square, and the other the cube, of
                    a line whose extremities are the points P and Q.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the sign √ indicates a root to be extracted; thus √A × B means
                    the square root of the product of A and B.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Axioms.</hi></p>

                <p>Let the points which are common to the two lines be A and B; in the first place
                    it is evident that they must*· coincide entirely between A and B; otherwise two

                    straight line, the angle FCE is a right angle (1 Cor. 1); and because ACD is a
                    straight line, the angle FCD is also a right angle, therefore the angle FCE is
                    equal to FCD, a part to the whole, which is impossible; therefore the straight

                <p>For if CB is not the line AC produced, let CE be that line produced, then, ACE
                    being a straight line, the angles ACD, DCE are together equal to two right

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Definitions.</hi></p>
                <p>I. A <hi rend="italic">Circle</hi> is a plane figure contained by one line, which
                    is called the <hi rend="italic">circumference,</hi> and is such that all
                    straight lines drawn from a certain point within the figure to the circumference
                    are equal to one another.</p>
                <p>And this point is called the <hi rend="italic">centre</hi> of the circle.</p>
                <p>II. Every straight line CA, CE, CD, &amp;c. drawn from the centre to the
                    circumference, is called a <hi rend="italic">Radius</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Semidiameter</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and every straight line, such as AB,
                    which passes through the centre, and is terminated both ways by the
                    circumference, is called a <hi rend="italic">Diameter.</hi></p>
                <p>Hence it follows that all the radii of a circle are equal, and all the diameters
                    are also equal, each being the double of the radius.</p>
                <p>III. An <hi rend="italic">Arch</hi> of a circle is any portion of its
                    circumference, as FHG.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">chard</hi> or <hi rend="italic">subtense</hi> of an arch is
                    the straight line FG which joins its extremities.</p>
                <p>IV. A <hi rend="italic">Segment</hi> of a circle is the figure contained by an
                    arch and its chord. If the figure be the half of the circle it is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">Semicircle.</hi><hi rend="italic">Note.</hi> Every chord
                    corresponds to two arches, and consequently to two segments; but in speaking of
                    these, it is always the smallest that is meant, unless die contrary be
                    expressed.</p>
                <p>V. A <hi rend="italic">Sector</hi> of a circle is the figure contained by an arch
                    DE and the two radii CD, CE, drawn to the extremities of the arch. If the radii
                    be at right angles to each other, it is called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quadrant.</hi></p>
                <p>VI. A straight line is said to be <hi rend="italic">placed,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">applied,</hi> in a circle, when its extremities are in the
                    circumference of the circle, as FG.</p>
                <p>VII. A rectilineal figure is said to be <hi rend="italic">inscribed</hi> in a
                    circle, when the vertices of all its angles are upon the circumference of the
                    circle; in this case, the circle is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >circumscribed</hi> about the figure.</p>
                <p>VIII. A straight line is said to <hi rend="italic">touch</hi> a circle, or to be
                    a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193519674" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9674-0439"/><hi

                    point only; such, for example, is BD, fig. 49. Ί he point A, which is common to
                    the straight line and circle, is called <hi rend="italic">the Point op
                    Contact.</hi></p>
                <p>IX. A polygon is said to be <hi rend="italic">described</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >circumscribed</hi> about a circle, when all its sides are tangents to the
                    circle; and in this case, the circle is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >inscribed</hi> in the polygon.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> I.—Any diameter AB divides the circle, and its
                    circumference, into two equal parts. (Fig. 43.)</p>
                <p>For if the figure AEB be applied to AFB, so that the base AB may be common to
                    both, the curve line AEB must fall exactly upon the curve line AFB; otherwise
                    there would be points in the one, or the other, unequally distant from the
                    centre, which is contrary to the definition of a circle.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> II.—Every chord is less than the diameter.</p>
                <p>Let the radii CA, CD be drawn from the centre to the extremities of the chord AD;

                <p>SECT. III.—OF PROPORTION.</p>
                <p>In comparing two quantities of the same kind, in respect of magnitude, we are led
                    to consider how often the one quantity contains either the whole or some part of
                    the other quantity. To resolve this question, we must find a <hi rend="italic"
                    >common measure</hi> of the quantities; that is, a quantity that is contained in
                    each a certain number of times exactly.</p>
                <p>Let the quantities be two given straight lines AB, CD; their common measure (if
                    they have one) may be found by proceeding as follows:</p>
                <p>Take the less line CD out of the greater AB, as often as possible, and let BE be
                    the remainder. Next take the remainder BE out of the line CD, as often as it can
                    be had, and let DF be the second remainder.</p>
                <p>Again, take the second remainder DF out of the first BE, as often as it can be
                    had, and let BG be the third remainder. Take the third remainder BG out of the
                    second DF as often as possible, and proceed in this way, until a remainder be
                    found, which is contained an exact number of times in the preceding. This last
                    remainder will be a common measure of the two lines.</p>
                <p>For example, let CD be contained twice in AB, with the remainder BE; and BE once
                    in CD, with a remainder<pb break="no" facs="nls:193519713"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-9713-0442"/> DF; and DF once in BE, with a remainder BG, and
                    let BG be contained twice exactly in DF; then</p>
                <p>DF = 2 BG</p>
                <p>EB = DF + BG = 3 BG CD = EB + DF = 5 BG AB = 2 CD + EB = 13 BG.</p>
                <p>Thus it appears, that BG is contained thirteen times in AB, and five times in CD;
                    therefore BG is a common measure of the two lines. Hence also we see, that the
                    relation which AB bears to CD, in regard to magnitude, consists in the former
                    containing thirteen such parts as the latter contains five.</p>
                <p>In this example it has been supposed that a remainder is at last found, which is
                    contained an exact number of times in the remainder immediately preceding. But
                    this will not always happen. If the given lines be the diagonal of a squares and
                    its side, and in innumerable other cases, it may be demonstrated, that no one of
                    the succeeding remainders can be contained an exact number of times in that
                    before it: therefore such quantities cannot have a common measure. Hence
                    quantities are distinguished into two kinds, viz. such as admit of a common
                    measure, and such as do not admit of a common measure. The former are said to be
                    <hi rend="italic">commensurable,</hi> and the latter <hi rend="italic"
                    >incommensurable.</hi></p>
                <p>The doctrine of proportion, as delivered in the 5th book of Euclid’s Elements,
                    applies alike to commensurable and incommensurable quantities; the theory may,
                    however, be rendered considerably easier, by confining it to commensurable
                    quantities. It is this limited view of the subject that is here given.
                    Experience proves that Euclid’s fifth book is difficult to be understood by the
                    generality of readers; and this fact may serve as an excuse for deviating,
                    unwillingly, from the illustrious ancient.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Definitions.</hi></p>
                <p>I. When one quantity contains another a certain number of times, without a
                    remainder, the former is said to be a <hi rend="italic">multiple</hi> of the
                    latter, and the latter a <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of the former.</p>
                <p>II. When several quantities are multiples of as many others, and each contains
                    its part the same number of times, the former are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >equimultiples</hi> of the latter, and the latter <hi rend="italic">like
                    parts</hi> of the former.</p>
                <p>III. Between any two finite magnitudes of the same kind there subsists a certain
                    relation, in respect of quantity, which is called their <hi rend="italic"
                    >ratio.</hi> The two magnitudes compared are called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >terms</hi> of the ratio. The first the <hi rend="italic">antecedent,</hi> and
                    the last the <hi rend="italic">consequent.</hi></p>
                <p>IV. If there be four quantities, and if the first contain a part of the second
                    (without a remainder) just as often as the third contains a like part of the
                    fourth, the ratio of the first to the second is said to be equal to the ratio of
                    the third to the fourth; or the first is said to have to the second the same
                    ratio which the third has to the fourth.</p>
                <p>V. The terms of any number of equal ratios are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >proportionals.</hi><hi rend="italic">Note.</hi> When four quantities A, B, C,
                    D, are proportionals, it is usual to say, that A is to B, as C to D, and to
                    write them thus, A: B:: C: D; or thus, A: B = C: D.</p>
                <p>VI. Quantities are said to be continual proportionals when the ratio of the first
                    to the second, of the second to the third, of the third to the fourth, and so
                    on, are all equal.</p>
                <p>VII. When three quantities are continual proportionals, the second is said to be
                    a mean proportional between the other two.</p>
                <p>VIII. In proportionals, the antecedent terms are called homologous to one
                    another; as also the consequents to one another.</p>
                <p>IX. When there is any number of quantities of the same kind, the first is said to
                    have to the last the ratio compounded of the ratio which the first has to the
                    second, and of the ratio which the second has to the third, and of the ratio
                    which the third has to the fourth, and so on, to the last magnitude.</p>
                <p>X. If three magnitudes are continual proportionals, the ι ratio of the first to
                    the third is said to be duplicate of the! ratio of the first to the second.</p>
                <p>XI. If four magnitudes are continual proportionals, the i ratio of the first to
                    the fourth is said to be triplicate of the ratio of the first to the second, or
                    of the ratio of the second to the third, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The following technical words are employed to signify i certain ways of changing
                    either the order or magnitude 1 of proportionals, so as that they still continue
                    propor- , tionals.</p>

                <p>2. Quantities having the same ratio to the same quantity, or to equal quantities,

                <p>SECT. IV.—THE PROPORTIONS OF FIGURES.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Definitions.</hi></p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Equivalent Figures</hi> are such as have equal surfaces.</p>
                <p>Two figures may be equivalent, although very dissimilar; thus a circle may be
                    equivalent to a square, a triangle to a rectangle, and so of other figures.</p>
                <p>We shall give the denomination of <hi rend="italic">equal</hi> figures to those
                    which, being applied the one upon the other, coincide entirely: thus, two
                    circles having the same radius are equal; and two triangles having three sides
                    of the one equal to three sides of the other, each to each, are also equal.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193519752" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9752-0445"/>
                <p>II. Two figures are <hi rend="italic">similar,</hi> when the angles of the one
                    are equal to the angles of the other, each to each; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >homologous</hi> sides proportionals. The homologous sides are those which have
                    the same position in the two figures; or which are adjacent to the equal angles.
                    The angles themselves are called <hi rend="italic">homologous angles.</hi></p>
                <p>Two equal figures are always similar, but similar figures may be very
                    unequal.</p>
                <p>III. In two different circles, <hi rend="italic">similar sectors, similar arches,
                    similar segments,</hi> are such as correspond to equal angles at the centre.
                    Thus the angle A being equal to the angle 0, the arch BC is similar to the arch
                    DE, and the sector ABC to the sector ODE, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>IV. The <hi rend="italic">Altitude of a parallelogram</hi> is the perpendicular
                    which measures the distance between the opposite sides or bases AB, CD.</p>
                <p>V. The <hi rend="italic">Altitude of a triangle</hi> is the perpendicular AD
                    drawn from the vertical angle A upon the base BC.</p>
                <p>VI. The <hi rend="italic">Altitude of a trapezoid</hi> is the perpendicular EF
                    drawn between its two parallel bases AB, CD.</p>
                <p>VΠ. The <hi rend="italic">Area</hi> and the surface of a figure are terms of
                    nearly the same signification. The term <hi rend="italic">area,</hi> however, is
                    more particularly used to denote the superficial quantity of the figure in
                    respect of its being measured, or compared with other surfaces.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> I.—Parallelograms which have equal bases and
                    equal altitudes are equivalent.</p>
                <p>Let AB be the common base of the parallelograms ABCD, EBAF, which being supposed
                    to have the same altitude, the sides DC, FE opposite to the bases will lie in DE
                    a line parallel to AB. Now, from the nature of a parallelogram, AD = BC, and AF
                    = BE; for the same reason DC = AB, and FE = AB; therefore DC = FE, and taking
                    away DC and FE from the same line DE, the remainders CE and DF are, equal; hence
                    the triangles DAF, CBĽ have three sides of the one equal to three sides of the
                    other, each to each; and consequently are equa! (10,1). Now, <hi

                <p>Hence it appears, that the product of the base by the altitude of a rectangle may
                    be taken for its measure, observing that by such product is meant that of the
                    number of linear units in the base by the number of linear units in the
                    altitude. This measure is however not absolute, but relative; for it must be
                    supposed, that in comparing <pb break="no" facs="nls:193519765"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-9765-0446"/>I one rectangle with another, the sides of both
                    are measured by the same linear unit. For example, if the base of a rectangle A
                    be three units, and its altitude 10, the i rectangle is represented by 3 × 10,
                    or 30; this number considered by itself has no meaning; but if we have a second
                    rectangle B, the base of which is twelve units and the altitude seven, this
                    second rectangle shall be represented by the number 12 × 7, or 84; and hence it
                    may be concluded that the two rectangles are to each other as 30 to 84;
                    therefore, if in estimating any superficies the rectangle A be taken for the
                    measuring unit, the rectangle B shall have for its absolute measure f⅞, that is,
                    it shall be ⅜⅜ superficial units.</p>
                <p>It is more common, as well as more simple, to take for a superficial unit a
                    square, the side of which is an unit in length, and then the measure which we
                    have regarded only as relative becomes absolute: for example, the number 30,
                    which is the measure of the rectangle A, represents thirty superficial units, or
                    thirty squares, each having its side equal to an unit. To illustrate this, see
                    fig. 70.</p>

                    angles, CA and AL constitute a straight line parallel to BH (3, 1); and thus the

                    consequently AOB = 2AOG = two fifths of two right angles, equal one fifth of
                    four right angles, therefore the arch AB is one fifth of the whole
                    circumference. If we now suppose straight lines BC, CD, DE, to be applied in the

                    be joined, the figure thus formed will be an equilateral pentagon, and it is

                <p>Let the radius of the circle = 1, then the sides of the inscribed square being
                    the hypothenuse of a right-angled triangle of which the radii are the sides (see
                    fig. 115), the area of the inscribed square will be 2 (13, 4), and the
                    circumscribed square, being the square of the diameter, will be 4. Now,
                    retaining the notation of last problem, if we make A = 2, and B = 4, the
                    formulae <hi rend="italic">a</hi> =√A×B, 2A X B</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">b ≡</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> a</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >^--</hi> give us α = 2∙8284271, &amp;c. the area of the inscribed octagon, and

                    octagon. By substituting these numbers in the formula, instead of A and B, we
                    shall obtain the areas of the inscribed and circumscribing polygons of 16 sides;
                    and thence we may find those of 32 sides, and so on, as in the following

                <p>Hence it appears that the area of a regular polygon of 32768 sides inscribed in
                    the circle, and of a similar polygon<pb break="no" facs="nls:193519908"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-9908-0457"/> described about it, differ so little from each
                    other that the numbers which express them are the same as far as the eighth
                    decimal place. And as the circle is greater than the one polygon, and less than
                    the other, its area will be nearly 3∙ 1415926. But the area is the product of
                    the radius and the half of the circumference; therefore the radius being unity,
                    half the circumference is 3∙1415926 nearly; and the radius is to half the
                    circumference, or the diameter is to the circumference, nearly as 1 to
                    31415926.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scholium.</hi> In this way the ratio of the diameter to the
                    circumference may be found to any degree of accuracy; but neither by this, nor
                    any other method yet known, can the ratio be exactly determined.</p>
                <p>Archimedes, by means of inscribed and circumscribed polygons of 96 sides, found
                    that the diameter is to the circumference as 7 to 22 nearly, which ratio is
                    nearer to the truth than can be expressed by any smaller numbers; and Metius
                    found it to be more nearly as 113 to S55. Both of these expressions are
                    convenient on account of the smallness of the numbers, but later mathematicians
                    have carried the approximation to a much greater degree of accuracy. Thus, it
                    has been found that the diameter being 1, the circumference is greater than 3∙
                    1415926535897932, but less than the same number having its last figure increased
                    by unity; and some have even had the patience to carry the approximation as far
                    as the 150th place of decimals.</p>
                <p>PART II.—GEOMETRY OF SOLIDS.</p>
                <p>SECT. I.—OF PLANES AND SOLID ANGLES.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Definitions.</hi></p>
                <p>I. A straight line is <hi rend="italic">perpendicular,</hi> or at right angles,
                    to a plane, when it is perpendicular to every straight line which it meets in
                    that plane. The plane is also perpendicular to the line.</p>
                <p>II. A line is <hi rend="italic">parallel</hi> to a plane when they cannot meet
                    each other, although both be produced. The plane is also parallel to the
                    line.</p>
                <p>III. Parallel planes are such as cannot meet each other, though produced.</p>
                <p>IV. It will be demonstrated (Theor. 3) that the common section of two planes is a
                    straight line; this being premised, the <hi rend="italic">inclination</hi> of
                    two planes is the angle contained by two straight lines drawn perpendicular to
                    the line which is their common section, from any point in it, the one
                    perpendicular being drawn in the one plane, and the other in the other
                    plane.</p>
                <p>This angle may be either acute or obtuse.</p>
                <p>V. If it be a right angle, the two planes are perpendicular to each other.</p>
                <p>VI. A <hi rend="italic">solid angle</hi> is that which is made by the meeting of
                    more than two plane angles, which are not in the same plane, in one point. Thus
                    the solid angle V is formed by the plane angles AVB, BVC, CVD, DVA. (Fig.
                    133.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> I.—One part of a straight line cannot be in a
                    plane and an⅛ther part above it.</p>
                <p>For from the definition of a plane (Sect. 1, Part 1), it is manifest, that if a
                    straight line coincide with a plane in two points, it must be wholly i <hi
                    rend="subscript"> n</hi> the plane.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> II—Two straight lines which cut each other in a
                    plane determine its position; that is, the plane can coincide with these lines
                    only in one position.</p>
                <p>Let the straight lines AB, AC cut each other in A; conceive a plane to pass
                    through AB, and to be turned about that line, till it pass through the point C;
                    and this it can manifestly do òhly in one position; then, as the points A and C
                    are in the plane, the whole line AC must be in the plane; therefore there is
                    only one position in which the plane can coincide with the same two lines AB,
                    AC.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> Therefore a triangle ABC, or three points A, B, C,
                    not in a straight line, determine the position of a plane.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> III.—If two planes AB, CD intersect each other;
                    their intersection is a straight line.</p>
                <p>Let E and F be two points in the line of common section, and let a straight line
                    EF be drawn between them; then the line EF must be in the plane AB (Der. 1), and
                    the same line must also be in the plane CD; therefore it must be the common
                    section of them both.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> IV.—If a straight line AP be perpendicular to
                    two straight lines PB, PC at P, the point of their intersection; it Will also be

                    Because DQ is parallel to PB, and PD = DC; therefore BQ = QC, and BC is bisected
                    in Q. Hence in the triangle BAC,</p>

                    hypothesis right-angled triangles, AB <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> — BP <hi

                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> — 2PQ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, and therefore

                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = AQ*; therefore the triangle APQ is right-angled at
                    P (Schol. 15, 4, Part 1), and consequently AP is perpendicular to the plane MN
                    (Der. 1).</p>

                <p>Con. 1. The perpendicular AP is shorter than any oblique line AO, therefore it

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cob.</hi> 2. From the same point P in a plane no more than
                    one perpendicular can be drawn. For if it be possible that there can be two
                    perpendiculars, conceive a plane to pass through them, and to intersect the
                    plane MN in the straight ∏ne PQ; then these perpendiculars will be in the same
                    plane, and both perpendicular to the same line PQ, at the same point P in that
                    line, which is impossible.</p>
                <p>It is also impossible that from a point without a plane two perpendiculars can be
                    drawn to the plane; for if the straight lines AP, AQ could be two such
                    perpendiculars, then the triangle APQ would have two right angles, which is
                    impossible.</p>

                <p>Let a plane pass through the parallel lines AP, DE, and intersect the plane MN in

                    because AP is perpendicular to the plane MN, so that APB, APC are right angles,
                    AB = AC, therefore ABC is an isosceles triangle; and since its base BC is
                    bisected at D, BC is perpendicular to AD (Schol. 11, 1, P. I.) î but by
                    construction BC is perpendicular to PD; therefore (4) BC or BD is perpendicular
                    to the plane passing through the lines AD and PD, or AP and DE; hence BD is
                    perpendicular to DE, but PD is also perpendicular to DE (19, 1, P. I.),
                    therefore DE is perpendicular to the two lines DP, DB; and therefore it is

                <p>Con. Two right prisms which have equal bases and equal altitudes are equal to one
                    another. If the equal angles of the lower bases follow each other in the same

                    will be respectively equal to the three planes which contain a solid angle of
                    the other prism, and will be similarly situated; and when the one solid angle is
                    applied to the other, these planes will coincide, and the prisms will exactly
                    coincide. If the equal angles of the lower base follow each other in a contrary
                    order, then, by inverting one of the prisms, so that its upper may become its
                    lower base, the angles of the two bases will follow-each other in the same

                    is only necessary to prove that the remainders, viz. the solids BaÁDrf, FeFHÄ
                    are equivalent to each other.</p>
                <p>Because BAEF, BαeF are parallelograms, therefore AE = BF = <hi rend="italic"

                <p>There may be three cases, according as .EI is greater or smaller than EF, or
                    equal to it; but the demonstration is the same for them all. In the first place
                    we shall prove that the triangular prism AĽI-DHM is equal to the triangular
                    prism BFK-CGL.</p>
                <p>Since AE is parallel to BF, and HE to GF, the angle AEI = BFK, HEI = GFK,andHEA =
                    GFB. Of these six angles, the three first form the solid angle E, and the three
                    others form the solid angle F; therefore, since the plane angles are equal each
                    to each, and sipι ilarly situated, the solid angles E and F are equal. Now, if
                    the prism AEI-DHM be applied to the prism BFK-CGL, so that their bases AEI, BFK,
                    which are equal, may coincide with each other; then, because the solid angle E
                    is equal to the solid angle F, the side EH shall fall upon FG, and this is all
                    that is necessary to prove that the two prisms coincide entirely; for the base
                    AEI and the edge EH determine the prism AEM, and the base BFK and the edge FG
                    determine the prism BFL (1); therefore the prisms are equal. Now, if from the
                    solid AEL, the prism AEM be taken away, there will remain the parallelepiped
                    AIL; and if from the same solid AEL, the prism BFL be taken away, there will
                    remain the parallelepiped AEG; therefore the parallelepipeds AIL, AEG are

                    Then, because EF and AB are equal and parallel, as also IK and AB, EF is equal
                    and parallel to IK (Cor. 2, 5, 1); for a similar reason GF is equal and parallel

                    of a rectangular parallelopiped by its altitude, or the product of its three
                    dimensions, may be taken as its numerical measure; and it is upon this principle
                    that all other solids are estimated. When two parallelepipeds are compared by
                    means of their bases and altitudes, their bases must be considered as measured
                    by the same superficial unit, and their altitudes by the same linear unit; thus,
                    if P and Q denote two parallelepipeds, and the base of P contain three such
                    equal spaces as that of Q contains four; and the altitude of P contains two such
                    equal lines as that of Q contains five, then P: Q ≡ 3 × 2: 4 × 5 = 6: 20.</p>
                <p>If all the dimensions of each solid be used in comparing them, then, the same
                    linear unit must be employed in estimating all the dimensions of both solids;
                    thus, if the length, breadth, and height of the solid P be 4, 3, and 6 linear
                    units, respectively; and those of Q, 7, 2, and 5, of the same units; then P:Q =
                    4×3×6:7×2×5 = 72: 70.</p>
                <p>As lines are compared by considering how often each contains some other line
                    taken as a measuring unit, and surfaces, by considering how often each contains
                    a square whose side is that unit; so solids may be compared, by considering how
                    often each contains a cube, the side or ιdge of which is the same linear unit.
                    Accordingly, the dimensions of the parallelepipeds P and Q being as above, the
                    proportion P: Q = 72: 70 may be considered as indicating that P contains 72 such
                    equal cubes as Q contains 70.</p>

                <p>1. Any parallelepiped is equivalent to a rectangular parallelepiped of the same

                    equal to the product of its base by their common altitude; therefore the
                    solidity of the whole prism is equal to the product of the sum of all their

                    possible (15); also let a series of prisms, <hi rend="italic">ce,fg, hk,

                    be sections of the pyramids at equal distances from their bases, therefore they

                <p>Let GH be the axis, and AGHD the rectangle, which by its revolution describes the
                    cylinder. Because HG is perpendicular to AG in every position of the revolving
                    rectangle, it is perpendicular to the plane of the circle described by AG; and
                    because AD, the line which describes the cylindric superficies, is parallel to
                    GH, it is also perpendicular to the plane of that circle (5, 1). Now when by the
                    revolution of the rectangle AGHD the .point A coincides with the point É, the
                    line EF will coincide with AD, and thus will be wholly in the cylindric

                    from the same point, which is impossible (2 Cor. 4, 1).</p>

                    equivalent bases, and the same altitude, are equal to one another.</p>
                <p>Let ABCD be a cylinder and EF a parallelepiped having equivalent bases, viz. the
                    circle AGB and the parallelogram EH, and having also equal altitudes; the
                    cylinder ABCD is equal to the parallelepiped EF. If not, let them be unequal;
                    and first let the cylinder be less than the parallelepiped EF; and from the
                    parallelepiped EF let there be cut off a part EQ by a plane PQ parallel to NF,
                    equal to the cylinder ABCD. In the circle AGB inscribe the polygon AGKBLM that
                    shall differ from the circle by a space less than the parallelogram PH (1 Cor.
                    2, 6, P. I.), and cut off from the parallelogram EH a part OR equal to the
                    polygon AGKBLM, then it is manifest that the parallelogram OR is greater than
                    the parallelogram OP, therefore the point R will fall between P and N. On the
                    polygon AGKBLM let an upright prism be constituted of the same altitude with the
                    cylinder, which will therefore be less than the cylinder, because it is within
                    it (1); and if through the point R a plane RS parallel to NF be made to pass, it
                    will cut off the parallelepiped ES equal to the prism AGBC, because its base is
                    equal to that of the prism, and its altitude is the same. But the prism AGBC is
                    less than the cylinder ABCD, and the cylinder ABCD is equal to the
                    parallelopiped EQ, by hypothesis; therefore, ES is less than EQ, and it is also
                    greater, which is impossible. The cylinder ABCD therefore is not less than the
                    parallelepiped EF; and in the same manner it may be shown not to be greater than
                    EF, therefore they are equal.</p>

                    and the same altitude; the cone is the third part of the cylinder.</p>
                <p>Let the cone ABCD and the cylinder BFKG have the same base, viz. the circle BCD,
                    and the same altitude, viz. the perpendicular from the point A upon the plane
                    BCD; the cone ABCD is the third part of the cylinder BFKG. If not, let the cone
                    ABCD be the third part of another cylinder LMNO having the same altitude with
                    the cylinder BFKG; but let the bases BCD, LIM be unequal, and first let BCD be
                    greater than LIM. Then, because the circle BCD is greater than the circle LIM, a
                    polygon may be inscribed in BCD that shall differ from it less than LIM does (1
                    Cor. 2, 6, P. I.), and which therefore will be greater than <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193520025" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0025-0466"/>LIM. Let this be the polygon
                    BECFD, and upon BECFD let there be constituted the pyramid ABECFD, and the prism
                    BCFKHG. Because the polygon BECFD is greater than the circle LIM, the prism
                    BCFKHG is greater than the cylinder LMNO, for they have the same altitude, but
                    the prism has the greater base. But the pyramid ABECFD is the third part of the
                    prism BCFHG (17, 1); therefore it is greater than the third part of the cylinder
                    LMNO. Now the cone ABECFD is by hypothesis the third part of the cylinder LMNO;
                    therefore, the pyramid ABECFD is greater than the cone ABCD, and it is also
                    less, because it is inscribed to the cone, which is impossible. Therefore the
                    cone ABCD is not less than the third part of the cylinder BFKG. And in the same
                    manner, by circumscribing a polygon about the circle BCD, it may be shown, that
                    the cone AB CD is not greater than the third part of the cylinder BFKG;
                    therefore, it is equal to the third part of the cylinder.</p>

                    about CD as an axis; a series of cylinders may be described about the solid, and

                    that the sum of the circumscribed cylinders shall exceed the sum of the
                    inscribed cylinders by less than any given solid S.</p>
                <p>Let S denote a solid which is a cylinder, having Bδ for the diameter of its base,

                    draw perpendiculars EF, GH, KL to meet the line AB in F, H, L. Construct the
                    inscribed rectangles AE, FG, HK, LD, also the circumscribed rectangles CF, EH,
                    GL, KB. By the rotation of the plane figure about the axis CD, these rectangles
                    will evidently generate a series of cylinders inscribed in the solid, and
                    another series described about it. Let the circumscribed cylinders, reckoned
                    from the bottom of the solid to the top, be denoted by V, X, Y, Z, and the

                    consequently will be less than V; but the lowest circumscribed cylinder V is
                    less than the solid S, because it has the same base (viz. the circle having for
                    its diameter B δ), and a less altitude KD, by construction; therefore the excess

                    the points of division, meeting the diagonal CE, in the points O, P, Q; the

                    the triangle CFE; construct also the rectangles CH, GL, KN, which will be
                    inscribed in the quadrant CFB. Suppose now the plane of the square to revolve
                    abôut its side CF as an axis; the triangle CFE will then generate a cone, which
                    will have DE for the diameter of its base, and C for its vertex; the quadrant
                    CFB will generate a hemisphere, having for its base a circle of which AB is a
                    diameter; and the square CBEF will generate a cylinder, having the same base and
                    altitude as the hemisphere: also, the rectangles described about the triangle
                    CFĖ will manifestly generate a series of cylinders circumscribing the cone; the
                    rectangles inscribed in the quadrant will generate a series of cylinders
                    inscribed in the hemisphere; and the rectangles CR, GS, KT, ME will generate a
                    series of cylinders which will compose a cylinder having the same base and
                    altitude as the hemisphere.</p>
                <p>The triangles CFE, CGO are manifestly similar, and CF = FE; therefore CG = GO. In
                    like manner, it may be proved that CK = KP and that CM = MQ.</p>
                <p>Join CH, and because CGH is a right-angled triangle, a circle described with CH
                    as a radius will be equal to two circles described with CG and GH as radii (2
                    Cor. 4, 6, Part I.), but CG = GO, and CH = GR; therefore a circle described with
                    GR as a radius will be equal to two circles described with GO and GH as radii;
                    hence again it follows, that the cylinder generated by the rectangle CR will be
                    equal to both the cylinders generated by the rectangles CO and CH, for they have
                    all the same altitude, and the base of the first is equal to the sum of the
                    bases of the other two. It may be demonstrated in the same manner that the
                    cylinder generated by the rectangle GS is equal to the sum of the cylinders
                    generated by the rectangles GP and GL, and the same of all the rest; therefore
                    the sum of the cylinders generated by the rectangles CR, GS, KT, ME is equal to
                    the two series of cylinders, one generated by the rectangles CO, GP, KQ, MÉ, and
                    the other generated by the rectangles CH, GL, KN; that is, a cylinder having the

                    of cylinders, one described about the cone, and the other described in the

                    circumscribing cylinder. (Fig. 154.)</p>
                <p>Let a figure be constructed exactly as is last proposition; and to abridge, let C
                    denote the cone, c the series of cylinders described about it, H the hemisphere,
                    <hi rend="italic">fι</hi> the cylinders described in it, and K the cylinder
                    having the same base and altitude as the hemisphere, or cone. Moreover, put <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193520038"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-0038-0467"/>for the difference between the cone and its
                    circumscribed cylinders, and d’ for the difference between the hemisphere and
                    its inscribed cylinders; then we have</p>
                <p>C + <hi rend="italic">d</hi> = c, and H = Ä + <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and
                    adding equals to equals,</p>
                <p>C+H + &lt;Z = c + A + d ’.</p>
                <p>But <hi rend="italic">c + h</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">K</hi>
                    (5); therefore, C + H + d= K + dζ and C + H + <hi rend="italic">d — d’</hi> = K,
                    also C + H = K + <hi rend="italic">d — d.</hi> Hence it appears that the
                    difference between C + H and K is equal to the difference between <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ct.</hi> Now <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    is less than the cylinder generated by the rotation of the rectangle ME (Cor. to
                    Prop. 4), and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is less than the cylinder generated by
                    the rectangle CR, which is equal to ME; therefore the difference between <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> must be less than the same
                    rectangle; hence the difference between C + H and K is less than the cylinder
                    generated by the revolution of the rectangle ME, ąr is less than a cylinder
                    having the same base as the cone, and the line FM for its altitude. From this we
                    may infer, that C + H is exactly equal to K; for if there can be any difference,
                    let it be a cylinder having the same base as the cone, and its altitude equal to
                    FV; then FM must be greater then FV; but the number of parts into which FC is
                    divided may be so great that FM may be less than F V; therefore C + H cannot be
                    unequal to K; and since C + H — K, and C = ⅜K (3), therefore H ≡≡ jK; that is,
                    the hemisphere is two thirds of its circumscribing cylinder; and taking the
                    doubles of these, the whole sphere is two thirds of its circumscribing
                    cylinder.</p>
