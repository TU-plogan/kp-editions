                    >Gray,</hi><hi rend="italic">Thomas,</hi> an eminent English poet, was the
                    youngest and only surviving son of Philip Gray, a citizen and money-scrivener of
                    London, and was born in Cornhill, on the 20th of December 1716. He was educated
                    at Eton, where he contracted a friendship with Horace Walpole, afterwards Earl
                    of Orford, and with Mr Richard West, son of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Mr
                    West and Mr Gray were both intended for the bar; but the former died early in
                    life, and the latter was diverted from that pursuit by an invitation to
                    accompany Mr Walpole in his travels, which he accepted, without any fixed plan
                    for his future life. During his travels, which included the customary tour
                    through France and Italy, he wrote a variety of letters to Mr West and to his
                    parents, which are printed with his poems, and full of interest. Architecture,
                    Gothic as well as Grecian, painting and music, with the manners and customs of
                    the people, were all studied by him with success. But, whilst at Reggio, an
                    unfortunate difference took place between him and Walpole, and they parted in
                    mutual displeasure. A great deal has been said of this quarrel, but the real
                    cause of it has never been sufficiently explained. Walpole, however, affected to
                    take the blame on himself, and in doing so he was very probably right. On his
                    return, Gray finding himself in narrow circumstances, yet with a mind indisposed
                    to active employment, retired to Cambridge, where he devoted himself to study;
                    and soon afterwards his friend West died. The melancholy impressed on him by
                    this event may be traced in his admired Elegy written in a Country Churchyard<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193523301" xml:id="kp-eb0710-3301-0718"/>; which is
                    believed to have been begun, if not finished, about this time, though the
                    conclusion, as it stands at present, is certainly different from what it was in
                    the original manuscript copy. The first impulse of hie sorrow for the death of
                    his friend gave birth to a tender sonnet in English, written on the model of
                    Petrarch; and also to a sublime apostrophe in hexameter verse, with which he
                    intended to commence one of his books <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Principiis Cogitandi.</hi></p>
                <p>From the winter of the year 1742 till the day of his death, his principal
                    residence was at Cambridge, whence he seldom was absent for any considerable
                    time, except between the years 1759 and 1762, when, on the opening of the
                    British Museum, he took lodgings in Southampton Row, in order to have access to
                    the Harleian and other manuscripts there deposited, from which he made several
                    curious extracts, amounting in all to a tolerably sized folia volume.</p>
                <p>About the year 1747, Mason, afterwards the editor of his poems, was introduced to
                    Gray. The former had written, a year or two before, some imitations of Milton’s
                    juvenile poems, particularly a Monody on the Death of Pope, and two pieces
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">II</hi><hi rend="italic">Bellicoso</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">II Pacifico</hi> on the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle; and the latter
                    had revised them at the request of a friend. This laid the foundation of an
                    intimacy which continued without interruption until the death of Gray.</p>
                <p>About the year 1750, Mr Gray having put the last touches to his Elegy written in
                    a Country Churchyard, communicated it to Walpole, who was too much charmed with
                    it to withhold it from his acquaintance. Accordingly it was shown about for some
                    time in manuscript, and received with all the applause which it so justly
                    merited. At last the publisher of one of the magazines having surreptitiously
                    obtained a copy, Gray wrote to Walpole, desiring that he would put the
                    manuscript into the hands of Mr Dodsley, and order him to print it immediately.
                    This proved the most popular of all our author’s publications. It passed through
                    eleven editions in a very short space of time, and was translated into Latin,
                    first by Ansty and Roberts, and afterwards by Lloyd.</p>
                <p>From July 1759 till the year 1762, Gray resided generally in London, with the
                    view, as we have already mentioned, of having more ready access to the British
                    Museum. In the summer of 1765 he undertook a journey to Scotland for the benefit
                    of his health, which was then in a precarious state, and having passed through
                    Edinburgh and Perth, he proceeded to Glammis Castle, the seat of Lord
                    Strathmore, where he resided for some time; after which he visited the north,
                    where he formed an acquaintance with Dr Beattie, then but little known beyond
                    the immediate circle of his friends at Aberdeen. Gray’s account of this journey
                    is praised by Dr Johnson as curious and elegant; “for,” says the doctor, “as his
                    comprehension was ample, his curiosity extended to all the works of art, all the
                    appearances of nature, and all the monuments of past events.” Part of the
                    summers of 1766 and 1767 he passed in journeys in England; and he had intended
                    to make a second tour in Scotland, but returned to London without accomplishing
                    his design. In July 1768 his grace the Duke of Grafton wrote him a polite
                    letter, informing him that his majesty had been graciously pleased to offer to
                    him the professorship of modem history in the university of Cambridge, then
                    vacant by the accidental death of Mr Brocket. This place was valuable in itself,
                    as the salary amounted to L.400 a year; but what rendered it particularly
                    acceptable to Mr Gray was its being given him without solicitation. He was
                    indeed remarkably disinterested or indifferent about money in all his pursuits.
                    Though his income, before this addition, was but small, he never readorwrote
                    with a view of rendering his labours useful to himself. He may be said to have
                    been one of the few personages connected with literature, especially the
                    poetical department, who are devoid of selfishness, and at the same time
                    attentive to economy; and he was also amongst mankind in general one of those
                    rare economists, who possess that talent, untinctured with the slightest stain
                    of avarice. When his circumstances were at the lowest, he gave away such sums in
                    private charity as would have done credit to an ampler purse. But what chiefly
                    deterred him from seeking any advantage by his literary pursuits, was a certain
                    degree of pride, which led him to despise the idea of being thought an author by
                    profession.</p>
                <p>It is probable, however, that early in life he had an intention of publishing an
                    edition of Strabo; for his papers contain a great number of notes and
                    geographical disquisitions on that author, particularly respecting that part of
                    Asia which comprehends Persia and India. The indefatigable pains which he had
                    bestowed on the writings of Plato, and the quantity of critical as well as
                    explanatory observations which he left upon almost every part of that ancient
                    philosopher’s works, plainly indicate that no man in Europe was better prepared
                    to republish and illustrate them than Mr Gray. Another work, on which he had
                    bestowed uncommon labour, was the <hi rend="italic">Anthologie.</hi> In an
                    interleaved copy of that collection of Greek epigrams, he has transcribed
                    several additional ones, which he selected in his extensive reading, inserted a
                    great number of critical notes and emendations, and also subjoined a copious
                    index. But whether he intended this performance for the press or not, has not
                    been ascertained. The only work which he meditated with a direct view to
                    publication from the beginning, was a history of English Poetry, upon a plan
                    sketched out by Pope. He has mentioned this himself in an advertisement to the
                    three fine imitations of Norse and Welsh poetry which he gave the world in the
                    last edition of his poems. But after he had made considerable preparations for
                    the execution of this design, and Mason had proffered his assistance, he was
                    informed that Mr Wharton, of Trinity College, Oxford, was engaged in a work of
                    the same kind. The undertaking was therefore relinquished by mutual consent; and
                    s∞n afterwards, upon that gentleman desiring a sight of the plan, Gray readily
                    sent him a copy of it.</p>
                <p>Amongst other sciences which he cultivated, Gray had acquired a great knowledge
                    of Gothic architecture. He had seen and accurately studied on the spot, whilst
                    abroad, the Roman proportions, both in ancient times, and in the works of
                    Palladio. In his later years he applied himself to study those stupendous
                    structures of more modem date which adorn our own country, and which, if they
                    have not the same grace, undoubtedly possess at least equal dignity, with those
                    of ancient times. He endeavoured to trace this mode of building from its
                    commencement through the various changes it underwent, until it arrived at its
                    perfection in the reign of Henry VIII. and ended in that of Elizabeth. For this
                    purpose, he did not so much rely upon written accounts, as on that internal
                    evidence which the buildings themselves exhibit of their respective antiquity;
                    since they constantly furnish to the well-informed eye, arms, ornaments, and
                    other marks, by which their several ages may be ascertained. On this account he
                    applied himself to the study of heraldry as a preparatory science; and he has
                    left behind him a number of genealogical papers, more than sufficient to prove
                    him a complete master of that subject. By these means he attained such prompt
                    sagacity in architectural matters, as to be enabled to pronounce, at first
                    sight, the precise time when every particular part of any of our cathedrals was
                    erected. But the favourite study of Gray for the last ten years of his life was
                    natural history, which he then rather resumed than commenced; for, by the
                    instructions of his uncle An-trobus, he was a considerable botanist at the age
                    of fifteen. The marginal notes which he has left on Linnaeus and other writers
                    on the vegetable, animal, and fossil kingdoms, are <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193523314" xml:id="kp-eb0710-3314-0719"/>very numerous; but the most
                    considerable are those on ' Hudson’s <hi rend="italic">Flora Anglica,</hi> and
                    the tenth edition of the <hi rend="italic">Systema Natura·,</hi> which he
                    interleaved and filled almost entirely. Whilst employed on zoology, he read with
                    great care Aristotle’s treatise on that subject, and explained many difficult
                    passages of that obscure ancient, by the lights he had received from modem
                    naturalists. In a word, excepting pure mathematics, and the studies dependent on
                    that science, there was hardly any branch of human learning in which he had not
                    acquired a competent skill, and in most of them a consummate mastery. To this
                    account of his literary character we may add, that he had a fine taste in
                    painting, prints, gardening, and music; and was moreover a man of good breeding,
                    as well as of virtue and humanity.</p>
                <p>Gray died in 1771; and an edition of his poems, with memoirs of his life and
                    writings, were published by Mr Mason in 1775, 4to. This gentleman, however,
                    instead of employing his own pen in delineating the character of Gray, has
                    adopted one drawn by the Reverend Mr Temple, rector of Mamhead in Devonshire,
                    and communicated in a letter to Mr Boswell. “Perhaps,” says Mr Temple, “he
                    (Gray) was the mostleamed man in Europe. He was equally acquainted with the
                    elegant and profound parts of science, and that not superficially, but
                    thoroughly. He knew every branch of history, both natural and civil; had read
                    all the original historians of England, France, and Italy; and was a great
                    antiquarian. Criticism, metaphysics, morals, politics, made a principal part of
                    his plan of study; voyages and travels of all sorts were his favourite
                    amusement; and he had a fine taste in painting, prints, architecture, and
                    gardening. With such a fund of knowledge, his conversation must have been
                    equally instructing and entertaining; but he was also a good man, a well-bred
                    man, a man of virtue and humanity. There is no character without some speck,
                    some imperfection; and I think the greatest defect in his was an affectation in
                    delicacy, or rather effeminacy, and a visible fastidiousness, or contempt and
                    disdain of his inferiors in science. He also had, in some degree, that weakness
                    which disgusted Voltaire so much in Mr Congreve: though he seemed to value
                    others chiefly according to the progress they had made in knowledge, yet he
                    could not bear to be considered himself merely as a man of letters; and though
                    without birth, or fortune, or station, his desire was to be looked upon as a
                    private independent gentleman, who read for his amusement. Perhaps it may be
                    said, what signifies so much knowledge, when it produces so little? Is it worth
                    taking so much pains to leave no memorial but a few poems? But let it be
                    considered that Mr Gray was, to others, at least innocently employed; to
                    himself, certainly beneficially. His time passed agreeably; he was every day
                    making some new acquisition in science; his mind was enlarged, his heart
                    softened, and his virtue strengthened; the world and mankind were shown to him
                    without a mask; and he was taught to consider every thing as trifling, and
                    unworthy the attention of a wise man, except the pursuit of knowledge, and the
                    practice of virtue in that state wherein God hath placed us.”</p>
                <p>The more recent, and perhaps also the more valuable editions of the collected
                    works of Gray, are, 1. That by Thomas James Mathias, London, 1814, in 4to; and,
                    2. That by the Rev. John Mitford, London, 1816, in two vols. 4to. The edition of
                    Mathias, besides the poetical works of Gray, contains Memoirs of his Life and
                    Writings, including his correspondence, by Mason, together with extracts,
                    philological, poetical, and critical, from the author’s original manuscripts. In
                    the edition of Mitford the poems are accompanied and illustrated with critical
                    notes, and to them are prefixed a Life of the author, and an Essay on his
                    Poetry.</p>
