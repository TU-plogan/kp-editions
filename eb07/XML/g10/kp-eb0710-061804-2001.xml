                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    jurisconsult, born at Paris in 1549, was allied by birth to the highest families
                    connected with the profession of law, and himself one of its most distinguished
                    ornaments. After having completed his classical studies, he applied himself to
                    that of law, and received the instructions of the famous professors who then
                    taught in the universities of Louvain, Cologne, and Heidelberg. On his return to
                    France, the civil disorders which broke out in all parts having forced him to
                    seek an asylum in foreign countries, he retired to Geneva, where he hoped to
                    find the tranquillity necessary for his pursuits. He was received with
                    distinction, and nominated to a chair of law in 1580. Henry IV. appointed him
                    magistrate of Gex in 1589; but this city having the year after been taken by the
                    Duke of Savoy, his house was pillaged, and no resource remained for him but to
                    pass into Germany. He, however, proceeded no farther than Strasburg, where he
                    taught the Pandects from 1591 till 1600, when the elector palatine called him to
                    Heidelberg. But the proceedings of his colleagues forced him six months
                    afterwards to return to Strasburg, where he remained three years more, at the
                    end of which time he consented to resume his functions at Heidelberg, upon an
                    assurance which was given him that he should have nothing to apprehend from the
                    jealousy of the other professors. It was only then that his countrymen became
                    sensible of the fault which had been committed in not endeavouring to retain in
                    Franc^ a man of such distinguished merit, and he was offered the chair which
                    Cujas had just left vacant at Bourges; but he declined the offer upon the ground
                    of his age, which did not admit of his attempting to form a new establishment;
                    and he alleged the same excuse in opposition to all the instances which were
                    made to draw him to Angers, to Valence, and to other universities of France and
                    Germany. In 1618 he was sent as deputy by the elector palatine to Louis X1IL,
                    who received him well, and solicited him to remain in Paris; but Godefroy had
                    become attached to Heidelberg, where he enjoyed all the consideration due to his
                    talents, and where he desired to end his days. In this expectation, however, he
                    was disappointed. The war, which extended to the palatinate, forced him to
                    return a third time to Strasburg, where, oppressed with grief and infirmities,
                    he expired on the 7th of September 1632, in the seventy-third year of his age.
                    His friend Bernegger pronounced his funeral oration, which is printed in the <hi

                    does him the greatest honour, and ensures him a permanent rank amongst
