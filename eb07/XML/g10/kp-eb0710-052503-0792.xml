                <p><label type="entry">GIOIA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Flavio</hi></label>, a pilot or
                    ship-captain, was born at Pasitano, a village situated near Amain, about the end
                    of the thirteenth century. During a long period this navigator was generally
                    regarded as the inventor of the mariner’s compass; and so precise were the ideas
                    of some writers on the subject, that they fixed the year 1302 or 1303 as the
                    date of the invention. But every one now knows that the claims of Gioia have
                    been disputed; that, according to some, he did not invent, but only improved,
                    the compass; whilst, in the opinion of others, he had nothing whatever to do
                    either with the invention or improvement of an instrument which, in a certain
                    sense, may be said to have changed the face of the world. To render him justice,
                    however, it is necessary to recall the most remarkable opinions which have been
                    expressed on the subject, and, in particular, to indicate the facts by which
                    these opinions are sought to be supported.</p>
                <p>Polydore Virgil places the invention of the compass amongst those the authors of
                    which are unknown. <hi rend="italic">Om-</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193520805"

                    may be, his testimony is of great weight against Gioia, as he was born in Italy
                    only two hundred years after the celebrated navigator of Amalfi. Several learned
                    men have attributed the invention of the compass to the Phoenicians, to the
                    Tyrians, and to King Solomon respectively. Court de Gébelin is one of those who
                    attribute it to the Phoenicians. Others, misled by an ill-interpreted passage of
                    Plautus, have supposed that the Greeks and Romans were acquainted with the
                    compass. In this number is Abundantius Collina, who, in a memoir entitled <hi

                    But these opinions have been completely refuted by Turnebus, Bochart, and
                    Dutens; by Trom-belli, <hi rend="italic">De Acus Nauticae</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Compass, printed twice in Italian, and then in French, Paris, 1807, in 8vo. In
                    fact, the ancients knew not the directive virtue of the magnet. The silence of
                    all the authors of antiquity, who have spoken of the loadstone, particularly of
                    Lucretius, Pliny, Claudian, and Plutarch, forms a negative proof of their
                    ignorance of this quality which seems quite insuperable. Gerbert of Auvergne,
                    born about the commencement of the tenth century, and afterwards pope under the
                    name of Silvester II., being desirous, when he was bishop of Magdeburg, to
                    construct a horizontal solar dial, found the north point by the help of an
                    instrument with which he observed the pole star; <hi rend="italic">in Magdeburg

                    Costadau, Collina, and others, have thought that, in the instrument here
                    mentioned, they recognized the compass. But Montucla has refuted this erroneous
                    opinion, and shown that the instrument of Gerbert was merely a tube <hi
                    rend="italic">(fistula),</hi> which he directed towards the pole star in order
                    to determine the meridian line. Evidence more convincing, however, attests that
                    the navigators of the Mediterranean were acquainted with the magnetic needle,
                    and knew how to make use of it more than a century before the time of Gioia.</p>
                <p>Albert, surnamed the Great, in his treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mineralibus,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Lib. ü. tract. 3, cap. 6.</p></note> mentions a passage of a
                    work, erroneously attributed to Aristotle, which he renders in these terms: <hi
                    rend="italic">Angulus magnetis quidam est, cujus virtus apprehendendi ferrum
                    est, ad zoron, hoc est, septentrionalem; et hoc utuntur nautee: angulus vero
                    alius magnetis illi oppositus trahit ad aphron, id est, polum meridionalem.</hi>
                    Whether this remarkable passage be found in Aristotle or not is of little
                    importance with reference to the period when Albert lived the was born in 1193,
                    and died in 1280); indeed it is necessary to go farther back than his time, for
                    the citation must have been made from some work still more ancient; and even if
                    the treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Mineralibus</hi> were
                    not the work of Albert, this would not diminish the importance of the passage
                    which the author, whoever he may be, has therein inserted, and which not only
                    shows that the directive power of the magnet was then known, but that this power
                    was applied by mariners for the purposes of navigation. Besides, the same text
                    is cited by Vincent of Beauvais, in the first part of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliotheca Mundi;</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Lib. ii. cap. 19.</p></note> and this part, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Speculum</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturale,</hi> must have been completed in the
                    year 1250, as appears from book xxvii. chapter 102. Brunetto Latini, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Trésor,</hi> composed first in French (Paris, 1260), and then
                    translated by himself into Italian, also speaks of the compass in language not
                    to be mistaken.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>His
                    words are, “Pour ce nagent le mariniers à l’enseigne de ces deux étoiles que

                    >Bible-Guyot,</hi> from verse 622 to verse 658, in which we find the compass
                    clearly indicated under the names of <hi rend="italic">manière</hi> or <hi

                    according to the various readings of the different manuscripts. This text may be

                    satire, called the <hi rend="italic">Bible-Guyot,</hi> is generally attributed
                    to Guyot, a French monk of Provins, who must have flourished about the end of
                    the twelfth century, since he appeared at the court of the Emperor Frederick I.
                    in 1181. But supposing this rhythmical piece were, as some have thought, the
                    work of Hugues de Bercy, a contemporary of Saint Louis, this difference would
                    only bring down the date by fifty, or at the most sixty years. Lastly, a passage
                    equally clear in the work of the Cardinal de Vitry, fixes the date beyond all
                    doubt. James of Vitry, a native of Argenteuil, and bishop of Ptolémaïs in Syria,
                    went to Palestine during the fourth crusade, that is, about the year 1204; on
                    his return from this voyage, he discharged the functions of legate of Pope
                    Innocent III. in the army which, in 1210, the Count de Montfort led against the
                    Albigenses; and having again set out for the Holy Land, he returned thence under
                    Honorius III. a considerable time before the death of this pope, and died in the
                    year 1244. But if, as is commonly supposed, he wrote his description of
                    Palestine, which forms the first book of his history, and is entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Historia Orientalis,</hi> during his second sojourn in the East,
                    this would fix its composition between the years 1215 and 1220; and, besides, he
                    speaks of a fact which he had observed since the year 1204. Now, in his 91st
                    chapter, he thus expresses himself: <hi rend="italic">Acus ferrea, postquam
                    adamantem contigerit, ad stellam septentrionalem,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >qiuε</hi><hi rend="italic">vel utaxis firmamenti, aliis vergentibus, non

                    valde necessarius est navigantibus in mari.</hi> [The iron needle, after contact
                    with the loadstone, constantly turns to the north-star, which, as the axis of
                    the firmament, remains immovable, whilst the other stars revolve; and hence it
                    is essentially necessary to those navigating on the ocean.] The sense of these
                    words presents no difficulty or obscurity. The question is not one relating to a
                    new discovery, but to a usage already established, to an instrument regarded as
                    absolutely necessary to mariners, to a species of knowledge which had in fact
                    become general and common.</p>
                <p>As Albert the Great, Guyon, and the Cardinal de Vitry, were all Frenchmen, and as
                    Brunetto Latini composed his work during his stay in France, whilst James of
                    Vitry must <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520818" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0818-0527"
                    />have crossed the Mediterranean in French vessels, the Benedictine authors of
                    the Literary History of France have thence concluded that the compass is a
                    French invention; and, in support of this conclusion, they have referred to the
                    usage (undoubtedly French) adopted by all nations of tracing upon the card of
                    the compass a <hi rend="italic">fleur-de-lis</hi> to indicate the north. This
                    opinion has been adopted by Μ. Azuni, and maintained by all the means which
                    extensive erudition could supply, in the dissertation to which we have already
                    referred. But other writers have claimed for the Arabians the honour of this
                    invention. Amongst these may be mentioned Tiraboschi, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Storia</hi><hi rend="italic">della Letteratura Italiana</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> Andres, in his <hi rend="italic">Origine e Progressi</hi><hi

                    however, rest solely upon vague assertions, and are unable to produce any
                    positive proofs. On the other hand, Chardin is persuaded that the Arabians
                    received the compass from Europe; whilst Renaudot has gone so far as to maintain
                    that there exists not any Arabian writing in which mention is made either of the
                    compass, or even of the di.- rective virtue of the magnet.<note anchored="true"

                    Silvestre de Sacy, confirms the opinion of Renaudot rather than destroys it,
                    since the author, who wrote in the year 681 of the hegira, relates a fact of
                    which he had been witness in the year 640 [ 1242 of our era], and since these
                    dates are <hi rend="italic">posterior</hi> to the times of Guyot de Provins and
                    Cardinal de Vitry. Ebn-Iounis, an Arabian astronomer, in his <hi rend="italic"

                    furnishes a negative proof of the most conclusive kind that the Arabians of his
                    time were unacquainted with the compass; for neither among the instruments of
                    which he makes mention, nor among the observations which he records, does he
                    ever speak of or allude to such a thing in any way. But there always remains
                    between these two epochs, that is, between the year 1007 and the year 1290, the
                    passage attributed to Aristotle, which must necessarily have been derived from
                    some Arabian author.</p>
                <p>The authors who have written on China have attacked the claims of Gioia with most
                    success. Father le Compte, Mailla, Father Gaubil in his <hi rend="italic"

                    declare themselves convinced that the Chinese made use of the compass long
                    before our era. Hager, in a dissertation published in Italian, under the title

                    rend="italic">orientale,</hi> has developed this opinion, and endeavoured to
                    prove not only that the compass is an invention of the Chinese, but that this
                    people transmitted it to us by means of their communications with the Arabians.
                    On this hypothesis, it appears wonderful that the compass, said to have been in
                    use in the Indian Sea one or two thousand years before Christ, should not have
                    been known either to the Egyptian navigators under the Ptolemies, or to the
                    Greeks of Constantinople in the middle ages. Chardin had left the question in
                    doubt. But Μ. de Guignes goes farther, and maintains that the sources whence
                    Father Gaubil derived his information are modem romances; and he censures that
                    historian for having supposed that he had detected the mention of a compass in
                    texts which are recognised as fabulous.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    551,</p></note> Nevertheless, it cannot now be doubted that the Chinese were
                    acquainted with the compass, if not at the early epochs of which Father Gaubil
                    speaks, at least long before the Europeans; and great weight has been given to
                    this opinion by the judgment which Barrow, Macartney, and other recent
                    travellers, have formed on the subject.</p>
                <p>But be this as it may, the writers who have attributed the invention to Gioia are
                    innumerable. Amongst others, Grimaldi, a learned Neapolitan, has collected in
                    favour of his countryman, in the dissertation which we have already cited, a
                    number of positive authorities, and has supported them with very imposing names.
                    Nor can it be dissembled that, during a long period, the opinion of all Europe
                    supported the claim of Gioia, and that there must have been some important fact
                    or circumstance to produce an assent so general in his favour. What, then, is
                    the precise title which the mariner of Amalfi possesses to public gratitude?
                    Father Fournier appears to have resolved this problem in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydrographie;</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Liv.
                    xi. chap. L</p></note> and Montucla, adopting the opinion of Fournier, has
                    developed it with a clearness calculated to satisfy every mind. The compass used
                    in the Mediterranean during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries consisted only
                    of a magnetic needle, which was made to float in a vase or bason by means of two
                    straws or a bit of cork, which supported it on the surface of the water. Such is
                    the description which the author of the <hi rend="italic">Bible-Guyot</hi> has
                    given of the instrument; and hence the names of <hi rend="italic">calamite</hi>
                    or of <hi rend="italic">grenouille</hi> (frog), under which it is designated in
                    some authors. The compass known to the Arabians, in the thirteenth century,
                    according to Bailak Kaptchaki, was no other than that here described. “It is
                    easy to perceive,” says Montucla, “how inconvenient this was, and how often the
                    agitation of the sea would render it useless But the</p>
                <p>Amalfitans imagined the convenient suspension which we now employ, by placing a
                    magnetised needle on a pivot which permits it to turn to all sides with
                    facility. It is not known that at first they went farther than this. Afterwards
                    it was attached to a card divided into thirty-two points <hi rend="italic"
                    >(rumbs de vent),</hi> and named <hi rend="italic">Bose des Vents</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and then the box containing it was suspended in such a
                    manner that, whatever motion the vessel might experience, it would always remain
                    horizontal. The English claim, <hi rend="italic">jure an injuria,</hi> this
                    addition to the compass, but on what ground I know not, having seen no proof in
                    support of such a pretension.” If the import of the verse of Antonius
                    Panormitanus, which is considered as one of the strongest proofs in favour of
                    the claim of Gioia, be examined with attention, it will perhaps be observed that
                    allusion is made, not to an invention, but a great and important improvement.
                    The verse in question is as follows:</p>
                <p>Prima dedit nautis <hi rend="italic">usum</hi> magnetis Ãmalphis.</p>
                <p>The poet does not appear to affirm that the town of Amalfi had given to mariners
                    the <hi rend="italic">knowledge</hi> of the magnetic needle, but only that it
                    had given, or rather facilitated, the <hi rend="italic">usage</hi> thereof.</p>
                <p>Such, then, appears to have been the merit of Gioia, namely, having rendered
                    truly useful an instrument of which, though previously known in an unimproved
                    state, little or no use could then be made. The timidity of pilots, in the
                    twelfth and thirteenth centuries, when they were already in possession of the
                    <hi rend="italic">calamite</hi> or <hi rend="italic">grenouille,</hi> and the
                    boldness which they displayed when provided with the compass of Amalfi,
                    evidently attest the importance of the service rendered to modern navigation by
                    Gioia. To improve in this manner is really to invent. It is possible that the
                    French may have added the <hi rend="italic">Rose des Vents,</hi> or card, to the
                    suspended needle of Gioia, which would account<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193520831" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0831-0528"/> for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fleur-de-lis</hi> being employed to indicate the north, as already mentioned.
                    It is also possible that the English may have conceived the idea of including
                    the needle, its pivot, and the card, in a <hi rend="italic">box</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">boxel,</hi> whence probably the names of <hi rend="italic"
                    >bussola</hi> and <hi rend="italic">boussole.</hi> The Germans, moreover, claim
                    the names of the winds, East, South, North, West, and even the name of the
                    compass. But these particularities are of little importance. What appears to be
                    established is, that the discovery of the directive virtue of the magnet was
                    made anterior to Gioia; that, before hi* time, navigators both in the
                    Mediterranean and the Indian Seas employed the magnetic needle; but that, by a
                    very important improvement, in the suspension of the needle, Gioia is entitled
                    to be considered as the real inventor in Europe of the compass such as we now
                    possess it. No history of the life of this navigator is known. Some writers call
                    him Giri; but the name of Gioia is that most generally adopted. Musanzio, in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Tables</hi><hi rend="italic">Chronologiques,</hi> complains
                    that Vossius and other learned men call him Giri, and describe him as a native
                    of Melfi, “instead,” says he, “of Gioia of Amalfi, who invented the compass in
                    the year 1303.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Table
