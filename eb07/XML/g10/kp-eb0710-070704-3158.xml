                <p><label type="entry">GRANDEUR</label> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Sublimity.</hi>
                    These terms have a double import, commonly signifying the quality or
                    circumstance in objects by which the emotions of grandeur and sublimity are
                    produced, and sometimes also the emotions themselves.</p>
                <p>In treating this subject, it is necessary that the impression made on the mind by
                    the magnitude of an object, abstracting from its other qualities, should be
                    ascertained; and because abstraction is a mental operation of some difficulty,
                    the safest method of judging is, to choose an object which is neither beautiful
                    nor deformed, if such an one can be found. The plainest that occurs is a huge
                    mass of rubbish, the ruins perhaps of some extensive building; or a large heap
                    of stones, such as are collected together for keeping in memory a battle or
                    other remarkable event. Such an object, which in miniature would be perfectly
                    indifferent, makes an impression by its magnitude,and even appears agreeable.
                    And supposing it large enough to fill the eye, and prevent the attention from
                    wandering to other objects, the impression it makes will be so much the
                    deeper.</p>
                <p>But though a plain object of this kind be agreeable, it is not termed <hi
                    rend="italic">grand</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> nor is it entitled to that
                    character, unless, together with its size, it be possessed of other qualities
                    which contribute to beauty, such as regularity, proportion, order, or colour;
                    but, according to the number of such qualities combined with magnitude, it will
                    be more or less grand. Thus St Peter’s church at Rome, the great pyramid of
                    Egypt, the Alps towering above the clouds, an arm of the sea, and, above all, a
                    clear and serene sky, are ^rand, because, besides theirdimensions, they are
                    beautiful in an eminent degree. On the other hand, an overgrown whale, having a
                    disagreeable appearance, is by no means grand. A large building, remarkable for
                    its regularity and proportions, is grand; and yet a much larger building, if
                    destitute of regularity, has not the least tincture <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193523171" xml:id="kp-eb0710-3171-0708"/>of grandeur. A single
                    regiment in battle-array makes a grand appearance, which the surrounding crowd"
                    does not, though perhaps ten times the number; and a regiment where the men are
                    all in one uniform, and the horses of one colour, makes a grander appearance,
                    and consequently strikes more terror, than where there is confusion of colour
                    and dress. Thus greatness or magnitude is the circumstance which distinguishes
                    grandeur from beauty; in other words, agreeableness is the genus, of which
                    beauty and grandeur are species.</p>
                <p>The emotion of grandeur, if duly examined, will be found to furnish additional
                    proof of the truth of our doctrine. That this emotion is pleasant in a high
                    degree, requires no other evidence than an appeal to the feelings, produced by
                    the view of a grand object; and if an emotion of grandeur be pleasant, its cause
                    or object, as already observed, must infallibly be agreeable in proportion.</p>
                <p>The qualities of grandeur and beauty are not more distinct than the emotions
                    which these qualities produce in a spectator. All the various emotions of beauty
                    have one common character; that of sweetness and gaiety. The emotion of grandeur
                    has a different character. A large object that is agreeable, occupies the whole
                    attention, and swells the heart with a vivid emotion, which, though extremely
                    pleasant, is rather serious than gay. And this affords a good reason for
                    distinguishing in language these different emotions. The emotions raised by
                    colour, regularity, proportion, and order, have such a resemblance to each
                    other, ąs readily to come under one general term, <hi rend="italic">the emotion
                    of beauty</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but the emotion of grandeur is so
                    different from these, that it deserves to have a peculiar name applied to
                    it.</p>
                <p>Though regularity, proportion, order, and colour, contribute to grandeur as well
                    as to beauty, yet these qualities are not by any means so essential to the
                    former as to the latter. To establish this proposition, some preliminary remarks
                    are necessary. In the first place, the mind, not being totally occupied with a
                    small object, can give its attention at the same time to every minute part; but
                    in a great or extensive object, the mind, being totally occupied with the
                    capital and striking parts, has no attention left for those which are little or
                    indifferent. In the next place, two similar objects appear not to be similar
                    when viewed at different distances; the similar parts of a very large object
                    cannot be seen except at different distances; and for this reason its
                    regularity, and the proportion of its parts, are in some measure lost to the
                    eye; neither are the irregularities of a very large object so conspicuous as
                    those of one which is small. Hence it is that a large object is not so agreeable
                    by its regularity as a small object, nor so disagreeable by its
                    irregularities.</p>
                <p>These considerations render it evident that grandeur is satisfied with a less
                    degree of regularity, and of the other qualities mentioned, than is requisite
                    for beauty. This may be illustrated by an experiment. Suppose that, approaching
                    a small conical hill, we take an accurate survey of every part, and are sensible
                    of the slightest deviation from regularity and proportion. If the hill were to
                    be considerably enlarged, so as to make us less sensible of its regularity, it
                    would upon that account appear less beautiful. It would not, however, appear
                    less agreeable, because some slight emotion of grandeur would come instead of
                    that which it had lost in beauty. Lastly, suppose the hill enlarged to a great
                    mountain; then the small degree of beauty which is left would be merged in its
                    grandeur. Hence it is that a towering hill is delightful, if it have but the
                    slightest resemblance of a cone; and a chain of mountains is not less so, though
                    deficient in the accuracy of order and proportion. We require a small surface to
                    be smooth; but in an extensive plain, considerable inequalities are overlooked.
                    In a word, regularity, proportion, order, and colour, contribute to grandeur as
                    well as to beauty; but with this remarkable difference, that in passing from
                    small to great they are not required in the same degree of perfection. This
                    remark serves to explain the extreme delight we feel in viewing the face of
                    nature, when sufficiently enriched and diversified with objects. The bulk of the
                    objects in a natural landscape are beautiful, and some of them grand; a flowing
                    river, a spreading oak, a round hill, an extended plain, are delightful; and
                    even a rugged rock, or barren heath, though in themselves disagreeable,
                    contribute by contrast to the beauty of the whole; but if to these we add the
                    verdure of the fields, the mixture of light and shadow, and the sublime canopy
                    spread over all, it will not appear wonderful that so extensive a group of
                    splendid objects should swell the heart to the utmost, and raise the strongest
                    emotion of grandeur. The spectator becomes conscious of an enthusiasm which
                    cannot bear confinement, or the strictness of regularity and order; he loves to
                    range at large, and is so enchanted with magnificent objects as to overlook
                    slight beauties or deformities.</p>
                <p>The same observation is applicable in some measure to works of art. In a small
                    building, the slightest irregularity is disagreeable; but in a magnificent
                    palace, or in a large Gothic church, irregularities are less regarded. In an
                    epic poem, we pardon many negligences which would not be permitted in a sonnet
                    or an epigram. But notwithstanding such exceptions, it may justly be laid down
                    as a rule, that in works of art, order and regularity ought to be governing
                    principles; and hence the justice of the observation of Longinus, that “in works
                    of art we have regard to exact proportion, and in those of nature, to grandeur
                    and magnificence.”</p>
                <p>The same reflections are in a great measure applicable to sublimity, particularly
                    that, like grandeur, it is a species of agreeableness; that a beautiful object
                    placed on an elevated position appears more agreeable than formerly, and
                    produces in the spectator a new emotion, termed <hi rend="italic">the emotion of
                    sublimity</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and that the perfection of order,
                    regularity, and proportion, is less required in objects elevated or placed at a
                    distance, than in those which are at hand.</p>
                <p>But though a grand object is agreeable, we must not thence infer that a little
                    object is disagreeable; which would be unfortunate for man, considering that he
                    is surrounded with so many objects of that description. The same thing holds
                    true with respect to place. A body placed high is agreeable; but the same body
                    placed low is not by that circumstance rendered disagreeable. Littleness and
                    lowness of place are precisely similar in this, that of themselves they produce
                    neither pleasure nor pain. And in this may be discovered a peculiar adaptation
                    in fitting the internal constitution of man to his external circumstances. Were
                    littleness and lowness of place agreeable, greatness and elevation could not be
                    so; were littleness and lowness of place disagreeable, they would occasion
                    uninterrupted uneasiness.</p>
                <p>The difference between great and little with respect to agreeableness is
                    remarkably felt in a series when we pass gradually from one extreme to the
                    other. A mental progress from the capital to the kingdom, and from that to
                    Europe, to the whole earth, to the planetary system, to the universe, is
                    extremely pleasant; the heart swells, and the mind is dilated at every step. Nor
                    is the returning in an opposite direction positively painful, though our
                    pleasure lessens at every step, till it vanish into indifference. Such a
                    progress may sometimes produce pleasure of a different sort, arising from our
                    taking a narrower and narrower inspection. The same observation holds good in a
                    progress upwards and downwards. Ascent is pleasant because it elevates us; but
                    descent is never painful; on the contrary, it is for the most part pleasant from
                    a different cause, that it is according to the order of nature. The fall of a
                    stone <pb break="no" facs="nls:193523184" xml:id="kp-eb0710-3184-0709"/>from any
                    height is extremely agreeable by its accelerated motion. We feel it pleasant to
                    descend from a mountain, because the descent is natural and easy. Neither is
                    looking downwards painful; whilst, on the contrary, looking down upon objects
                    forms part of the pleasure of elevation. Looking down becomes painful only when
                    the object is so far below as to create dizziness.</p>
                <p>It has been remarked, that the emotions of grandeur and sublimity are nearly
                    allied; and hence it is, that the one term is frequently put for the other. An
                    increasing series of numbers, for example, producing an emotion similar to that
                    of mounting upwards, is commonly termed <hi rend="italic">an ascending
                    series</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a series of numbers gradually decreasing,
                    producing an emotion similar to that of going downwards, is commonly termed <hi
                    rend="italic">a descending series.</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Nc</hi> talk familiarly of going <hi rend="italic">up</hi> to the
                    capital, and of going <hi rend="italic">down</hi> to the country; and from a
                    lesser kingdom we talk of going <hi rend="italic">up</hi> to a greater, as in
                    the <hi rend="italic">anabasis</hi> of the Greek language, when one travelled
                    from Greece to Persia. We discover the same mode of expression in the language
                    even of Japan; and its universality proves that it is the offspring of a natural
                    feeling.</p>
                <p>This leads us to consider next grandeur and sublimity in a figurative sense, and
                    as applicable to the fine arts. Hitherto these terms have been taken in their
                    proper sense as applicable to objects of sight only; and it is of importance to
                    bestow some pains upon this, because, generally speaking, the figurative sense
                    of a word is derived from its proper sense, and particularly so in the present
                    instance. Beauty, in its original signification, is confined to objects of
                    sight; but as many other objects, intellectual as well as moral, raise emotions
                    resembling that of beauty, the resemblance of the effects prompts us to extend
                    the term <hi rend="italic">beauty</hi> to these objects. The same principle
                    serves equally to explain the terms <hi rend="italic">grandeur</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">sublimity,</hi> when employed in a figurative sense. Every
                    emotion, from whatever cause it proceeds, which resembles an emotion of grandeur
                    or elevation, is called by the same name. Thus generosity is said to be an <hi
                    rend="italic">elevated</hi> emotion, as well as great courage; and that firmness
                    of soul which is superior to misfortunes obtains the peculiar name of <hi
                    rend="italic">magnanimity.</hi> On the other hand, every emotion which contracts
                    the mind, and fixes it upon things trivial or of no importance, is termed <hi
                    rend="italic">low,</hi> by its resemblance to an emotion produced by a little or
                    low object of sight. Thus an appetite for trifling amusements is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">low taste.</hi> The same terms are applied to characters and
                    actions. We talk familiarly of an <hi rend="italic">elevated</hi> genius, of a
                    <hi rend="italic">great</hi> man, and equally so of <hi rend="italic"
                    >littleness</hi> of mind. Some actions are <hi rend="italic">great</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">elevated,</hi> and others are <hi rend="italic">little</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">grovelling.</hi> Sentiments, and even expressions, are
                    characterised in the same manner. An expression or sentiment which raises the
                    mind is denominated <hi rend="italic">great</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >elevated</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and hence the sublime in poetry. In such
                    figurative terms, we lose the distinction between great and elevated in their
                    proper sense; for the resemblance is not so entire as to preserve these terms
                    distinct in their figurative application. And we carry this figure still
                    further. Elevation, in its proper sense, imports superiority of place, and
                    lowness inferiority of place; hence we say a man of <hi rend="italic"
                    >superior</hi> talents, of <hi rend="italic">superior</hi> rank, of <hi
                    rend="italic">inferiorparts,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">inferior</hi> taste, and
                    such like. The veneration we have for our ancestors, and for the ancients in
                    general, being similar to the emotion produced by an elevated object of sight,
                    justifies the figurative expression of the ancients being <hi rend="italic"
                    >raised</hi> above us, or possessing a <hi rend="italic">superior</hi> place,
                    llιe notes of the gamut, proceeding regularly from the blunter or grosser sounds
                    to the more acute and piercing, produce in the hearer a feeling somewhat similar
                    to that which is produced by mounting upwards; and this gives occasion to the
                    figurative expressions, <hi rend="italic">a high note, a low note.</hi></p>
                <p>Such indeed is the resemblance in feeling between real and figurative grandeur,
                    that amongst the nations on the eastern coast of Africa, who are directed purely
                    by nature, the officers of state are, with respect to rank, distinguished by the
                    length of the batoon each carries in his hand; and in Japan, princes and great
                    lords exhibit their rank by the length and size of their sedan poles. Again, it
                    is a rule in painting, that figures of a small size are most proper for
                    grotesque pieces; but that an historical subject generally requires figures as
                    large as the life, or nearly so. The resemblance of these feelings is in reality
                    so strong, that elevation in a figurative sense is observed to have the same
                    effect, even externally, with real elevation.</p>
                <p>The resemblance in feeling between real and figurative grandeur is humorously
                    illustrated by Addison in criticising English tragedy. “The ordinary method of
                    making a hero is to clap a huge plume of feathers upon his head, which rises so
                    high, that there is often a greater length from his chin to the top of his head
                    than to the sole of his foot. One would believe that we thought a great man and
                    a tall man the same thing. As these superfluous ornaments upon the head make a
                    great man, a princess generally receives her grandeur from those additional
                    incumbrances that fall into her tail. I mean the broad sweeping train that
                    follows her in all her motions, and finds constant employment for a boy who
                    stands behind her to open and spread it to advantage.” On the same principle,
                    the Scythians, impressed with the fame of Alexander, were astonished when they
                    found him a little man.</p>
                <p>The gradual progress from small to great is not less remarkable in figurative
                    than in real grandeur or elevation. Every one must have observed the delightful
                    effect of a number of thoughts or sentiments, artfully disposed like an
                    ascending series, and making impressions deeper and deeper as they proceed. Such
                    a disposition of members or clauses in a period is termed a <hi rend="italic"
                    >climax.</hi></p>
                <p>Within certain limits grandeur and sublimity produce their strongest effects;
                    which, however, lessen by excess as well as by defect. This is remarkable in
                    grandeur and sublimity taken in their proper sense. The grandest emotion which
                    can be excited by a visible object is where the object can be taken in at one
                    view; but if so immense as to be comprehended only in parts, it tends rather to
                    distract than to satisfy the mind.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    cut into the figure of the hero, according to the propŵl of Phidias, with a
                    river in one band and a city in the other.</p></note> In like manner, the
                    strongest emotion produced by elevation is where the object is seen distinctly;
                    a greater elevation lessens in appearance the object, till it vanishes out of
                    sight with its pleasant emotions. The same thing is equally remarkable in
                    figurative grandeur and elevation. Sentiments may be so strained as to
                    become.obscure, or to exceed the capacity of the human mind; but against such
                    license of imagination every good writer will be upon his guard; and it is
                    therefore of importance to observe, that even the true sublime may be carried
                    beyond that pitch which produces the strongest impression. We are undoubtedly
                    susceptible of a greater elevation than can be inspired by human actions the
                    most heroic and magnanimous: this is evident from the feelings produced by
                    Milton’s description of superior beings: yet every man must be sensible of a
                    more constant and agreeable elevation when the history of his own species is the
                    subject. He enjoys an elevation equal to that of the greatest hero, of an
                    Alexander or a Caesar, of a Brutus or an <pb break="no" facs="nls:193523197"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-3197-0710"/>Epaminondas; he accompanies these heroes in their
                    most sublime sentiments and hazardous exploits, with a magnanimity equal to
                    theirs; and he finds it no stretch to preserve the same tone of mind for hours
                    together without sinking. The case is not the same in describing the actions or
                    qualities of superior beings. The reader’s imagination cannot keep pace with
                    that of the poet; the mind, unable to support itself in a strained elevation,
                    falls as from a height, and the fall is immoderate like the elevation; or where
                    that effect is not felt, it must be prevented by some obscurity in the
                    conception, which frequently attends the descriptions of unknown objects. A mind
                    unable to raise itself to the full contemplation of the Supreme Being
                    self-existent and eternal, or to support itself in a strained elevation, finds
                    itself more at ease in using the intercession of some saint whose piety and
                    penances whilst on earth are supposed to have rendered him a favourite in
                    heaven; and hence the part assigned to tutelary saints, such as St Francis and
                    St Dominic, amongst the Roman Catholics.</p>
                <p>Objects of sight which are not remarkably great nor elevated scarcely raise any
                    emotion of grandeur or sublimity; and the same things hold respecting other
                    objects; for we often find the mind roused and animated, without being carried
                    to that height. This difference may be discerned in many sorts of music, as well
                    as in some musical instruments. A kettle-drum rouses, and a hautboy is
                    animating; but neither of them inspires an emotion of sublimity. Revenge
                    animates the mind in a considerable degree; but it never produces an emotion
                    which can be termed <hi rend="italic">grand</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >sublime</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and perhaps no disagreeable passion ever
                    has that effect.</p>
                <p>No desire is more universal than that of being exalted and honoured; and upon
                    this account chiefly are we ambitious of power, riches, titles, fame, which
                    would suddenly lose their relish did they not elevate us above others, and
                    command submission and deference; indeed it may be thought that our attachment
                    to things grand and lofty proceeds from their connection with our favourite
                    passion. This connection has undoubtedly its effect; but that the preference
                    given to things grand and lofty must have a deeper root in human nature, will
                    appear from considering that many bestow their time upon low and trifling
                    amusements, without having the least tincture of such a noble passion; yet these
                    very persons talk the same language with the rest of mankind, and prefer the
                    more elevated pleasures; they acknowledge a more refined taste, and are ashamed
                    of their own as low and grovelling. This sentiment, constant and universal, must
                    be the work of nature; and it plainly indicates an original attachment in human
                    nature to every object which tends to elevate the mind. Some men may have a
                    greater relish for an object not of the highest rank; but they are conscious of
                    the preference given by mankind in general to things grand and sublime, and they
                    are sensible that their own peculiar taste ought to yield to the general
                    inclination.</p>
                <p>What’ is said above suggests a rule for attaining the sublime in such works of
                    art as are susceptible of it; and that is, to present those parts or
                    circumstances only which make the greatest figure, keeping out of view every
                    thing low or tnvial; for the mind, elevated by an important object, cannot,
                    without reluctance, be forced down to bestow any share of its attention upon
                    trifles. Such a judicious selection of capital circumstances is by an eminent
                    critic styled grandeur of manner. In none of the fine arts is there so great
                    scope for that rule as in poetry, which thus enjoys a remarkable power of
                    bestowing upon objects and events an air of grandeur. When we are spectators,
                    every minute object presents itself in its order; but in describing at second
                    hand, these are laid aside, and the capital objects are brought close together.
                    A judicious taste in thus selecting the most interesting incidents, to give them
                    an united force, accounts for a fact which may appear surprising; namely, that
                    we are more moved by spirited narrative at second hand, than by being spectators
                    of the event itself, in til its circumstances.</p>
                <p>There is another rule which chiefly regards the sublime, though it is applicable
                    to every sort of literary performance intended for amusement; namely, to avoid
                    as much as possible abstract and general terms. Such terms, like mathematical
                    signs, are contrived to express our thoughts in a concise manner; but images,
                    which are the life of poetry, cannot be raised in any perfection except by
                    introducing particular objects. General terms, which comprehend a number of
                    individuals, must however be excepted from this rule. Our kindred, our clan, our
                    country, and words of the like import, though they scarcely raise any distinct
                    image, have a wonderful power over the passions; the greatness of the complex
                    object overbalances the obscurity of the image; and the associations, of which
                    it is the mnemonic type, fill the mind with exalted emotions.</p>
                <p>Grandeur being an extremely vivid emotion, is not readily produced in perfection,
                    except by reiterated impressions. The effect of a single impression can be but
                    momentary; and if one feel suddenly something like a swelling or exaltation of
                    mind, the emotion vanishes as soon as felt. Single thoughts or sentiments are
                    often cited as examples of the sublime; but their effect is far inferior to that
                    of a grand subject displayed in its capital parts.</p>
                <p>The straining of an elevated subject beyond due bounds, or beyond the reach of
                    ordinary conception, is not a vice so frequent as to require the correction of
                    criticism. But the false sublime is a rock which writers of more fire than
                    judgmentcommonly split upon. One species of false sublime, known by the name of
                    bombast, is common amongst writers of a mean genius; it is a serious endeavour,
                    by strained description, to exalt a low or familiar subject, which, instead of
                    becoming sublime, fails not to become ridiculous. The mind, indeed, under the
                    influence of some animating passions, is extremely prone to magnify its objects
                    beyond natural bounds; but such hyperbolical description has its limits, and
                    when carried beyond the impulse of the propensity, it degenerates into
                    burlesque. Another species of false sublime, which is still more faulty than
                    bombast, is that of forcing elevation by introducing imaginary beings without
                    preserving any propriety in their actions; as if it were lawful to ascribe every
                    extravagant» and inconsistency to beings of the poet’s creation. In a word,
                    exaggeration of every kind, with a view to produce a great effect, is not only
                    contrary to the principles of good taste, but becomes disgusting or ludicrous,
                    very probably both.</p>
