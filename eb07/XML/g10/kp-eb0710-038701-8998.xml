                <p>INTRODUCTION.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> term <hi rend="smallcaps">Geography,</hi> derived
                    from two Greek words, <hi rend="italic">γta, the earth,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">γ1aφu, I write,</hi> signifies <hi rend="italic">a description of
                    the earth.</hi> The description to which this title is applied may be more or
                    less general; either embracing such truths only as belong to the earth
                    considered as one whole, or extending to particulars which belong to and
                    distinguish the several countries spread over its surface. In whichsoever of
                    these two aspects the subject be regarded, a vast field opens to the view of the
                    observer. In order to give a full and accurate description of the earth, it
                    would be requisite to consider it in reference to its motion, figure, and
                    magnitude; in reference to its relation to the other bodies of the universe, and
                    more especially to the planetary system of which it forms a part; in reference
                    to its surface, as diversified by land and sea, mountains and valleys, lakes and
                    rivers; in reference to the materials which compose its crust, and to its
                    internal structure; in reference to the constitution of the atmosphere with
                    which it is surrounded, and the effects arising from the variations in
                    atmospherical pressure, temperature, and humidity. Nor would it be enough to
                    consider the earth only as a mass of inert and unorganized matter; it would be
                    necessary to regard it in its relations to vegetable and animal life; and to
                    trace the phenomena which these, in their endless variety, present in its
                    various divisions and provinces. It would still further be necessary to view it
                    as the abode of man himself, and as modified by his existence; divided into
                    states and kingdoms; adorned with cities, and all the noble monuments of
                    civilized life.</p>
                <p>Such is an outline of the picture which geography, in the most unlimited meaning
                    of the term, should exhibit of the globe. To fill up this picture in all its
                    parts, it would evidently be necessary to call in the aid of the whole circle of
                    the sciences. But the description is usually of a less extended character, being
                    confined chiefly to the more obvious and striking features of the various
                    regions and countries of the earth.</p>
                <p>In the wide range which the subject presents, several divisions and subdivisions
                    are suggested by the different views in which the earth may be considered. The
                    three following divisions are the most important:</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Mathematical Geography,</hi> which illustrates, on
                    astronomical principles, the figure, magnitude, and motion of the earth; teaches
                    how to determine the positions of places on its surface; explains the
                    construction of globes, with their application to the solution of problems; and
                    shows how the whole or any portion of the earth’s surface may, on the principles
                    of projection, be delineated on a map or chart.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Physical Geography,</hi> which treats of the mutual
                    relations of the diversified objects found on the surface of the earth,
                    including the atmosphere by which it is surrounded; and explains the causes,
                    whether of a chemical or mechanical description, that produce the modifications
                    and changes which they continually undergo.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Political</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Historical
                    Geography,</hi> which describes the earth as divided into countries, occupied by
                    various nations, and improved by human art and industry. It traces the
                    circumstances and character of the different races and tribes of mankind,
                    explaining their social institutions, and ascertaining the place which each
                    occupies in the scale of civilization.</p>
                <p>From this general arrangement of the subject, it is evident that geography
                    depends for its rank as a science on its intimate connection with various
                    branches of knowledge, which, taking their rise from investigations instituted
                    in reference to the nature and mutual relations of the objects on the earth, or
                    connected with it, furnish those accurate views which must be obtained before
                    any thing like a precise description can be given of the globe we inhabit, or of
                    any portion of it. With regard to what belongs to Physical Geography, we must
                    refer the reader to the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Physical Geography,
                    Mineralogy, Meteorology, &amp;c.</hi> in this work. What belongs to Political or
                    Historical Geography will be found under the names of the respective countries.
                    The following article will be limited to a view of the progress of Geographical
                    Discovery, and to a brief explanation of the principles of Mathematical
                    Geography.</p>
                <p>I.—VIEW OF THE PROGRESS OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISCOVERY.</p>
                <p>There are many circumstances in the condition of man which connect him so closely
                    with the globe which he inhabits, as to render absolutely necessary to his
                    existence a knowledge of at least the neighbourhood of the spot where his lot is
                    cast. It is from the earth that he must derive the means of subsistence and
                    accommodation, the materials on which his industry is to be exerted, and those
                    objects in the exchange of which commerce consists. In every stage of his
                    progress, therefore, from barbarism to civilization, he must employ some
                    attention and observation, in order to discover in what respects the objects
                    with which he is surrounded are qualified to contribute to the supply of his
                    wants, and to his comfort and convenience. Even while he roams the forest in the
                    savage state, he must make himself acquainted with many circumstances, a
                    knowledge of which is necessary either to give him success in the chase, or to
                    direct him in retracing his steps to the place where he has fixed his dwelling.
                    But it is not until men have united in society, and that neighbouring
                    communities have begun to hold mutual intercourse, that those feelings and
                    passions are effectually aroused which stimulate to the arduous pursuits of
                    geographical discovery'. Commerce and war, with the spirit of adventure which
                    usually accompany them, have without doubt been among the first causes of
                    geographical research. In the train of these have followed the workings of
                    avarice and the aims of ambition. As the human mind has advanced in its career
                    of improvement, curiosity, with an enlargement of views and desires, have been
                    called into action; and voyages have been undertaken for the express purpose of
                    discovering new countries and exploring unknown seas.</p>
                <p>In tracing the effects which these causes have produced in the gradual increase
                    of geographical knowledge, it will contribute to distinctness to keep in view a
                    threefold division, which the subject naturally assumes, namely, <hi
                    rend="italic">ancient</hi> geography, extending from the earliest period of
                    history down to the time when, the Roman empire having been overrun by barbarous
                    nations from several quarters, Europe was overwhelmed in the darkness which
                    preceded the revival of learning; the geography <hi rend="italic">of the middle
                    ages,</hi> extending from the revival of letters to the fifteenth century, when
                    the discoveries of the Portuguese began to lay a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193519011" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9011-0388"/>wider foundation for the
                    science; and <hi rend="italic">modem</hi> geography, which embraces the most
                    recent discoveries, and is progressively improving by the accessions which it is
                    receiving from the labours and science of modern travellers and navigators.</p>
                <p>The Phoenicians are the earliest commercial people of whose discoveries we have
                    any correct accounts. This people seem first to have explored the coasts of the
                    Mediterranean. Their navigators at length extending their voyages through the
                    Straits of Gades, now called the Straits of Gibraltar, entered the Atlantic
                    Ocean, and visited the western coasts of Spain and Africa. In many places to
                    which they resorted they planted colonies; and sought, by instructing the
                    inhabitants, in some measure, in their arts and improvements, to open a wider
                    sphere for their commerce. The learned Bochart, led by the analogy between the
                    Phoenician tongue and the oriental languages, has endeavoured to follow the
                    tracks of the Phoenicians, both along the shores of the Mediterranean and those
                    of the Atlantic. These analogies are not always sure guides; but there seems no
                    reason to doubt that Cadiz was originally a Phoenician colony, and it is not
                    likely that this was the only one formed by that enterprising people.</p>
                <p>The Arabian Gulf, or Red Sea, offered to the Phoenicians another field of naval
                    and commercial exertion, to the improvement of which the distance of Tyre, the
                    emporium of their trade, was the only obstacle. This induced them to make
                    themselves masters of Rhinocrura or Rhinocolura, the port in the Mediterranean
                    nearest to the Red Sea. Commodities purchased in Arabia, Ethiopia, and India
                    were landed at Elah, the safest harbour in the Red Sea towards the north; thence
                    they were conveyed over land to Rhinocolura; and being there reshipped, they
                    were carried to Tyre, whence they were distributed over the world.</p>
                <p>The wealth and power which accrued to the Phoenicians from their being in the
                    sole possession of the lucrative trade of the East, incited the Jews, their
                    neighbours, under the prosperous reigns of David and Solomon, to desire a
                    participation in its advantages. Their conquest of Idumea, which stretches along
                    the Red Sea, put it in the power of Solomon to fit out a fleet; while his
                    alliance with Hiram, king of Tyre, enabled him to command the skill of the
                    Phoenicians for the conducting of the voyage. Passing through the Straits of
                    Babelmandel, they carried on commerce in the Indian Ocean; and so distant were
                    the countries to which they traded, that the voyage occupied no less than three
                    years. But though the Jews thus for a time engaged in the pursuits of trade, yet
                    the tendency of their institutions, which were expressly designed to preserve
                    them a separate people, was unfavourable to the development of the commercial
                    spirit which their monarchs wished to foster among them. This, joined with the
                    division of the kingdom on the death of Solomon, proved fatal to their rising
                    greatness as a commercial people, and excluded them from ranking among the
                    nations who have contributed to the advancement of geographical knowledge. It is
                    perhaps impossible to fix with certainty the limits which bounded the
                    geographical researches of the Phoenicians, on account of the difficulty there
                    is of assigning the precise places marked out by the names then given to the
                    countries to which they traded. The length of time occupied in the voyage, and
                    the nature of the cargoes brought, home, with a few other circumstances of the
                    same vague kind, are the only particulars afforded to direct us in the
                    determination. Thus the country of Ophir, to which the Phoenicians navigated the
                    ships of Solomon, must be ascertained by the facts that the voyage thither and
                    homeward occupied three years, and that the cargo consisted of “gold and silver,
                    ivory, and apes, and peacocks.” Among the various opinions which have been
                    entertained respecting the position of this distant country, the most probable
                    appears to be that it was situated on the eastern coast of Africa, as far south
                    as Sofala. To this quarter every indication seems clearly to point; and whatever
                    objections may appear to stand in the way, in consideration of the remoteness of
                    the region, and the difficulties to be encountered, these admit of being
                    answered by a reference to the length of time required for the voyage, and to
                    the wealth, naval skill, and ample resources, at the command of the monarchs
                    engaged in the traffic.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The regions always spoken of in Scripture as the most remote with which the
                    Hebrews and Phoenicians were acquainted are, Tarsbish, Ophir, the Isles, Sheba,
                    and Dedan, the River, Gog, Magog, and the North, without entering into any
                    discussion, we may give what appear to be the most probable conclusions with
                    regard to the positions of the countries to which these names were applied.
                    Tarshish is a country from which two voyages are spoken of in Scripture as being
                    made; one by the Mediterranean, bringing iron, silver, lead, and tin, the
                    produce of Spain and Britain; the other by the Red Sea, bringing gold, ivory,
                    and other productions of tropical Africa. These two voyages, though at first
                    sight they appear incongruous if supposed to be made to the same country, may be
                    reconciled by supposing that Tarshislι is fundamentally Carthage, which
                    monopolized almost entirely the commerce of Spain and Britain, and was the
                    medium through which the commodities of the west were distributed; and that the
                    name of this great African metropolis was extended to the whole of the continent
                    of Africa. The Isles are the whole southern coasts of Europe, consisting either
                    of real islands or peninsular tracts. Sheba is the southern portion of that part
                    of the coast of Arabia which borders on the Red Sea; while Dedan lies upon the
                    opposite coast, that borders on the Persian Gulf. These countries rose to
                    commercial importance in consequence of the valuable commodities which were
                    imported into the former from the African coast, and into the latter from India.
                    Thence arose the traffic carried on by “the companies of Sheba,” or caravans,
                    and by “the travelling companies of Dedanim.” The River was the name always
                    applied to the Euphrates. Gog, Magog, and the North, appear to be the high
                    tableland in the interior and north of Asia Minor, Phrvgia, Galatia, Cappadocia,
                    and Paphlagonia, regions in which may be recognised the peculiarly rude and
                    formidable aspect which belonged to the countries to which in ancient times the
                    names in question were applied. (See <hi rend="italic">£ncyclopadia of
                    Geography,</hi> by H. Murray, Esq.)</p></note></p>
                <p>The Carthaginians, a Phoenician colony, retained in full vigour the commercial
                    spirit of the parent state. They did not, however, attempt to divide with Tyre
                    the wealth and power which she derived from the monopoly of the trade carried on
                    in the Arabian Gulf. They directed their efforts to the opposite quarter, and
                    sailing through the Straits of Gades, pushed their researches far beyond the
                    bounds which had been reached by the mother country in this part of the globe.
                    They visited not only all the coast of Spain, but likewise that of Gaul, and
                    penetrated at length as far as the south-western coast of Britain, where they
                    obtained tin from the mines of Cornwall or in traffic with the natives. Nor was
                    it only towards the northward that they directed their efforts; they explored
                    also the regions southward of the straits, and sailing along the western coast
                    of Africa almost as far as the northern tropic, they planted colonies, as the
                    Phoenicians of Tyre had formerly done, with a view to prepare the natives for
                    carrying on commercial intercourse. The Atlantic Ocean was destined to conceal
                    for ages from the inhabitants of the old world the immense regions which lie
                    beyond it. But the Carthaginians extended the boundary of navigation westward by
                    the discovery of the Fortunate Islands, now known by the name of the
                    Canaries.</p>
                <p>The enlargement of views gradually generated by this spirit of commercial
                    enterprise led at length to voyages ol which discovery was the special
                    object-The circumnavigation of Africa was one of the earliest attempts of this
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193519024" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9024-0389"/>kind made by
                    the ancients. The direction which the coast takes beyond the Mediterranean on
                    the one hand, and the Red Sea on the other, suggested the idea of a peninsula
                    which it might be possible to sail round. This voyage was first undertaken by
                    the Egyptians; a people exceedingly averse to engage in naval affairs, but who
                    at this time were ruled over by Necho, a monarch whose active spirit prompted
                    him to engage some Phoenicians to descend the Arabian Gulf, and, coasting along
                    Africa, to endeavour to return by the Straits of Gades. Herodotus narrates in a
                    few words the result of this enterprise, which was undertaken about six hundred
                    and four years before the Christian era. He says, “the Phoenicians, setting sail
                    from the Red Sea, made their way into the southern sea; and when autumn
                    approached they drew their vessels to land, sowed a crop, and waited till it was
                    grown; when they reaped it, and again put to sea. Having spent two years in this
                    manner, in the third year they reached the pillars of Hercules, and returned to
                    Egypt, reporting what does not find belief with me, but may perhaps with some
                    other person; for they said that in passing Africa they had the sun on their
                    right hand. In this manner Lybia was first known.”</p>
                <p>This passage has given rise to much controversy among the learned. But the voyage
                    here so briefly described does not seem to involve any impossibility,
                    notwithstanding the then infant state of navigation; and the circumstance which
                    the historian objects to as incredible is the very point which, from its
                    coincidence with what we know should have-happened, renders the story more
                    worthy of belief.</p>
                <p>Xerxes king of Persia, according to Herodotus, gave a similar commission, about
                    four hundred and eighty years before the Christian era, to one of his satraps,
                    named Sataspes, who, for a heinous offence, had been condemned to die. If
                    successful in the accomplishment of this voyage, Sataspes was to escape a cruel
                    death; but the difficulties were too great to be surmounted by a navigator
                    brought up amidst the luxury and indulgence of the Persian court. Having
                    procured from Egypt a vessel and crew, he passed through the Straits of Gades,
                    entered the Atlantic Ocean, and, bending his course towards the south, coasted
                    the continent of Africa, until, after several months, he probably reached the
                    coast of Sahara. The frightful and desolate shores along which he sailed, and
                    the tempestuous ocean which beat against them, combined to fill his mind with
                    alarm, and to shake his resolution. He retraced his course to the straits; and
                    hoping perhaps that the labours he had undergone in the partial accomplishment
                    of the task imposed on him would be accepted by his royal master as a sufficient
                    atonement for his offence, or that the offence itself might in a great measure
                    be forgotten, he returned home and presented himself before Xerxes. The cause
                    which he assigned for the failure of the ultimate object of his mission was,
                    that he had encountered a sea so full of herbage that his passage was completely
                    obstructed. This reason (the grounds of which have never been satisfactorily
                    explained, though it <hi rend="italic">has</hi> been alleged that obstacles of
                    this description occur in that part of the sea which lies between the Cape Verd
                    Islands, the Canaries, and the coast of Africa) appeared so ridiculous to
                    Xerxes, that he ordered the sentence of death by crucifixion, which had been
                    pronounced upon Sataspes, to be immediately executed.</p>
                <p>But the most celebrated voyage of antiquity undertaken for the purpose of
                    discovery was the expedition under Hanno, fitted out by the authority of the
                    senate of Carthage, and at the public expense, and that with the view of
                    attempting a complete survey of the western coast of Africa. Of all the voyages
                    performed by the Phoenicians and Carthaginians, this is the only one of which we
                    have an authentic narrative. Mercantile jealousy prevented these two great
                    commercial states from communicating to other nations the knowledge which they
                    acquired of the remote regions of the earth; and from this cause, when the
                    maritime power of the former was annihilated by Alexander’s conquest of Tyre,
                    and the empire of the latter was overthrown by the Roman arms, all monuments of
                    their great skill in naval affairs appear in a great measure to have perished.
                    Even the account of the voyage of Hanno <hi rend="italic">{Periplus
                    Hannonis)</hi> has been considered by its learned editor Mr Dodwell as a
                    spurious work. But the arguments of Μ. de Montesquieu and of Μ. de Bougainville
                    appear fully to establish its authenticity, which the learned world now
                    generally admit.</p>
                <p>Hanno set sail with a fleet of sixty vessels, so constructed that, according to
                    the mode of ancient navigation, he could keep close in with the coast. We are
                    told that, in twelve days after leaving the Straits of Gades, he reached the
                    island of Cerne; that proceeding thence, and following the direction of the
                    coast, he arrived, in seventeen days, at a bay, which he called <hi
                    rend="italic">The West Hom.</hi> From this he advanced to another bay, which he
                    named <hi rend="italic">The South Horn.</hi> The objects which are described as
                    having been seen by Hanno in his progress belong to tropical Africa. But in
                    attempting to ascertain the places which he visited, or the utmost distance
                    which he sailed southward, much difficulty and uncertainty are experienced.
                    Bougainville supposes Hanno to have reached the Gulf of Benin, and contends that
                    this limit, distant as it is, cannot be regarded as beyond what may be conceived
                    to have been accomplished by the most skilful navigator of antiquity. Major
                    Rennell shortens the distance considerably by conceiving the voyage to have been
                    extended no further southward than Sherbro Sound, a little beyond Sierra Leone.
                    He thus obtains the advantage of avoiding a difficulty involved in the
                    hypothesis of Μ. de Bougainville; namely, the supposition of ancient ships
                    having sailed upwards of seventy geographical miles in a day. At the same time,
                    the arguments which support the one hypothesis are equally applicable to the
                    other.</p>
                <p>According to the views of Μ. Gosselin, however, the voyage must be confined to
                    much narrower limits southward than even those assigned by Major Rennell. He
                    supposes it to have terminated about the river Nun; an opinion which he supports
                    by alleging that, in such a voyage, the progress must necessarily have been
                    slow. The Carthaginian navigator had to encounter all the obstacles and dangers
                    incident to a course held along a shore, and in a sea, which were equally
                    unknown. He must have found himself impeded by the requisite examination of
                    every part of the coast, as well as by the many precautions which the safety of
                    the fleet under his command must have rendered constantly necessary. With regard
                    to the circumstances given in the narrative which appear to point to tropical
                    Africa, Μ. Gosselin supposes that the same aspect of life and nature may, at
                    that distant period, have belonged to Morocco, then thinly peopled by the rude
                    native tribes, which is now specially characteristic of more southern re-</p>
                <p>Amidst such diversity of opinion among the learned, it is not easy to decide in
                    reference to a subject beset with so many difficulties. If we assume either of
                    the more remote distances assigned for the termination of the voyage, Cerne must
                    be identified with the isle of Arguin; and, on Major Rennell’s hypothesis, the
                    Gulfs of Bissago and Sherbro present those numerous islands described by Hanno,
                    to which there are no islands corresponding on any other part of the coast. On
                    the whole, however, the most limited distance seems preferable, if we admit that
                    part of Μ. Gosselin’s hypothesis which assigns to Morocco features of man and of
                    nature that are usually held to be characteristic of tropical Africa.</p>
                <p>The circumnavigation of Africa was an enterprise which in ancient times not only
                    called forth the naval efforts of the most powerful maritime states, but which
                    also awakened<pb break="no" facs="nls:193519037" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9037-0390"/>
                    the ambition of private adventurers. Eudoxus, a native of Cyzicus, being sent on
                    a mission to Alexandria, at that time the seat of naval enterprise and
                    geographical knowledge, his ardent mind, naturally biassed to these pursuits,
                    was aroused to action by the spirit which prevailed in that city. He began his
                    career under the auspices of Ptolemy Euergetes, the reigning Egyptian monarch,
                    who fitted out a fleet, and placed it under his command. According to the
                    destination assigned him, Eudoxus descended the Arabian Gulf, and proceeded
                    probably as far as the southern shore of Arabia. Thence he appears to have
                    returned, after a prosperous voyage, with a valuable cargo of aromatics and
                    precious stones. But of this wealth he appears to have been deprived by
                    Euergetes. After the death of this monarch, which in a short time took place,
                    his widow Cleopatra sent Eudoxus on another voyage, in the course of which he
                    was driven by unfavourable winds on the coast of Ethiopia, where he was kindly
                    received by the inhabitants, and carried on with them an advantageous traffic.
                    After other vicissitudes of fortune, he was induced by circumstances which
                    occurred in his adventurous life to leave the court of Egypt, and repair to the
                    commercial city of Cadiz, in Spain, and there to fit out an expedition for the
                    purpose of African discovery. At Massilia (Marseilles), and other maritime
                    places through which he passed on his way to Cadiz, he took care to make known
                    his views and hopes of success, and to invite all who were actuated by any
                    spirit of enterprise to accompany him. He succeeded in fitting out a ship and
                    two large boats; on board of which he carried not only goods and provisions, but
                    artisans, medical men, and even players on musical instruments. This was no
                    doubt proceeding on a magnificent scale. But his crew was ill calculated to
                    second his bold undertaking. To avoid the danger of stranding, Eudoxus was
                    anxious to keep the open sea. His companions, however, alarmed at the swell,
                    forced him to adopt the usual mode then followed of stüling along the shore; a
                    measure which led to the disaster which he had anticipated. With one vessel of a
                    lighter construction, on board of which was put the more valuable part of the
                    cargo, Eudoxus pursued his voyage until he reached a part of the coast inhabited
                    by a race of people that appeared to him to speak the same language with those
                    whom he had found on the opposite side of the continent. Judging from this
                    circumstance that he had ascertained the main object of his voyage, he returned
                    and endeavoured to obtain the assistance of Bocchus, king of Mauritania.
                    Suspecting, however, treachery on the part of that monarch, he again had
                    recourse to Spain. Here he was again successful in eauipping another expedition,
                    consisting of one large vessel fitted for the open sea, and another of smaller
                    size for the examination of the coast. This was a judicious preparation for the
                    accomplishment of the object in view; but with regard to the issue of the voyage
                    no accounts of any authority have been preserved.</p>
                <p>Such are the leading circumstances connected with the voyages of Eudoxus, which
                    are narrated by Strabo; and, notwithstanding the scepticism and severe
                    criticisms of that geographer, there is really nothing to which the candid
                    reader can reasonably refuse his belief. Prejudices, founded, for the most oart,
                    on his own want of information, led Strabo to treat likewise as fabulous the
                    relation of the only ancient voyage having Europe, and more particularly the
                    British isles, for its object, of which we have any detailed account.</p>
                <p>Pytheas, a Massilian navigator, undertook an expedition about three hundred and
                    twenty years before the Christian era. He steered northward; and after examining
                    the coasts of Spain and Gaul, he sailed round the island of Albion; and,
                    stretching still farther to the north, he discovered an island, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ultima Thule</hi> of the ancients. What island this was the
                    learned are not agreed. It has been sup posed to be the modem Iceland; but this
                    implies too great an extent of open sea for an ancient navigator to traverse;
                    and besides, six days, the period during which he is said to have navigated to
                    the northward of Albion before he made his discovery, are too short a time to
                    admit of his reaching Iceland. Others, amongst whom is Malte-Brun, have
                    considered Jutland as Ultima Thule. But it should be kept in view that Pytheas
                    uniformly regarded Thule as British, a character which he could scarcely
                    conceive to belong to Jutland, seeing he could have reached that peninsula only
                    by a long course along the coasts of Germany, which must have impressed on his
                    mind the idea that he had left far behind him every thing belonging to Britain.
                    On the whole, Shetland seems best entitled to be considered as the ancient
                    Thule, and suits well with the appellation which Pytheas gives it, when he
                    expressly calls it the “furthest of the Britains.”</p>
                <p>Strabo endeavours to throw discredit on the statements of Pytheas, by starting
                    objections long known to be of the most groundless description; and it is an
                    advantage which the traveller and navigator possess who describe faithfully the
                    grand features of nature, that, however prejudice may dim their reputation for a
                    time, yet will their accuracy as well as veracity at length, in the progress of
                    knowledge, appear, and secure for them the respect and applause of mankind. At
                    the same time, it must be admitte&lt;l that, in describing what he saw beyond
                    his Ultima Thule, the statement given by Pytheas, as reported by Strabo, assumes
                    a somewhat fabulous character. He asserted, it seems, that beyond Thule there
                    commenced what was neither earth, sea, nor air, but a confused blending of all
                    the three. But even here some allowance is to be made for the workings of
                    imagination under very peculiar circumstances, and a readiness, not unnatural,
                    to believe reports which represented him to have reached the extremity of the
                    habitable globe. If his language is not too literally interpreted, it will be
                    found to convey a strongly figurative, but not altogether imperfect, description
                    of the state of the sea and sky in these climes, which have been so little
                    favoured by nature.</p>
                <p>The conquests of Alexander the Great, by making known the East, enlarged the
                    bounds of geographical knowledge. Though the course of his expedition was for
                    the most part by land, his mind was equally intent on commerce and maritime
                    discovery. Checked as he had so long been in the career of his victories by the
                    opposition and efforts of the republic of Tyre, he had an opportunity afforded
                    him of observing the vast resources of a maritime power, and at the same time of
                    forming a judgment respecting the immense wealth to be derived from commerce,
                    especially from that carried on with India, which he found to be wholly in the
                    hands of the Tyrians. With a view to secure this commerce, as soon as he had
                    completed the conquest of Egypt, he founded the city of Alexandria, and thus
                    established for it a station preferable in many respects to Tyre. After his
                    final victory over the Persians, his march in pursuit of Bessus, who had carried
                    off Darius into Bactriana, often led him near to India, and among people
                    accustomed to much intercourse with it, from whom he learned many things
                    concerning the state of the country, that served so to confirm and inflame a
                    desire which he had long cherished of extending his dominion over those regions,
                    that he was induced to conduct his army from Bactria, for the purpose of
                    invasion, across that ridge of mountains which form the northern barrier of
                    India. After passing the Indus, Alexander directed his march to the Ganges,
                    which, from the accounts he heard of it, and of the countries through which it
                    flows, he was eager to reach. The route which he found it necessary to follow,
                    in consequence of being successively engaged in hostilities with various native
                    princes, led him through one of the richest and best peopled countries in India,
                    now called Punjab. In his ultimate object, however, he failed.</p>

                    suffered so much, that notwithstanding the high degree in which he possessed all
                    those qualities that secure an ascendency over the minds of soldiers, he was
                    unable to persuade them to advance beyond the banks of the Hyphasis, the modem
                    Beyah, which was accordingly the utmost limit of Alexander’s progress in
                    India.</p>
                <p>By this expedition, Alexander first opened the knowledge of India to the people
                    of Europe; and as he was accompanied, wherever he went, by skilful surveyors,
                    Diog-netes and Baeton, who measured the length and determined the direction of
                    every route taken by the army, he furnished a survey of an extensive district of
                    it, more accurate than could have been expected from the short time he remained
                    in that country. The memoirs drawn up by his officers likewise afforded to
                    Europeans their first authentic information respecting the climate, the soil,
                    the productions, and the inhabitants of India.</p>
                <p>Though Alexander did not penetrate to the Ganges, his expedition prepared the way
                    to the knowledge of that magnificent stream. For soon after, Seleucus, one of
                    his successors, sent Megasthenes as his ambassador to Palibothra, the capital of
                    a powerful nation on the banks of the Ganges. The site of Palibothra was
                    probably the same as that of the modern city of Allahabad, at the junction of
                    the river Jumna with the Ganges. This embassy brought new and opulent provinces
                    of India into view, an acquaintance with which served to raise still higher the
                    idea generally entertained of the value and importance of the country.</p>
                <p>The island <hi rend="italic">Taprobane,</hi> so celebrated among the ancients,
                    which appears, notwithstanding some great mistakes with respect both to extent
                    and position, to be the modem Ceylon, seems not to have been known in Europe
                    even by name before the age of Alexander. In consequence, however, of the
                    enlightened and active curiosity with which he explored every country which he
                    subdued or visited, some knowledge of it was at length obtained; and, after his
                    time, it is mentioned by almost every ancient geographer.</p>
                <p>Whilst Alexander was attempting to penetrate into India, a numerous fleet was
                    assembled by officers whom he had left on the banks of the Hydaspes, the modern
                    Behat or Chelum, with orders to build and collect as many ships as they could.
                    The destination of this fleet was to sail down the Indus to the ocean, and from
                    its mouth to proceed to the Persian Gulf, with a view of opening a communication
                    between India and the centre of his dominions.</p>
                <p>When Alexander reached the banks of the Hydaspes on his return, he committed the
                    conduct of this expedition to Nearchus. The voyage down the Indus derived
                    splendour from the greatness and magnificence of the armament, which consisted
                    of an army of a hundred and twenty thousand men, and two hundred elephante, and
                    of a fleet of nearly two thousand vessels. Alexander himself accompanied
                    Nearchus in his navigation down the river, with one third of the troops on
                    board; whilst the remainder, in two divisions, one on the right and the other on
                    the left of the river, accompanied them in their progress. Having reached the
                    ocean after the lapse of nine months, Alexander left Nearchus and his crew to
                    pursue their voyage, and conducted hi <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> army back by
                    land to Persia. A coasting voyage of seven months brought Nearchus, with the
                    fleet, in safety, <hi rend="subscript"> up</hi> the Persian Gulf ∙nto the
                    Euphrates. It was at the mouth of the Indus that the Greeks witnessed for the
                    first time, and that with astonishment and terror, the ebb and flow of the sea;
                    a phenomenon scarcely perceptible in the Mediterranean, to whach their
                    navigation had formerly been confined. In the progress of the voyage they were
                    also struck with surprise on observing phenomena belonging to the midsummer of
                    the tropics. At noon objects were observed to project no shadows, or to project
                    small shadows declining to the south. Their attention was still further
                    attracted by the new appearance of the sky. Stars which they had been accustomed
                    to see high in the heavens were now seen near the horizon. Some stars to the
                    north disappeared, while other stars formerly invisible were seen in the
                    south.</p>
                <p>The opening of a communication between the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf was with
                    Alexander another great object of ambition. But though with this view he seems
                    to have sent expeditions down both seas, he failed in his attempts to accomplish
                    this project.</p>
                <p>Among the Romans, navigation and commerce, the handmaids of geographical science,
                    were never made objects of pursuit, except in so far as they were found to be
                    necessary to forward their schemes of universal dominion. Their conquests opened
                    indeed the west, as those of Alexander had made known the east; and it might be
                    truly said of that great people, that as they were the conquerors, so they were
                    the surveyors of the world. Every new war produced a new survey and itinerary of
                    the countries which were the scenes of action; so that the materials of
                    geography were accumulated by every additional conquest. Some fragments of the
                    itineraries thus composed still remain. The most memorable is that which bears
                    the name of Antoninus, and which may be described as a mere skeleton road-book,
                    exhibiting nothing more than the names of places, and their distances from each
                    other. The Jerusalem Itinerary, which details minutely the route from Bordeaux
                    to that holy city, is of the same description.</p>
                <p>A more remarkable monument, however, is the <hi rend="italic">Peu-tìngerian
                    Table,</hi> which forms a map of the world, constructed on the most singular
                    principles. The map is twenty feet long and only one foot broad, so that we can
                    easily conceive how incorrectly the proportion of the different parte is
                    exhibited. Along the high road which traverses the Roman empire in the general
                    direction of east and west, objects are minutely and accurately represented; but
                    of those objects which lie to the north and south of it, only some general
                    notion is conveyed. The Peutingerian Table serves as a specimen of what were
                    called <hi rend="italic">Jtinera Picla,</hi> the “painted roads” of the
                    ancients, intended for the clearer direction of the march of their armies.</p>
                <p>While the Romans by their surveys contributed much to increase the mass of
                    materials out of which the structure of geographical science was to be reared,
                    they never attempted themselves to combine these materials into one harmonious
                    system. They imbibed in no degree the commercial spirit of the great maritime
                    states of the ancient world, Carthage, Greece, and Egypt, which their valour and
                    discipline obliged to submit to their dominion. But whilst the trade of the
                    conquered countries continued to be carried on through nearly the former
                    channels after they were reduced to the form of Roman provinces, the wealth
                    accumulated in the capital of the world gave rise to a demand for luxuries of
                    every description. This, combined with the comparative peace and security which
                    for a long time prevailed after the complete establishment of the Roman
                    dominion, gave new vigour to commercial enterprise. Alexandria continued the
                    great centre of naval affairs. Obstacles which in the time of Alexander were
                    deemed insurmountable, were completely overcome. Trade with India through Egypt
                    acquired new energy, and was carried on to a greater extent. Continued
                    intercourse with the shores of India at length made known to navigators the
                    periodical winds which prevail in the Indian Ocean; and taking advantage of
                    these, pilots were emboldened to abandon the slow and dangerous course along the
                    coasts, and to make the open sea their highway<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193519063" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9063-0392"/>. Their course was from
                    Ocelis, at the mouth of the Arabian Gulf, to Nelkunda (Nelisuram), on the
                    western shores of the Indian continent (the coast of Malabar), which seems to
                    have been the utmost limit of the ancient navigation in that quarter of the
                    globe. The extensive regions which stretch beyond this to the east were very
                    imperfectly known by the reports obtained from a few adventurers who visited
                    them by land.</p>
                <p>If we now bring into one view the amount of information possessed by the ancients
                    respecting the habitable globe, we shall find that it was extremely limited. It
                    was at those places on the earth where the human mind displayed greatest
                    activity and enterprise that this knowledge was naturally accumulated.
                    Proceeding from these stations, the boundary which separated the known from the
                    unknown part of the world was gradually enlarged; but the regions comprehended
                    within it constituted still but a small portion of the whole. In Europe the
                    extensive provinces in the eastern part of Germany were but little known, while
                    the whole of that vast territory which now forms the countries of Denmark,
                    Sweden, Prussia, Poland, and Russia, was buried in the deepest obscurity. The
                    inhospitable and dreary climes within the arctic circle were yet unexplored. In
                    Africa little was known beyond the countries stretching along the Mediterranean
                    Sea, and those bordering on the western shore of the Arabian Gulf. In Asia the
                    rich and fertile countries beyond the Ganges, whence the commerce of modern
                    times has drawn the most valuable commodities for the comfort and embellishment
                    of civilized society, were known, if known at all, only by the most vague and
                    uncertain reports. The immense regions on the north occupied by the wandering
                    tribes called in ancient times by the general names of Sarmatians or Scythians,
                    and which are now inhabited by various tribes of Tartars, and by the Asiatic
                    subjects of Russia, seem never to have been penetrated. Add to this, that the
                    fertile and populous regions within the torrid zone were imagined to be
                    uninhabitable; and we have ample proof that the geography of the ancients was
                    very imperfect.</p>
                <p>Having thus far given a succinct view of the progressive steps by which the
                    earth’s surface, considered merely as tracts of territory inhabited by men,
                    gradually became known, it will be proper next to trace briefly the advances
                    made towards arranging into a systematic form the materials accumulated. Science
                    required that the relative positions of places, with their distances from each
                    other, should be ascertained in such a manner as to furnish fixed principles on
                    which the whole, or any portion, of the surface of the earth might be
                    represented or delineated with due regard to its figure and dimensions.</p>
                <p>The first rude attempt made by the early geographers to determine the position of
                    places appears to have depended on the division of the earth into <hi
                    rend="italic">climates,</hi> distinguished by the species of animals and plants
                    produced in each. Thus the appearance of the negro, the rhinoceros, and the
                    elephant, suggested to them the line of division where the torrid zone began
                    towards the north, and ended towards the south. But instead of this very vague
                    method, another was soon adopted, which consisted in observing at places the
                    length of the longest and shortest day. This was determined with some accuracy
                    by means of a <hi rend="italic">gnomon,</hi> a method of observation much used
                    by the ancients. An upright pillar of a known height being erected on a level
                    pavement, by observing the lengths of the meridian shadows, they were enabled to
                    trace the progress of the sun from tropic to tropic. The most ancient
                    observation with the gnomon which we meet with is that of Pytheas, in the days
                    of Alexander the Great. Pytheas observed at the summer solstice at Marseilles,
                    that the length of the meridian shadow was to the height of the gnomon as 213⅜
                    to 600; an observation which makes the meridian altitude of the sun at
                    Marseilles on that day 70° 27 ’. The merit of the invention of the gnomon in
                    Greece is ascribed to the astronomical school of Miletus, and particularly to
                    Anaximander and Anaximenes. There is reason, however, to believe that this
                    method of observation was originally invented by the Egyptians; and that Thales,
                    who travelled into Egypt, carried thence the knowledge of it into Greece. It has
                    even been conjectured that the Egyptian pyramids and obelisks were intended for
                    the same purpose with the gnomon; and, though it would be extravagant to imagine
                    that this was their sole use, this opinion appears to be countenanced by the
                    fact of their being placed in the direction of the four cardinal points.</p>
                <p>The determination of the length of the meridian shadow at the solstices for
                    different parts of the earth, by observations made with the gnomon, is important
                    as being the first step towards connecting geography with astronomy; and, when
                    combined with just conceptions of the globular figure of the earth, leads, by a
                    simple train of thought, to the notion of latitude by which the position of a
                    place is fixed relatively to north and south. The position with regard to east
                    and west is the only other element necessary for fixing the absolute situation
                    of the place on the surface of the earth. It might have been supposed not to be
                    more than a reflecting mind could easily accomplish, to reach the conception of
                    both these elements, and to apply them to use. Yet so slow was the progress
                    towards the apprehension of the principles on which an accurate system of
                    geography might be founded, that from the days of Thales and his immediate
                    successors, who flourished in the sixth century before the Christian era, there
                    appears to have been little done for the improvement of geography, as a science,
                    until the establishment of the famous astronomical school of Alexandria.
                    Pythagoras had indeed maintained the true system of the world, by placing the
                    sun in the centre, and giving the earth both a diurnal and annual revolution;
                    but this doctrine was so much in advance of the age in which he promulgated it,
                    that it was soon lost sight of.</p>
                <p>Eratosthenes was the first who reduced geography to a regular system, and laid
                    its foundations on clear and solid principles. Under the patronage of the
                    Ptolemies, he had access to the materials collected by Alexander, his generals
                    and successors, as well as to the immense mass of documents accumulated in the
                    Alexandrian library. At an early period of the history of astronomical science,
                    the vulgar opinion that the earth is a flat surface, with the heavens resting
                    upon it as a canopy, was rejected; but it was not at once that distinct
                    conceptions of its globular figure were acquired. It was only as astronomical
                    observations increased that the doctrine of its sphericity was fully
                    established. This point had been gained when Eratosthenes began his labours; and
                    what he endeavoured to accomplish was to delineate, in strict conformity with
                    this principle, the known parts of the earth’s surface.</p>
                <p>With this view, founding his system on the use of the gnomon, he supposed a line
                    to be traced through certain places, in all of which the longest day was known
                    to be exactly of the same length. This line would evidently be a parallel to the
                    equator. But though his method was correct in principle, the want of accurate
                    observations rendered it uncertain in practice. The line was supposed to
                    comprise all the leading positions which, lay near it, though they did not
                    actually come within its range. Its western extremity was the Sacred Promontory
                    of Iberia (Cape St Vincent); thence it passed through the Straits of Gades.
                    Proceeding eastward, it passed through the Sicilian Sea, and near the southern
                    extremity of the Peloponnesus, and was continued through the island of <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193519076" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9076-0393"/> principles
                    imperfectly understood.” Any one who peruses a few pages of the dialogues will
                    be at no loss how to interpret this declaration, nor will he feel any surprise
                    that those whom Galileo here pretended to vindicate should have evinced but
                    little gratitude for such a justification. But what can scarcely be imagined
                    now, is the fury which the appearance of this work excited amongst the
                    theologians of Rome, almost all of whom were ardent peripatetics. In vain did
                    Galileo attempt to escape by alleging that his book had been submitted to the
                    judgment of the holy see; in vain did he, as a last resource, protest that his
                    only object had been to expound, in a philosophical manner, the two systems of
                    Ptolemy and Copernicus. His enemies would not suffer any such excuse to be
                    listened to. Still there remained to him some hope, founded upon the personal
                    esteem of Pope Urban VIII., who, on a former occasion, had given him a most
                    gracious reception, and had even paid his astronomical discoveries the
                    compliment of celebrating them in bad verse; but the holy father having been
                    persuaded that Galileo had intended to represent him under the character of
                    Simplicius, his wounded self-love rendered his severity inexorable.<note

                    intercession of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, and the earnest solicitations which
                    this prince caused to be made by his ambassador, the work of Galileo was delated
                    to the Inquisition, and the author himself ordained to appear before that
                    formidable tribunal.</p>
                <p>The power of Rome was then supreme; it was necessary to obey. Neither the
                    infirmity of his health, nor the pain he suffered from a rheumatic complaint
                    which afflicted him, could procure an exemption from that sorrowful journey.
                    This was in 1633, Galileo being then in the sixty-ninth year of his age. “I
                    arrived at Rome,” says he, in one of his letters, “on the 10th February, and was
                    remitted to the clemency of the Inquisition, and of the sovereign pontiff, Urban
                    VIII. who had some esteem for me, although I could not compose epigrams or write
                    little amatory sonnets. I was put under arrest in the delicious palace of the
                    Trinità de’ Monti, the residence of the ambassador of Tuscany. Next day I
                    received a visit from Father Lancio, commissary of the holy office, who took me
                    with him in his coach. By the way he put to me a number of questions, and showed
                    a great desire that 1 would repair the scandal which I had given to all Italy by
                    maintaining the opinion of the motion of the earth; and to all the mathematical
                    reasons which I could oppose to him, he could make no other answer than this:
                    <hi rend="italic">Terra</hi><hi rend="italic">autem</hi><hi rend="italic">in
                    aeternum</hi><hi rend="italic">stabit,</hi><hi rend="italic">quia terra in
                    aeternum stat.</hi> In discoursing thus we arrived at the palace of the holy
                    office. I was presented by the commissary to the assessor, with whom 1 found two
                    religious Dominicans, who civilly informed me that I would be permitted to
                    explain my reasons before the congregation, and that afterwards I should be
                    heard as to my grounds of excuse, if I was found guilty. The Thursday following
                    I appeared before the congregation, and applied myself to the exposition of my
                    proofs. But, unfortunately for me, they were not apprehended; and,
                    notwithstanding all the pains I took, I could not succeed in making myself
                    understood. My reasonings were cut short by bursts of zeal; they spoke to me
                    only of the scandal which I had occasioned; and always opposed to me the passage
                    of Scripture on the miracle of Joshua as the victorious piece of my process.
                    This brought to my recollection another passage where the language of the sacred
                    book is evidently conformable to popular ideas, since it is said that <hi
                    rend="italic">the heavens are solid, and polished like a mirror of brass.</hi>
                    This example appeared to me one in point to prove that the expression of Joshua
                    might be similarly interpreted; and the consequence seemed to me perfectly just.
                    But no regard whatever was paid to it; and all the answer I received consisted
                    of shrugs of the shoulders.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    30th of April Galileo was sent back to the residence of the ambassador, with a
                    prohibition not to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> beyond the <hi rend="italic"
                    >enceinte</hi> of the palace, but with permission to walk freely in the
                    extensive gardens attached to it. On the 22d of June he was again brought before
                    the tribunal to hear the sentence read, and pronounce the abjuration dictated to
                    him, according to which the venerable philosopher was made to say, “I abjure,
                    curse, and detest the error and heresy of the motion of the earth,” &amp;c. and
                    to promise that he would never more in future say or assert any thing, verbally
                    or in writing, importing “that the sun is the centre of the world, and
                    immoveable; and that the earth is not the centre of the world, and moveable.”
                    This expiation being completed, his dialogues were prohibited; he was condemned
                    to suffer imprisonment for an indefinite period; and, as asalutary punishment,
                    he was ordained to recite once a week for three years, the seven penitential
                    psalms. Such was the unworthy recompense of one of the greatest geniuses that
                    has ever enlightened humanity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    remarkable records of intolerant ignorance and bigoted folly to be found in the
                    history of science, is conceived in the following terms :—" We, the undersigned,
                    by the grace of God, cardinals of the Holy Roman church, Inquisitors General
                    throughout the whole Christian Republic, Special Deputies of the Holy
                    Apostolical Chair against heretical depravity: whereas you, Galileo, son of the
                    late vinceιιzo Galilei of Florence, aged seventy years, were denounced in 1615
                    to this holy office, for holding as true a false doctrine taught by many,
                    namely, that the sun is immoveable in the centre of the world, and that the
                    earth moves, and also with a diurnal motion; also, for having pupils whom you
                    instructed in the same opinions; also, for maintaining a correspondence on the
                    same with some German mathematicians; also, for publishing certain letters on
                    the solar spots, in which you developed the same doctrine as true; also, for
                    answering the objections which were continually produced from the holy
                    Scriptures, by glozing the said Scriptures according to your own meaning; and
                    whereas thereupon was produced the copy of a writing, in form of a letter,
                    professedly written by you to a person formerly your pupil, in which, following
                    the hypothesis of Copernicus, you include several propositions contrary to the
                    true sense and authority of the holy Scripture: therefore this holy tribunal,
                    being desirous of providing against the disorder and mischief which was thence
                    proceeding and increasing, to the detriment of the holy faith, by the desire of
                    his holiness, and of the most eminent lords cardinals of this supreme and
                    universal Inquisition, the two propositions of the sUbility of the sun, and
                    motion of the earth, were <hi rend="italic">qualified</hi> by the <hi

                    >The proposition that the sun is in the centre of the world, and immoveable from
                    its place, is absurd, philosophically</hi><hi rend="italic">false,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">and formally heretical, because it is expressly contrary to the
                    holy Scripture</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> 2dly, <hi rend="italic">The
                    proposition that the earth is not the centre of the world, nor immoveable, but
                    that it moves, and also with a diurnal motion, is also absurd, philosophically
                    false, and, theologically considered, at least erroneous in faith.</hi> But
                    whereas being pleased at that time to deal mildly with you, it was decreed in
                    the holy congregation, held before his holiness on the 25th day of February
                    1616, that his eminence the Lord Cardinal Bellarmine should enjoin you to give
                    up altogether the said false doctrine; if you should refuse, that you should be
                    ordered by the commissary of the holy office to relinquish it, not to teach it
                    to others, nor to defend it, nor ever mention it, and in default of acquiescence
                    that you should be imprisoned; and in execution of this decree, on the following
                    day, at the palace, in presence of his eminence the said Lord Cardinal
                    Bellarmine, after you had been mildly admonished by the said lord cardinal, you
                    were commanded by the acting commissary of the holy office, before a notary and
                    witnesses, to relinquish altogether the said false opinion, and in future
                    neither to defend nor teach it in any manner, neither verbally nor in writing;
                    and upon your promising obedience you were dismissed. And in order that so
                    pernicious a doctrine might be altogether rooted out, nor insinuate itself
                    farther to the heavy detriment of the Catholic truth, a decree emanated from the
                    holy congregation of the index prohi <pb break="no" n="294"/>biting the books
                    which treat of this doctrine; and it was declared false, and altogether contrary
                    to the holy and divine Scripture. And whereas a book has since appeared,
                    published at Florence last year, the title of which showed that you were the
                    author, which title is, <hi rend="italic">The Dialogue of Galileo Galilei, on
                    the two principal systems of the world, the Ptolemaic and Copernican</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and whereas the holy congregation has heard that, in
                    consequence of the printing of the said book, the false opinion of the earth’s
                    motion and stability of the sun is daily gaining ground, the said book has been
                    taken into careful consideration, and in it has been detected a glaring
                    violation of the said order, which had been intimated to you; inasmuch as in
                    this book you have defended the said opinion, already and in your presence
                    condemned; although in the said book you labour with many circumlocutions to
                    induce the belief that it is left by you undecided, and in express terms
                    probable; which is equaUy a very grave error, since an opinion can in no way be
                    probahle which has been already declared and finaÚy determined contrary to the
                    divine Scripture. Therefore by our order you have been cited to this holy
                    office, where, on your examination upon oath, you have acknowledged the said
                    book as written and printed by you. You also confessed that you began to write
                    the said book ten or twelve years ago, after the order aforesaid had been given.
                    Also, that you demanded license to publish it, but without signifying to those
                    who granted you this permission that you had been commanded not to hold, defend,
                    or teach the said doctrine in any manner. You also confessed that the style of
                    the said book was, in many places, so composed that the reader might think the
                    arguments adduced on the false side to be so worded as more effectually to
                    entangle the understanding than to be easily solved, alleging in excuse that you
                    have thus run into an error, foreign (as you say) to your intention, from
                    writing in the form of a dialogue, and in consequence of the natural complacency
                    which every one feels with regard to his own subtilties, and in showing himself
                    more skilful than the generality of mankind in contriving, even in favour of
                    false propositions, ingenious and apparently probable arguments. And, upon a
                    convenient time being given to you for making your defence, you produced a
                    certificate in the handwriting of his eminence the Lord Cardinal Bellarmine,
                    procured as you said by yourself, that you might defend yourself against the
                    calumnies of your enemies, who reported that you had abjured your opinions, and
                    had been punished by the holy office; in which certificate it is declared that
                    you had not abjured, nor had been punished, but merely that the declaration made
                    by his holiness, and promulgated by the holy congregation of the index, had been
                    announced to you, which declares that the opinion of the motion of the -earth,
                    and stability of the sun, is contrary to the holy Scriptures, and therefore
                    cannot be held or defended. wherefore, since no mention is there made of two
                    articles of the order, to wit, the order ‘ not to teach,’ and * in any manner,’
                    you argued that we ought to believe that, in the lapse of fourteen or sixteen
                    years they had escaped your memory, and that this was also the reason why you
                    were silent as to the order, when you sought permission to publish your book,
                    and that this is said by you not to excuse your error, but that it may be
                    attributed to vain-glorious ambition rather than to malice. But this very
                    certificate, produced on your behalf, has greatly aggravated your offence, since
                    it is therein declared that the said opinion is contrary to the holy Scripture,
                    and yet you have dared to treat of it, to defend it, and to argue that it is
                    probable; nor is there any extenuation in the license artfully and cunningly
                    extorted by you, since you did not intimate the command imposed upon you. But
                    whereas it appeared to us that you had not disclosed the whole truth with regard
                    to your intentions, we thought it necessary to proceed to the rigorous
                    examination of you, in which (without any prejudice to what you had confessed,
                    and which is above detailed against you. with regard to your said intention) you
                    answered like a good catholic. Therefore, having seen and maturely considered
                    the merits of your cause, with your said confessions and excuses, and every
                    thing else which ought to be seen and considered, we have come to the
                    underwritten final sentence against you. Invoking, therefore, the most holy name
                    of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of his most glorious virgin Mother Mary, by this
                    our final sentence, which, sitting in council and judgment for the tribunal of
                    the reverend masters of sacred theology, and doctors of both laws, our
                    assessors, we put forth in this writing touching the matters and controversies
                    before us, between the magnificent Charles Sincerus, doctor of both laws, fiscal
                    proctor of this holy office of the one part, and you, Galileo Galilei, an
                    examined and confessed criminal from this present writing now in progress as
                    above of the other part, we pronounce, judge, and declare, that you, the said
                    Galileo, by reason of these things which have been detailed in the course of
                    this writing, and which, as above, you have confessed, have rendered yourself
                    vehemently suspected by this holy office of heresy; that is to say, that you
                    believe and hold the false doctrine, and contrary to the holy and divine
                    Scriptures, namely, that the sun is the centre of the world, and that it does
                    not move-from east to west, and that the earth does move, and is not the centre
                    of the world; also that an opinion can be held and supported as probable after
                    it has been declared and finally decreed contrary to the holy Scripture, and
                    consequently that you have-incurred all the censures and penalties enjoined and
                    promulgated in the sacred canons, and other general and particular constitutions
                    against delinquents of this description. From which it is our pleasure that you
                    be absolved, provided that, first, with a sincere heart and unfeigned faith, in
                    our presence, you abjure, curse, and detest the said errors and heresies, and
                    every other error and heresy contrary to the Catholic and apostolic church of
                    Rome, in the form now shown to you. But, that your grievous and pernicious error
                    and transgression may not go altogether unpunishe&lt;l, and that you may be made
                    more cautious in future, and may be a warning to others to abstain from
                    delinquencies of this sort, we decree that the book of the Dialogues of Galileo
                    Galilei be prohibited by a public edict, and we condemn you to the formal prison
                    of this holy office, for a period determinable at our pleasure; and, by way of
                    salutary penance, we order you, during the next three years, to recite once a
                    week the seven penitential psalms, reserving to ourselves the power of
                    moderating, commuting, or taking off the whole or part of the said punishment
                    and pen. ance. And so we say, pronounce, and by our sentence declare, decree,
                    and reserve, in this and in every other better form and manner, which lawfully
                    we may andean use.' So we, the subscribing cardinals, pronounce. Felix, Cardinal
                    di Ascoli; Guido, Cardinal Bentivoglio; Desiderio, Cardinal di Cremona; Antonio,
                    Cardinal S. Gnofrio; Berlingero, Cardinal Gessi; Fabricio, Cardinal Yerospi;
                    Martino, Cardinal Ginetti.” This document is decisive as to the fallacy of the
                    allegation, that “Galileo was not persecuted as a good astronomer, but only as a
                    bad theologian."</p></note></p>

                <p>latione; and thus furnished the means of ascertaining the relative situations of
                    places with a precision which no itinerary measurements could possibly attain.
                    If we suppose the earth to be a globe concentric with the celestial sphere, and
                    intersected by the planes of the celestial equator and meridian, the principle
                    on which the application of this artifice to the terrestrial sphere depends
                    becomes at once obvious. Hipparchus made a considerable number of observations
                    of latitude, and pointed out how longitudes might be determined by observing the
                    eclipses of the sun and moon. Great as this improvement was, its importance
                    seems not to have been duly estimated until the days of Ptolemy; for none of the
                    intermediate authors, such as Strabo, Vetruvius, and Pliny, have given the least
                    hint of the latitude and longitude of any one place in degrees and minutes,
                    though all of them have given minutely the geographical position of places
                    according to the length and shadows of the gnomon. Strabo, indeed, even
                    justifies his neglect of the astronomical principles introduced by Hipparchus.
                    “A geographer,” says he, “is to pay no attention to what is out of the earth;
                    nor will men engaged in conducting the affairs of that part of the earth which
                    is inhabited, deem the distinction and divisions of Hipparchus worthy of
                    notice.”</p>
                <p>The true principles of geography being pointed out by the application of latitude
                    and longitude to places on the earth, the way was opened for the improvement of
                    maps, which, with the single exception of the map drawn by Eratosthenes, had
                    hitherto been little more than rude outlines and topographical sketches of the
                    different countries.</p>
                <p>No maps more ancient than those formed to illustrate Ptolemy’s geography have
                    reached modern times; but the earliest of which there is any account are those
                    of Sesostris, of whom it is said, that having traversed great part of the earth,
                    he caused his marches to be recorded in maps; and that he gave copies of these
                    maps not only to the Egyptians, but to the Scythians, whose astonishment he thus
                    greatly excited.</p>
                <p>Some have imagined that the Jews made a map*of the Holy Land when they gave the
                    different portions to the nine tribes at Shiloh. For on that occasion, as we are
                    informed by the sacred historian, men were sent “to walk through the land, and
                    to describe it:” and when they had accomplished the object of their mission, by
                    describing “it by cities into seven parts, in a book,” they returned unto
                    Joshua. What is here said, however, does not fully determine whether their
                    mensuration of the land was only recorded in numbers, or regularly projected and
                    digested into the form of a map.</p>
                <p>The first Grecian map on record is that of Anaximander, mentioned by Strabo,
                    which some have conjectured to have been a general map of the then known world.
                    It has further been imagined to be the same with that referred to by Hipparchus
                    under the designation of <hi rend="italic">The Ancient Map,</hi> and which in
                    some few particulars he preferred to that of Eratosthenes.</p>
                <p>But some idea of the nature of the maps of those early days will be best obtained
                    from the map of Aristagoras, king of Miletus, which is minutely described by
                    Herodotus: The historian tells us that this map, which was traced on brass or
                    copper, Aristagoras showed to Cleomenes, king of Sparta, in order to induce him
                    to attack the king of Persia, even in his palace at Susa, for the purpose of
                    restoring the Ionians to their ancient freedom. It contained the intermediate
                    countries to be traversed in that march. We must not interpret, however, the
                    words of Herodotus too literally, when he describes it as containing “the whole
                    circumference of the earth, the whole sea or ocean, and all the rivers.” Keeping
                    in view the state of geography at that period, it may justly be concluded, that
                    notwithstanding this pompous form of expression, <hi rend="italic">the sea</hi>
                    meant only the Mediterranean, and therefore <hi rend="italic">the earth</hi> or
                    land the coasts of that sea, and more particularly Asia Minor, extended towards
                    the middle of Persia: by <hi rend="italic">the rivers</hi> must be meant the
                    Halys, the Euphrates, and the Tigris, which Herodotus mentions as necessary to
                    be crossed in the expedition in question. The map contained one straight line,
                    called the <hi rend="italic">royal highway,</hi> embracing all the stations or
                    places of encampment between Sardis and Susa, so that it was properly an
                    itinerary.</p>
                <p>The principle on which Eratosthenes constructed his map we have already
                    considered. With regard to its extent, it seems to have contained little more
                    than the states of Greece, and the dominions of the successors of Alexander,
                    digested from the surveys of the marches of that great general. He had some <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> faint idea respecting the western parts of Europe,
                    which he had acquired from the voyage of Pytheas; but not such a conception as
                    to enable him to delineate their outline on a chart. According to the report of
                    Strabo, he was quite unacquainted with Spain, Gaul, Germany, and Britain, he was
                    equally ignorant of Italy, the coasts of the Adriatic, Pontus, and of all the
                    countries toward the north. His errors with regard to the distances of places
                    were in some instances enormous. The distance of Carthage from Alexandria he
                    represents at 15,000 stadia, instead of 9000.</p>
                <p>It was not until Ptolemy commenced his labours that the improvements pointed out
                    by Hipparchus were effectually applied to perfect the system which Eratosthenes
                    had so happily begun. Ptolemy composed his system of geography, which escaped
                    amidst the general wreck which has consumed so many other ancient books of
                    science, in the reign of Antoninus Pius, about 150 years after the opening of
                    the Christian era. At this period the Roman empire had reached its utmost
                    extent, and all the provinces had been surveyed, and were well known. The
                    materials then in existence, and in the possession of Ptolemy for completing his
                    great work, were the proportions of the height of the gnomon and its shadow, at
                    the time of the equinoxes and solstices, taken by different astronomers;
                    calculations founded on the length of the longest days; the measures or computed
                    distances of the principal roads contained in the surveys and itineraries; and
                    the various reports of travellers and navigators, whose determinations of the
                    distances of places often rested, however, on no better foundation than hearsay
                    and conjecture. Among these various particulars, there evidently existed
                    considerable differences in point of authority. But Ptolemy undertook the
                    difficult and laborious task of comparing, and reducing into one system, which
                    should possess the order and beauty of science, this apparently incongruous
                    mass. He converted and translated the whole into a new mathematical language,
                    expressing in degrees and minutes the latitude and longitude of each place,
                    according to the principles laid down by Hipparchus, but which had been allowed
                    by geographers to lie useless for upwards of two hundred and fifty years. It is
                    in Ptolemy’s work, which consists of eight books, that we find for the first
                    time the mathematical principles of the construction of maps, both general and
                    particular, as well as of several projections of the sphere.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding that the light of accurate science thus directed the steps of the
                    first geographer of antiquity, he was far from reaching the precision at which
                    he aimed. This arose from the imperfection of the original materials upon which
                    his work is based in reference to its details. With regard to the remoter
                    boundaries of the then known world, in all its quarters, a wonderful advancement
                    in knowledge had been made since the days of Eratosthenes and of Strabo. But
                    still that additional information was not fitted to make up for the want of
                    astronomical observations, by which alone accuracy could be secured. Besides, in
                    relation to places situated beyond the limits of the Roman <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193519102" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9102-0395"/>empire, and therefore out of
                    the range alike of astrono∙ ' mers and surveyors, it was almost impossible for
                    Ptolemy not to commit mistakes. Thus his errors arose from the ignorance of the
                    age; and are of such a character as to admit of being removed only as
                    opportunities are afforded of obtaining the requisite data by the strict
                    application of the principles derived from mathematical and astronomical
                    science.</p>
                <p>Ptolemy adopted the measure of a degree at 500 stadia, according to the standard
                    of Possidonius, instead of following the measurement of Eratosthenes, which
                    gives 700 stadia to a degree. But Μ. Gosselin has accused him of an error of a
                    more serious kind; because, if really committed, it would have indicated a
                    strange neglect of what a geographer should make his first care. This error
                    consists in assuming one measure for the degree of latitude (the measure of
                    Eratosthenes, 700 stadia) and another for the degree of longitude at the
                    equator. Such a hypothesis would evidently be inconsistent with the globular
                    figure of the earth. It may reasonably be doubted, however, whether Μ.
                    Gosselin’s accusation is well founded; for, though it seems supported by the
                    fact, that, while Ptolemy has changed materially all the longitudes of
                    Eratosthenes, the latitudes along the great line remain the same, and are in
                    general correct, this circumstance may be accounted for sufficiently from other
                    causes. Rhodes, and several other points of this great line, were fixed with
                    regard to latitude by observations approximating to the truth, while the
                    elements for determining the longitudes were derived entirely from the
                    itineraries. To the north and south of the great central line, which alone was
                    fixed upon sound data, errors in latitude accumulate as rapidly as those in
                    longitude are found to do in proceeding eastward.</p>
                <p>One of the most remarkable errors in the geographical work of Ptolemy is the
                    great length assigned to the Mediterranean. Reckoning from the Straits of Gades
                    to the bottom of the Bay of Issus, where Alexandretta, or Scanderoon, now
                    stands, he makes the difference of longitude no less than sixty-two degrees,
                    which is upwards of twenty and a half degrees above the truth. This amazing
                    error, which affected all our maps more or less until the beginning of the last
                    century, was produced in consequence of his having put too much confidence in
                    the supposed surveys of different persons of reputation recorded by Strabo, and
                    who appeared to confirm the accuracy of each other’s computation. According to
                    their united testimony, the whole length of the Mediterranean was about 26,500
                    stadia, which, being converted into degrees of longitude according to the method
                    of Ptolemy, of allowing 400 stadia to a degree of longitude on the parallel of
                    Rhodes, give about 66° 1 5 ’. This is 4° 15 ’ more than what are given by
                    Marinus, whom in this particular Ptolemy strictly follows.</p>
                <p>Pliny quotes from Agrippa a computation of the length of the Mediterranean, which
                    makes it 3440 Roman miles; but in quoting it he adds a suspicion that there is
                    an error in the numbers. When converted into degrees of longitude, the result of
                    this computation gives 58° 20 ’. As, however, the length given by Strabo
                    amounted, as we have seen, to 66° 1 5 ’, Ptolemy seems to have chosen a middle
                    path between these two erroneous computations, and to have adopted 62° for the
                    difference of longitude in question. But there is another ancient computation
                    quoted also by Pliny from Polybius, according to which the length of the
                    Mediterranean is stated to be 2440 Roman miles. Had Ptolemy followed this
                    estimate, he would have obtained for a result 41° <hi rend="italic">V,</hi>
                    which is not far from the truth.</p>
                <p>Thus we see that the circumstances under which Ptolemy wrote rendered it
                    impossible for him to avoid mistakes, and that he might be misled even when more
                    accurate results were within his reach.</p>
                <p>The great obstacle with which the ancients had to contend was the finding of the
                    longitude with accuracy, a problem for the solution of which it was long before
                    there was discovered any method sufficiently exact. This accounts for the
                    erroneous longitudes of Ptolemy, and more especially for the length of time,
                    even many centuries, during which the remarkable error with regard to the length
                    of the Mediterranean remained undiscovered and uncorrected.</p>
                <p>We have now traced the history of geography from the earliest period of which we
                    have any information, to the time when it assumes a scientific character. We
                    shall conclude our account of ancient geography by shortly noticing the
                    principal geographers of antiquity, some of whom have not yet been mentioned,
                    while others have only been quoted in tracing the rise and progress of the
                    science.</p>
                <p>The intimate connection between geography and the sciences of geometry and
                    astronomy, rendered the former an object of attention to many who anciently
                    cultivated the latter. We have already mentioned Anaximander and Anaximenes, of
                    the school of Miletus. Democritus, Eudoxus of Cnidus, and Parmenides, are also
                    reported to have improved geography; and to the last is attributed the division
                    of the earth into zones. These were followed by Eratosthenes, who lived about
                    two hundred and forty years before the Christian era; by Hipparchus about eighty
                    years afterwards; by Polybius, Geminus, and Possidonius. Eratosthenes wrote
                    three books on geography, some passages of which Strabo criticises, though he
                    frequently defends him against Hipparchus, who appears to oppose his opinions
                    with some degree of affectation. Polybius also wrote on geography; as did
                    likewise Geminus and Possidonius, who are frequently quoted by Strabo. Polybius,
                    according to Geminus, argued with considerable acuteness for the possibility of
                    the torrid zone being inhabited; and he even adduced plausible arguments to
                    prove that the countries under the equator enjoy a more temperate climate than
                    the countries do that are situated near the tropics.</p>
                <p>We must not here omit a geographer and geometer who lived about the time of
                    Alexander the Great. This was Dicearchus of Messina, a disciple of Theophrastus,
                    who wrote a description of Greece in iambic verses, of which some fragments yet
                    remain. But what chiefly renders him remarkable is, that he measured
                    geometrically several mountains, to which an excessive height had been before
                    assigned.</p>
                <p>With Dicearchus we may notice another geometer, Xenagoras, a disciple of
                    Aristotle, mentioned by Plutarch in his life of Paulus Aemilius, who occupied
                    himself in the measurement of mountains. He found the height of Mount Olympus to
                    be fifteen stadia.</p>
                <p>In some of the latter periods which preceded the Christian era there were several
                    writers on geography, as Artemidorus of Ephesus, who wrote a geographical work
                    of eleven books, of which nothing remains; Scymnus of Chio, author of a
                    description of the earth in iambic verses, which remain in a very mutilated
                    state; Isidorus of Charax, who gave a description of the Parthian empire; and
                    Scylax of Caryades, author of a voyage round the Mediterranean,, which is still
                    extant.</p>
                <p>The works of all these geographers are, however, but small in comparison with the
                    Geography of Strabo; a work in seventeen books, which has come down to us
                    entire. This is one of the most valuable works of antiquity, both from the
                    spirit of discussion which runs through it, and the number of curious
                    particulars which the author has collected from different geographers and
                    navigators who preceded him, and of whose works nothing remains except these
                    extracts. Strabo lived in the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius, and was nearly
                    contemporary with Pomponius Mela. This latter geographer wrote a work <hi
                    rend="italic">De Situ</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193519115"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-9115-0396"/><hi rend="italic">Orbis,</hi> which, though little
                    more than a bare summary, is valuable as it gives 'us a sketch of what was known
                    in his time respecting the state of the habitable globe. Besides Mela, Rome
                    produced in the most flourishing era of its literature another eminent
                    geographer, Pliny. He devoted two books of his extensive work on natural history
                    to a system of geography. His intimate connection with the imperial family, and
                    with many of the most eminent commanders of the time, appears to have given him
                    access to all the military measurements, as well as to the general survey of the
                    Roman empire. Thus furnished with a greater store of authentic materials than
                    any former writer, he has introduced a great number of itinerary details, which
                    are for the most part accurate and valuable. Julius Solenus has also treated of
                    geography in his <hi rend="italic">Polyhistor,</hi> a compilation sufficiently
                    valuable from the number of curious particulars which are there collected.
                    Marinus of Tyre was another geographer who appears to have been distinguished,
                    though his works have perished. Even under the Roman empire Tyre continued to be
                    the seat of an extensive commerce; indeed the commercial relations of her
                    citizens appear to have extended over a wider portion of the earth’s surface
                    than ever. The enlarged materials furnished by the lengthened journeys of his
                    countrymen, which brought them even to the confines of China, Marinus collected,
                    and sought to apply to them the astronomical principles of Hipparchus, so that
                    he .might give to geography a new and more accurate form. Ptolemy, whom Marinus
                    preceded by a short time, employs a great part of his first book in discussing
                    the means employed by the Tyrian geographer for fixing the relative position of
                    places; and from the references and extracts it appears that the system of
                    Marinus partook largely∣of the imperfections of a first effort.</p>
                <p>The enlarged and scientific views of Ptolemy we have already considered. Some
                    time after Ptolemy lived Dionysius, commonly called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Periegetic,</hi> from the title of a work in verse composed by him, namely, his
                    <hi rend="italic">Periegesis,</hi> or Survey of the World. This work was
                    translated into Latin verse by Priscianus, and afterwards by Avienus. There is,
                    besides, a description by Avienus, of the maritime coasts, in iambic verses, of
                    which there remain about seven hundred.</p>
                <p>The difficulty of procuring the small and scattered pieces of most of these
                    authors, with those of a few others not here enumerated, induced the learned
                    Hudson to collect them into one work, consisting of four volumes octavo, which
                    were published in the years 1698,1702,1712, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geographia veteris Scriptores</hi><hi rend="italic">Groeci</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">minores.</hi> The originals are accompanied with Latin
                    translations, and notes and dissertations on each by Dodwell. This is a very
                    valuable collection.</p>
                <p>We now proceed to consider the progress of geography during the middle ages. From
                    the days of Ptolemy to the revival of letters in .Europe, little was done for
                    its solid improvement. The calamities that ere long overwhelmed the Roman
                    empire,, involved in the general progress of the intellectual darkness which
                    settled on the world even the imperfect knowledge possessed by the ancient
                    geographers. While barbarous nations poured in from several quarters, art and
                    science ceased to be cultivated. The union by which the Roman power had bound
                    together mankind being now dissolved, Europe was divided into small and
                    independent, and for the most part hostile communities, which had but vague
                    conceptions respecting the situation of each other, while no intercourse
                    subsisted between their members. With regard to remote regions all knowledge was
                    lost; their situations, their commodities, and almost their names, were
                    unknown.</p>
                <p>Amidst this ignorance there were but few channels open through which knowledge
                    could be obtained. One circumstance, however, prevented commercial intercourse
                    with foreign nations from being altogether suspended. The opulence and luxury of
                    imperial Rome had long given life and energy to commercial enterprise: that
                    stimulus was now withdrawn; but Constantinople still remained, the last refuge
                    of ancient arts, and taste, and elegance, when the rest of Europe was overspread
                    with barbarism. Fortunately that city had escaped the destructive rage of the
                    fierce invaders; and there, under the cherishing influence of a demand for
                    foreign productions and luxuries, commerce continued to flourish. Alexandria
                    continued to be the emporium whence they imported the commodities of the East
                    Indies, until Egypt, falling under the power of the Arabians, ceased to be a
                    province of the Roman empire. After this event the industry of the Greeks
                    succeeded in discovering a new channel by which Constantinople might still be
                    supplied with the productions of India. These were first conveyed up the Indus
                    as far as that river is navigable, thence by land-carriage they were brought to
                    the Oxus, and were carried down that river to the Caspian Sea. Entering there
                    the Volga, they were conveyed up it, and thence were again transported by land
                    until they reached the Tanais, down which they were conveyed to the Euxine Sea,
                    where vessels from Constantinople awaited their arrival. By this circuitous
                    route was a channel of intercourse kept open with the most distant countries of
                    the East; and an extensive knowledge of remote regions was still preserved in
                    the capital of the Greek empire, while the rest of Europe was sunk in the
                    grossest ignorance.</p>
                <p>The missions sent for the conversion of the northern pagans to Christianity
                    served somewhat to illustrate the geography of Europe; though there is
                    sufficient proof that the monks employed were, in many instances, themselves
                    grossly ignorant, some not even knowing the capital of their own country, or the
                    cities nearest to their own. Something was also done by the great sovereigns of
                    Europe towards dispelling the prevailing ignorance of the age on matters
                    connected with geography. Nor did the piratical exploits of the Danes and
                    Norwegians under their great sea-kings fail to make them acquainted with the
                    seas and maritime coasts where they carried on their devastations. But it was in
                    the East that a gleam of light and knowledge began to appear, which seemed to be
                    the harbinger of the noon-day splendour of science, that should dispel the
                    darkness of ignorance which had so long oppressed the human mind. Under the
                    influence of a fanaticism which prompted them to own no law but the koran and
                    the sword, the followers of Mahomet had rushed from the heart of Arabia, and had
                    carried their conquests over half the world. At length, however, under a race of
                    humane and polished princes, having contracted a relish for the sciences of the
                    people whose empire they had contributed to overturn, they stood for some time
                    distinguished as the most learned of nations. They translated into their own
                    language the books of several of the Greek philosophers. The valuable work of
                    Ptolemy was one of the first; and hence the study of geography became an early
                    object of their attention. But the advancement which the science made in their
                    hands towards precision was slow; for they copied and retailed all Ptolemy’s
                    principal errors. Still, in all the countries that were under Mahommedan
                    dominion numerous observations were made, which, though not always strictly
                    correct, were entitled to be considered as a step beyond the calculations made
                    merely from the itineraries by the Alexandrian geographers. In the beginning of
                    the ninth century, under their caliph Alrnamon, who may rank among the most
                    distinguished patrons of science that ever filled a throne, they measured a
                    degree of latitude on the plains of Sinjar, or Shinar, near Babylon, with a view
                    to determine the circumference<pb break="no" facs="nls:193519128"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-9128-0397"/> of the earth. The .tables of Abulſeda and Ulug
                    Beg, and of Nazir Eddin, edited by Graevius, and republished by Hudson, furnish
                    materials that are still of use in the construction of the maps of the interior
                    of Asia.</p>
                <p>The progress and success of the Moslem arms removed the obscurity in which many
                    countries had until then been concealed, as well as the barbarism in which they
                    had been sunk. And even beyond the limits of the Mahommedan world they pushed
                    their researches, by sending missions both to the east and to the west, which
                    they explored to their remotest limits. At that time Europe remained ignorant of
                    the improvements made by the Arabians, though she was destined in subsequent
                    ages to perfect their discoveries.</p>
                <p>At length the long period of barbarism which accompanied and followed the fall of
                    the Roman empire, during which the traces of whatever had embellished society,
                    or contributed to the comfort and convenience of life, were almost entirely
                    effaced, drew to a close. Industry began again to shed its blessings on mankind,
                    and Italy was the country where its benign influences were first perceptible.
                    Having from the operation of various causes again obtained liberty and
                    independence, the Italians soon began to feel the impulse of those passions
                    which serve most powerfully to arouse men to activity and enterprise. The
                    reviving demand for the comforts and luxuries of life led to the revival of
                    foreign commerce. The valuable commodities of the East were at first obtained at
                    Constantinople. But the exorbitant price demanded at that mart, in consequence
                    of the circuitous route by which they were conveyed thither, induced the
                    Italians to resort to other ports, as Aleppo and Tripoli, on the Syrian coast,
                    and at length to Egypt itself. After the Soldans had revived the commerce with
                    India in its ancient channel by the Arabian Gulf, Venice, Genoa, Pisa, rose from
                    inconsiderable towns to wealthy and populous cities. Their trade extended to all
                    the ports in the Mediterranean, and even beyond the straits to the towns on the
                    coasts of Spain, France, the Low Countries, and England; and from these points
                    they diffused through Europe a taste for the luxuries and enjoyments of
                    civilized life, which they at the same time furnished the means of
                    gratifying.</p>
                <p>It was not long ere an event occurred, the most extraordinary perhaps in the
                    history of human society, which gave a new impulse to the European mind, and
                    forcibly directed its view eastward to the regions of Asia. Under the influence
                    of a high-wrought enthusiasm, the martial spirit of the Europeans was aroused,
                    and vast armies, composed of all the nations of Christendom, marched towards
                    Asia on the wild enterprise of delivering the Holy Land from the dominion of
                    Infidels. The crusades, however blind the zeal from which they took their rise,
                    had a very favourable influence on the intellectual state of Europe, and
                    prepared it for receiving the light of science which was soon to dawn upon it.
                    Interesting regions, known hitherto only by the scanty reports of ignorant and
                    credulous pilgrims, were now made the object of attention and research. Not only
                    was the way opened for the European nations acquiring a correct knowledge of the
                    Holy Land, with the kingdoms of Jerusalem and Edessa, founded by the victorious
                    crusaders; but the extensive regions over which the Saracens and the Turks had
                    extended their empire began to be explored. Search was now made in the writings
                    of the ancient geographers; nor is it improbable that some light was derived
                    even from the Arabian writers. Religious zeal, the hope of gain, combined with
                    motives of mere curiosity, induced several persons to travel by land into remote
                    regions of the East, far beyond the countries to which the operations of the
                    crusaders extended. Prompted by superstitious ve neration for· the law of Moses,
                    and by a desire of visiting his countrymen in the East, whom he hoped to find
                    possessed of wealth and power, Benjamin, a Jew of Tudela, in the kingdom of
                    Navarre, set out from Spain in the year 1160, and travelling by land to
                    Constantinople, proceeded through the countries to the north of the Euxine and
                    Caspian Seas. He then journeyed towards the south, and traversed various
                    provinces of the further India, until, having reached the Indian Ocean, he
                    embarked and visited several of its islands; and at length, after thirteen
                    years, returned by the way of Egypt to Europe. In his progress he had acquired
                    much information respecting a large portion of the globe, then altogether
                    unknown to Europeans.</p>
                <p>Various missions were sent by the pope and by Christian princes, for purposes
                    which led them to traverse the remote provinces of Asia. Father John de Plano
                    Carpini, at the head of a mission of Franciscan monks, and Father Ascolino, at
                    the head of another mission of Dominicans, were in the year 1246 sent by
                    Innocent IV. to enjoin Kayuk Khan, the grandson of Zengis, who was then at the
                    head of the Tartar empire, to embrace Christianity, and to cease from desolating
                    the world by his arms. In fulfilling the commands laid upon them by the head of
                    the Christian church, the mendicants had an opportunity of visiting a great part
                    of Asia. Carpini, having taken his route through Poland and Russia, travelled
                    through the northern provinces as far as the extremities of Thibet; whilst
                    Asco-îino, who appears to have landed somewhere in Syria, advanced through the
                    southern provinces into the interioι parts of Persia.</p>
                <p>Father William de Rubruquis, a Franciscan monk, having been sent in the year 1263
                    on a mission by St Louis of France, in search of an imaginary personage, a
                    powerful khan of the Tartars, who was reported to have embraced the Christian
                    faith, made a circuit through the interioι parts of Asia more extensive than
                    that of any European who had hitherto explored them. He had the merit ol being
                    the first modern traveller that gave a true accoun∣ of the Caspian, which had
                    been correctly described by the early Greeks as an inland separate sea; but a
                    notion afterwards prevailed that it was connected with the Northern Ocean.
                    Rubruquis ascertained that it had no connection with the ocean or any other sea.
                    The account of his journey was so little read, however, that the old error was
                    repeated in books of geography long after his time.</p>
                <p>While the republics of Italy, and, above all, the state of Venice, were engaged
                    in distributing the jewels, the spices, and the fine cloths of India over the
                    western world, it was impossible that motives of curiosity, as well as a desire
                    of commercial advantage, should not be awakened to such s degree as to impel
                    some to brave all the obstacles and dangers to be encountered in visiting those
                    remote countries where these precious and profitable commodities wert produced.
                    A considerable number accordingly are recorded as having penetrated a greater or
                    less depth into tht interior of Asia. But of all the old travellers the fame iι
                    eclipsed by that of Marco Polo, who has always rankec among the greatest
                    discoverers of any age. This extraordinary man was a noble Venetian, whose
                    family, according to the custom of his country, engaged in extensive commerce
                    Nicoo Polo, and Mafl*eo Polo, the father and uncle of Marco, were merchants,
                    who, in partnership, traded chiefly wit! the East; and in pursuit of their
                    mercantile speculationi had already visited Tartary. The recital of their
                    travel· on their return fired the youthful imagination of Marco then between
                    seventeen and eighteen years old. Having when in the East, gained the confidence
                    of Kublai Khan the great conqueror of China, at whose court they had resided for
                    a long time, he had sent them back to Italy, accompanied by an officer of his
                    court, that they might repaiι to Rome as his ambassadors to the pope, of whom,
                    and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193519141" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9141-0398"/>• the
                    potentates of the western world, they had given him ar ample account. After many
                    delays they were now, about the year 1265, to set out on their return to the
                    court of Kublai, bearing the papal letters and benediction; and it was resolved
                    that young Marco should accompany them. After a journey that occupied no less
                    than three and a half years, and in the progress of which they passed through
                    the chief cities in the more cultivated parts of Asia, they reached Yen-king,
                    near the spot where Pekin now stands, where they were honourably and graciously
                    received by the grand khan. Struck with the appearance of young Marco, the khan
                    condescended to take him under his protection, and caused him immediately to be
                    enrolled among his attendants of honour. By prudence and fidelity Marco gained
                    so high a place in the esteem and confidence of his protector, that for
                    seventeen years, during which he remained in his service, he was employed in
                    confidential missions to every part of the empire and its dependencies. He made
                    more than one voyage on the Indian Ocean, and traded with many of the islands.
                    Besides what he learned from his own observation, he collected from others many
                    things concerning countries which he did not visit. Considering the very
                    favourable circumstances in which he was placed for geographical research, as
                    well as his passion for travelling, which seems to have increased with his
                    opportunities of gratifying it, it is not surprising that, after the long period
                    of his wanderings in Asia, he should have returned to Europe possessed of the
                    knowledge of many particulars, until his time unknown, respecting the eastern
                    parts of the world. Marco, being afterwards made a prisoner by the Genoese, was
                    induced, with a view to beguile the tediousness of his confinement, to dictate a
                    narrative of his travels. His information was so far in advance of the age, that
                    his veracity was exposed to the most injurious suspicions. But, if we make
                    allowance for some tincture of credulity, characteristic of the times in which
                    he lived, his narrative is supported in all its essential points by modern
                    information.</p>
                <p>While great accessions were thus made to the ∙ stock of knowledge possessed by
                    the nations of Europe respecting the habitable globe, their ideas were at the
                    same time gradually enlarged; and an adventurous spirit was generated, which
                    prepared them for attempting further discoveries. Still their efforts were
                    limited by certain bounds, in consequence of the imperfect state of navigation.
                    Whatever conceptions a daring mind might venture to form respecting the
                    existence of unknown regions, separated from the known continents by the mighty
                    expanse of the Atlantic Ocean, mankind had not yet so obtained the dominion of
                    the sea as to be able to bring such conceptions to the test of experiment. It
                    was not until the fortunate discovery of the polarity of the magnetic needle,
                    and the consequent construction of the mariner’s compass, that man was enabled
                    to visit every part of the globe which he inhabits. This important discovery was
                    made by Flavio Gioia, a citizen of Amalfi, a town of considerable trade in the
                    kingdom of Naples, about the year 1302. Encouraged by the possession of this
                    sure guide, by which at all times and in all places he could with certainty
                    steer his course, the navigator gradually abandoned the timid and slów method of
                    sailing along the shore, and boldly committed his bark to the open sea. At the
                    commencement of the fifteenth century, however, navigation appears to have
                    advanced very little beyond the state which it had reached before the downfall
                    of the Roman empire. But it was now destined to make rapid progress. The growing
                    spirit of enterprise, combined with the increasing light of science, had
                    prepared the states of Europe for entering upon that great career of discovery,
                    of which the details constitute the materials for the history of modern
                    geography.</p>
                <p>Portugal took the lead in this new and brilliant path. Her first attempt was
                    t&lt;⅛ discover the unknown countries situated along die western coast of
                    Africa. Notwithstanding the vicinity of that great continent, and the strong
                    inducement afforded, in the fertility of the countries already known in it, to
                    its further exploration, Cape Non had hitherto limited the researches of the
                    Portuguese, and had been regarded as an impassable barrier. In the year 1412,
                    however, ships sent out for discovery doubled this formidable promontory, and
                    reached Cape Bojador, a hundred and sixty miles to the southward, which became
                    in its turn the boundary of Portuguese navigation; and it continued to be so for
                    upwards of twenty years. Under the coasting system, which still continued to be
                    practised, it was not likely that the obstacles presented by its rocky cliffs,
                    which stretch a considerable way into the Atlantic, would soon have been
                    overcome. But a sudden squall of wind having driven out to sea the vessel next
                    dispatched, this event fortunately led to the discovery of Porto Santo; whence
                    in a little time Madeira was discovered, being first mistaken for a small black
                    cloud in the horizon; and at length, when the Portuguese by their voyages
                    thither had gradually become accustomed to a bolder navigation, Cape Bojador was
                    doubled. Thus, by repeated efforts, the Portuguese navigators gradually
                    approached the northern boundary of the torrid zone. Here their progress was for
                    some time arrested, not by any physica! difficulties, but in consequence of the
                    influence which the opinion of the ancient mathematicians and geographers, whom
                    they had hitherto followed as their guides, that excessive heat rendered the
                    middle regions of the earth uninhabitable, had upon their minds. Experience,
                    however, at length enabled them to triumph over ignorance and prejudice. A
                    powerful fleet, fitted out in 1484, after discovering the kingdoms of Benin and
                    Congo, advanced above fifteen hundred miles beyond the equator. Their
                    intercourse with the natives enabled them to obtain information concerning those
                    parts of the country which they had not visited. Not only had they detected the
                    error of the ancients in reference to the torrid zone, but they found also that
                    the direction of the coast was very different from what the description given by
                    Ptolemy had led them to expect. They saw reason to conclude that the continent
                    gradually became narrower as they proceeded southward; so that there was room to
                    believe that the ancient accounts respecting the circumnavigation of Africa were
                    really founded in truth. New and more extensive prospects were thus opened to
                    them; and the finding of a passage to India by sailing round the southern
                    extremity of Africa became a favourite project. In the year 1488 the lofty
                    promontory which terminates that continent was descried by Bartholomew Diaz; but
                    it was not until about ten years after that it was doubled, and the coast of
                    Malabar reached, by Vasco de Gama.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the Cape de Verd Islands, which are said to have been known to the
                    ancients, but afterwards lost sight of, had been discovered in 1446; and soon
                    after the Azores Isles. When we consider the distances at which these two groups
                    of islands lie from the land, the former being upwards of 300 miles from the
                    coast of Africa, and the latter distant 900 miles from any continent, it may be
                    concluded that the Portuguese, when they entered so boldly into the open seas,
                    had made no inconsiderable progress in the art of navigation.</p>
                <p>But brilliant as is the lustre which these discoveries shed around the Portuguese
                    name, their glory would have been still more dazzling had they seconded the
                    profound views of Columbus, which led him to the discovery of the New World.
                    That illustrious man and skilful navigator, by revolving in his mind the
                    principles on which the Portuguese had founded their schemes of discovery, and
                    carried them into execution, was led to conceive that he could improve on their
                    plan, and accomplish discoveries which they had <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193519154" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9154-0399"/>hitherto attempted in vain.
                    From the time that they hat doubled Cape Verd, the great object at which the
                    Portuguese aimed was to find a passage by sea to the East Indies. The direction
                    in which their efforts were made implied necessarily a long and hazardous
                    voyage, should the, even be successful in accomplishing their design. But as the
                    Atlantic Ocean stretched westward to an unknown distance, was it not possible
                    that it might reach the shores ol those very countries to which it was thought
                    so desirable to find a naval route? This supposition was perfectly consistent
                    with the known globular figure of the earth; and it was evident, on the same
                    principle, that the further India stretched to the east, the nearer it must
                    approach to the western shores of Europe and Africa. Such was the idea suggested
                    to the mind of Columbus, by the knowledge which he possessed of navigation and
                    geography, both in theory and practice. While he found his views Confirmed by a
                    careful comparison of the observations of modern pilots with the hints and
                    conjectures of ancient authors, he became thoroughly convinced that the
                    navigator who should have the boldness to cross the Atlantic Ocean, would have
                    his toils rewarded by the most important discoveries.</p>
                <p>These ideas had presented themselves to the mind of Columbus as early as the year
                    1474; but it was not until the year 1492, after several years of fruitless
                    solicitation, and of discouragements and disappointments of the most vexatious
                    kind, that he obtained the patronage of Ferdinand and Isabella, who then
                    governed the united kingdoms of Castile and Arragon, and was by them put in
                    possession of the means of carrying his schemes of discovery into execution.
                    With no more suitable an armament for his great enterprise than three small
                    vessels, having ninety men, mostly sailors, on board, and victualled for twelve
                    months, he sailed from the port of Palos in Andalusia on the third day of
                    August, and steered for the Canaries. Taking then his departure from Gomera, one
                    of the most westerly of these islands, he stretched into unknown seas; and
                    holding his course due west, reached Guanahani, one of the Bahama Islands, on
                    the 12th day of October. After employing some time in making further
                    discoveries, he returned to Spain to announce the success of his undertaking,
                    the fame of which soon spread over Europe, and excited general attention. It was
                    no easy matter to determine what relation the newly-discovered countries bore to
                    the regions formerly known. Columbus’s own views on the subject were in strict
                    conformity with the idea which had taken so firm a hold of his mind, -namely,
                    that India might be reached by sailing towards the west. He imagined that the
                    islands he had visited were some of those which were said to lie contiguous to
                    the remote shores of Asia. In this opinion he was confirmed by the coincidence
                    which he thought he could trace between certain names given to places by the
                    natives, and the appellations known to belong to countries situated in India. He
                    thought he could recognise, in the answer given to his inquiries after the
                    situation of the mines which yielded gold, the name <hi rend="italic">Ci∙
                    pango,</hi> by which Marco Polo and other travellers in the East designated the
                    island Japan. Ignorant of their language, and unaccustomed to their
                    pronunciation, he even supposed that they spoke of the great khan; and hence
                    concluded that the kingdom of Cathay or China, described by Marco Polo, was not
                    far off. The same erroneous opinion was still further riveted in his mind, by
                    what he supposed an identity between the animal and vegetable productions of the
                    East Indies and those of the countries which he had discovered.</p>
                <p>His second voyage led to the discovery of several more of the group of islands
                    now called the West Indies, a name given them in conformity with the original
                    notions of the discoverer. It was on his third voyage thst he discovered the
                    vast continent of America. Having unexpectedly found the island of Trinidad,
                    with the neighbouring land, he encountered, before he was aware of danger, the
                    adverse currents and tumultuous waves occasioned by the resistance which the
                    waters of the Orinoco oppose to the tides in the ocean. His attention was thus
                    forcibly called to the immense body of water which is here jχjured into the
                    Atlantic. This he was convinced was vastly too great to be supplied by any
                    island; and hence he concluded that he had now reached the continent which he
                    had sought through so many dangers.</p>
                <p>The tenacity with which an ingenious and enterprising mind adheres to a scheme
                    which it has once proposed to itself as an object of pursuit, was strikingly
                    evinced by Columbus, whose thoughts still dwelt with eagerness on his original
                    and favourite plan of opening a new passage to India. It was not enough that he
                    had astonished mankind by finding a new continent; he conceived the idea that
                    beyond it there might lie a sea extending to the coasts of Asia, and that by
                    diligent search some strait might be found which would conduct him into this
                    sea, or some narrow neck of land, by crossing which it might be reached. To
                    determine this important point, though hitherto his services had met with the
                    most unworthy returns, though years crept upon him, though worn out by fatigue
                    and broken with infirmities, he still undertook with alacrity another voyage. By
                    a lucky conjecture he directed his efforts towards the east of the Gulf of
                    Darien; but he searched in -vain for a strait; and though he frequently went on
                    shore and advanced into the country, he never penetrated so far as to enable him
                    to descry the great Southern Ocean.</p>
                <p>After the first steps had been taken, the progress of discovery over the globe
                    was astonishingly rapid. No expense or danger deterred even private adventurers
                    from fitting out fleets, crossing oceans, and encountering the rage of savage
                    nations in the most distant parts of the earth. Before Columbus had reached the
                    continent at the mouth of the Orinoco, Newfoundland had been discovered by
                    Cabot, a Venetian by descent, but sailing under the auspices of England. He had
                    also coasted along the present territory of the United States, perhaps as far as
                    Virginia. In the next two or three years, the Cortereals, a daring family of
                    Portuguese navigators, began the long and unavailing search of a passage round
                    the northern extremity of America. They sailed along the coast of Labrador, and
                    entered the spacious inlet of Hudson’s Bay. Two of them unfortunately perished
                    in this enterprise. In the year 1501 Alvarez Cabral, a Portuguese navigator,
                    destined for India, having stood out to sea in order to avoid the variable
                    breezes and frequent calms which he was sure to meet with on the African coast,
                    to his surprise, came upon the shores of an unknown country, the coast of
                    Brazil, which he claimed for Portugal. Amerigo Vespucci, a Florentine gentleman,
                    who had already sailed along a great part of Terra Firma and Guyana, now made
                    two extensive voyages along the Brazilian coast. Soon after his return he drew
                    up and transmitted to one of his countrymen an account of his adventures and
                    discoveries, in which he insinuated that to him belonged the honour of having
                    first discovered the continent in the New World. His performance, which was the
                    first description published of the newly-discovered countries, circulated
                    rapidly, was read with admiration, and became the means of procuring for its
                    author the high honour of giving his name to the whole continent. Not many years
                    elapsed before the conjecture of Columbus respecting the existence of an ocean
                    beyond the continent which he had discovered was found to be true; and his
                    favourite project of opening a passage to India by steering westward was
                    actually accomplished. By crossing the narrow isthmus of Panama, Núñez Balboa
                    reached the Pacific Ocean in the year 1513; and in 1521 Magellan discovered and
                    sailed through the famous straits which bear <pb break="no" facs="nls:193519167"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-9167-0400"/>his name. After twenty days occupied in navigating
                    this dangerous channel, he beheld spread out before him the boundless expanse of
                    the great Southern Ocean. Directing his course to the north-west, he continued
                    his voyage for nearly four months without discovering land. From want of
                    provisions, and from sickness, he and his crew suffered dreadful distress. But
                    when about to sink under their sufferings, they fell in with the Ladrone
                    Islands, where they found refreshments in abundance. From these isles he
                    proceeded on his voyage, and was not long of discovering the Philippines. Here,
                    in an unfortunate quarrel with the natives, he was slain, with several of his
                    principal officers. But his surviving companions, pursuing their voyage, and
                    returning to Europe by the Cape of Good Hope, solved the great problem of the
                    circumnavigation of the earth.</p>
                <p>After the dis∞very of the Pacific Ocean by Balboa, the investigation of the
                    western coasts of America went speedily forward. Expeditions were soon sent out
                    both northward and southward; so that nearly a full view was obtained of the
                    immense range of coast which the American continent presents to the Pacific
                    Ocean, and at the same time of its great interior breadth.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, discovery in the eastern world was no less rapid. Within
                    twenty years from the time that Gama reached India by the way of the Cape of
                    Good Hope, all the coasts of Hindustan, those of Eastern Africa, of Arabia, and
                    Persia, had been explored. Navigators had penetrated to Malacca and the Spice
                    Islands. They had learned the existence of Siam and Pegu; and it was only the
                    characteristic jealousy of the rulers of the Celestial Empire that prevented
                    -them from entering the ports of China.</p>
                <p>The scientific geographer had now abundance of materials to arrange and digest
                    into one systematic whole. He was now called upon to give such a delineation of
                    the earth’s surface, as should connect together the ranges of eastern and
                    western discovery, and should exhibit the true outline and relative positions of
                    countries, as these had been demonstrated by the astronomer and navigator. The
                    ancient system of geography, to which the Arabs seem closely to have adhered,
                    was founded on the idea of the whole earth being surrounded by an ocean as by a
                    great zone. This the Arabians characterized as the “Sea of Darkness,” an
                    appellation most usually given to the Atlantic; while the northern sea of Europe
                    and Asia, as inspiring still more gloomy and mysterious ideas, was styled the
                    “Sea of Pitchy Darkness.” Such notions could not now keep possession of the
                    human mind, though it was only by degrees that mankind could be expected to be
                    enlightened by doctrines which were not only new, but seemed likewise to be
                    contradicted by. the evidence of sense. The fundamental principles of a
                    systematic arrangement had, as we have already seen, been known from the time of
                    Hipparchus, and had been reduced to practice by Ptolemy. But the want of
                    astronomical observations, or even of accurate surveys, which navigators seldom
                    furnished, and for which science had not indeed yet provided suitable
                    instruments, placed it still beyond the resources of modern geography to give
                    any thing like a just representation of the two hemispheres. The Venetian
                    geographers were the first who attempted a systematic arrangement of the immense
                    regions recently discovered, adjusting them to each other, and to the mass of
                    information previously possessed. But a series of Venetian maps, preserved in
                    the king’s library, show how much their skill was counteracted by the
                    difficulties with which they had to contend. Instead of exhibiting the vast
                    ocean which separates the east coast of Asia from the west coast of America, the
                    two continents are represented either as meeting, or as separated .only by a
                    narrow strait. The voyage of Magellan across the Southern Ocean had not shown
                    with sufficient distinctness the presentation of the opposite coasts, to enable
                    the geographers of the time to avoid this error. When maps of different dates
                    are compared, we find, as we descend towards modern times, a gradual progress
                    towards accuracy in the representations given of the earth’s surface. This is
                    what might be expected; for all maps should be considered as unfinished works,
                    in which there will always be something to be corrected, or something new to be
                    inserted.</p>
                <p>At the period of the revival of letters in Europe, the latitudes and longitudes,
                    as given by Ptolemy, were universally received with implicit confidence. When
                    checked, however, by actual observation, they were found to differ materially
                    from the truth. The latitudes in many instances were found very erroneous; that
                    of Byzantium, for example, exceeded the truth by two degrees. As nearly the same
                    excess was found to exist in some other cases, many geographers, unwilling to
                    renounce the authority of Ptolemy, concluded that this difference had arisen
                    from a change having taken place in the position of the earth’s axis, in
                    consequence of which the latitudes of all the places in Europe were increased.
                    The progress of observation showed that this opinion was untenable, and that
                    before geography could rest on a sure basis, a general revision of ancient
                    graduation was indispensably necessary. The only observations employed by the
                    ancients for determining longitudes were those of the eclipses of the moon; but
                    it was found that the results derived from this source could not be depended on.
                    In the year 1610, Galileo, having discovered three of Jupiter’s satellites,
                    pointed out the use which might be made of their eclipses for finding
                    longitudes. But this method, which gives the greatest degree of accuracy, was
                    turned to little account, ιmtil 1668, when Cassini published his tables of Lite
                    revolutions and eclipses of these satellites. Three years afterwards, by means
                    of simultaneous observations made by him and Picard at Paris, and in the
                    observatories of Tycho Brahe at Copenhagen, the difference of longitude of these
                    two important points, which had been long a matter of dispute, was finally
                    determined. Since that time, other accurate methods of finding the longitude
                    have been discovered; and the instruments employed in observation have been
                    brought to a high degree of perfection. The refinements and improvements of
                    modern science have been brought to bear upon the great problem of determining
                    the figure of the earth, which, though nearly, is not exactly spherical. (See
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Figure of the Earth.)</hi> The labours of scientific men to
                    obtain accurate results on this subject have contributed much to the improvement
                    of geography. The expeditions sent out ιmder Maupertuis to the arctic circle,
                    and under Condamine to the equator, afforded an opportunity of making various
                    observations of latitude and longitude in regions of which no delineation
                    resting upon proper data had hitherto been given. Within the last thirty years,
                    trigonometrical surveys of France and England have been executed, which have
                    nearly completed the delineation of these countries.</p>
                <p>Much advantage has accrued to geographical science, in point of accuracy and
                    precision, from the application in modern times of a sound and judicious
                    criticism to the immense mass of materials which had been accumulating for ages.
                    The labours of Μ. d’Anville, in the eighteenth century, were employed with great
                    success in this department. He undertook the revision of the whole system on
                    which the delineation of the world, and of the countries into which it is
                    divided, had hitherto been made; and by unhesitatingly rejecting every
                    particular that did not rest on positive authority, he removed many false or
                    uncertain features, and clearly distinguished the known from the unknown parts
                    of the globe. Major Rennell has skilfully arranged and illustrated the important
                    materials collected respecting India. Various authors have in modem<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193519180" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9180-0401"/> times cultivated
                    another interesting field of inquiry, the comparison between ancient and modem
                    geography, and the tracing of the rise and progress of early discovery, These
                    researches were diligently pursued by Vossius, Bocbart, and other learned men of
                    the seventeenth century, and with still more success by Rennell, Vincent, and
                    Mannert, who appear to have pushed them as far as they admit, though much
                    darkness still rests on some parts of the inquiry. Gosselin, notwithstanding
                    that he has applied to the subject a great extent of investigation, as well as
                    much skill and force of criticism, has failed, on account of the peculiar views
                    in which he indulged, to make any solid addition to the science.</p>
                <p>The discoveries made by the Spaniards and Portuguese had greatly increased the
                    stock of geographical information. Still much remained to be done. The desire of
                    finding a short and convenient route to India still continued to supply a
                    stimulus to exertion in the way of discovery. The English and Dutch made
                    extraordinary efforts, and encountered fearful dangers and disasters, with the
                    expectation of effecting a passage by the north-east, along the northern shores
                    of Asia. A coast beset with the ices of the Polar Seas presented, however,
                    obstacles too formidable to be overcome; though recent researches appear to show
                    that no barrier of land intervenes. But there was still another quarter where an
                    attempt might be made; and to this point the commercial nations of Europe failed
                    not to direct their efforts. The jealousy of Spain long prevented the other
                    European states from visiting the north-western coast of America, so that they
                    remained ignorant of the vast breadth to which the continent spreads out as it
                    advances towards the north. They adopted, indeed, the opinion that, like the
                    southern extremity, the northern terminated in a point or cape. This left room
                    to hope for a north-western passage into the Pacific Ocean, by sailing round the
                    imaginary cape. The English took the most decided lead in the exploratory
                    voyages to which these views gave rise. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth,
                    Frobisher and Davis were sent out on three successive voyages, which led to the
                    discovery of the entrance into Hudson’s Bay by the former navigator, and of the
                    entrance into Baffin’s Bay by the latter. These two capacious basins were
                    afterwards discovered by the intrepid navigators whose names they bear. In
                    sailing round the great sea which he had discovered, Baffin mistook the great
                    opening into Lancaster Sound for a mere gulf; a misapprehension which checked
                    for a time any further attempts in that quarter, as navigators were led to
                    expect success only through the channel of Hudson’s Bay. In 1631, Fox explored a
                    part of that great opening on the north of Hudson’s Bay, called Sir Thomas Roe’s
                    Welcome, which seemed now to hold out almost the only hope of accomplishing the
                    object sought. The assertion of Middleton, an officer in the service of the
                    Hudson’s Bay Company, that he had discovered the head of the Welcome to be
                    completely closed, and the circumstance of two other navigators, who were sent
                    out the following year, failing to effect any thing, produced an impression on
                    the public mind that the passage so long sought had no existence.</p>
                <p>The discoveries of Cook in the North Pacific Ocean, where he found the American
                    coast stretching away in a north-westerly direction, joined to the circumstance
                    that, when he penetrated through the strait discovered early in the last century
                    by Behring and Tchirikof, which separates America from Asia, the coast appeared
                    there to extend indefinitely to the north, seemed not only to confirm the
                    conclusion that no passage into the North Pacific Ocean was here to be expected;
                    but also that the American continent extended northward in one unbroken mass,
                    perhaps even to the pole. The groundlessness of these views became apparent
                    when, in the year 1771, Mr Hearne, who had been dispatched by the Hudson’s Bay
                    .Company to explore the limits of the coast in this direction, sailed down the
                    Copper-Mine River, and discovered its entrance into the sea; and again, when, in
                    1780, Sir Alexander Mackenzie traced also to the sea another river about twenty
                    degrees farther to the west. Thus were there furnished strong grounds to believe
                    that the pole was surrounded by an ocean which separated the northern coasts of
                    Asia and America, making these two continents altogether distinct from each
                    other; and that through this ocean lay the long-sought course which would
                    certainly conduct the navigator who should succeed in forcing his way through
                    the ice and storms of the polar regions, from the Atlantic into the North
                    Pacific Ocean.</p>
                <p>The determination of this great geographical question, so long agitated, has
                    recently called forth the utmost efforts of the British government. In 1818 an
                    expedition was sent out to Baffin’s Bay under the command of Captain Ross,
                    without leading to any important result, as he was led to conclude that no
                    opening existed. Lancaster Sound had, however, forcibly attracted the attention
                    of Lieutenant Parry, second in command; and on returning with a new expedition
                    under his immediate command, he succeeded in penetrating through Lancaster
                    Sound, which he found gradually to widen till it opened into the Polar Sea. He
                    found a chain of large islands to lie parallel to the American coast; and among
                    these he continued his navigation until the accumulation of ice in the straits
                    and channels through which he had to pass stopped his further progress. This
                    circumstance induced him to make his next attempt through Hudson’s Bay, by the
                    channel of the'Welcome, which had as yet been but imperfectly explored. Here he
                    succeeded in reaching a point considerably beyond that at which Middleton had
                    represented the bay as terminating. He found at length a narrow strait
                    communicating with the Polar Sea, but so encumbered with ice as to preclude the
                    hope of its ever affording an open passage. He was therefore again sent out to
                    renew his efforts in the first direction, where he had already obtained partial
                    success. But the obstacles which he had formerly been unable to overcome still
                    continued, and prevented him from making any material addition to his former
                    discoveries. Whilst these skilfully-conducted voyages were in progress, Captain
                    Franklin was sent out at the head of two successive expeditions by land, and, by
                    actual survey, ascertained three fourths of the boundary coast; his operations
                    terminating at a point beyond the 149th degree of west longitude. On the other
                    hand, an expedition under Captain Beechy, sent to meet Captain Franklin on his
                    second toilsome journey, passed the Icy Cape of C∞k, and penetrated nearly as
                    far as the 156th degree of west longitude, leaving only seven degrees, or 160
                    miles, between the farthest point thus reached and the utmost limit reached by
                    Captain Franklin. The results of this investigation appeared to prove that the
                    whole of the northern coast of America extends in a line not varying much from
                    the parallel of the seventieth degree of latitude. But Captain Ross, in the late
                    expedition, fitted out by himself, has found a large peninsula stretching as far
                    north as seventy-four degrees of latitude. The existence of a naval passage
                    farther to the north, in the line of Captain Parry’s first voyage, is, however,
                    still probable.</p>
                <p>The discovery of a new continent greatly enlarged, as we have seen, the views of
                    mankind respecting the constitution of the globe. But imagination, no longer
                    limited in its range by the notion of a circumambient ocean that could not be
                    passed, soon gave rise to the belief of a southern continent, which was supposed
                    necessary to balance the land in the northern regions of the earth. The immense
                    body of water that was found to occupy so large a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193519193" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9193-0402"/>portion of the known regions
                    of the southern hemisphere gave ample room for supposing this unknown continent
                    to be of vast dimensions. It was imagined that it might equal in extent as well
                    as in wealth the American continent. Nor was it considered necessary to exclude
                    it from the map of the world till its existence should be proved. It appears in
                    all the early maps as an immense mass of land surrounding the south pole, and
                    presenting to the ocean one unbroken coast. The discovery of certain great
                    insular tracts in the South Seas, which, from ignorance of their true nature,
                    navigators might mistake for continental promontories or portions of coast, no
                    doubt at first gave some countenance to the belief of the existence of antarctic
                    land. But the delusion was gradually dispelled before the light ąífbrded by
                    further discovery. The Portuguese, in less than twenty years after their passage
                    of the Cape of (rood Hope, pushed their researches to the most remote islands in
                    the Indian Ocean, including Java and the Moluccas. They appear also to have
                    observed some part of the coast of New Guinea. The Spaniards during their early
                    and adventurous career put forth strenuous exertions to explore the Southern
                    Ocean, and several of the groups of islands scattered over its surface were
                    discovered by their navigators. In 1607, the Dutch having wrested from the
                    Portuguese Java and the Spice Islands, established in them the centre of their
                    Indian dominion. A great maritime power being thus placed so near to the
                    northern shores of the largest portion of land on the globe that is regarded as
                    an island, it became almost impossible that New Holland could long remain
                    unknown. It was discovered early in the seventeenth century, and was long
                    supposed to form a part of the great southern continent. Van Diemen, the -Dutch
                    governor of India, sent out several vessels successively to explore its coasts.
                    Hertog, Carpenter, Nuytz, and Ulaming, made very extensive observations on the
                    northern and western shores, but found them so dreary and uninviting that no
                    settlement was attempted. In the year 1644 the eastern coasts were visited by
                    Tasman, who, proceeding beyond his predecessors, reached the southern extremity
                    of Van Diemen’s Land, to which he gave its name; but he failed to discover that
                    it is a separate island. Pursuing his course eastward, he surveyed next the
                    western coast of New Zealand, and returned home by the Friendly Islands. He thus
                    proved that New Holland was no part of the southern continent, even should such
                    a continent exist. Cook, by ranging along the borders of the southern pole,
                    where he found only isles and firm fields of ice, showed that the hypothesis of
                    an austral continent had no foundation. The eastern side of New Holland was
                    discovered by Captain Cook in the year 1770, who by his extensive operations in
                    that quarter left little to be done towards completing the full circuit of it.
                    The same great navigator likewise secured glory to his country and to himself by
                    completing the survey of the Great Pacific Ocean. Some of the interesting groups
                    of islands scattered over its vast surface had already been made known by the
                    previous voyages of Byron, Wallis, and Carteret. Cook fully traced the great
                    chain of the Society Islands and the Friendly Islands. He determined also the
                    form and relations of New Zealand, New Caledonia, and other great lands and
                    islands in that region of the globe.</p>
                <p>The extensive island of New Holland has recently become doubly interesting from
                    the important relations which now subsist between it and Europe. In the year
                    1788 the establishment of a British colony on the east coast paved the way for a
                    more complete survey. By the different ex-peditιons undertaken from 1795 to
                    1799, chiefly under the direction of Bass and Flinders, the east coast, together
                    with Van Diemen s Land and Bass’s Strait, which separatee that ⅛. <hi

                    was sent out by the British government under the command of Captain Flinders,
                    for the purpose of surveying a large portion of the coast. These surveys were
                    prosecuted with unremitting ardour and perseverance. At the same time that
                    Captain Flinders was carrying on his survey, the French captain Baudin was
                    employed on the same service, and in some parts the discoveries of these
                    navigators intermingle. Some additional observations have more recently been
                    made; and by these various expeditions the whole coast of New Holland and Van
                    Diemen’s Land has been accurately surveyed, the position of every point has been
                    ascertained, and every inlet and bay has been traced to its termination.</p>
                <p>In tracing the history of geographical discovery, it cannot fail to be observed,
                    that while discovery by sea has been pursued with great advantage, on account of
                    the rapidity of its progress and the extent of its range, the slower and more
                    confined operations of the discoverer by land are no less necessary to make
                    known the interior features and circumstances of the different countries.</p>
                <p>The British dominion in India has led to much additional information respecting
                    the interior of Asia; information which is, however, in many respects, only the
                    revival of ancient knowledge. The great mountainous chain which forms the
                    northern boundary of India has been traced and found in many places to tower to
                    such heights as to exceed the Andes, long supposed to be the highest mountains
                    in the world. The source of the Ganges, and that of the Indus, with the early
                    courses of these great rivers, have been found to be situated quite differently
                    from what had been supposed to be their position by modern geographers. The
                    mountainous territories of Cabul and Cashmere, the high interior table-land of
                    Thibet, and the vast sandy plains of Meckran, have all been more or less
                    explored. Information of an authentic character has also been recently obtained
                    respecting the formerly celebrated capitals, Buchara and Samarkand. But a wide
                    field still remains for future research.</p>
                <p>The continent of Africa, however, is the quarter of the globe which, more than
                    any other, has baffled the efforts of those who would explore its interior. The
                    vast sandy deserts, high mountains, and impenetrable forests which occur on its
                    surface, joined with the unremitting wars carried on between the petty tribes,
                    and the deeply-rooted antipathy of the African Mahommedans towards the Franks,
                    have presented obstacles of the most formidable kind. The ancients, whose
                    knowledge of the African coasts was very imperfect, except where they border on
                    the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, were accustomed to penetrate into the inland
                    provinces, and are said to have been acquainted with many parts of it which are
                    now altogether unknown. At an early period of modern history reports that
                    Prester John, the Christian prince, who had been sought for in vain in the East,
                    was to be found in the interior of Africa, induced the Portuguese to explore
                    Abyssinia; but the accounts which they gave of the extent of that country were
                    greatly exaggerated. From the western coast they dispatched embassies into the
                    interior in quest of the object of their search; and on one occasion they appear
                    to have reached the city of Tombuctoo, and to have obtained at Benin some
                    information concerning the great interior kingdom of Ghana. Tombuctoo has been
                    for many centuries the grand emporium of the central trade uf Africa; and on
                    this account an eager desire has been felt in Europe, ever since the rise of
                    discovery and commercial enterprise, to visit it and establish an intercourse
                    with it. All attempts, however, to reach it made by European merchants and
                    travellers have until recently been entirely baflled. Its actual condition, and
                    even magnitude, are still involved in very considerable uncertainty. Major Laing
                    resided there a considerable time, and made die most diligent inquiries; but the
                    fatal catastrophe which terminated his career prevented the result from ever
                    reaching Europe.</p>

                <p>But the grand object connected with the interior of Africa, by which the
                    attention of Europeans has been from the first chiefly excited, is its great
                    central river, the Niger. The interest with which this stream has been regarded
                    has arisen from the remarkable nature of the regions through which it flows, and
                    still more from our ignorance, combined with the various and contradictory
                    rumours which were so long abroad respecting its course and termination.
                    Herodotus is the earliest author who affords any ideas applicable to this
                    subject. He mentions an expedition into the interior of Africa, undertaken by
                    some Nasamonian youths, who, being taken prisoners, were carried to a great city
                    inhabited by negroes, and situated on the banks of a river which flowed from
                    west to east. This stream he conjectures to be the remote source of the Nile;
                    but the particulars given appear to leave little doubt that it was the Niger. A
                    similar hypothesis was adopted by Strabo, Mela, and Pliny, identifying the
                    waters of these two great rivers. But Ptolemy, whose residence in Alexandria
                    afforded him ample means of information, rejects altogether the idea of any
                    communication between them. He describes the Niger as terminated on the west by
                    Mount Mandrus (Mandingo), and as giving rise to several extensive lakes as it
                    proceeds in its course. His statements do not, however, involve any thing
                    positive as to the direction in which it flows. The Saracens or Arabians are the
                    next great source of information; for in the course of the dissensions which
                    took place among their dynastics in Northern Africa, large bodies crossed the
                    desert, and founded kingdoms on the eastern part of the shore of the Niger, of
                    which the kingdom of Ghana was the most splendid. According to their testimony,
                    the Niger flows from east to west, and discharges itself into the sea, by which
                    they understood the Atlantic, or great circumambient ocean. With regard to its
                    source, they generally regarded it as the same with that of the Egyptian Nile,
                    identifying the two rivers in the early part of their course. Some were of
                    opinion that the waters of the Niger did not reach the sea; so that they must
                    have supposed them to be discharged into a lake. The system adopted by modern
                    Europeans was derived from Leo Africanus, who retained the delineation of the
                    Niger as flowing from east to west, and falling into the ocean, but instead of
                    deriving it from the Nile, supposed it to rise from the lake of Bornou, lying
                    deep in the interior of Africa. Following this hypothesis, all the early
                    European navigators, when they saw the two broad estuaries of the Senegal and
                    Gambia, concluded that one or both gave egress to the waters of the Niger. In
                    the beginning of the seventeenth century, the French and English having each
                    formed a settlement, the one on the Senegal and the other on the Gambia, were
                    induced by the hope of gain to seek a route up these rivers to the city of
                    Tombuctoo; and in this enterprise they proved the falsity of the opinion which
                    had been so long held. The streams were traced so near to their source as to
                    become little more than rivulets; whilst the explorers were still far from the
                    great central emporium of Africa, and from the great plain through, which the
                    Niger was understood to flow. This result led the two great French geographers
                    Delisle and D’Anville to construct maps in which the Niger, after the lapse of
                    so many ages, was again represented as flowing to the eastward. Instead of a
                    single stream pursuing a course across the whole breadth of Africa, and falling
                    into the Atlantic, D’Anville distinguished three rivers; the Senegal flowing
                    westward, the Niger flowing eastward into a lake in Wangara, and another river
                    still farther east, and flowing in the opposite direction. The data on which
                    this scheme rests were never fully made public.</p>
                <p>Still new doubt was thrown around this subject by the reports collected by Mr
                    Lucas, who travelled under the auspices of the African Association, and who was
                    assured at Tripoli, by a native merchant, that the river flowed with rapidity in
                    a westerly direction. The time, however, at last arrived when these conflicting
                    opinions were to be silenced, and new light thrown on the subject, by the
                    labours of our illustrious modem traveller Mr Park. In his first expedition, on
                    reaching Sego, he beheld “the long-sought majestic Niger, glittering in the
                    morning sun, as broad as the Thames at Windsor, and flowing slowly to the
                    eastward,” and directing its course into the depths of interior Africa. Here,
                    then, was a new point from which theory and conjecture might start in
                    endeavouring to ascertain the terminatiòn of the Niger. By the persevering
                    exertions of the British government, an expedition has, however, at length
                    actually made its way into the unknown interior of Africa, and has finally led
                    to the solution of the grand problem which had so long puzzled geographers, as
                    well as exercised their ingenuity. Without entering further into details, it
                    will be sufficient to observe, that instead of only one river being found
                    flowing through the great African plain in one direction, there were several
                    rivers discovered flowing in different directions; all of which, it appears,
                    have been considered at different times, and under different circumstances, the
                    Niger. Hence had arisen the various statements which for ages involved the
                    subject in such deep mystery. The great central stream of Africa has now-been
                    very completely traced, whilst much light has been obtained respecting the
                    regions through which it flows. It was reserved for Lander finally to trace the
                    course of the Niger to the Gulf of Benin, where its waters are discharged
                    through a succession of estuaries, extending along the coast a space of about
                    300 miles. Thus, by means of this river and its numerous tributaries, the
                    prospect is now opened to British commerce of being able to penetrate into the
                    most inland and finest regions of the African continent.</p>
                <p>In all parts of the habitable globe the spirit of research, which has already
                    done so much, is still active; nor is it directed only to the determining of the
                    outlines of continents and countries, or to the marking of the leading features
                    of mountains, rivers, and cities, with their relative positions-and distances.
                    These are regarded by the geographical inquirer merely as affording a proper
                    basis on which to rest the description of the earth considered as the habitation
                    of man, and as affording him amply the means of improvement and happiness. The
                    picture can be completed only by the continued labours of the scientific
                    observer, who makes the earth, with its various productions, whether natural or
                    artificial, the treasures hid in its bosom, the animals found upon its surface,
                    and, above all, the human beings who people its different regions (and these in
                    all their mutual bearings and relations), the objects of attentive examination
                    and study.</p>
                <p>II—MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY.</p>
                <p>CHAP. 1.—PRINCIPLES AND DEFINITIONS: OF THE TERRESTRIAL SPHERE.</p>
                <p>We have already stated that mathematical geography treats of the figure,
                    magnitude, and motion of the earth; its relations to the other bodies of the
                    system to which it belongs; the relative positions of places on its surface ∙
                    and the methods of delineating the whole or any part of its surface. Several of
                    these topics belong as much to astronomy as to geography; for the former science
                    regards the earth, on the one hand, as the grand observatory whence the
                    phenomena of the heavens are contemplated<pb break="no" facs="nls:193519219"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-9219-0404"/> by man; and, on the other hand, as itself
                    constituting a portion of the planetary system, the laws of which it is the
                    object of the astronomer to investigate and explain. It is only, indeed, by
                    celestial observation that the position of a point on the surface of the earth
                    can be accurately determined; so that the first principles of geographical
                    science must necessarily be drawn from astronomy.</p>
                <p>We take for granted, then, the doctrine of the celestial sphere; the globular
                    form, the magnitude, and motion of the earth, with the phenomena arising out of
                    and depending upon its motion. These points are fully discussed in the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Astronomy,</hi> part ii. It will be necessary, however, for
                    the sake of distinctness, to state briefly such of the results derived from the
                    reasoning there employed as belong specially to the subject of this article.</p>
                <p>The doctrine of the earth’s rotundity is that with which the student of geography
                    must first make his mind familiar. To the eye the earth appears a circular
                    plane, at the centre of which the spectator imagines himself placed; whilst the
                    heavens, spread over his head likea magnificent canopy, seem to meet the earth
                    all round in a circle which bounds the view. The space comprehended within this
                    circle is found to present often a very irregular surface, rising into
                    mountains, or sinking into cavities, so as apparently to exclude the idea of its
                    bearing any resemblance to a portion of a globe or sphere. This is, however,
                    nearly its true figure. Were we placed at such a distance from the earth that
                    the eye would be able to take in at one glance the vast mass in its full
                    dimensions, it would present the appearance of a circular disk, of greater or
                    less diameter according to our distance. If viewed on all sides, its circular
                    form would remain unchanged; a property characteristic of no other body but a
                    globe or sphere. The highest mountains would be found to bear so little
                    proportion to the whole bulk, as to cause no perceptible deviation from the
                    globular form; and the same thing may be said of the difference which exists
                    between the polar and equatorial diameters, though that quantity amounts to
                    about twenty-eight miles.</p>
                <p>The portion of the earth, then, seen from any point above its surface, is to be
                    regarded as the segment of a sphere, which increases in extent according as the
                    eye is more elevated. Knowing the semidiameter of the earth, and the height of
                    the eye above the surface, it is easy to find the diameter of the circle which
                    bounds our view on the earth; supposing, as is the case at sea, that no object
                    should intervene to obstruct our vision. Thus, let AB (Plate CCLIX. fig. 1) be
                    the height of a mountain on the earth’s surface. From A draw the line AD, a
                    tangent to the surface in any direction; D will be the most distant point seen
                    by a spectator whose eye is placed at A, the summit of the mountain. If the line
                    AD be supposed to be carried round the point A, while it at the same time
                    continues to be a tangent to the surface, until, having passed through every
                    possible position, it returns to that from which it set out, the point D will
                    trace the circumference of the circle which bounds the terrestrial view, and of
                    which the radius will not differ much from AD. Now AD being a tangent to the
                    arch BD, we have AD <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = (2BC + AB) × AB = 2BC × AB
                    nearly, since AB must always be very small compared with 2BC, the diameter of
                    the earth. Assuming the diameter equal to 7912 English miles, we have AD <hi
                    rend="superscript">!</hi> = 7912 X AB; or, if AB is expressed in feet, 7912</p>
                <p>AD* = 5280 <hi rend="superscript"> ×</hi> ^B∙ ∏ <hi rend="superscript"> ence</hi>
                    &gt; extracting the square root of the numerical part, we obtain</p>
                <p>AD = 1-224126 √AB.</p>
                <p>The result obtained from this formula will deviate from the truth in consequence
                    of the effect of refraction. The error arising from this cause is found to vary
                    from į to <hi rend="italic">it</hi> of the whole distance. At a medium,
                    refraction may be considered as increasing the distance by about <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="subscript">
                    τ</hi>, or ∙0714 of the whole. Applying this correction to the above formula, it
                    becomes</p>
                <p>AD= 1∙3115√AB.</p>
                <p>For example, if the Peak of Teneriffe is 12,358 English feet in height, then AD =
                    1∙3115 √12358 = 145-8 miles is the radius of the circle which bounds the view
                    from that elevation.</p>
                <p>The circle bounding terrestrial vision, which we have now been considering, does
                    not, except when the eye is close to the surface of the earth, coincide with the
                    sensible horizon as determined by a plane passing through the eye along the line
                    HO, and perpendicular to the vertical line CZ. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Astronomy,</hi> p. 754.) The angle contained between the visual ray AD and the
                    horizontal plane, is called the <hi rend="italic">dip</hi> of the horizon. For
                    ordinary purposes, however, it is sufficiently accurate to say that the <hi
                    rend="italic">sensible horizon</hi> is the circle which bounds the view, where
                    the heavens and the earth appear to meet. To this circle the <hi rend="italic"
                    >rational horizon</hi> is parade), being determined by a plane passing through
                    the centre of the earth perpendicular to the vertical fine CZ, and continued in
                    every direction to the sphere of the heavens. Let NESQ (Plate CCLIX. fig. 2) be
                    the terrestrial sphere, of which C is the centre; HO is the rational horizon of
                    the point Μ.</p>
                <p>The rotatory motion of the earth determines the position of the line NS (Plate
                    CCLIX. fig. 2), on which it revolves, and which is called its <hi rend="italic"
                    >axis.</hi> The two points N, S, in which the axis meets the surface, are called
                    the <hi rend="italic">poles of the earth.</hi> The circle EQ upon the earth, the
                    plane of which passes through C the centre, and is perpendicular to NS the axis,
                    is called the <hi rend="italic">equator</hi> or <hi rend="italic">equinoctial
                    line.</hi> This circle is equidistant from the poles of rotation, and its plane
                    coincides with the plane of the celestial equator. The rational horizon and
                    equator being two great circles of the terrestrial sphere, that is, the plane of
                    each passing through the centre, they are mutually bisected. This is a property
                    which belongs to all great circles. Any great circle NPS passing through the two
                    poles is called a <hi rend="italic">meridian.</hi> Any given point P may have a
                    meridian passing through it; and the plane of that circle will coincide with the
                    plane of the celestial meridian which passes through the zenith of that point.
                    Every meridian cuts the equator at right angles.</p>
                <p>The horizon HO corresponding to any point M upon the globe, is divided into four
                    equal parts by the equator and the meridian passing through that point. The
                    points of division are called the four <hi rend="italic">cardinal points.</hi>
                    Those through which the meridian passes are called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >north</hi> and <hi rend="italic">south</hi> points of the horizon. Those
                    points, again, through which the equator passes are called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >east</hi> and <hi rend="italic">west</hi> pointe.</p>
                <p>The earth is divided by the horizon into two hemispheres, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">upper,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lower</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >under hemispheres</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> by the equator it is divided
                    into the <hi rend="italic">northern</hi> and <hi rend="italic">southern
                    hemispheres</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and by the meridian, into the <hi
                    rend="italic">eastern</hi> and <hi rend="italic">western hemispheres.</hi></p>
                <p>The position of any point P on the surface of the earth is determined by
                    referring it to the co-ordinate circles, the equator and meridian. The distance
                    PA of the place P from the equator, measured in degrees and parts of a degree on
                    the meridian passing through the place, is called its <hi rend="italic"
                    >latitude,</hi> which is said to be north or south, according as the place is
                    situated in the northern or southern hemisphere. The arch EA of the equator,
                    intercepted between the meridian passing through the place P and some particular
                    meridian NMS, called the <hi rend="italic">first meridian,</hi> as being that
                    fixed on from which the reckoning is to commence, is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">longitude</hi> of the place in question; and is east or west,
                    according as the place is situated in the eastern or western hemisphere in
                    reference to the first meridian. The difference of longitude between two places
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193519232" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9232-0405"/>is the arch,
                    of the equator intercepted between their meri∙ dians; and is found by
                    subtracting or adding the longitudes, according as the places are on the same or
                    on opposite sides of the first meridian. The ancients assumed for their first
                    meridian that of the Fortunate Islands, which they conceived to be the western
                    limit of the habitable world. In latter times, the meridian passing through
                    Ferro, one of the Canary Islands, and nearly coinciding with that of the
                    ancients, was used as the first meridian by the geographers of many countries.
                    But in modern systems of geography the first meridian is that which passes
                    through the capital of that country, or through an observatory, if there is one
                    in or near the capital, from which the position of other meridians is
                    determined. By British geographers the meridian of the observatory at Greenwich
                    is reckoned the first meridian. It is usual to call the semicircle NPS, passing
                    through the two poles and a given place, the meridian of that place; and the
                    other semicircle NRS passing through the opposite point on the globe, the
                    opposite meridian. All places lying under the same meridian have the same
                    longitude, and at all of them noon or any other hour occurs at the same instant
                    of absolute time. With regard to places that he towards the east and west of the
                    meridians of each other, this is not the case. The sun in his apparent diurnal
                    revolution moves over fifteen degrees in an hour; so that at a place in fifteen
                    degrees east longitude, noon occurs an hour earlier than at places under the
                    first meridian, and at a place in fifteen degrees west longitude, an hour later;
                    and each fifteen degrees by which the longitude east or west is increased, makes
                    an additional hour of difference in the time at which noon occurs. Hence
                    longitude, and difference of longitude, may be estimated in time, allowing
                    fifteen degrees to an hour, or one degree to four minutes.</p>
                <p>If a small circle MPK, or <hi rend="italic">mpk,</hi> be drawn parallel to the
                    equator at any distance from it, all the places through which that small circle
                    passes will have the same latitude. Such small circles are accordingly called
                    <hi rend="italic">parallels of latitude.</hi> The difference of latitude between
                    two places is the arch of the meridian intercepted between their parallels of
                    latitude, and is found by subtracting or adding the latitudes, according as the
                    places lie on the same or on opposite sides of the equator.</p>
                <p>On the hypothesis of the earth being a perfect sphere, the degree of latitude
                    must be assumed as everywhere of the same length. Actual observation shows that
                    this is not exactly the case, but that the length of the degree increases
                    slightly as we proceed from the equator towards either pole (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Figure of the Earth), so</hi> as to indicate a flattening of
                    the surface in the latter regions, or that the earth is of a spheroidal figure.
                    This, however, we do not at present take into view. With regard to the degree of
                    longitude, it is at the equator of the same length with the degree of latitude.
                    But on both sides of the equator it decreases gradually on account of the
                    meridians approaching each other until they intersect at the poles. At the
                    equator a degree of longitude is the 360th part of the circumference of a great
                    circle of the terrestrial sphere; at every point to the north or south of the
                    equator it is the 360th part of the circumference of a small circle, of which
                    the radius is equal to the cosine of the latitude. Now, since similar portions
                    of the circumferences of circles are to one another as their radii, if we put L
                    for the length of the degree of longitude at the equator, and Ľ for its length
                    in a latitude denoted by <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> we have rad.: cos. <hi
                    rend="italic">I</hi>:: L: Ľ. Hence, radius being unity, we obtain Ľ = L × cos.
                    <hi rend="italic">I. '</hi></p>
                <p>From this formula the following table is calculated; the length of the degree of
                    longitude at the equator being assumed equal to 69-06 English miles.</p>

                <p>If a great circle B&lt;Z be supposed to be drawn on the terrestrial sphere,
                    cutting the equator obliquely at an angle of about twenty-three and a half
                    degrees, this circle will mark out the course of the sun through the year, and
                    is called the <hi rend="italic">ecliptic.</hi> It corresponds with the celestial
                    ecliptic, and is divided in the same manner into signs and degrees. The parallel
                    of latitude which passes through the point of the ecliptic in which the sun is
                    placed on any particular day, shows to what points of the earth’s surface the
                    sun is vertical on that day. The two parallels BLD, <hi rend="italic">bld,</hi>
                    which touch the ecliptic at the points where it recedes farthest from the
                    equator to the north and south, are called the <hi rend="italic">tropics</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> the one, BLD, the northern tropic, or the tropic of cancer;
                    and the other, <hi rend="italic">bld,</hi> the southern tropic, or the tropic of
                    capricon; because they touch the ecliptic in the first points of these signs.
                    These circles lie in the planes of the corresponding circles in the celestial
                    sphere.</p>
                <p>Of the two poles, that which lies in thenorthern hemisphere is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">north</hi> or <hi rend="italic">arctic pole</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and the opposite, lying in the southern hemisphere, is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">south</hi> or <hi rend="italic">antarctic pole.</hi> The two
                    parallels of latitude FG, <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> ∕p, which encircle these
                    poles respectively at an angular distance equal to the obliquity of the
                    ecliptic, are called the <hi rend="italic">polar circles,</hi> the one the north
                    or arctic, and the other the south or antarctic.</p>
                <p>Suppose a great circle to be drawn on the terrestrial sphere everywhere equally
                    distant from that point on the surface to which the sun is vertical at any given
                    time; this circle is called the <hi rend="italic">circle of illumination,</hi>
                    because it separates the enlightened from the dark hemisphere of the earth. It
                    is upon the position of the circle of illumination that the equal or unequal
                    lengths of the days and nights throughout the year depend over the face of the
                    earth. At every season of the year this circle bisects the equator, so that
                    under the equator the days and nights are always equal. When the sun is over
                    either of the equinoctial points E, Q (Plate CCLIX. fig. G), the circle of
                    illumination bisects not only the equator, but likewise all the parallels to the
                    equator, in consequence of cutting them at right angles; and hence, as the
                    parallel of latitude passing through any point on the earth’s surface may be
                    regarded as the path along which that point is carried by the diurnal motion of
                    the earth, at that season of the year the days and nights are equal over all the
                    earth. When the sun is over any other point of the ecliptic, the parallels of
                    latitude are cut obliquely by the circle of illumination, so that they are
                    divided by it into two unequal parts (Plate CCLIX. fig. 7, 8); and hence the
                    days and nights are unequal all over the earth, except at the equator. If the
                    sun is in north declination (fig. 7) at all places to the north of the equator,
                    the days are longer than the nights; but at all places to the south of the
                    equator the nights are longer than the days; because with regard to places to
                    the north, the larger portion of the parallel of latitude lies within the
                    enlightened hemisphere, while with regard to places to the south the larger
                    portion lies within the dark hemisphere. The reverse has place when the sun is
                    in south declination (fig. 8). When the sun is over the northern tropic BD (fig.
                    7), or over the southern tropic <hi rend="italic">bd</hi> (fig. 8), the day is
                    then the longest or shortest of the year; and the adjacent polar circle is
                    wholly in the light, and the opposite one wholly in darkness. Thus, within the
                    arctic and antarctic circles the inhabitants have their light and darkness
                    extended to a great length; the sun sometimes skirting round a little <hi
                    rend="subscript"> abθ</hi> ve the horizon for many days together, and at another
                    season never rising above the horizon at all, but making continual night for a
                    considerable length of time.</p>
                <p>Such are the circles supposed to be drawn on the terrestrial sphere. Though these
                    circles are altogether imaginary, and have really nothing corresponding to them
                    on the earth’s surface, yet as the positions of the corresponding circles in the
                    heavens can be accurately determined by observation on the celestial bodies,
                    they become actually as effective for fixing the relative positions of places on
                    the globe of the earth, and for other purposes of geography, as if that globe
                    were reduced to such a magnitude as to admit of its being grasped by the hand of
                    man, and surveyed by a single glance of his eye.</p>
                <p>The height NO of the pole (Plate CCLIX. fig’. 2) adjacent to any place M above HO
                    the horizon of that place, is equal to the latitude of the place; for the arches
                    MO and EN are equal, each being a quadrant; and taking away from each the common
                    arch MN, the remaining arch NO, the elevation of the pole N, is equal to the
                    remaining arch ME, the latitude of the place Μ.</p>
                <p>Hence there are, with regard to the horizon, three positions of the terrestrial
                    sphere, as there are of the celestial, depending on the latitude of the place.
                    If an observer were placed on the pole, the latitude being 90°, his horizon
                    would coincide with the equator, and all the parallels of latitude would be
                    parallel to the horizon. This is the parallel position of the sphere, which is
                    represented in Plate CCLIX. fig. 3. Again, if an observer were placed on any
                    point of the equator, the latitude being 0, the poles of the earth must be in
                    the horizon; and from the properties of the sphere, the equator, and all the
                    small circles parallel to the equator, must be at right angles to the horizon.
                    This is the right position of the sphere which is represented in fig. 4. With
                    regard to an observer placed at any point between the equator and either pole,
                    the axis of the earth lies obliquely to the plain of his horizon, which is
                    therefore cut obliquely by the equator and all the small circles parallel to the
                    equator: this is the oblique position of the sphere, and is that represented in
                    fig. 2.</p>
                <p>The method of determining the latitude of a place, and the difference of
                    longitude between two points on the earth’s surface, is given in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Astronomy,</hi> part iv. chap. i. prob. ix. and x. The
                    latitudes and longitudes of two points on the surface of the earth being given,
                    the angular distance may be found; and hence the length of a degree on the
                    earth’s surface being known, the distance between the points may be expressed in
                    miles. Thus, let A and B be two points on the earth’s surface (Plate CCLIX. fig.
                    5); let P be the adjacent pole, and PA, PB the meridians passing through A and
                    Ð: then PA and PB will be the complements of the latitudes, and therefore given;
                    and the spherical angle APB will be the difference of the longitudes, and
                    therefore also given. In the spherical triangle PAB, the base AB of which is the
                    distance required, we have therefore two sides and the included angle, so that
                    the base AB can be found. Put D and D ’ for the complements of the given
                    latitudes, and P for the difference of the given longitudes; then, by spherical
                    trigonometry, we have</p>
                <p>Cos. AB ≡ cos. D cos. D ’ + sin. D sin. D’ cos. P.</p>
                <p>By assuming tan. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> = tan. D cos. P, this formula may be
                    reduced to the more convenient form</p>
                <p>Cos.AB= <hi rend="superscript"> COłDc0ł</hi> AE~F <hi rend="superscript">
                    )</hi>.</p>
                <p>cos. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi></p>
                <p>From the above expression the number of degrees and parts of a degree contained
                    in the arch intercepted between the points A and Ð are to be found; and allowing
                    for each degree 69∙06 English miles, the distance will be obtained, expressed in
                    English miles, which will necessarily differ a little from the truth, in
                    consequence of the earth not being truly spherical. To determine the distance
                    between two points on the earth’s surface with precision, requires the
                    application of some of the most refined improvements in modern mathematics. See

                <p>Each of the four quadrants into which the horizon is divided by the equator and
                    the meridian is supposed to be divided into eight equal parts; so that the whole
                    circumference is divided into thirty-two equal parts, which are called <hi
                    rend="italic">points of the compass</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and to each
                    point of division a name is given indicating its position with regard to the
                    four cardinal points.</p>
                <p>The position of one place with regard to another, as estimated by the points of
                    the compass, is called the <hi rend="italic">bearing</hi> of the former from the
                    latter. Thus, when a place is said to bear N.E. (north-east), N.N.E.
                    (north-north-east), &amp;c. the meaning is, that it lies in the direction of
                    those points in the horizon from the present position of the observer. If a
                    series of points be assumed on the earth’s surface, so situated that all of
                    them, when taken in regular succession, he towards any the same point of the
                    compass, except either of the four cardinal points, the assumed points lie, not
                    in the circumference of a circle of the sphere, but in a sort of spiral line,
                    the characteristic property of which is, that it cuts all the meridians at the
                    same angle. This line is called a <hi rend="italic">rhumb line</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and, whilst it continually approaches the pole, it can
                    never arrive at it, except after an infinite number of revolutions. In passing,
                    therefore, from one point of the surface of the globe to another, by pursuing
                    the direction in which the latter lies from the former, we do not take the
                    shortest way, which is an arch of a great circle, but move over a portion of a
                    rhumb line, passing through the two points. This is the line described by a
                    ship, whilst her course is continually directed towards one and the same point
                    of the compass.</p>
                <p>CHAP. II.—OF THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH, AND ITS GENERAL DIVISIONS:
                    DEFINITIONS.</p>
                <p>The surface of the earth contains about 196,663,400 square miles. By much the
                    larger portion of this space is water, which is, indeed, more than twice the
                    extent of the land. The surface of the land is exceedingly diversified, almost
                    everywhere rising into hills and mountains, or sinking into valleys, and
                    sometimes stretching out into plains of great extent. Amongst the most extensive
                    plains are the sandy deserts of Arabia and Africa, the internal part of European
                    Russia, and a tract of considerable extent in Prussian Poland But the most
                    remarkable extent of level ground is the vast table-plain of Thibet in Asia,
                    which is the most elevated tract of level ground on the globe. The principal
                    mountain ridges are the Alps and Pyrenees in Europe, the Altai and Himalaya
                    Mountains in Asia, the mountains of Atlas in Africa, and the Andes or
                    Cordilleras in South America. The greatest concavities of the globe are those
                    which are occupied by the waters of the ocean; and of these by far the largest
                    forms the bed of the Pacific Ocean, which, stretching from the eastern shores of
                    Asia and of New Holland to the western coast of America, covers nearly half the
                    globe. The concavity next in extent is that which forms the bed of the Atlantic
                    Ocean, extending between the new and the old worlds; and a third concavity is
                    occupied by the Indian Ocean. The Arctic and Antarctic Oceans fill up the
                    remaining concavities.</p>
                <p>Smaller collections of water which communicate freely with the oceans are called
                    <hi rend="italic">seas</hi> (Plate CCLIX. fig. 9, 1); and of these, the
                    principal are the Mediterranean, the Baltic, the Euxine or Black Sea, and the
                    White Sea. Seas sometimes take their names from the countries near which they
                    flow; as the Irish Sea, the German Ocean. Some large collections of water,
                    though they have no immediate connection with the great body of waters, being on
                    all sides surrounded by land, are yet called seas; as the Caspian Sea.</p>
                <p>A part of the sea running up into the land, so as to form a large hollow, is
                    called a <hi rend="italic">bay</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gulf</hi> (fig. 9, 2),
                    as the Bay of Biscay, the Gulf of Mexico but if the hollow be small, it is
                    called a <hi rend="italic">creek,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">road,</hi> a <hi
                    rend="italic">haven.</hi></p>
                <p>When two large bodies of water communicate by a narrow pass between two adjacent
                    lands, the pass is called a <hi rend="italic">strait</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >straits</hi> (fig. 9, 3), as the Straits of Gibraltar, the Straits of Dover,
                    the Straits of Babelmandel. A channel is a wider kind of strait. The water
                    usually flows through a strait with considerable force and velocity, forming
                    what is called a <hi rend="italic">current t</hi> and frequently this current,
                    as in the case of the Straits of Gibraltar, flows continually in the same
                    direction.</p>
                <p>A body of fresh water entirely surrounded by land is called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >lake</hi> (fig. 9, 4), as the Lake of Geneva, Lake Champlain.</p>
                <p>A considerable stream of water rising inland, and draining a portion of country
                    more or less extensive, discharging its waters into the sea, is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">river.</hi> A smaller stream of the same kind is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">rivulet,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">brook</hi> (fig. 9, 5).</p>
                <p>The great extent of land which forms the rest of the surface of the globe is
                    divided into innumerable portions; two of vast extent, but the rest of
                    comparatively small dimensions. The portions of the land which are of great
                    extent are called <hi rend="italic">continents,</hi> the one the eastern
                    continent, or the old world, comprehending Europe, Asia, and Africa; the other
                    the western continent, or new world, comprehending North and South America. New
                    Holland is a third portion of land, however, which has by some been also
                    reckoned a continent on account of its great extent.</p>
                <p>A portion of land entirely surrounded by water is called an <hi rend="italic"
                    >island</hi> (fig. 9, a), as Britain, Ireland, Jamaica, Madagascar. According to
                    the strict meaning of this defini ∙ tion, the largest portions of land on the
                    surface of the globe may be said to be islands·; for there is every probability
                    that each of the continents is everywhere bounded by the sea. But this is an
                    extent of signification in which the term <hi rend="italic">island</hi> is not
                    employed; and New Holland is the largest portion of land which is called an
                    island. When a number of smaller islands lie near each other they are said to
                    form a <hi rend="italic">group</hi> of islands (fig. 9, 5).</p>
                <p>A portion of land which is almost entirely surrounded by water is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">peninsula</hi> (fig. 9, c), as the peninsula of Malacca, the Morea
                    or Grecian Peloponnesus, &amp;c. The term peninsula is often applied to a large
                    extent of country. Thus we speak of Spain as a peninsula. Indeed Africa itself
                    may be considered as a vast peninsula, being connected with Asia only by the
                    narrow isthmus of Suez.</p>
                <p>The narrow neck of land which joins a peninsula to the main land, or which
                    connects two tracts of country together, is called an <hi rend="italic"
                    >isthmus</hi> (fig. 9, <hi rend="italic">d).</hi> The mpst remarkable isthmuses
                    in the world are, the Isthmus of Suez, which joins Africa and Asia, and the
                    Isthmus of Darien, which connects the continents of North and South America.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193519271" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9271-0408"/>
                <p>A narrow tract of land stretching out into the sea, and appearing to terminate in
                    a point, is called a <hi rend="italic">cape</hi> (fig. 9, e). The most
                    remarkable capes are, the Cape of Good Hope, at the southern extremity of
                    Africa; Cape Horn, at the southern extremity of South America; and the North
                    Cape, at the northern extremity of Europe. A large portion of land jutting out
                    into the sea is called a <hi rend="italic">promontory</hi> (fig. 9,∕).</p>
                <p>It may assist the memory to keep in view the analogy which subsists between the
                    denominations of land and those of water. The large portions of land called <hi
                    rend="italic">continents</hi> correspond to the extensive tracts of water called
                    <hi rend="italic">oceans</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> islands are analogous to
                    lakes; peninsulas to seas or gulfs; isthmuses to straits; capes to creeks; and
                    so with the others,</p>
                <p>Until of late, in systems of geography, the earth used to be considered as
                    divided into four quarters; Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. A classification
                    in which the whole world is arranged under seven divisions ha» now however been
                    very generally adopted: These divisions are, Europe, Asia, Africa,. North
                    America, South America, Australasia, and Polynesia. With regard to the last two,
                    the one, Australasia, or South Asia, comprehends certain of the great islands,
                    particularly New Holland, which are usually considered as belonging to Asia; and
                    the other, Polynesia, signifying many islands, comprehends all the smaller
                    islands which are scattered over the great expanse of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
                <p>This arrangement and classification of the parts of the earth’s surface are
                    founded on the most obvious points of distinction. We shall now explain two
                    divisions employed by the ancients, which are founded upon different principles;
                    that into zones, and that into climates.</p>
                <p>The division into zones is suggested by the different degrees of temperature
                    which prevail in different regions of the earth. The temperature of a country
                    depends on a variety of circumstances (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Physical
                    Geography);</hi> but of these, one of the most obvious is the position of the
                    sun with regard to the zenith. The more nearly his rays are received vertically,
                    the higher will be the temperature; and, on the contrary, the more obliquely
                    they fall, the less effect will they produce in raising the temperature. Now to
                    every point of the earth’s surface between the tropics the sun is vertical twice
                    in the year. It is in this region, then, that the highest temperature will
                    prevail. Again, within the polar circles the sun’s rays at all times fall very
                    obliquely; and for a length of time they do not reach these two regions of the
                    globe at all. Here, then, the temperature must be lower than any where else, as
                    all other places enjoy more of the sun’s genial influence. In the two regions
                    between the tropics and the polar circles, a medium temperature is found,
                    increasing as we approach the former, and diminishing as we approach the latter.
                    Thus is the earth’s surface divided, by the two tropics and two polar circles,
                    into five <hi rend="italic">zones,</hi> distinguished from one another by the
                    prevailing temperature in each. That between the tropics is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">torrid zone,</hi> because there the heat is understood to be
                    extreme. This region, which has the equator passing through the middle of it,
                    the ancients, indeed, considered as uninhabitable. The two regions comprehended
                    within the arctic and antarctic polar circles are called the northern and
                    southern <hi rend="italic">frigid zones,</hi> on account of the severity of the
                    cold which there prevails. The two regions situated between the tropics and the
                    polar circles, the one in the northern hemisphere, bounded by the tropic of
                    cancer and the arctic circle, the other in the southern hemisphere, bounded.by
                    the tropic of qapricon and the antarctic circle, are called the northern and
                    southern <hi rend="italic">temperate zones,</hi> because there neither the heat
                    nor cold is excessive; but the heat reaches the highest temperature of summer,
                    and the cold sinks to the lowest temperature of winter, without either becoming
                    extreme.</p>
                <p>As each tropic lies about 23⅜° from the equator, the breadth of the torrid zone
                    is about 47°, or nearly 3240 English miles. The breadth of each of the frigid
                    zones, that is, from the circumference of the polar circle to the pole, is 23∣
                    <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>, or nearly 1620 miles; so that there remains for
                    the breadth of each of the temperate zones about 43°, or nearly 2970 miles. The
                    superficial content of each zone is easily calculated by the ordinary rules of
                    mensuration. Let <hi rend="italic">s</hi> be the surface of a segment of the
                    sphere, <hi rend="italic">d</hi> the diameter of the sphere, and <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> the height of the segment; then</p>
                <p>« = 3-1416dÄ.</p>
                <p>To apply this formula; let NESQ (Plate CCLIX. fig. 3) be the sphere divided into
                    five zones. It is evident that, for the torrid zone, <hi rend="italic">h</hi>
                    must be equal to <hi rend="italic">LI,</hi> or to twice the sine of BE to the
                    radius EC; that for each of the temperate zones Ä must be equal to LR or <hi
                    rend="italic">lr,</hi> the difference of the sines FE and BE to the same radius
                    CE; and that for the space comprehended within each polar circle, <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> must be equal to NR, the excess of the radius NC above CR,
                    the sine of FE corresponding to the radius. Hence, if we put <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> for twice the natural sine of the arch BE; for the différence of the
                    natural sines of the arches BE and FE; and for the excess of radius above the
                    natural sine of FĽ, successively ;—since in the case of the terrestrial sphere
                    CE or CN is equal to 3956 miles, we have A = 3956 <hi rend="italic">m.</hi>
                    Putting, therefore, instead of <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> its value, 7912, and
                    giving the above formula a logarithmic form, we obtain</p>
                <p>Log.« = log. <hi rend="italic">m</hi> + 7∙9926935.</p>
                <p>Now, for the torrid zone, <hi rend="italic">m</hi> = 2 nat. sin. 23° 30 <hi

                <p>The portion of the surface of the globe comprehended within each polar circle is
                    therefore nearly equal to 8,155,600 square miles.</p>
                <p>It is evident that the superficial content of any other zone of the terrestrial
                    sphere may be found by the above formula, by putting <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    equal to the difference of the natural sines corresponding to the latitudes of
                    the parallels by which the zone is bounded.</p>
                <p>If it is required to find the area of a segment of a zone bounded at both
                    extremities by meridians, it is only necessary to find first the area of the
                    whole zone, and then to multiply the result by the number of degrees and parts
                    of a degree in the length of the segment, and to divide by 360. Thus, the number
                    of square miles contained in the portion of the torrid zone terminated by two
                    meridians which are separated from each other by 8° 45 ’ is equal to 78419520

                <p>∙ing any particular country or district into segments of zones by means of
                    parallels of latitude, its area can easily be calculated.</p>
                <p>The division of the earth’s surface into climates was employed by the ancients
                    for ascertaining the situation of places. They supposed the northern and
                    southern hemispheres to be each divided into small zones, to which they gave the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">climates,</hi> the extent and situation of each zone
                    being determined in the following manner. At the equator the day is always equal
                    to the night, and consists therefore of twelve hours. Here the first climate
                    began, and extended to that parallel where the longest day was 12į hours, which
                    corresponds to 8° 34 ’ of latitude. Commencing at this same parallel at which
                    the first terminated, the second climate extended to latitude 16° 43', where the
                    longest day is thirteen hours. Here the third climate began, and was extended in
                    like manner to that parallel where the longest day is 13⅛ hours. By proceeding
                    in this manner, the space between the equator and each polar circle was divided
                    into twenty-four climates, each of such a breadth as to make half an hour of
                    difference in the length of the longest day at the two parallels of latitude by
                    which the climate was bounded. Having reached the polar circles northward and
                    southward, where the longest day is twenty-four hours, they divided the space
                    within each polar circle in such a manner as to make the difference in the
                    length of the longest day at the beginning and termination of each climate one
                    month. Hence, as the poles are alternately illuminated for six months, there
                    were just six climates within eacļi polar circle.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Table of Climates.</hi></p>
                <p>Besides dividing the surface of the globe into zones and climates, the ancients
                    likewise distinguished the inhabitants of the different regions of the earth by
                    the particular direction in which the shadows of bodies are projected in each
                    region, and by some other circumstances depending on the position of the sun
                    relatively to the zenith or to the meridian. The inhabitants of the torrid zone
                    have their shadows at noon projected, sometimes towards the south and sometimes
                    towards the north, according to the position of the sun in the ecliptic. They
                    were therefore called by the ancients <hi rend="italic">Amphiscii,</hi> a term
                    derived from <hi rend="italic">a,aφι, about,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">βjua, a
                    shadow.</hi> In the temperate zones, the sun is at noon always on the same side
                    of the zenith. Hence the shadows of objects at noon always fall in the same
                    direction; in the northern temperate zone towards the north, and in the southern
                    temperate zone towards the south. The inhabitants of these regions were
                    accordingly called <hi rend="italic">Heteroscii,</hi> from irífo¢, <hi
                    rend="italic">different,</hi> and Aua. Within, the polar circles the sun does
                    not always rise and set every twenty-four hours, as in the other zones; but for
                    a certain number of days in our summer he never sets to places within the arctic
                    polar circle, nor rises to places within the antarctic; and the contrary takes
                    place for a certain number of days during our winter. The number of days during
                    which the sun is present or absent increases as we advance from the polar circle
                    towards the pole. When the sun continues above the horizon for twenty-four hours
                    or upwards, the shadows will make a complete circuit round the objects from
                    which they are projected; hence the inhabitants of the frigid zones were called
                    <hi rend="italic">Periscii,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">erφ, about,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">&lt;r×ιa∙</hi></p>
                <p>Again, the inhabitants of two places which lie under the same meridian, and have
                    the same latitude, but are situated on opposite sides of the equator, were
                    called, relatively to each other, <hi rend="italic">Antacii,</hi> from <hi
                    rend="italic">am, opposite to,</hi> and o∕x∕α, <hi rend="italic">a
                    habitation.</hi> At such places the hours of the day will always correspond, but
                    the seasons of the year will be opposite. The inhabitants of two places which
                    have the same latitude, and are situated on the same side of the equator, but
                    under opposite meridians, were called <hi rend="italic">Perioecii,</hi> from
                    &lt;πg∕, <hi rend="italic">about,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">enua.</hi> They
                    have always the same season of the year at the same time; but any hour of the
                    day at the one place corresponds to the same hour of the night at the other. The
                    inhabitants of two places which have the same latitude, but are situated on
                    opposite sides of the equator, and under opposite meridians, are called <hi
                    rend="italic">Antipodes</hi> to each other, from <hi rend="italic">am, opposite
                    to,</hi> and vous, <hi rend="italic">a foot.</hi> They have always opposite
                    seasons and opposite hours.</p>
                <p>CHAP. III.—DESCRIPTION AND USE OF THE GLOBES.</p>
                <p>When geographers became familiar with the doctrine of the sphericity and motion
                    of the earth, it was an obvious step to have recourse to an artificial sphere
                    for illustrating that doctrine. From a very early period, accordingly, the
                    instruments called the <hi rend="italic">terrestrial</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >celestial globes</hi> have been employed for this purpose. A sphere made of
                    metal, ivory, plaster, paper, pasteboard, or some other convenient substance, is
                    suspended in a brass ring NES (Plate CCLX. fig. 1), of somewhat greater
                    diameteι⅛ on two pins N, S, upon which it can be made to revolve. The sphere,
                    thus suspended, is placed in a frame BMC, which may be in many respects
                    variously constructed, according to the taste of the workman; but its upper part
                    BC always consists of ♯ broad ring made of metal or wood, and supported in a
                    horizontal position. The inner circumference of this ring is equal to that of
                    the brass circle in which the globe is suspended; and two notches in its inner
                    edge, diametrically opposite to each other, receive the brass ring, which also
                    rests in a groove below, in such a posi- <pb break="no" facs="nls:193519297"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-9297-0410"/>tion that the plane of the horizontal ring bisects
                    the sphere. By this arrangement the globe can be made to revolve on its axis,
                    and the brass circle can be made to slide round in its own plane. On the surface
                    of the globe are delineated the equator or equinoctial line, situated exactly in
                    the middle between the two points on which the globe is suspended, and divided
                    into 360 degrees; the ecliptic, divided into twelve signs, and each of these
                    subdivided into thirty degrees; the two tropics; the two polar circles, with as
                    many more parallels to the equator as are found convenient; and generally
                    twenty-four meridians passing through the points of suspension, which represent
                    the poles. The first meridian is usually made to pass through the intersections
                    of the equator and ecliptic, the points of the vernal and autumnal equinoxes;
                    and from the former of these points the reckoning of the degrees on the equator
                    and ecliptic begins. The brass circle in which the globe hangs may be made to
                    represent the meridian of any given point on the surface of the globe,, by
                    simply bringing the given point under it by turning the globe round on its axis.
                    Hence the brass circle is called the <hi rend="italic">universal meridian.</hi>
                    It is divided, by the equator and two poles, into four quadrants, each of which
                    is graduated; and on the semicircle NES (Plate CCLX. fig. 1) the degrees are
                    reckoned from the equator towards either pole, while on the opposite semicircle
                    they are reckoned from either pole towards the equator. On the broad horizontal
                    circle of the frame in which the globe stands are drawn several concentric
                    circles, the outer of which is divided into 365 equal parts, answering to the
                    number of days in the year; whilst the other circles are graduated, the
                    innermost (or rather another circle concentric with it, but larger) being,
                    besides, divided into thirty-two equal parts corresponding to the points of the
                    compass. The circle next the outer edge forms the calendar, and it has the names
                    of the months arranged in order around it, whilst the divisions are distributed
                    so as to mark the number of days in each. The adjacent circle contains the signs
                    and degrees of the ecliptic, so arranged that against each day of the year is
                    found the point of the ecliptic in which the sun is situated on that day. The
                    innermost circle represents the horizon; and the two notches in which the brazen
                    meridian rests pass through the north and south points. It is divided into four
                    quadrants by the cardinal points; and the degrees of the two quadrants, which
                    form the northern semicircle, are reckoned from the east and west points towards
                    the north; while the degrees of the other two quadrants are reckoned from the
                    east and west towards the south.</p>
                <p>Such is a general view of the parts which belong alike to both globes, the
                    terrestrial and the celestial. A more minute description seems unnecessary, as a
                    careful inspection of the globes themselves, with their appendages, will convey
                    a much more distinct conception of them than can be given either by description
                    or by drawings. It will be necessary, however, to describe shortly the horary or
                    hour-circle, the quadrant of altitude, and the compass.</p>
                <p>The hour-circle is a small circle of brass, divided into twenty-four equal parts
                    corresponding to the hours of the day, the divisions being reckoned in two
                    twelves to suit the hours before and after noon. This circle is fixed on the
                    axis of the globe, having its centre coinciding with the north pole. It can be
                    adjusted with the hand to any meridian, but is at the same time tight enough to
                    be moved along with the globe. Some globes have the hour circle fixed on the
                    meridian, with an index that admits of being adjusted with the hand, but is
                    carried round with the globe.</p>
                <p>The quadrant of altitude is a thin flexible slip of brass, equal in length to one
                    fourth part of the circumference of a great circle on the globe. It is graduated
                    on one side, and is furnished with a nut and screw at one end, for the purpose
                    of making it fast to the brazen meridian. Its use is to measure degrees on the
                    surface of the globe in any direction.</p>
                <p>The compass is simply a magnetic needle suspended over the centre of a circle, on
                    the circumference of which are marked the thirty-two points of the compass. It
                    is fixed to the under part of the frame in which the globe is suspended, and is
                    used for the purpose of placing the meridian due north and south.</p>
                <p>On the terrestrial globe the land and water which compose the surface of the
                    earth are delineated, with the various divisions belonging to each. If we
                    suppose the globe to be six or seven feet in diameter, the true height of the
                    mountains on the earth’s surface must be reduced, in order to be represented on
                    the globe in due proportion to its bulk, in the ratio of 7912 miles to six or
                    seven feet; that is, the height of the protuberance, on the globe which shall
                    represent any particular mountain must be somewhat about the six millionth part
                    of the actual elevation of the mountain above the general surface of the earth.
                    Apply this to the highest mountain in the world, which does not exceed five and
                    a half miles in height; the elevation of the protuberance representing it on a
                    globe of the supposed dimensions would be about one seventeenth part of an inch
                    above the general surface. It is seldom, however, that globes are made of this
                    size. One third of the supposed diameter is more near to the ordinary
                    dimensions. Hence we see with what propriety the earth is represented by a globe
                    having a smooth surface.</p>
                <p>But in order to render the representation more complete, it may be supposed
                    necessary that the terrestrial globe should be enclosed in a hollow sphere which
                    would represent the heavens surrounding the earth on all sides. In conformity
                    with this idea the <hi rend="italic">armillary sphere</hi> was contrived, in
                    which the several circles of the system of the world, put together in their
                    natural order, are represented, with a small globe in the centre of the sphere
                    to represent the earth. Fig. 3, Plate CCLX., represents a sphere of this
                    description, which will be sufliciently understood by inspection. The ordinary
                    way, however, of representing the heavens, proceeds on the supposition that the
                    eye of the observer is placed, not in the centre of the celestial sphere, but
                    beyond its bounds, so as to look down on a <hi rend="italic">convex</hi>
                    surface. Thus are the stars and constellations represented in their relative
                    positions on the celestial globe (fig. 2), with which the concave surface of the
                    visible heavens is easily compared.</p>
                <p>Besides answering the general purposes of illustration, the globes furnish also
                    the means of resolving with facility, and with a degree of accuracy sufficient
                    for ordinary purposes, many problems in geography and practical astronomy. It is
                    only requisite to consider the circumstances on which the solution of a problem
                    depends, and to arrange on the globe these circumstances, according to their
                    natural order and dependence, and the result is at once obtained. We proceed to
                    give a few of the more useful problems, with their solutions by the globes.</p>

                    that the same arrangement of the globe will give the point of the compass on
                    which the sun rises and sets, by simply observing what point of the circle of

                    we find the time when the sun ceases to shine without setting, which is the
                    termination of the longest day. By proceeding in the same manner with the

                <p>Rectify the globe for the latitude; bring the first meridian under the brazen

                    case, the arches intercepted on the horizon will measure the angles which the
                    hour-lines make with the meridian. To find the angles corresponding to half
                    hours and quarters, turn the globe gradually from its position in which the

                    the arch of the horizon intercepted between the southern point and the first
                    meridian; the arches thus found give the positions of the lines corresponding to
                    the half hours and quarters. The style of the dial represents the axis of the

                    the latitude of the place.</p>
                <p>A direct north or south dial for any latitude may be constructed in the same

                    complement of the given latitude.</p>

                <p>CHAP. IV.—OF THE CONSTRUCTION AND USE OF MAPS.</p>
                <p>In representing the geographical divisions of the earth’s surface, two objects
                    are to be kept in view; on the one hand, to exhibit accurately to the eye the
                    relative position of the different countries; and, on the other hand, to give a
                    delineation sufficiently minute to furnish a distinct knowledge of the necessary
                    details. As the globe has very nearly the exact figure of the earth, the
                    representation which it affords of the surface fulfils the first of these
                    objects in the most perfect manner; but to attain the second it would be
                    requisite to enlarge the globe beyond all convenient size. A globe of the
                    ordinary dimensions serves almost no other purpose in this respect, but to
                    convey a clear conception of the earth’s surface as a whole; exhibiting the
                    figure, extent, position, and general features of the great continents and
                    islands, with the intervening oceans and seas. To obtain a detailed
                    representation of any part of the earth’s surface, geographers have therefore
                    found it necessary to have recourse to <hi rend="italic">Maps,</hi> in which
                    countries are delineated on a plane, while the mutual proportions of the
                    distances of places are preserved as nearly as possible the same as on the
                    globe.</p>
                <p>For the construction of maps different mathematical hypotheses have been
                    adopted.</p>
                <p>By one method of construction, that of <hi rend="italic">projection,</hi> the
                    boundaries of countries, and their more remarkable features, are represented
                    according to the rules of perspective, on the supposition of the eye being
                    placed on some point of the sphere, or at some given distance from it, which may
                    be increased indefinitely. Wherever the eye is supposed to be situated, the
                    representation thus obtained answers very well, provided the surface to be
                    represented is of small extent, and the point of view, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >projecting point,</hi> is nearly over the centre; but when the surface is of
                    great extent, for example, a whole hemisphere, those places which are situated
                    near the border of the projection are in all of them much distorted.</p>
                <p>Another method, that of <hi rend="italic">development,</hi> is founded on the
                    supposition that the spherical surface to be represented is a portion of a cone,
                    of which the vertex is situated somewhere<pb break="no" facs="nls:193519336"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-9336-0413"/> in the polar axis produced, and the conical
                    surface is supposed either to touch the sphere in the middle parallel of the
                    map, or to fall within the sphere at the middle parallel, and without it at the
                    extreme parallels. The surface of the cone is then supposed to be spread out
                    into a plane.</p>
                <p>A third method, which depends on the development of a cylindrical surface, is
                    that according to which maps arc so delineated as to have the parallels of
                    latitude and circles of longitude respectively represented by parallel straight
                    lines. By this method marine charts are constructed. As the rhumb makes equal
                    angles with every meridian, it necessarily, according to this method of
                    delineation, becomes a straight line. Such a representation of the earth’s
                    surface is commonly called <hi rend="italic">Mercators Chart,</hi> although the
                    invention is due to an English mathematician, Edward Wright.</p>
                <p>These are the three principal methods employed to represent to the eye the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> several countries on the surface of the earth.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Construction of Maps by Projection.</hi></p>
                <p>The representation of any portion of the earth’s surface obtained by projection,
                    varies, of course, its character according to the several situations of the eye
                    and of the plane of projection, in relation to the meridians, parallels, and
                    various points or places so represented. It is usual to assume the plane of a
                    great circle of the sphere as the plane of projection, and to suppose the eye
                    situated at some point in a straight line perpendicular to this plane, and
                    passing through the centre of the circle. If the distance of the eye from the
                    plane of projection be supposed indefinitely great, the projection is called the
                    <hi rend="italic">orthographic</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> if it is supposed to
                    be upon the surface of the sphere, the projection is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">stereographic</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and if the eye is
                    supposed to be in such a position, that the projections of the meridians and
                    parallels of latitude are nearly equidistant, as the meridians and parallels
                    themselves are upon the globe, the projection is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >globular.</hi> In order to apply these projections to the construction of maps,
                    we must attend to the properties of each.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Orthographic Projection of the Sphere.</hi></p>
                <p>The fundamental principle in this projection is, that the representation of any
                    point on the sphere is where a perpendicular from that point meets the plane of
                    projection. Hence it follows that the projection of a line of any kind is
                    determined by supposing perpendiculars to fall from every point in that line
                    upon the plane of projection, and a line to pass through the points of
                    intersection of these perpendiculars with that plane.</p>
                <p>If the proposed line be a straight line, its orthographic projection will also be
                    a straight line, being the intersection of the plane of projection with the
                    plane perpendicular to it passing through the proposed line.</p>
                <p>If the proposed line be the circumference of a circle parallel to the plane of
                    projection, its orthographic projection will also be a circle of the same
                    diameter; since the circle and its projection are the equal and parallel
                    extremities of the cylinder formed by the perpendiculars failing upon the plane
                    of projection.</p>
                <p>If the proposed line be the circumference of a circle, of which the plane is
                    perpendicular to the plane of projection, its orthographic projection will be a
                    straight line equal to its diameter.</p>
                <p>If the proposed line be the circumference of a circle, of which the plane is
                    neither parallel nor perpendicular to the plane of projection, its projection
                    will be an ellipse, being the curve in which the plane of projection intersects
                    the cylinder formed by the perpendiculars falling upon it 'rom every point in
                    the circumference of the circle. An accurate idea of the orthographic projection
                    of any line or figure may be obtained by holding it up in the light of the sun,
                    and observing the shadow formed on a plane perpendicular to the direction of the
                    sun’s rays. The rays which pass close to the figure are the perpendiculars to
                    the plane of projection, and the shadow is the orthographic projection of the
                    figure.</p>
                <p>From the nature of this projection, the orthographic representation of half the
                    surface of the globe shows nearly the true figure and proportions of countries
                    about the middle of the map, that is, directly opposite to the supposed position
                    of the eye; but towards the extremities the true figure and position of the
                    countries are imperfectly exhibited. For this reason this method of projection
                    is seldom employed in geography, but in astronomy it is frequently used. We
                    shall give, however, the orthographic projection of the sphere on the plané of
                    the equator and on the plane of the meridian.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To project the Sphere orthographically on the Plane of the
                    Equator.</hi> From any point Cas a centre, with any radius CA (Plate CCLX. fig.
                    4), describe the circle ABD. Let this circle represent the equator, upon the
                    plane of which it is required to project the sphere orthographically. It is
                    evident that the centre C will be the projection of the poles of the equator,
                    and that since the planes of the meridian circles are perpendicular to the plane
                    of the equator, these circles will be projected into diameters, making with each
                    other the same angles as do the planes of the meridians. Let A 90, B 180, be two
                    perpendicular diameters; they will represent two meridian circles at right
                    angles to each other: divide the semicircle B 90 D into twelve equal parts at
                    the points 15, 30, 45, &amp;c., and let diameters be drawn through the points of
                    division; then the twenty-four radii CB, C 15, C 30, &amp;c. will be the
                    projections of the twenty-four meridians usually drawn upon the globe, any one
                    of which, as BC, may be considered as the first meridian.</p>
                <p>Next, it is evident that the parallels of latitude will be projected into
                    circles, which have C for their common centre, and of each of which the radius
                    will be equal to that of the corresponding parallel of latitude, or to the
                    cosine of the latitude of the parallel. Let us suppose that a parallel is drawn
                    on the globe for every tenth degree of latitude; then divide the quadrant AB
                    into nine equal parts, at the points 80, 70, 60, &amp;c.; from these points of
                    division let fail perpendiculars upon BC, meeting it in the pointe 80, 70, 60,
                    &amp;c.; the lines C 80, C 70, C 60, &amp;c. are equal to the cosines of the
                    arches B 80, B 70, B 60, &amp;c. to the radius BC. From the centre C, therefore,
                    describe circles with these lines as radii; and these circles will be the
                    projections of the parallels corresponding to the 80th, 70th, 60th, &amp;c.
                    degrees of latitude.</p>
                <p>Lastly, the projections of the polar circles and of the tropics may be found by
                    setting off from the point A towards B, and from the point B towards A,
                    twenty-three and a half degrees, drawing perpendiculars to BC through the points
                    of division, and describing circles from C as a centre through the points in
                    which these perpendiculars cut BC.</p>
                <p>Thus will the projection of the sphere upon the plane of the equator be
                    completed. The representation given of the polar regions in a map of this
                    description is tolerably correct, but the countries towards the equator are very
                    much distorted.</p>

                    diameters PS and AB at right angles to each other: then may PS be assumed as the
                    projection of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193519349" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9349-0414"
                    />. the meridian which is at right angles to the plane of projection; and AB
                    will be the projection of the equator, since that circle cuts all the meridians
                    at right angles. The other meridians cutting the projecting plane obliquely are
                    projected into ellipses, having PS for their common transverse axis, and the
                    cosines of their inclinations to the projecting plane for their several
                    semicojugate axes. Let the quadrant AS be therefore divided into six equal parts

                    parallels on the other side of the equator are to be drawn in the same manner;
                    as are also the tropics and polar circles, the former at 23⅜° on each side of
                    the equator, and the latter at 23⅜° from the poles.</p>
                <p>In this projection there is great distortion in the appearance of the regions
                    about the poles, and of all the countries near the meridian PASB. It is as we
                    approach the centre of the map that this distortion begins so far to disappear
                    as to allow a projected portion of the earth’s surface to acquire any
                    considerable resemblance to its delineation on the globe.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Stereographic Projection of the Sphere.</hi></p>
                <p>In the stereographic projection of the sphere the eye is supposed to be situated
                    at one of the points where the surface of the sphere is intersected by a
                    straight line passing through the centre, and perpendicular to the plane on
                    which the projection is to be made. This plane, as we have already remarked, is
                    that of a great circle of the sphere; so that the point on the sphere at which
                    the eye is supposed situated will be everywhere 90° distant from the
                    circumference of that circle whose plane is assumed as the plane of projection.
                    In order that the lines and circles on the sphere may be visible to the eye in
                    this position, it will be necessary to suppose the sphere to be transparent.
                    Let, then, ABEC (Plate CCLX. fig. G) be a great circle drawn on a sphere of this
                    description, and passing through the eye at E. Let FG be a plane passing through
                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> the centre of the sphere, in such a manner as to cut
                    the plane of the circle ABEC at right angles in the diameter HK, and to make
                    each of the arches EH, EK, equal to 90°: then FG will be the plane of
                    projection. Draw EA the diameter of the sphere passing through the eye; also
                    draw EB, EC, to B and C, any two points in the circumference of the circle ABEC;
                    and let the lines EA, EB, EC, intersect the plane FG in the points α, <hi
                    rend="italic">b, c.</hi> By the fundamental principle of the ∙tereographic
                    projection, namely, that the representation of any point is where the straight
                    line drawn from it to the eye intersects the plane of projection, the points α,
                    <hi rend="italic">b, c</hi> are the projections of the points A, B, C. It i <hi
                    rend="subscript"> s</hi> evident also that the line <hi rend="italic">be,</hi>
                    in which the planes EBC and FG intersect each other, is the projection of the
                    line BC, or of the arch BAC; and that the lines <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ac,</hi> are the projections of the arches AB,</p>
                <p>Since <hi rend="italic">Bab</hi> is a right angle, <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> is
                    the tangent of the angle <hi rend="italic">aEJ&gt;</hi> to the radius Ea. But
                    the angle <hi rend="italic">aEb</hi> is measured by ' <hi rend="superscript">
                    a</hi> [ <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> A n <hi rend="superscript"> βrc</hi> ∙
                    AB <hi rend="superscript">:</hi> hence <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> is the tangent
                    of half the arch AB, or its semitangent. Thus it appears, that if a great circle
                    pass through the projecting point E, any arch of it reckoned from the opposite
                    point of the sphere is projected into a straight line passing through the
                    centre, and equal to the semitangent of that arch.</p>
                <p>Let BDC be any circle drawn on the sphere, and having BC for a diameter. Take D
                    any point in the circumference of that circle, and draw ED intersecting the
                    plane FG in the point <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> If the point D be carried round
                    the circumference BCD, the line ED will trace the surface of a cone of which BDC
                    is the base; and the line <hi rend="italic">bdc,</hi> (the intersection of the
                    plane FG with the conical surface), which is traced by the point <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> is the projection of the circle BCD.</p>
                <p>Now, it can be demonstrated that the angles EBC, ECB, are equal to <hi
                    rend="italic">Ecb, Ebc,</hi> each to each; so that the cones EBC, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ebc</hi> are similar. Hence the projection <hi rend="italic"
                    >bdc</hi> is a circle, whose diameter <hi rend="italic">be</hi> is found by
                    taking <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ac</hi> equal to the
                    semitangents of the arches AB, AC.</p>
                <p>Thus it appears that every circle of the sphere is, according to the
                    stereographic projection, represented by a circle; but a circle can be described
                    when three points in the circumference are given, or when two points in the
                    circumference and the radius are given. Hence this property renders the
                    projection of the sphere by this method very easy.</p>
                <p>Another very elegant and important geometrical property of this projection is,
                    that any two straight lines touching the sphere at one and the same point are
                    represented by two straight lines which make with each other on the plane of
                    projection an angle equal to that contained by the touching lines themselves.
                    Hence also the angle formed by any two circles of the sphere is equal to the
                    angle formed by their projections.</p>
                <p>When it is further considered that the stereographic projection gives a
                    representation of a hemisphere, in which the parts about the extremity of the
                    map are less distorted than in the representation obtained by the orthographic
                    projection, it must be concluded that the former method is preferable to the
                    latter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To project the Sphere stereographicaUy on the Planepf the

                    represent the equator, on the plane of which it is required to project the
                    sphere; or rather that hemisphere which lies remote from the point of sight. As
                    the eye must be supposed to be situated at the pole, it is evident that the
                    centre C will be the projection of the opposite pole, and that the meridians
                    will be projected into straight lines passing through C, and dividing the
                    circumference of the circle ABGE into as many equal parts as there are meridians
                    supposed to be drawn on the globe. If there are twenty-four meridians, then draw
                    AG any diameter, and divide the semicircle AEG into twelve equal parts. Through
                    the points of division draw diameters, as BCE, FCK, DCH, &amp;c, and the radii
                    thus found will be the projections of the meridians corresponding to every
                    fifteenth degree of the equator, any one of which may be assumed for the first
                    meridian.</p>
                <p>Again, to project the parallels of latitude; let AG and BE be perpendicular
                    diameters. Divide the quadrant AB into nine equal parts in the points 10, 20,
                    30, &amp;c. From E to the several points of division draw straight lines
                    intersecting AC in the points 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. The lines C 10, C 20, C 30,
                    &amp;c. are the semitangents of the distances of the several parallels of
                    latitude from the pole. Hence the points 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. are the points of
                    intersection of the projected parallels with the projected meridian AG. Upon C,
                    then, as a centre, at the distances C 10, C 20, C 30, &amp;c. describe
                    concentric circles, and these will be the projections of the parallels
                    corresponding to every tenth degree of latitude. The tropics and polar circles
                    are found in the same manner.</p>

                    describe the circle ASBP to represent the meridian on the plane of which it is
                    required to project the sphere stereographically. As the eye, in this case, is
                    supposed to be situated at a point in the equator, that circle will be projected
                    into a straight line passing through the centre C: let it be represented by the
                    diameter AB. Draw the diameter PS perpendicular to AB; then will PS represent
                    the meridian passing through the eye, and P and S will be the poles. To project
                    the other meridians, divide the quadrant AP into nine equal parts (supposing a
                    meridian to pass through every tenth degree of the equator) at the points 10,
                    20, SO, Ac., and from S draw straight lines to these points of division
                    intersecting AC in the points 1, 2, 3, Ac. The lines C 1, C 2, C 3, Ac. are the
                    semitangents of the arcs of the equator which measure the distances of the
                    points in which the several meridians cut the equator from the point of the
                    sphere opposite to the eye. Hence the points 1, 2, 3, Ac. are the points in
                    which the projected meridians will intersect the projected equator AB. But the
                    projected meridians also pass through the points P and S. In each, therefore,
                    there are three points given. If we describe, then, the arches PIS, P 2 8, P 3
                    S, Ac. these arches will be the projections of the meridians on one side of that
                    passing through the point opposite to the projecting point, and those on the
                    other side are to be found in like manner.</p>
                <p>Again, by dividing each of the quadrants PA, PB into nine equal parts, we find
                    two points in each of the parallels of latitude. A third point in each will be
                    found by drawing straight lines from B to each of the points of division 80, 70,
                    60, Ac. so as to intersect PC in the points 8,7, 6, Ac.; for the lines C 8, C 7,
                    C 6, Ac. are the semitangents of the arcs intercepted upon that meridian of
                    which PS is the projection between the several parallels and the point of the
                    sphere opposite to the projecting point. Describe, then, the several arches
                    through the three points found in each; and in this manner the parallels on one
                    side of the equator are found. Proceed in the same manner with regard to the
                    parallels on the other side of the equator, and with regard to the tropics and
                    polar circles, and the projection will be completed. It is evident that the
                    centres of all the projected meridians will lie in the line AB, or in that line
                    produced; and from the construction it is easy to show that the distance of the
                    centre of each projected meridian from the point C is equal to the tangent of
                    the inclination of the meridian to the plane of projection; while the radius of
                    the projected meridian is equal to the secant of the same angle.</p>
                <p>Further, the centres of all tlfe projected parallels of latitude lie in the line
                    PS, or in PS produced; and the centre of each projected parallel is distant from
                    C by the secant of the arch which measures the distance of the parallel from the
                    pole; while the radius of the projected parallel is equal to the tangent of the
                    same arch.</p>

                    required to project the sphere. To avoid intricacy among the lines necessary to
                    be drawn for the construction, let the subsidiary circle N'W'S'E'( Plate
                    CCLXI.fio 1) be described with the same radius. Through C, the centre of each
                    circle, draw two diameters WE, NS (Plate CCLX fig. 9), and W'E',N'S'(Plate
                    CCLXI. fig. 1), intersecting each other at righlt angles. Let the diameters NS,
                    WE (Plate CCLX. fig. 9) be the projections of the meridian of the given place,
                    and of a semicircle at right angles to that meridian, and pasing also through
                    the given place. It is evident that the points N, W, S, E are the four cardinal
                    points of the horizon. On the circumference of the subsidiary circle N'W'S'E
                    (Plate CCLXI. fig. I) takeN'P ’ equal to the given latitude; and draw the
                    straight line W'P' intersecting CN' in P: then will CP be the semitangent of the
                    distance of the pole from the point on the sphere opposite to the projecting
                    point. Make therefore CP (Plate CCLX. fig. 9) equal to CP (Plate CCLXI. fig. 1),
                    and the point P is the projection of the pole. Draw the diameters <hi

                    drawing W'A ’ to intersect CS ’ in A, we obtain CA the semitangent of the
                    distance of the point in which the equator intersects the meridian from the

                    9) equal to CA (Plate CCLXI. fig. 1); and through the three points W, A, E,
                    describe an arch of a circle: the arch WAE will be the projection of the
                    equator. Next, we shall show the manner of drawing the parallels of latitude, by
                    taking as an example the two parallels which are twenty and forty degrees
                    distant from the pole. In the subsidiary circle (Plate CCLXI. fig. 1) take P ’
                    20 and P' 40, equal to 20° and 40° on each side of P ’. Draw from W' to the
                    points thus found, straight lines intersecting CN' and CS' in the points α, <hi

                    circles; these circles are the projections of the parallels required. In the
                    same manner are the other parallels of latitude, the tropics, and the polar
                    circles to be drawn.</p>
                <p>Again, to project the meridians; the straight lines NP, PS, are the projections
                    of the opposite meridians which pass through the north and south points of the
                    horizon. The meridian circle, which is at right angles to that represented by
                    NS, passes through the east and west pointe of the horizon, so that three points
                    in its projection are given, namely, the points W, P, E; its projection may
                    therefore be drawn. But it may be more conveniently found by considering that
                    the meridian in question makes with the plane of projection an angle equal to
                    the given latitude: the centre of its projection, which is in CŚ produced, must
                    therefore be distant from the point C by the tangent of the given latitude, and
                    its radius will be equal to the secant of the same. From the point S' (Plate
                    CCLXI. fig. 1) draw S'D, touching the circle in S', and meeting <hi
                    rend="italic">P</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">p</hi> produced in D; then DS'and DC
                    are the tangent and secant of the given latitude. In CS produced (Plate CCLX*
                    fig. 9) take CB equal to DS'; and on B as a centre describe an arch through the
                    point P, which will also pass through W and Ľ. The arches PW, PE will represent
                    the opposite meridians, which are at right angles to the meridian of the place
                    for which the projection is made. With regard to the other meridians, it is not
                    difficult to see that their centres will lie in a straight line GH (Plate CCLX.
                    fig. 9) drawn through B at right angles to CB; and that the distance of the
                    centre of each projection from the point B will be equal to the tangent of the
                    inclination of the corresponding meridian circle to that meridian circle which
                    passes through the east and west points; while the radius of the projection will
                    be equal to the secant of the same inclination. Let us suppose, then, that the

                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Globular Projection of the Sphere.</hi></p>
                <p>In the globular projection of the sphere, a point is assumed for the position of
                    the eye, at a finite distance from the centre greater than the radius, and so
                    situated that the degrees in the representation shall be nearly equal to each
                    other, and the deviations from equality in the representations of equal portions
                    of the spherical surface thus in some measure corrected. To determine the
                    position of the point of view so as to answer these conditions, let ADBF (Plate
                    CCLXI. fig. 2) be a section of the sphere made by a plane passing through C the
                    centre, and through the point E which is assumed as the projecting point
                    required. Through C draw EB, meeting the circumference ADBF in A and B, and draw
                    the diameter DF at right angles to EB. Bisect the quadrant DB in I, and draw El
                    meeting DC in G; the point G will be the projection of the point I. But by
                    hypothesis the projections of equal arches are nearly equal: let then DG be
                    assumed equal to GC. Join DB, and draw CI meeting DB in H. Join GH, and draw IK
                    parallel to DC, or at right angles to AB. Then it is evident that DĲ is equal to
                    HB; and therefore DH: HB:: DG: GC. Hence the line GH is parallel to CB; and we
                    have IH: HC:: (IG: GE: :) KC: CE. But III is equal to BK, and HC to KC:
                    therefore BK: KC:: KC: CE, and we have BK ∙ CE = KC <hi rend="superscript">
                    s</hi> = IK' = BK ∙ KA. Hence CE is equal to KA; and taking away the common part
                    AC, there remains EA equal to KC or to IK: that is, EA, the distance of the
                    point of view above the surface, is equal to the sine of 45°. If the radius CA
                    be divided into 100 equal parts, EA is therefore nearly equal to 71 of these
                    parts.</p>
                <p>This projection was first suggested by Μ. Delahire, and the approximation which
                    it gives to equality in the projection of equal arches of a circle perpendicular
                    to the plane of projection is considerable. The circles of the sphere are,
                    according to this method of projection, represented by ellipses. An
                    approximation to this method is, however, generally all that is aimed at. The
                    circles of the sphere are represented by circles; and, without any regard to the
                    distance of a projecting point, the degrees of longitude on the equator and of
                    latitude on the meridian are made all equal to one another; the plane of the
                    meridian being assumed as the projecting plane. The following is the
                    construction by which such a representation of a hemisphere of the earth’s
                    surface is obtained, <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> From the centre C (Plate
                    CCLXI. fig. 3), with any radius CA, describe a circle PASB to represent the
                    meridian on which it is required to project the hemisphere. Draw the diameters
                    AB, PS, at right angles to each other; and let PS represent the meridian of
                    which the plane is at right angles to the plane of projection: then AB will be
                    the projection of the equator, and the points P and S, the projections of the
                    poles.</p>
                <p>To project the parallels on the north side of the equator, divide each of the
                    quadrants PA, PB, into nine equal parts: also divide the radius CP into the same
                    number of equal parts. Let 80, 70, 60, &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">d, e, f
                    &amp;c.</hi> be the points of division: the parallel corresponding to 80° of
                    latitude will pass through the three points 80, <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> 80;
                    that corresponding to 70° of latitude through the three points 70, <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> 70, and so on. Describe circles, accordingly, through
                    these points, and the parallels on the north side of the equator will be drawn.
                    In the same manner are the parallels on the south side of the equator to be
                    projected, as are also the tropics and polar circles.</p>
                <p>Again, to project the meridians, divide the radius AC into six equal parts in the
                    points <hi rend="italic">a, b,</hi> c, &amp;c., and through the points P and S,
                    and these points of division, describe circles PαS, Ptó, &amp;c. Proceed in the
                    same manner on the other side of PS, and the circles thus described will
                    represent the meridians passing through every fifteenth degree of the equator,
                    any one of which may, in laying down places by their latitudes and longitudes,
                    be assumed for the first meridian. Plate CCLXII. is a planisphere, or map of the
                    world, projected in this manner.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Construction of Maps by Development.</hi></p>
                <p>The practical application of the three methods of projection which we have now
                    explained, to the construction of maps, is usually confined to the
                    representation of a hemisphere; whilst for the delineation of the geographical
                    features of a single country, the method of development is commonly employed.
                    The particular purpose for which a map is to be used may make it more or less
                    important that it should exhibit, with all the precision that can be attained,
                    some particular features of the country represented. The purposes of civil
                    government require maps that give the true figure and dimensions of territory.
                    For military affairs, maps that give correct distances are chiefly useful;
                    whilst for the purposes of the navigator, the bearings of places, one from
                    another, must be correctly, and, at the same time, simply exhibited. The first
                    two objects are nearly gained in ordinary maps. But, for the attainment of the
                    last, a map of a peculiar construction, called <hi rend="italic">Mercator’s
                    Chart,</hi> has been invented; which, while it answers completely the purpose of
                    the navigator, is not immediately applicable to any other.</p>
                <p>It is an obvious property of a cone and of a cylinder, that the surface of each
                    admits of being spread out on a plane. If a cone be laid with its slant side on
                    a plane, the former will coincide with the latter along a line stretching from
                    the point of contact in the base to the apex of the cone. Hence, if the cone is
                    rolled round, whilst the apex continues at the same point, every point upon the
                    surface of the cone will come in contact with a corresponding point in the plane
                    surface; so that a sector of a circle will be described, with which the surface
                    of the cone, if expanded, would exactly coincide. A cylinder admits of being
                    rolled along a plane surface in a similar manner. But this is not the case with
                    respect to a sphere. For, since a sphere touches a plane only in a point, if the
                    former be rolled along the latter in one direction, the successive points of
                    contact will mark out a straight line. A narrow zone of the sphere may, however,
                    be supposed, without great error, to coincide with the surface of a cone or
                    cylinder; and this hypothesis gives rise to a twofold construction by
                    development, that by the development of a conical surface, and that by the
                    development of a cylindrical surface.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Development of the Curve Surface of a Cone.</hi></p>
                <p>Let NAMB (Plate CCLXI. fig. 4) be a section of the sphere by the plane of the
                    meridian. Let NM represent the axis; then AB drawn through the centre C, at
                    right angles to NM, will represent the diameter of the equator. Take EF, any
                    arch of the meridian, and bisect it in the point G. Through G draw LD a tangent
                    to the circle NAMB, and meeting the axis MN produced in the point L. Let the
                    plane figure LGMB be now supposed to revolve about the axis LM; then will the
                    circle NAMB generate a sphere, and the line LD will generate a conical surface,
                    which will touch the sphere. Further, the points E, G, F will describe circles,
                    which will be parallels of latitude. If EF be an arch of not many degrees, the
                    zone comprised between the parallel circles Ee, <hi rend="italic">ĩj</hi> will
                    nearly coincide with the corresponding portion of the conical surface
                    intercepted between the planes of the same circles. Take any point H in the
                    circumference <pb break="no" facs="nls:193519388" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9388-0417"
                    />of the circle described by G, the middle point of the arch EF, and join LH,
                    HK, the point K being the centre of the circle GHÿ.</p>
                <p>Let us now suppose the conical surface comprehended between the straight lines
                    LG, LH, and the arch GH, to be spread out into a plane L'G'H'. Then it is
                    evident that the arch GH on the middle parallel, of which the radius is HK, the
                    cosine of the middle latitude, is changed into an arch GΗ' of which the radius
                    is L'G' = LG, the cotangent of the middle latitude. In the line L'G', and in
                    L'G' produced, take G'F', G'E' equal to the arch EG or GF. Then, on the point L'
                    as a centre, at the distances L'E', L’F' describe the arches Efir, F⅛, and the
                    plane surface EΕrr may be considered as nearly equal to the spherical surface
                    comprehended between the meridians passing through G and H, and the arcs of the
                    parallels Ee, <hi rend="italic">ιf</hi> intercepted by these meridians. Hence,
                    if any tract of country situated on the corresponding portion of the earth’s
                    surface be delineated on the plane E'F⅛r, the representation of it thus obtained
                    will bear a near resemblance to its delineation on the globe, the resemblance
                    increasing according as the zone comprehended between the extreme parallels is
                    diminished in breadth.</p>
                <p>Such is the principle of the conical development. Let us now consider how the
                    line L'G'and the angle G'L’H'are to be determined, so as to suit the space
                    Ľ'F'sr to any given difference of longitude and given middle latitude; also in
                    what manner the parallels of latitude and the meridians are to be drawn on that
                    surface.</p>
                <p>We have already seen, that L'G' is equal to the cotangent of the middle latitude
                    to the radius of the sphere. If the radius of the sphere be considered equal to
                    unity, the trigonometrical tables will give the length of L'G' in parts of the
                    radius. But it will be more convenient to have it expressed in minutes of a
                    degree. Now, since the semicircumference is to radius as 3-1416 is to 1, if we
                    put R for radius, we have 3-1416: 1:: 180 × 60: R = 3437∙7, which is the radius
                    expressed in minutes of a degree. Hence L'G' expressed in the same manner will
                    be equal to</p>
                <p>3437∙7 × cotan. middle latitude.</p>
                <p>Again, since the arch GH is equal in length to the arch G’H' by hypothesis, the
                    angle GKH measured by the former, must be to G'L'H' measured by the latter, as
                    the radius L'G' is to the radius GK; that is, if we put D for the difference of
                    longitude, and <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> for the angle G'L'H', we will have Dip::
                    (L'G': GK:: cot. mid. lat.: cos. mid. lat.: :) rad.: sine mid. lat. Hence we
                    obtain p = D × sine mid. lat.</p>
                <p>The angle L' being thus determined, and the lines L'G', G'E', G ’ F' being known,
                    and expressed in minutes of a degree, we can describe the figure E'Fsr, so that
                    it shall be accommodated to any given middle latitude and given difference of
                    longitude. Then having divided E'F into as many equal parts as there are minutes
                    in the difference of latitude, or as there are some given number of minutes in
                    it, the points must be ascertained through which the parallels intended to be
                    drawn pass, and from L' their common centre, these parallels are to be drawn
                    accordingly. The parallels E'r, F⅛ are in like manner to be divided each into as
                    many equal parts as-there are minutes, or some given number of minutes, in the
                    difference of longitude: and points being ascertained in each of these parallels
                    through which the meridians proposed to be drawn pass, the straight lines
                    joining the corresponding points are the meridians required. It is by this
                    method that common maps of particular countries are constructed.</p>
                <p>As an example, let it be required to construct a map of Great Britain and

                    of a degree on the meridian. Let it be described accordingly (Plate CCLXI. fig.

                    in the figure, and the map is prepared for having traced upon it the outline of
                    the coasts of the British isles, and places laid down according to their
                    latitudes and longitudes.</p>
                <p>It is evident that if the point in which E'F' and <hi rend="italic">rs</hi>
                    intersect each other becomes very distant, it may be exceedingly troublesome, or
                    practically impossible, to describe from it as a centre the parallels of
                    latitude. An obvious remedy for this inconvenience is, to join together two
                    rulers, as AB, AC (Plate CCLXI. fig. 6), at the point A, in such a manner as
                    that they may contain an angle equal to the angle in the segment which has for
                    its arch the parallel to be drawn. If the edges of the rulers be made, by means
                    of two pins, to slide over the extremities D, E of the parallel, a pencil fixed
                    at the angular point A will trace the parallel on the map. In the present
                    instance the rulers mustbe placed so as to form an angle of¢——- <hi

                <p>The conical development has been variously modified, so as to remove as much as
                    possible its defects. Thus, one modification was given by the Rev. Patrick
                    Murdoch in the <hi rend="italic">London Philosophical Transactions,</hi> 1758.
                    He supposed the cone to pass through points of the meridian between the middle
                    latitude and the extremities of the arch to be projected, its side being
                    parallel to the tangent at the middle latitude, while the points where the cone
                    intersects the meridian are so situated as that the conic surface is exactly
                    equal to the spherical surface which it represents. Let M denote the arch of the
                    meridian to be represented in the map; then, according to this method of
                    development, L'G', the radius of the middle parallel on the map, is equal to
                    chord of arch M , ., <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>- ×

                <p>arch M</p>
                <p>the cotangent being supposed to be expressed by the radius of the sphere. In
                    other respects the construction is the same as in the ordinary conical
                    projection.</p>
                <p>But the simplest and most successful method of remedying the defects of the
                    conical development is that known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Flamsteeds
                    projection.</hi> The English astronomer by whom this method was invented, and
                    whose name it bears, made use of it in constructing his celestial atlas. He
                    developed all the parallels of latitude on the sphere into straight lines, and
                    also one of the meridians, namely, that which passes through the middle of the
                    chart. To this meridian the lines representing the parallels are perpendicular,
                    and the length of each is the same with that of the parallel on the sphere which
                    it represents. Dividing the parallels in the projection into equal parts, in
                    like manner as the parallels on the sphere łre divided, he supposed curved lines
                    to be drawn through the corresponding points of division, and these curve lines
                    represent the meridians. Flamsteed employed this projection in representing the
                    position of the stars; but it is also made use of in geography, particularly for
                    the delineation of countries which extend on both sides of the equator.</p>
                <p>To suit it more effectually to this purpose, it has undergone, however, a
                    modification of very considerable importance, as it corrects in some measure the
                    distortion in the figure of countries lying near the extremities of the map,
                    which arises from the obliquity of the curve lines representing the meridians to
                    the straight lines representing the parallels of latitude, which increases as
                    the former recede from the centre of the map. On the globe the meridians cut all
                    the parallels of latitude at right angles; and by employing concentric circles
                    instead of straight lines, as in Flamsteed’s projection, to represent the
                    parallels of latitude, the curves representing the meridians on the map may be
                    made more nearly to fulfil this condition. For this purpose the common centre of
                    the circles, which is situated in a straight line drawn through the middle of
                    the map as an axis, is so assumed that the radius of the middle parallel of
                    latitude is equal to the cotangent of the middle latitude; an assumption which
                    diminishes as much as possible the obliquity of the angles made at the
                    intersections of the curves which represent the meridians, with the circles
                    which represent the parallels. In the position of the common centre of the
                    circles representing the parallels of latitude, this modified projection of
                    Flamsteed coincides with the ordinary conical projection.</p>
                <p>We shall exemplify this construction by showing how to describe, according to it,
                    the parallels and meridians for a map of Europe.</p>
                <p>Let the map be supposed to extend from 35° to 70∙ north latitude. Hence the
                    middle latitude will be 52° 30 ’, and the radius of the middle parallel of∙the
                    map (being equal to 3437'∙7 × cot. 52’ 30 ’) will be equal to 3637'∙8.</p>
                <p>Draw, then, any line LE (Plate CCLXI. fig. 7) for the axis of the map; and
                    assuming any point C for the point of intersection of the axis with the parallel
                    of middle latitude, set off the length of the radius of that parallel from C to
                    L, taken from any convenient scale of equal parts, which is to be considered as
                    a scale of minutes of a degree. Thus the point L, the common centre of the
                    circles representing the parallels, is determined.</p>
                <p>Let us now suppose that a parallel is to be drawn through every tenth degree of
                    latitude; that is, through 40°, 50°, 60°, 70°. As the middle latitude exceeds
                    50° by 150 minutes, take 150' from the scale of equal parts, and set it off from
                    C to 50. Again, take 600, which are equal to 10°, from the scale of equal parts,
                    and set off that distance from 50 to 40, from 50 to 60, and from 60 to 70. The
                    point E, corresponding to 35°, is found by setting off 800 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> from the point 40. If we were to proceed according to
                    Flamsteed’s method, as originally employed by him, it would be necessary to draw
                    straight lines through the points E, 40, 50, &amp;c. perpendicular to DE, and
                    therefore parallel to each other, and to make these lines equal respectively to
                    the portions of the parallels on the sphere which they represent; then, dividing
                    each line on both sides of the axis into as many equal parts as are indicated by
                    the number of meridians intended to be drawn on each side of the axis, through
                    the extremities and corresponding points of division to trace curve lines to
                    represent the meridians. In this case the point L would not be required. But in
                    the modification of the method which we are now exemplifying, from the point L
                    as a centre an arch of a circle is to be described through each of the points E,
                    40, 50, &amp;c. and each of these arches of longitude is to be made equal to the
                    arch of the parallel on the sphere which it represents. Let us then fix upon
                    some meridian of a given number of degrees of longitude to the eastward and
                    westward of that represented by the line DE, which is to be so drawn as to
                    fulfil this condition. Let AB and <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> be the meridians
                    assumed, the former 30° to the westward, and the latter 30° to the eastward, of
                    DE.</p>
                <p>The arch BE or iE is equal in length to an arch of 30° on the parallel of
                    latitude 35°. Now, the latter arch may be determined in geographical miles or
                    minutes of the meridian by means of the table (page 405), showing the length of
                    a degree of longitude for every degree of latitude in geographical miles. Thus,
                    30° on the parallel of 35° latitude is found equal to 1474∙ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> ∙5. But the arch BE is of the same length. Therefore
                    we have BE or iE = 1474'∙5.</p>
                <p>We might next find the angle which the arch BE subtends at the centre L, and thus
                    determine the points B and <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> But it is more convenient
                    to find the chord of the arch, which may be easily done as follows:</p>
                <p>Put <hi rend="italic">a</hi> for any arch of a circle whose radius is r. Then α
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> sin. <hi rend="italic">a = a</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> — nearly, if the arch is not very great.</p>
                <p>In this expression put <hi rend="italic">įa</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> and it becomes sin. ⅜α - ∣ <hi rend="subscript"> β</hi> _ nearly.</p>
                <p>Doubling both sides of this equation, and observing that 2 sin. įa ~ chord of <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> we obtain chord of <hi rend="italic">a = a</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> nearly. 24r <hi rend="superscript">! j</hi></p>
                <p>For arches not exceeding 30°, this formula will give the length of the chord with
                    sufficient exactness. Let us apply it to find the chord of the arch BE.</p>
                <p>Here <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = 1474 ’ ∙5, and <hi rend="italic">r</hi> = LE =

                    =8∙513745</p>
                <p>Hence the chord of the arch BE is 1464 ’ ∙7 of the meridian. Taking this number
                    from the scale of equal parts, and setting it off from E towards B and <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> the points B and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> are
                    determined.</p>
                <p>Proceeding in the same manner, we may find the arches of 30° of longitude, with
                    their chords, on the other parallels of latitude; and thence determine the
                    remaining points through which each of the projected meridians AB, <hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi> passes. The curves drawn through these points will be the
                    representations of the two meridians which have 30° of longitude to east and
                    west of the meridian represented by DE.</p>
                <p>The points in which the projections of the intermediate meridians intersect the
                    projected parallels, may be found by dividing each parallel into thirty equal
                    parts from the axis, both towards the right and left; then, by tracing curves
                    through the proper corresponding points of division, as many meridians may be
                    represented as are judged to be necessary. If the map is to extend farther than
                    30° on each side of its middle meridian, the division of the parallels may be
                    extended to the necessary distance beyond the meridians AB and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab.</hi></p>
                <p>It is a consequence of the properties of this projection, that distances on the
                    map may be readily and accurately measured by a scale of equal parts. This scale
                    may be constructed as follows:</p>
                <p>Draw a straight line AB (Plate CCLXI. fig. 8) equal to any assumed number of
                    degrees of latitude. If we assume 35 degrees, AB will be equal to DE. From B
                    draw an indefinite line BC, making with AB any angle. Then, since AB is equal to
                    35°, or to 2417 English miles nearly, take 2417∙from any convenient scale of
                    equal parts, and set that distance off from B towards C, making BD equal to
                    2417. From the same scale of equal parts take 100, or 200, &amp;c. (in the
                    present instance we shall take 500), according to the number of miles which each
                    of the divisions of the scale is intended to represent; and with this distance
                    in the compasses set off from B towards C the divisions Bm, <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn, np,pq∙,</hi> the remaining part çD, being only 417, will not again contain
                    it. Join AD; and through the points of division <hi rend="italic">m, n, p,
                    q,</hi> draw straight lines parallel to AD, and intersecting AB. Each of the
                    divisions of AB thus found will represent 500 miles, with the exception of that
                    adjacent to A, which will correspond to 417 miles. The distance of two places of
                    the map applied to this scale will give the distance in English miles.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Development of the Curve Surface of a Cylinder.</hi></p>
                <p>The principle of this development is analogous to that of the conical, and may be
                    illustrated in a similar manner. Let the arch AB (Plate CCLXI. fig. 9) be a
                    fourth part of a meridian, and draw the lines AC, BC to the centre; these lines
                    will be at right angles to each other, so that if we suppose BC to represent the
                    semiaxis of the sphere, then AC will be the radius of the equator. Let EF be any
                    arch of the meridian, and let it be bisected in G. Through G draw DH
                    perpendicular to AC, or parallel to BC. If the plane figure BDGAC be supposed to
                    revolve round BC as an axis, the arch AB will describe one half the surface of
                    the sphere, the line DH will describe the surface of a right cylinder, the point
                    A will describe the equator, and the points E, F, G, will describe parallels of
                    latitude. If EF be a small arch, the zone of the sphere which it describes will
                    nearly coincide with the corresponding zone of the cylinder. Any tract of
                    country delineated upon the former may, therefore, be nearly represented upon
                    the latter; and the cylinder being developed, the meridians will be represented
                    by parallel and equidistant straight lines, as will also the parallels of
                    latitude; the lines representing the former being at the same time at right
                    angles to the lines representing the latter. Let EF/è be a portion of the zone
                    described by EF comprehended between two meridians of which the difference of
                    longitude is equal to the difference of latitude of the parallels described by
                    the points E and F. The breadth of the map representing this portion will be
                    equal to the arch <hi rend="italic">Gg</hi> of the middle parallel of latitude.
                    But since the difference of latitude and difference of longitude are supposed
                    equal, the arch <hi rend="italic">Gg</hi> is the same part of the middle
                    parallel that EF is of the meridian. Hence we have rad.: cos. mid. lat.:: EF:
                    <hi rend="italic">Gg</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> so that <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gg</hi> may be found in minutes of the meridian. Upon this principle depends
                    the construction of the plane chart, which is said to have been invented by
                    Henry, son of John king of Portugal.</p>
                <p>As an example, let it be required to construct a plane chart extending from 30°
                    to 50° north latitude, and from 5° to 25° west longitude. Here the difference of
                    latitude and difference of longitude are each equal to 20°, and the middle
                    latitude is 40°. Hence we have EF, the length of the chart, equal to 1200 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>, and the breadth of it equal to 919 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> ∙25. Construct a parallelogram EF∕e (Plate CCLXI.
                    fig. 10), of which the sides EF, F <hi rend="italic">f</hi> are respectively
                    equal to 1200 and 919∙25 taken from any the same scale of equal parts, which is
                    to be considered as a scale of minutes of the meridian. Divide EF and F/'each
                    into four equal parts, and through the points of division draw straight lines
                    parallel to F/’and EF, and these lines will represent the parallels of latitude
                    and meridians for every fifth degree of latitude and longitude. If it is
                    required that the chart should extend to a greater number of degrees of
                    longitude east or west, the parallels of latitude may be produced, and
                    additional meridians drawn on the left of EF, or on the right ofe∕l</p>
                <p>The plane chart has nothing to recommend it but its simplicity. The degree of
                    longitude bears to the degree of latitude its proper proportion only at the
                    middle parallel of latitude, where the sphere and the cylinder are supposed to
                    intersect each other. Hence the rhumbs, as shown by this chart, are altogether
                    erroneous, except when the places between which the rhumb is drawn are very near
                    the equator.</p>
                <p>The utter inadequacy of the plane chart to serve the purposes of navigation,
                    induced ingenious men to turn their thoughts to the problem of constructing a
                    chart in which the rhumbs should be straight lines, and at the same time the
                    bearings of places accurately represented.* The first condition of the problem
                    is satisfied in the cylindrical development which we have already explained,
                    since in it the meridians are represented by parallel straight lines; so that
                    the line that makes equal angles with them all must be a straight line. We are
                    now to consider by what modification of this development the other condition may
                    be satisfied. This can be accomplished in no other way than by preserving at
                    every point on the map the ratio of the degree of longitude to the degree of
                    latitude, the same as it is at the corresponding point of the globe. Let us
                    suppose then that a cylinder is constituted on the equator as a base, and has
                    its axis coincident with that of the globe. Let us suppose further that the
                    globe, with its usual delineations upon it, is expanded as if it were inflated,
                    so as to meet the cylinder, all its parts stretching in such a manner as that
                    the meridians lengthen in the same proportion as the parallels do, until every
                    part of its surface touches the concave surface of the cylinder; then will each
                    parallel have the same diameter as the equator, and the meridianswill <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193519427" xml:id="kp-eb0710-9427-0420"/> be straight lines
                    parallel to each other; but from the equator towards each pole they will be
                    gradually increased in length at each point, so as to preserve the exact
                    proportion between the degree of the meridian and the degree of longitude on the
                    parallel which passes through that point.</p>
                <p>If the cylinder be now spread out on a plane surface, it will present a chart
                    having the important properties required; the rhumbs will be represented by
                    straight lines, and the bearings of places will be accurately shown.</p>
                <p>Such is the principle of <hi rend="italic">Wright's,</hi> or, as it is usually
                    called, <hi rend="italic">Mercators chart.</hi> A chart of this description was
                    first published by Gerard Mercator in the year 1556. It is not known on what
                    principle he proceeded in constructing it; but it is certain that the true
                    principles of the construction were unknown to him, for these were first found
                    by Edward Wright of Caius College, in Cambridge.</p>
                <p>It remains to inquire how the lengthened meridians are to be determined so that
                    the chart may be constructed. This problem can be accurately resolved only by
                    the assistance of the fluxional calculus (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Fluxions).</hi> But we may approximate to the solution by reasoning as
                    follows:</p>
                <p>Let AB (Plate CCLXI. fig. 11) be a quadrant of the meridian; draw AC, BC, to the
                    centre; and let BC represent the semi-axis; then AC will be the radius of the
                    equator; and if any point D be taken in the quadrant AB, the arch AD will be the
                    latitude of the point D. Draw AG, CG, the tangent and secant of the arch AD, and
                    DE, DF, its sine and cosine. The increase which the arch AD acquires in being
                    transferred from the sphere to the cylinder is made at every individual point of
                    the arch, so that the whole augmentation is the sum of these indefinitely small
                    increments. Let us suppose, then, that AD is divided into a number of small
                    portions, for example, into minutes. Since similar arches of circles are to one
                    another as their radii, and the radius of any parallel is the cosine of the
                    latitude of that parallel to the radius of the sphere, if we put L for any
                    latitude, we have rad.: cos. L:: l’ of the meridian: 1' on the parallel whose
                    latitude is L. But from the similar triangles GAC, CED, it is evident that CD:
                    CE:: CG: CA; that is, for any latitude L, rad.: cos. L:: sec. L: rad. Therefore
                    we have, sec. L: rad.:: l’of the merid.: 1' on the parallel whose latitude is L;
                    and this applies alike to every minute of which the arch AD is made up. Let us
                    now suppose a minute on any one parallel to become equal to a minute on the
                    equator, or to a minute of the meridian, by the parallel being brought into
                    coincidence with the surface of the cylinder, in consequence of the expansion of
                    the spherical surface. The minute on the meridian undergoes a corresponding
                    increase. Let <hi rend="italic">d</hi> denote it in its lengthened state; then,
                    taking for granted that the increase on each minute of the meridian depends
                    entirely on that of the higher of the two parallels which pass through its
                    extremities, we obtain sec. L: rad.:: <hi rend="italic">d</hi>: 1' of equator,
                    or 1' of meridian;</p>
                <p>, , sec. L × 1' of mer.</p>
                <p>hence <hi rend="italic">d =</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 3</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">.</hi> rad.</p>
                <p>Let 1' of the meridian be now assumed as the radius; then <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> = sec. L to the radius 1' of the meridian; or, since secants to
                    different radii are proportional to one another, and we only require
                    proportional quantities, we have simply <hi rend="italic">d</hi> = sec. L.</p>
                <p>Thus the increased minute on the chart for each successive minute of which the
                    arch AD on the sphere is made up, is proportional to the secant of the latitude
                    of the higher of the two parallels which pass through the extremities of that
                    minute. Let <hi rend="italic">m</hi> denote the number of minutes in the arch
                    AD, and take L = 1', 2 ’, 3', &amp;c <hi rend="italic">m</hi> ’ successively;
                    and we obtain for the lengthened meridian corresponding to AD, sec. I' + sec. 2
                    ’ + sec. 3' +, &amp;c + sec. <hi rend="italic">m</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic"
                    >.</hi></p>
                <p>If, instead of dividing AD into minutes, we had divided it into smaller portions,
                    the approximation would have been so much the nearer to the truth. Upon this
                    principle a table of the lengthened meridians corresponding to every degree and
                    minute of latitude, called a table of <hi rend="italic">meridional parts,</hi>
                    is calculated; and by means of such a table Mercator’s chart is easily
                    constructed. The following table shows the length of the enlarged meridian for
                    every fifth degree of latitude:</p>

                <p>The approximate numbers obtained in the manner now pointed out are suíficiently
                    correct for all nautical purposes, and indeed might be carried to any degree of
                    accuracy. From the more rigorous investigation afforded by the fluxional
                    calculus, it is found that the enlarged meridian is proportionally equal to the
                    logarithmic tangent of an arch found by adding to 45° half the arch of latitude
                    reckoned from the equator. Thus, the meridional parts corresponding to 40° of
                    latitude are equal to the logarithmic tangent of (45° + 20°) = log. tan. 65° =
                    33133; and the meridional parts corresponding to 50° are equal to log. tan. (45°
                    + 25°) = log. tan. 70° ≡ 43389. These two numbers will be found to be nearly
                    proportional to the numbers set down in the above table as denoting the
                    meridional parts corresponding to 40° and 50°.</p>
                <p>To construct Mercator’s chart: Draw two straight lines WE, NS (Plate CCLXI. fig.
                    12), cutting each other at right angles in the point C. Of these lines, WE is to
                    represent the equator, and NS the meridian passing through the middle of the
                    chart. From any convenient scale of equal parts set off equal parts on the
                    equator both ways from C. These divisions are to represent degrees of longitude;
                    and if the size of the chart will admit, each should be subdivided into minutes.
                    Assuming the equator as a scale of minutes, set off from C towards the north and
                    south on the middle meridian the number of minutes in the enlarged meridian,
                    corresponding to each degree of latitude, as shown by a table of meridional
                    parts. Draw straight lines through every fifth or every tenth degree of the
                    equator and divided meridian, and at right angles to them. The lines at right
                    angles to the equator will be the meridians; and those at right angles to the
                    divided meridian, and therefore parallel to the equator, will be parallels of
                    latitude. Any one of the meridians may be assumed as the first meridian.</p>
                <p>To find the bearing of any one place from another, it is only necessary to draw a
                    straight line from the one to the other, and to observe the angle which that
                    line makes with the meridians: that angle is the bearing required, or the <hi

                    to the other. Thue, if L be the Lizard Point on the chart, and M the east end of
                    the island of Madeira, draw LK parallel to NS, and the angle KLM will be the
                    course to be steered from the Lizard to reach Madeira. The distance of the
                    places may be found by considering that it is the hypotenuse of a right-angled
                    triangle of which the <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> difference of latitude (not
                    the meridional difference) is one side, and the course the adjacent angle.</p>
                <p>Plate CCLXIΠ. is a chart of the world according to Mercator’s projection. The
                    great elongation of the degrees of latitude as we advance northward and
                    southward, renders this projection very defective, in as far as the figure and
                    the relative magnitudes of places are concerned. But this is a purpose which it
                    was not intended to serve. It does answer perfectly the purposes for which it
                    was originally constructed, and has supplied what before its invention was a
                    desideratum in geography.</p>

                    conveyed, will be best learned from the actual examination of good maps, both
                    general and particular. Various problems might be proposed to be resolved by
                    maps; but these the intelligent student of geography will find no difficulty,
                    either in proposing to himself or resolving.</p>
                <p>Descriptive Geography being a branch of knowledge which is continually changing
                    by the progress of discovery and political revolution, the latest works on the
                    subject will of course supersede those which have gone before. Hence it has
                    happened that the geographical works of Echard, Gordon, Salmon, and Guthrie are
                    now of little value, unless for showing, by comparison with later works, the
                    changes which have taken place. Amongst modern works we may mention Playfair,
                    Pinkerton, and particularly Murray’s Encyclopaedia of Geography (the latest), in
                    the English language. In the French language there are General Treatises by
                    Mentelle and Malte-Brun, of which last there is an excellent English
                    translation. In the German language we may mention Die Erdkunde, or, Allgemeine
                    Vergleichende Geographie, von Carl Ritter; an elaborate and valuable, but most
                    voluminous work, published in Berlin, of which the first volume, on Africa,
                    appeared in 1822, and the second, third, and fourth, on Asia, at subsequent
                    periods, down to this present year (1834). Apparently it will extend to ten or
                    twelve volumes of 1000 or 1200 pages each, octavo.</p>
                <p>On the general construction of maps there is a treatise by Jamieson. This is in a
                    popular style. Full information relating to the construction of maps of every
                    kind, and even to the details of engraving and lettering, may be found in
                    Mémorial Topographique et Militaire. This work, in six numbers, was composed at
                    the general depot of war, in the time of Bonaparte, by order of the minister.
                    Mathematical disquisitions on the construction of maps have been given by
                    Delahire, Mém. de l’Acad. des Sciences, 1701; Euler, Acta Acad. Petropolitanae,
                    vol. i. of first part; Lorgna, Principi de Geografia, 1789; Cassini, Acad, des
                    Sciences, 1745; Clairaut, idem, 1733; Lagrange, Acad, de Berlin, 1779. There is
                    a valuable Mémoire sur la Projection des Cartes Géographiques, 1810, by Henry,
                    given as a sequel to Memorial Topographique. The subject is also fully treated
                    by Puissant, in Traite de Topographie, &amp;c. 1807. As to maps, what has been
                    said of books will apply to them; the latest are likely to be the best. Those of
                    Arrowsmith, Faden, Carey, Hall, and Gardiner, are deserving of full
                    confidence.</p>
                <p>The best globes we know are those by Carey and Gardiner. We particularly
                    recommend the large terrestrial globe of this last artist, as the finest we have
                    ever seen.</p>
