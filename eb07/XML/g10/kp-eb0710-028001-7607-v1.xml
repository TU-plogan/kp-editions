                <p><label type="entry">G</label>, THE seventh letter and fifth consonant of our
                    al-ŋî phabet, though in the alphabets of all the oriental languages, the Hebrew,
                    Phoenician, Chaldee, Syriac, Samaritan, Arabic, and even Greek, G is the third
                    letter. The Hebrews call it <hi rend="italic">ghimel</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >gimel,</hi> a camel, by reason of its supposed resemblance to the hump on the
                    back of that animal; and it bears the same appellation in the Samaritan,
                    Phoenician, and Chaldee; in the Syriac it is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >gamel,</hi> in Arabic <hi rend="italic">giim,</hi> and in Greek <hi
                    rend="italic">gamma.</hi> The gamma, Γ, of the Greeks is manifestly the ghimel,
                    j, of the Hebrews or Samaritans; the difference between the gamma and ghimel
                    consisting in this, that the one is turned to the right and the other to the
                    left, according to the different manners of writing and reading which obtained
                    amongst these different nations. From the Greeks the Latins borrowed their form
                    of this letter; the Latin G being certainly a corruption of the Greek gamma, Γ,
                    as might be easily shown, if our printers had all the characters and forms of
                    this letter to be met with in the Greek and Latin manuscripts, through which the
                    latter passed from Γ to G. Diomedes (lib. ii. cap. <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Litera)</hi> calls G a new letter. His reason is, that the Romans
                    had not introduced it before the first Punic war, as appears from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Columna Rostrata</hi> erected by Duilius, in which C is everywhere
                    found instead of G. It was Sp. Carvilius who, as we leam from Terentius Scaurus,
                    first distinguished between these two letters, and invented the figure of the
                    G.</p>
                <p>The G, however, is found instead of C on several medals (Vaillant, <hi
                    rend="italic">Num.</hi><hi rend="italic">Imperat.</hi> tom. i. p. 39); and Beger
                    produces a medal of the <hi rend="italic">Familia Ogulnia,</hi> where we find
                    <hi rend="italic">Gar</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">Car,</hi> which is the
                    reading on those of Palin. But the C is more frequently seen on medals instead
                    ofG, as <hi rend="italic">Aucustalis, Calloecia, Cartacinensis, &amp;c.</hi>;
                    not that the pronunciation of these words was altered, but only that the G was
                    unskilfully or negligently cut by the workmen; as may be seen in different
                    inscriptions of the eastern empire, where <hi rend="smallcaps">avc</hi> is
                    frequently found for <hi rend="smallcaps">aug,</hi> and so in other cases. The
                    northern nations frequently changed the G into V or W, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gallus, Wallus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">Gallia,
                    Wallia,</hi><hi rend="italic">Vallia,</hi> &amp;c. But it must not be supposed
                    that the French have changed the W into G; because they wrote <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gallus</hi> long before <hi rend="italic">Wallus</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >ĩVallia</hi> was known, as appears from all the ancient Greek and Roman
                    writers. And yet it is equally true that the French change the W of the northern
                    nations, and V consonant, into G; as <hi rend="italic">Willielmus,</hi> William,
                    into <hi rend="italic">Guillaume</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Wulphilas</hi> into <hi rend="italic">Gul-philas</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">Vascon</hi> into <hi rend="italic">Gascon,</hi> and so
                    in other cases.</p>
                <p>The letter G is a mute, and cannot be any way sounded without the help of a
                    vowel. It is formed by the reflection of the air against the palate by the
                    tongue, as the air passes out of the throat, or, as Martianus Capella expresses
                    it, G <hi rend="italic">spiritus</hi><hi rend="italic">cum palaio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> so that G is a palatal letter. The modern G takes its form
                    from that of the Latins. In English it has two sounds; one from the Greek Γ,
                    which is called that of the hard G, because it is formed by a pressure somewhat
                    hard of part of the tongue against the upper gum, a sound which it retains
                    before <hi rend="italic">a, a, u, I, r</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the
                    other, called that of the soft G, resembles that of <hi rend="italic">j,</hi>
                    and is commonly, though not always, found before <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and í,
                    as in <hi rend="italic">gesture, giant,</hi> whilst at the end of a word it is
                    always hard. To this rule, however, there are many exceptions. G is often hard
                    before », as <hi rend="italic">give,</hi> &amp;c. and sometimes before e, as <hi
                    rend="italic">get, &amp;c.</hi> It is also hard in derivatives from words ending
                    in <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">singing, stronger,</hi>
                    &amp;c. and generally before <hi rend="italic">er</hi> at the ends of words, as
                    <hi rend="italic">finger.</hi> G is mute before <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> as <hi
                    rend="italic">gnash, sign.</hi> GA has the sound of the hard G in the beginning
                    of a word, as <hi rend="italic">ghostly</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in the
                    middle, and sometimes at the end, it is quite silent, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >right, though.</hi> At the end of a word <hi rend="italic">Gh</hi> has often
                    the sound of/ as <hi rend="italic">laugh, rough, tough.</hi></p>
                <p>As a numeral, G was anciently used to denote 400; and with a dash over it thus,
                    Ğ, 40,000. As an abbreviature, G. stands for <hi rend="italic">Gaius,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gellius,</hi><hi rend="italic">gens, genius,</hi> &amp;c. G. G.
                    for <hi rend="italic">gemina, gessit, gesserunt,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sec.</hi>
                    G. C. for <hi rend="italic">genio civitatis</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Casaris.</hi> G. L. for <hi rend="italic">Gaius</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >libertus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">genius loci.</hi> G. V. S. for <hi
                    rend="italic">genio urbis sacrum;</hi> G. B. for <hi rend="italic">genio
                    bono;</hi> and G. T. for <hi rend="italic">genio tutelari.</hi> In music, G is
                    the character or mark of the treble cleff; and from its being placed at the
                    head, or marking the first sound in Guido’s scale, the whole scale took the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">gamut.</hi></p>
