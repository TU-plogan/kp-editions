                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">GIFFORD, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>, a
                    distinguished critic, satirist, and dramatic annotator, was born at Ashburton,
                    in Devonshire, in April 1757. Although his immediate ancestors possessed
                    considerable property in their native county, and were there accounted
                    gentlemen, yet a series of indiscretions had deprived them of the greater part
                    of their substance; and when the subject of this memoir was born, his father
                    only possessed two small estates. The elder Gifford, whose roving propensities
                    had driven him to sea, and also led him “to wander in some vagabond society,” as
                    his son informs us, established himself after his marriage, as a plumber and
                    glazier, at South Molton. But his habits were unsettled and desultory; he went
                    again to sea, and once more returned without having acquired any wisdom from his
                    misfortunes; and he died at last, “of a decayed and ruined constitution, before
                    he was forty.” When this event happened, his son William had not completed his
                    thirteenth year. He had been sent to school to read, write, and cipher; but,
                    according to his own account of himself, he there made “a most wretched
                    progress.” In less than twelve months after the death of his father, his mother
                    followed her husband to the grave, and after various vicissitudes young Gifford
                    was sent on board of a coasting vessel, by the person under whose guardianship
                    he had been placed. This individual, who was his godfather, and into whose hands
                    the effects of Gifford’s parents had fallen, recalled him from his nautical
                    pursuits, principally, it would appear, on account of the outcry which the
                    people of Ashburton raised against him for the manner in which he had treated
                    his young charge. Gifford was now sent to school, where he made great progress,
                    especially in arithmetic; but from this he was in a short time withdrawn, and
                    apprenticed to a shoemaker. He was now in his fifteenth year, and he was
                    articled to serve until he was twenty-one. But he thoroughly listed his new
                    profession, and whenever leisure afforded him opportunities, he prosecuted his
                    favourite Study of mathematics. Few facilities for study fell to his lot, but
                    his ingenuity supplied the deficiency; and the means which he adopted of
                    improving himself as well as the irrepressible perseverance which he displayed,
                    affords a striking instance of the force of genius in compensating and
                    overcoming the disadvantages of untoward circumstances. He also began to write
                    verses, though not at this Įieriod for amusement, but only when he wanted money
                    for his mathematical pursuits. But his devotedness to his studies seems to have
                    rendered him indifferent to the concerns of his master, whose indignation was
                    accordingly roused. He requested young Gifford to give up his books and papers;
                    and this being refused, he proceeded to the garret of the delinquent, which he
                    thoroughly sacked. Being now deprived of his sole means of improvement, almost
                    of enjoyment, Gifford began to display a degree of sullenness, reserve, and
                    discontent, which made him an object of dislike to his fellow-workmen. However,
                    in this humble and obscure condition, poor beyond the common lot, he attracted
                    the notice of Mr Cookesley, a surgeon of the town in which he resided. This
                    excellent individual deeply interested himself in behalf of Gifford, and set on
                    foot a subscription to purchase his freedom from the latter part of his
                    indentures, and to pay for his education; a scheme which completely succeeded.
                    Thus, by an act of generosity, which it is pleasing to record, was the humble
                    shoemaker rescued from his abject state, and placed in circumstances which
                    enabled him to gain the highest literary honours, and to sit in judgment upon
                    the most gifted men of his time.</p>
                <p>After having passed two years at school, he was pronounced fit for the
                    university; and by the active benevolence of Mr Cookesley he was enabled to
                    proceed to Oxford, where he obtained the situation of Bible reader in Exeter
                    College. Whilst at this place, he undertook a translation of Juvenal, poetry
                    having now become his delight. A subscription for publishing it was set on foot;
                    but during the progress of this undertaking his benefactor died; a circumstance
                    which ultimately, and perhaps fortunately, prevented him from publishing a
                    translation of the great Roman satirist, at least for a time. By an accidental
                    occurrence, however, he became known to Lord Grosvenor, who invited him to his
                    house. He accordingly quitted Oxford, and took up his residence with that
                    nobleman, under whose hospitable roof he prosecuted the translation of Juvenal,
                    until called upon to accompany the son of his patron to the Continent. With this
                    young nobleman he spent, in two successive tows, many years, “of which,” he says
                    in his autobiography, “the remembrance will always be dear.” Although Mr Gifford
                    was principally engaged upon his translation of Juvenal, its publication was
                    preceded by several other productions, by which at the time he obtained great
                    popularity. The first was the <hi rend="italic">Bavaid,</hi> a paraphrase on the
                    first satire of Persius. This production appeared in 1794, and was levelled at a
                    class of poetasters who deluged the daily prints of the time with their weak and
                    effeminate lucubrations, which were likewise deformed by the most fulsome
                    adulation of each other. The satire had the effect of completely extinguishing
                    this tuneless tribe. Mr Gifford’s next production, which appeared the following
                    year, was entitled the <hi rend="italic">Maviad</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> an
                    imitation of Horace, and directed against the corruptions of the drama. This
                    work was only partially successful, for the malady which it was intended to cure
                    had its seat in public manners rather than in the affectation of individuals. In
                    both of these works Mr Gifford displays the most caustic severity and
                    personality; and it has been questioned whether the harmless generation of
                    ephemeral songsters and dramatists deserved the abuse with which they were
                    assailed. In 1800 he published his <hi rend="italic">Epistle to Peter
                    Pindar,</hi> an attack which brought him little else but disquietude; the
                    laughter of the one satirist being quite as formidable as the gall of the other.
                    About this period Mr Gifford became connected with a set of men of wit and
                    genius, at the head of whom was Mr Canning, who resolved upon establishing a
                    weekly paper for the purpose of exposing to ridicule the political agitators of
                    the time. This print was called the <hi rend="italic">Anti-Jacobin,</hi> and Mr
                    Gifford became its editor. The ministerial connection thus formed was of some
                    use to him, as by it he obtained tl&gt;e paymastership of the band of gentlemen
                    pensioners; and at a subsequent period he was made a double commissioner of the
                    lottery. In 1802 appeared his English version of Juvenal, a work which may be
                    said to have engrossed the greater part of his life. It was ushered into the
                    world with every possible advantage, headed by a dedication to Earl Grosvenor,
                    and with the translator’s autobiography prefixed to it. The translation is able
                    and spirited, although it is occasionally diβiise and unharmonious, and not
                    unfrequently coarse in its diction. In 1805 Mr Gifford published an edition of
                    the Plays of Massinger in four volumes; and in 1816 the Works of Ben Johnson, in
                    nine volumes. In his annotations upon both these dramatic poets he displays
                    great acuteness and industry; but in exposing the blunders of previous
                    commentators, he shows not a little of his characteristic accrbity. In 1821 he
                    published a version of Persius; and since his death his editions of the dramatic
                    works of Ford and Shirley have been given to the world, accompanied with able
                    and acute notes.</p>
                <p>It was, however, as editor of the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> that Mr
                    Gifford became most generally known. The success of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edinburgh Review,</hi> in advocating liberal principles in politics, suggested
                    to the opposite party the idea of a counterpoise in the shape of the journal
                    above named, which was accordingly carried into effect in 1809, and Mr Gifford
                    entrusted with its management. The scheme completely succeeded; and it is
                    allowed by all parties, that as <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520701"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-0701-0518"/>editor of this distinguished journal, Mr Gifford
                    displayed uncommon skill and ability. No man possessed a finer tact in
                    discerning the weak and bad points of an author, when his object was to turn him
                    into ridicule; none could hold them up to laughter with more felicitous
                    acrimony. From the time of his taking the charge of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quarterly Review</hi> until his death, few circumstances of any moment occurred
                    in the life of Mr Gifford, except the publication of the works already
                    mentioned. He continued the editorship until about two years before his death,
                    which took place on the 31st of December 1826.</p>
                <p>From the prominent position which Mr Gilford occupied in the literary world, his
                    character has been the subject of severe animadversion by one party, and of
                    exaggerated eulogy by another. Of his great talents there can be no doubt. His
                    sagacity and quickness of apprehension were striking, and the rapidity with
                    which he acquired knowledge is proved by his having prepared himself for the
                    university after being only two years at school. His wit was distinguished for
                    caustic severity rather than for brilliancy, and he dealt more in invective than
                    in polished repartee. As a poet he cannot be said to rank very high; but that he
                    had a keen perception of the beauties of the noblest inspirations of the muse,
                    and could point them out with great felicity, provided political feelings did
                    not intervene to pervert his judgment, is proved by his many admirable
                    criticisms, and by the confidence which Lord Byron and others reposed in his
                    opinions. In private life Mr Gifford was modest and unassuming; and amongst the
                    numerous parties, poetical, political, or religious, who occasionally suffered
                    by his castigations, none of them ever ventured to recriminate by attacking the
                    moral character of the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review.</hi>
                    The memoir of himself, which he prefixed to his version of Juvenal, is one of
                    the most remarkable pieces of autobiography extant. It is written with ability
                    and manly feeling, as well as with unaffected modesty and apparent candour. (a.
