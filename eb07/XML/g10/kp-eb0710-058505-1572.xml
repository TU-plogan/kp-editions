                    western side of the kingdom. On the north-east it is bounded by Warwickshire, on
                    the north-west by Worcestershire; Oxfordshire and Berkshire bound it on the
                    east, Wilts and Somerset on the south, and Hereford and Monmouth on the west.
                    The greatest length is seventy miles, and the greatest breadth thirty-five. Its
                    area, including its rivers, is 1718 square miles, or 1,099,520 acres.</p>
                <p>The number of inhabitants at each of the four decennial censuses has been as
                    follows, viz. :—in 1801, 250,809; in 1811, 285,514; in 1821, 335,843; and in
                    1831, 386,700. In this enumeration the city of Bristol is included; for, though
                    a part of it stands within the county of Somerset, yet in each of the
                    parliamentary surveys it is considered as a part of the county of Gloucester,
                    within which division the greater portion of it is situated. The most
                    considerable places, and their population, are the following:</p>

                <p>The foreign trade of this county is considerable, and centres chiefly in Bristol.
                    Latterly, however, Gloucester has enjoyed a considerable share of it. This has
                    been chiefly owing to the completion of a broad and deep canal parallel to the
                    Severn, which admits vessels from sea to reach Gloucester. The principal trade
                    from Bristol is to the West Indies, but both places maintain intercourse with
                    America, Portugal, Spain, and other foreign territories, and import much wine,
                    Merino wool, oil, and other commodities.</p>
                <p>The internal trade of this county is, however, by far the most important. By the
                    river Severn, which passes through it, it is enabled to maintain a regular
                    intercourse with the potteries and glass manufactories of Worcestershire and
                    Staffordshire, with the salt works of Droitwich, and with those parts of
                    Warwickshire, Staffordshire, and Shropshire, which furnish the heavy iron goods
                    that would not bear the expense of land-carriage. Though the Severn is not
                    navigable except for flat-bottomed vessels, and for these only at spring tides,
                    yet the craft on that river is very considerable; and at Stourport there is a
                    connection with all the numerous canals which traverse the' centre of the
                    king<pb break="no" facs="nls:193521585" xml:id="kp-eb0710-1585-0586"/>dom.
                    Besides the river Severn, the Wye is navigable for small craft to a considerable
                    distance from its mouth, and facilitates the commercial intercourse with
                    Monmouthshire and Herefordshire.</p>
                <p>Several navigable canals have been constructed in this county with the view of
                    promoting its internal communication. The most remarkable of these is the Thames
                    and Severn Canal, which communicates with the latter river through the Stroud
                    Canal, and with the former river at the town of Lechlade. It was begun in 1783,
                    and finished in ten years. The summit-level is two hundred and forty-one feet
                    above the level of the Stroud Canal, and a hundred and thirty feet above the
                    river Thames at the place of its junction. These rises of level are surmounted
                    by locks, admirably contrived and executed; and in one place it passes under the
                    park of Lord Bathurst, through Sapperton tunnel, and, after being buried for the
                    distance of two miles and five furlongs, again emerges near Cirencester. The
                    tunnel is lined with masonry, arched above, and at the bottom has an inverted
                    arch, except in some very few places, where, passing through a solid rock, that
                    expense has been spared. The breadth of the canal is forty-two feet at the top
                    and thirty feet at the bottom, and it is constructed for barges adapted to the
                    locks upon the river Thames, as well as those of the canal. The barges are
                    twelve feet wide, from seventy to eighty feet long, and when loaded carry
                    seventy tons, and draw about four feet of water. This work has, however, been
                    more splendid than beneficial. The expense of its construction exceeded
                    L.250,000, and the tolls are scarcely more than sufficient to defray the expense
                    of the necessary repairs. In fact, it connects two rivers, the navigation of
                    which is bad; but especially that of the Thames, which, before it reaches
                    Oxford, is subject to great expense in horses to draw the barges; it has many
                    shallows where the vessels must be lightened to pass over them, and is liable to
                    frequent impediments, sometimes from a scarcity of water, and sometimes from
                    inundations. The trade which once passed through this canal has been diminished
                    by the opening of the Kennet and Avon, which forms a better medium for the
                    transit of goods from Bristol or Gloucester to London. The Hereford and
                    Gloucester Canal, designed to connect these two cities, passes near Boyce
                    through a tunnel one mile and a quarter in length, between the Severn and
                    Ledbury, to which place, a distance of seventeen miles, the rise is a hundred
                    and eighty-ţhree feet.</p>
                <p>The mineral riches of this county are almost wholly confined to iron; for, though
                    veins of lead exist at Sodbury, Deynton, and other places, they are not
                    sufficiently productive of ore to induce the working of them. Iron is abundant
                    in many parts of the county; but the principal forges are on the western side of
                    the Severn, near Lydney, in the forest of Dean, where both charcoal and coal are
                    abundantly produced. On both sides of the Severn coal is worked to a
                    considerable extent. The forest of Dean contains upwards of a hundred and twenty
                    coal pits, whence the city of Gloucester and its vicinity are supplied with that
                    necessary article. At Kingswood, near Bristol, there are considerable veins, but
                    these being at a great depth, the proprietors can scarcely compete with the
                    miners of Monmouthshire, though by many of the inhabitants of the city the coals
                    of Kingswood are preferred to those brought by water from Newport The mineral
                    springs in this county, at Clifton, at Cheltenham, at Stow-on-the-Wold, and at
                    Bourton-on-the-Water, are well known; and the two former places, as well by
                    their natural beauties as by their medicinal waters, attract considerable
                    numbers of occasional visitors, who there find all those accommodations which
                    the best watering-places can afford. No part of the kingdom produces better or
                    more abundant stone than is raised from the quarries of Gloucestershire.
                    Limestone of excellent quality extends from Cromhan south-east to Sodbury, and
                    south-west to Aust-Cliff; and the rocks of Clifton yield an excellent stone,
                    from which much lime is made, both for domestic consumption and for exportation
                    to the West Indies. Freestone is found on the Cotswold Hills, and near Lydney
                    some gritstones are raised, which are adapted by the miíl-wrights to their
                    purposes.</p>
                <p>Gloucestershire is one of the chief manufacturing counties; and though a greater
                    progress has been made of late years in the northern counties of Lancaster and
                    York, it is still very much distinguished in this particular. The woollen
                    manufacture has long been established in what are provincially called <hi
                    rend="italic">the Bottoms,</hi> a district in the valleys, between the range
                    where the Cotswold Hills, with a less elevation, assume the name of the Stroud
                    Hills. Between the ranges of these hills there are clear and rapid streams,
                    which supply the mills in which the manufactures are carried on. The principal
                    seats of the manufactures are in the thickly-peopled parishes of Bis)ey,
                    Hampton, Stroud, Painswick, Woodchester, Horsley, Stonehouse, Stanley, Uley,
                    Dursley, and Wotton-under-Edge. Almost the whole process is now performed by
                    machinery except the weaving. The dyers in this district are celebrated for
                    their scarlet, but more especially for their dark-blue colours, the excellence
                    of which is attributed to some peculiar properties in the Stroud water. The
                    greater part of the cloths of this county are dyed in the piece, not in the
                    wool. Those of the superior quality, made from Merino woo), are destined either
                    for the consumption of the kingdom or for the supply of Russia; and some few are
                    exported to America. .The inferior kinds, made of the wool of the Cotswold, the
                    Hereford, or the Southdown sheep, are mostly calculated for the markets of India
                    and China. These are sent to London white, and the agents of the East India
                    Company select such as suit their demand, which are dyed to the requisite
                    colours, and pressed and packed by their own different tradesmen in the vicinity
                    of the metropolis. Cassimeres of the best quality are also made in this district
                    to a very considerable extent.</p>
                <p>In the city of Gloucester and its vicinity there are several considerable
                    manufactories of pins, which, minute as is the article, furnish employment to
                    upwards of fifteen hundred persons. A bell foundery was established there in
                    1500, which has been continued to the present time, and is a kind of hereditary
                    occupation in a family of the name of Rudhall, who have carried it on for the
                    last hundred and fifty years, and during that period have cast several thousands
                    of bells for different churches.</p>
                <p>The vicinity of Bristol is crowded with manufactories of various kinds. The sugar
                    refinery is very considerable, and produces some of the best kinds of white
                    sugar. Glass of all kinds, for windows and for domestic purposes, is made there.
                    The copper and brass manufactures are also large establishments. Hard white soap
                    is an article of considerable importance; much is sent to London, and a large
                    quantity is exported to America and the West Indies. Hats, leather, saddlery,
                    shoes, white lead, gunpowder, earthen ware, salt, snuff, and beer, are made in
                    the city or neighbourhood of Bristol, and form the rudiments of its foreign
                    trade, as well as administer to its domestic intercourse with the western
                    counties, and with Wales.</p>
                <p>The agriculture of Gloucestershire partakes of very different characters,
                    according to the elevation of the land. On the eastern side of the county, a
                    district of 200,000 acres, extending over the Cotswold Hills, is provincially
                    distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic">stone brash land.</hi> This tract
                    of country is very undulating, but none of the summits’ rise to a great height,
                    so that the whole is cultivated. In the intervals between the ridges of hills
                    there are gene-- <pb break="no" facs="nls:193521598"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-1598-0587"/>rally beautiful rivulets, by which the inhabitants
                    are enabled so to irrigate their meadows as to produce early grass for their
                    young lambs. The hills, whatever be the surface, have uniformly a calcareous
                    basis, which admirably adapts them for the growth of sainfoin. In no part of
                    England is that valuable grass cultivated to so great an extent, or with such
                    bountiful results. It has been an article of very ancient cultivation, and in
                    this soil has the property of producing hay for twenty successive years. It
                    requires, however, great care in the first laying down, and that all other
                    grasses, as well as weeds, be eradicated; after which, as it draws its
                    nourishment from a great depth, it has little or no tendency to exhaust the soil
                    on the surface. In process of time it becomes choked by other grasses, when the
                    land is again returned to the arable state. It is the practice of the best
                    farmers to have one seventh part of their land constantly bearing sainfoin. The
                    remaining six portions of the farm are divided pretty nearly in equal
                    proportions between turnips, barley, clover or rye-grass, wheat, peas, and oats.
                    The principal dependence for producing fertility is' the large flocks of sheep
                    which are bred here, and which are usually folded as a dressing for the turnips.
                    It is a common practice to pare the soil, and burn it, that the weeds may be
                    destroyed, and that the ashes may furnish manure. The crops of barley are
                    moderately good. Wheat is sown at very early periods, sometimes in August, but
                    it seldom produces even a moderate crop if sowed later than September or early
                    in October. The average produce of that grain does not exceed sixteen bushels to
                    the acre, and it is not of the best quality. The soil is more congenial to the
                    production of peas than to any other crop, and hence they form an important
                    article of cultivation. The sheep of this district, for whose food, as the
                    enumeration of the crops shows, the principal provision is made, are of a
                    peculiar breed, without horns, the wool rather long, and not of a very fine
                    quality. They are said to be indigenous to these hills, but have of late been
                    improved by crossing with other races. The Southdown sheep have recently been
                    bred here, and are gradually acquiring a preference, as they do wherever they
                    are introduced on soils of an inferior quality. Few parts of England have been
                    more improved in cultivation within the last forty years than the Cotswold
                    Hills. They have, however, in spite of this improvement, but a cold and barren
                    appearance, owing to their being nearly destitute of trees, and to the want of
                    verdant hedges; for the fences are almost uniformly stone walls, about four feet
                    and a half in height. The farms are generally large, from three hundred to
                    twelve hundred acres; and the homesteads, as well as the cottages of the
                    labourers, being usually situated in the valleys, and therefore not in sight at
                    a distance, the face of the country has a poor and depopulated aspect. The depth
                    of the soil is scarcely more than five inches: sometimes, however, it is very
                    tenacious, but the experience of the natives has taught them, that even the most
                    clayey soils do not require frequent ploughings. At each ploughing, considerable
                    quantities of stone-rubble are brought to the surface.</p>
                <p>To the westward of the Cotswold Hills, and inclining to the northwards, the rich
                    vales of Evesham, Gloucester, and Berkley, are spread. The agricultural system
                    which is practised, though it has some variations, is generally similar, J. lie
                    vale of Evesham, a considerable part of which is in Worcestershire, is watered
                    by the river Avon, and is highly productive in corn, pasture, and fruits. On the
                    arable lands, the most general rotation is a clean fallow; then barley or oats;
                    next beans or clover; and, lastly, wheat. The wheat is generally sown in
                    November or December, the produce is commonly abundant, and the gram is of the
                    best quality. The district is well wooded. The hedge-rows are filled with elm,
                    oak, ash, and maple trees, and the apple and pear trees are abundantly scattered
                    in the fields, as well as in large orchards near the villages. Cider and perry
                    form very valuable portions of the produce of each farm. The proportion of
                    arable land is small; the rich pastures feed numerous cows; and butter and
                    cheese are the articles on which many farmers almost wholly depend.</p>
                <p>The vale of Gloucester is in the form of an arc, of which the river Severn may be
                    said to form the chord. It is protected from the cold northerly and easterly
                    winds by the Cotswold and Stroud Hills, and hence is well adapted for the growth
                    of fruit trees. Though there are now no vineyards, William of Malmesbury, in the
                    twelfth century, said that “no county in England has more numerous or richer
                    vineyards; or which yields grapes more abundantly or of better flavour, as the
                    wine is but little inferior to that of France in sweetness.” The apple and pear
                    trees of the district yield, however, most profusely, liquors which, in the
                    estimation of the inhabitants, are far preferable to any wine from foreign
                    countries. The soil of this vale is generally of a rich sandy loam, on a very
                    retentive and tenacious subsoil of clay. Fallowing is deemed indispensable on
                    all the arable lands, which are thrown in very high ridges, about eight yards in
                    breadth, with furrows between them, from twenty-four to thirty inches deep.
                    Barley, oats, clover, beans, and wheat yield most abundant crops, and of the
                    best quality. The greater part of the land is, however, in permanent pasture,
                    receiving no other manure than the feces of the cattle that are grazed on it,
                    and, in some instances, the rich sediment deposited by occasional inundations.
                    The meadows feed numberless cows, and the dairies, besides the cheese, the name
                    of which is derived from this county, furnish large quantities of butter, fatten
                    many calves, and, with the whey and buttermilk, rear and fatten great numbers of
                    swine. The swine are of a peculiarly large breed, and the market for them at
                    Gloucester is by far the most considerable in the kingdom. The fattening of them
                    does not, however, wholly depend on the dairy, but large quantities of oil-cake
                    are applied to that purpose. The cheese denominated Gloucester has long enjoyed
                    great celebrity both at home and abroad. It is usually made in the summer
                    months, from May to October inclusive. The number of cows belonging to
                    individuals seldom exceeds from thirty to forty. The uniformity of the quality
                    is such that the factors, who are the middlemen, contract for the whole produce
                    of the dairies without examining it, knowing the value of the cheese from the
                    quality of the land on which the cows are pastured.</p>
                <p>The vale of Berkley is separated from that of Gloucester by a natural
                    intersection, and, like it, is bounded to the westward by the river Severn. Its
                    surface is more irregular, but though the undulations are numerous, they are not
                    excessive. The hills are covered with beech trees, and the face of the district
                    is both rich and picturesque. The soil is uniformly fertile in a very
                    extraordinary degree. Nearly the whole is rich pasture or orchard, and the
                    arable land does not form one seventh part of the valley. The soil is a rich fat
                    loam, occasionally mixed with a prolific clay, and generally resting on a
                    retentive subsoil. The dairy farms are of smaller extent than in the adjoining
                    vale, but they far excel them in the proportional quantity of the cheese which
                    they yield, and the quality is also much superior. The cheese commonly
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">double Gloucester</hi> is almost wholly made in
                    the vale of Berkley, and in the neighbourhood is known by that name. It is
                    usually made in the months of May, June, and July in dairies, where, later in
                    the summer, a thinner kind is manufactured. Its excellence depends upon
                    attention to its management, as well as on the quality of the land on which the
                    cattle are fed. The quantity of cheese made in this vale is about 1200 tons
                    annually, and each cow is estimated to yield 350 pounds.</p>

                <p>The western side of the Severn is principally occupied by the forest of Dean. It
                    abounds with excellent oak and beech trees, and produces abundance of cider,
                    especially one kind called Stire-cider, which is highly valued. The forest
                    formerly contained 43,000 acres, but has been diminished by several royal
                    grants; it is, however, now a most important district, on account of the large
                    ship-timber which it produces. It abounds with coal and with iron ore, and the
                    miners are regulated by peculiar courts.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable curiosities of this county are the Roman antiquities at
                    Woodchester, which have been accurately described by that indefatigable
                    antiquary Lysons; the Roman roads, which traverse it in various directions; the
                    numerous antique coins which have been frequently found in the fields; the
                    vestiges of ancient fortifications, and the ruins of monastic edifices.</p>
                <p>This county has long conferred the title of duke on various members of the royal
                    family, or in ancient times on those connected with that of the reigning prince.
                    It gives titles also to Marquis Camden, Earl of Berkley, Earl Bathurst, Lord
                    Sherborne, and Lord Segrave. For election purposes it is formed into the eastern
                    division, the polling-places of which are Gloucester, Stroud, Tewkesbury,
                    Cirencester, Camden, Northleach, and Cheltenham; and the western, the
                    polling-places of which are Wotton-under-Edge, Newent, Newenhatu, Çoleford,
                    Sodbury, Thornbury, and Dursley.</p>
                <p>Two members for each are returned to parliament from Bristol, Gloucester,
                    Cirencester, and Tewkesbury; and one for each from Cheltenham and Stroud;
                    making, with four for the county, fourteen in all. ' The seats of noblemen and
                    gentlemen are very numerous, but the most remarkable of these are Badminton, the
                    Duke of Beaufort’s; Berkley Castle, Ix&gt;rd Segrave’s; Oakley Grove, Lord
                    Bathurst’s; Sherborne, Lord Sherborne; Tolworth, Lord Ducie; King’s Weston, Lord
                    de Clifford; Hengham Court, Sir William Guise’s; Fairford, Mr Raymond Barker;
                    Whitcombe Park, Sir William Hicks; Gatcombe Park, Mr Ricardo; and Blaze Castle,
