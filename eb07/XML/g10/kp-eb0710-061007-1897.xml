                <p><label type="entry">GOOD HOPE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Cape of</hi></label>, a
                    district of country in the southern portion of Africa, in the possession of
                    Great Britain. In the distribution of land and water, this cape occupies a
                    conspicuous place on the map of the globe. It separates the Indian Ocean from
                    the Atlantic, and divides the voyage to Hindustan into two nearly equal
                    portions. To double this Cape, and bear across the ocean to the golden shores of
                    India, was an object of ambition to the early Portuguese navigators. It was
                    first descried, in 1493, by Diaz, who commanded a Portuguese squadron. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Gama.)</hi> The tempestuous nature of the sea, however, caused
                    by the conflict of contending oceans running in opposite directions, compelled
                    the navigator to return. By him the newly discovered land was called the Cape of
                    Tempests; but the king of Portugal gave it the more auspicious name which it
                    still bears. The formidable barrier, however, was not passed until 1497, when
                    the celebrated Vasco de Gama, with his characteristic boldness, surmounted every
                    difficulty, and carried the Portuguese flag into the Indian Sea. The Portuguese,
                    however, found a richer spoil in the kingdoms of the East; and although they
                    frequently touched at the Cape, they did not make any permanent settlement
                    there. But the Dutch early saw the importance of forming a station at the Cape,
                    and fixed upon it as a place where their vessels might take in water and
                    provisions. But they did not, properly speaking, colonize it, until the middle
                    of the seventeenth century, when they founded Cape Town. This led to further
                    improvements, and the colony gradually assumed its present dimensions. The
                    natives were either compelled to fly beyond the mountains, or they were reduced
                    to a state of abject slavery. During the war with revolutionary France, the Cape
                    was reduced by the British in 1797, but was ceded to Holland by the peace of
                    Amiens. When the war recommenced, it again yielded to Britain, and the permanent
                    possession of it was confirmed by the congress of Vienna in 1815.</p>
                <p>This colony is bounded on the north and east by the Orange and Fish Rivers, and
                    on the west and south by the Atlantic and Southern Oceans. The country extends
                    from latitude 26. to 33. 55. 40. south. It includes the country inhabited by the
                    Hottentot race and the Boshuanas. The country, as represented upon the map, is
                    of a very irregular figure; but it has been ascertained by late measurements
                    that the Cape Colony comprehends an area of 110,256^ square miles. Of this great
                    tract of territory, a very considerable proportion is a sterile waste.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193521910" xml:id="kp-eb0710-1910-0611"/>
                <p>Chains of vast and barren mountains enclose level plains composed of a hard
                    surface of clay, thinly sprinkled over with sand, and producing straggling tufts
                    of stunted shrubs. The mountains generally extend in the direction of east and
                    west, but there are exceptions to this rule.</p>
                <p>The first great chain of mountains, which runs east and west, is called Lange
                    Kloof or Long Pass. Between it and the southern coast there lies an irregular
                    belt of land from twenty to sixty miles in width. It is indented by several
                    bays, and, possessing a good soil and a more mild and equable temperature than
                    the interior parts of the colony, it is well clothed with vegetation, and is in
                    many parts wooded with forest trees. The next great chain is the Swartebergen,
                    or Black Mountains. It is more lofty and rugged than the first, and in many
                    places consists of double, and sometimes treble ranges of hills. Between it and
                    the first chain there lies a belt which is about the mean width of that between
                    the first and the sea. Its surface is very various, being composed in some parts
                    of barren hills; in others of arid tracts of clay land called karroo; and in
                    some places of fertile land. This belt lies higher than the first; but the
                    temperature is less uniform, and altogether it is not so valuable as the other.
                    The third great range is the Nieuweveld Mountains, which, with the second,
                    encloses the Great Karroo,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Th· word <hi rend="italic">karroo</hi> belongs to the Hottentot language,
                    and signifie· dry or arid.</p></note> an arid plain 309 miles in length, and
                    eighty in breadth. This desert, which forms the third step or terrace of
                    Southern Africa, is greatly elevated above the second. It is destitute of
                    inhabitants, and almost of vegetation. What there is of the latter is parched
                    and shrivelled by the heat of the sun, and from the want of moisture. On the
                    western coast are also elevated chains of mountains. To the northward the
                    country is more barren and sandy than towards the eastward. Sandstone resting
                    upon a base of granite composes all the continuous chains of mountains in
                    Southern Africa. These are the most prevailing rocks; the next in frequency are
                    clayslate, and there are also greywacke, quartz rock, and dolerite. In some
                    parts the sandstone is traversed by veins of red iron ore. Dr Clarke Abel
                    mentions a vein six feet wide, and extending for upwards of a hundred feet.</p>
                <p>On the western coast there are two principal rivers, the Berg or Mountain River,
                    which falls into St Helena Bay, and the Olifant or Elephant’s River, which falls
                    into the Southern Atlantic in south latitude 31. 30. Both these rivers have
                    obstructions at their mouths, which prevent their being navigable. On the south
                    coast are several considerable rivers, one of which is the Great Fish River.</p>
                <p>All these streams are well stocked with various kinds of fish. Breede or Braad
                    River is navigable, by ships of 200 tons burden, and its mouth has been called
                    Port Beaufort. Here the exports of the district are made. The Grautz is the next
                    great river of the coast. It is a collection of waters from the Great Karroo,
                    the Black Mountains, and the maritime chain. The other streams it is unnecessary
                    to mention. Southern Africa possesses but few lakes, and of these some are salt.
                    There is also a paucity of springs; and although much rain falls in Cape
                    District, it affords comparatively few, on account of the peculiar nature and
                    relative position of the strata.</p>
                <p>Cape Colony is divided into two provinces, the eastern and western, which are
                    again subdivided into districts, arranged as under:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Western Province.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Cape District,
                    Stellenbosch, Caledon, Zwellendam, Worcester (formerly Julbach),
                    Clanwilliam.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Eastern Province.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Graaff Reynet,
                    Beaufort, Somerset, Albany, Uitenhage, George, Fredericksburg.</p>
                <p>It is to be observed that some of these districts have been united into one,
                    since the commissioners of inquiry into the state of the colony suggested the
                    propriety of dividing Cape Colony into two provinces. Although they are of
                    nearly equal superficial extent, in their physical character and productions
                    they are very unlike. The western districts produce chiefly corn and wine, and
                    the eastern are principally adapted for pasturage.</p>
                <p>Cape District is the most populous and prosperous of the whole. It consists of
                    two parts; the peninsula on which the town stands, and the slip of land
                    extending from the shore of Table Bay to the mouth of Berg River, and separated
                    from Stellenbosch and Drakenstein by the Little Salt River, Deep River, and
                    Mossel Bank River. This is about eighty miles from north to south, and
                    twenty-five from east to west; whilst the Cape Peninsula is about thirty miles
                    in length and eight in breadth. Both comprehend a surface of 3584· square miles,
                    and in 1836 had a population of 13,180, consisting of 6943 males and 6237
                    females.</p>
                <p>Cape Peninsula is distinguished for the richness and variety of its vegetable
                    productions. Some of the finest botanical specimens which now adorn the gardens
                    of Europe have been derived from this quarter of the world. In no other place do
                    the bulbous plants in particular exhibit so many beautiful varieties. Others of
                    the vegetable tribes, which are rather for ornament than use, are likewise
                    numerous and beautiful; but there is a deficiency of building timber and fire
                    wood, although forests of oak are said to exist to the east of False Bay, in
                    that part called Hottentot Land. Many European plants have been introduced, as
                    the vines of France, and the fruits of the north of Europe; and it is believed
                    that the tea of China, the coffee of Java, the cotton of India, and the tobacco
                    of America, as well as other valuable vegetable productions, might be
                    successfully cultivated at the Cape. Of metals, copper, native iron, silver, and
                    lead, are known to exist, and coal is said to have been discovered. This would
                    no doubt be an invaluable acquisition to the natural wealth of the Cape; but at
                    present the staple commodities upon which the colony depends are the produce of
                    the wine districts; grain, hides, and skins; horses, argol, aloes, and wool.
                    Perhaps silk might be made a source of colonial revenue, for here the wulberry
                    grows to perfection, and the climate is precisely adapted to the worm. With
                    regard to the zoology of the Cape of Good Hope, as there is little peculiar to
                    this part of Southern Africa, and as under the head of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Africa</hi> sufficient details are given, it is unnecessary to recapitulate
                    what will be found in that article. We shall commence our topographical
                    descriptions with the seat of government, Cape Town.</p>
                <p>Cape Town, the capital of the colony, lies at the bottom of Table Bay, about
                    thirty-two miles north from the Cape of Good Hope, and on the western side of
                    the territory to which it gives its name, in longitude 18. 21. E. and latitude
                    33. 55. 56. S. The town, as we have already mentioned, was founded by the Dutch
                    in 1650, after which it shared in the various vicissitudes which were
                    experienced by the colony. The streets are regularly laid out in straight lines,
                    crossing each other at right angles. Though unpaved, they are kept in excellent
                    order, many of them being watered by canals, and planted on each side with oaks.
                    The houses are built of brick, and faced with a stucco of lime, and they are
                    decorated with cornices and architectural devices. Each house has in front a
                    paved platform, called the stoep or step, usually eight or ten feet wide, and
                    raised from two to four feet above the level of the street. It is here that the
                    inhabitants retire to enjoy the air, or the converse of friends. The roofs have
                    only an inclination sufficient to allow the rain to run down. Although the
                    houses do not display the luxury and splendour of European mansions<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193521923" xml:id="kp-eb0710-1923-0612"/>, they are
                    nevertheless commodious and comfortable. There are three churches here, one for
                    the Reformed or Calvinistic congregation, the established church of the Dutch
                    government; one for the performance of the English service, built in 1820; and a
                    third belonging to the Lutherans, who are a numerous body. Besides these, there
                    is a meeting-house open to preachers of various denominations; and the Malays
                    have a place of worship, in which the Mahommedan service is performed. The
                    public buildings of Cape Town are, the government-house, which stands in a
                    garden surrounded with plantations; the burgher senatehouse, a large handsome
                    building, where civic business is transacted, and which stands on one side of a
                    square, where a market for vegetables is held; the commercé exchange, a building
                    which contains the court of justice, the secretary’s office, and most of the
                    principal public offices; the customhouse, and other public buildings, such as
                    are necessary in conducting the affairs of a large town. It is defended by a
                    castle of considerable strength, which commands the jetty or landing place, and
                    part of Table Bay, and completely controls the only road between the town and
                    country. Table Bay is capable of containing any number of ships; but it is
                    exposed to the westerly winds during the months of June, July, and August,
                    during which there is thrown in a heavy swell, which often proves very
                    destructive. This is the great drawback upon Cape Town, otherwise so admirably
                    adapted for a commercial station. During the prevalence of the easterly monsoon,
                    however, Table Bay is perfectly safe; whilst the cheapness of provisions, the
                    healthiness of the climate, and, above all, its position, render it an excellent
                    resting place for vessels bound to or returning from India, China, Australia,
                    and other places.</p>
                <p>Large quantities of corn of a very good description are produced in the immediate
                    neighbourhood of Cape Town; but its free exportation is restrained, none being
                    allowed to be sent abroad, except a specified quantity decided upon by
                    government after an investigation into the state of the crops. Large quantities
                    of wine, and of what is called brandy, are produced at the Cape; but, with the
                    exception of Constantia, they are very inferior. Considerable quantities of
                    hides, skins, and horns, are exported. They are principally brought from Algoa
                    Bay, on the eastern side of the colony; and the trade has increased very fast
                    during the last six or seven years. Horses, butter, beef, ivory, whale oil,
                    aloes, argol, and various other articles, are among the exports. The imports at
                    the Cape consist of woollens, cottons, hardware, earthen ware, furniture,
                    haberdashery, soap, paper, books, and portions of most articles used in this
                    country. Piece-goods and teak timber are imported from India, tea from China,
                    sugar from India and the Mauritius, &amp;c. The total revenue of the Cape Colony
                    for the year 1832 amounted to L.130,808. 7s. 3įd.; the expenditure for the same
                    year was L.126,889. Os. 9Jd; leaving a balance or surplus of L.3919. 6s. 10fd.
                    The trade between the colonists and the independent natives is subjected to
                    restraints, which do not work advantageously. According to the accounts
                    published by the board of trade, the values of the products imported into and
                    exported from the Cape of Good Hope in 1831 were-aşμnder.</p>

                <p>The whites are composed of individuals from various European nations. The most
                    numerous of the inhabitants are the Dutch, who still occupy places of
                    importance. The slaves are for the most part Malays, or natives of Madagascar
                    and the eastern coast. The Hottentots prefer a country life, and are generally
                    averse to residing in towns. In regard to the society of Cape Town, Mr Thomson
                    observes, “Of the habits and customs of the Cape Dutch in Cape Town and its
                    vicinity, I need only say, that they are becoming every day more decidedly
                    English. It will be a matter of regret, if they ever so entirely change as to
                    lose some of their present character. They are a frank and hospitable, and at
                    the same time a prudent and thrifty race.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Thomson’s <hi rend="italic">Travel·</hi> hi <hi
                    rend="italic">South Africa,</hi> vol. ü. p. 42X</p></note> The old Dutch court
                    of justice, which till within a few years administered the law, has been
                    superseded by a court more on the English model, consisting of a chief justice
                    and three puisne judges, with an attorney general, &amp;c. instead of the old
                    fiscal. Landrosts and humraden have been supplanted by civil commissioners,
                    resident magistrates, and justices of peace. A council has been appointed to
                    assist the governor with its advice, and consists of the chief justice, the
                    government secretary, the military officer next in command to the governor for
                    the time being, the accountant general, and the chief commissioner of the
                    eastern province. But the most important of all is, an order in council, by
                    which the Hottentots and other free coloured population are placed under the
                    equal protection of the laws, and declared to be, as subjects of the British
                    government, in every respect upon the same footing as the white colonists,
                    whether Dutch or English.</p>
                <p>A minute topographical description of the extended and thinly-peopled territory
                    comprehended within the Cape Colony is unnecessary. A few particular places,
                    however, may be described. In the vicinity of the capital there is a very
                    conspicuous mountain called Table Mountain, which rises to the height of 3582
                    feet above the level of the sea. It commands a view of vast extent, and its
                    sides afford a rich treat to the botanist and geologist. In the same peninsula
                    on which the above mountain stands, are two others nearly as conspicuous and
                    interesting. One of them is termed the Lion’s Head, and has an elevation of 2160
                    feet above the level of the sea; the other is denominated the Lion’s Rump, and
                    its height is 1142 feet. About seventy-five miles from Cape Town, in the
                    direction of south-east by east, are the warm baths of Swarteberg. To the north
                    of these is the Guadenthal, or Bavian⅛ Mountain, where the Moravian missionaries
                    have their principal settlement. The members of this religious colony have been
                    highly useful to the poor proscribed Hottentots. Near Algoa Bay, and 450 miles
                    eastward of Cape Town, is situated Bethels-dorp, the principal establishment of
                    the London Missionary Society. Those who have visited this place describe its
                    outward appearance as being far from prepossessing. The country around is bleak
                    and barren, and wants water for irrigation. However, many of the Hottentot
                    families occupy substantial and commodious houses, whilst some have reached a
                    degree of comfort and convenience far above the average of the frontier boors.
                    The manufactures of England are used as clothing; many native artificers are to
                    be met with; and, altogether, from the aspect of intelligence which the
                    inhabitants exhibit, as described by the most recent travellers, there is no
                    room to doubt that they are rapidly rising in the scale of society. There are a
                    number of other missionary stations scattered throughout Cape Colony, and they
                    all appear to have done, and to be still doing some good.</p>
                <p>In 1820 a company of Scottish emigrants to the number of 5000, under the
                    patronage of the British government, planted a colony in the district of Albany,
                    on the frontiers of Caffreland, and conferred on it the name of Glen-Lynden. The
                    late Mr Pringle, who headed the party, thus speaks of the settlement in 1834: “A
                    few words in conclusion about our settlement of Glen-Lynden. Under the blessing
                    of Providence its prosperity has been steadily progressive Without having any
                    pretensions to wealth, and with very little <hi rend="italic">money</hi> among
                    them, the Glen-Lynden settlers, with some few exceptions, may be said to be in a
                    thriving, and, on the whole, in a very enviable condition.” This puts down at
                    once the assertions which have been made in various publications, that the
                    attempt had proved unsuccessful. It is impossible to calculate the benefits
                    which may result from the enterprise of the intrepid Scottish emigrants. Keeping
                    out of view entirely the moral effects which must result from their intercourse
                    with the rude tribes around them, science seems likely to be greatly benefited
                    by this colony. The number of the settlers has very much increased, and by their
                    gradual diffusion over this vasl continent, they may yet be the first to convey
                    to us information respecting the interior of Africa, all attempts to explore
                    which have hitherto proved equally fruitless and fatal.</p>
                <p>The past history of the native races of Cape Colony, since the latter became
                    known to Europeans, presents nothing but a dark picture of fierce tyranny on the
                    one side, and gloomy submission on the other. Their domestic feuds also have
                    tended greatly to enhance their miseries. The condition of the Hottentot is
                    still very abject, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193521949"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-1949-0614"/>on account of the oppression of the district
                    authorities, although the missionaries have done much to alleviate it. But we
                    cannot enter into details relative to the conflict which was carried on between
                    interested rapacity on the one hand, and Christian philanthropy on the other.
                    Ample information upon this subject will be found in Dr Phillips’ <hi
                    rend="italic">Researches in South Africa.</hi> A late writer thus describes the
                    personal appearance and general character of the Hottentots.</p>
                <p>“This unfortunate tribe has become noted and almost proverbial for presenting man
                    in his lowest estate, and under tþe closest alliance with the inferior orders of
                    creation. It must, indeed, be admitted, that they take particular pains to
                    render their external appearance the most hideous that the human body can
                    possibly present. Grease is poured over their persons in copious streams, which,
                    being exposed to the perpetual action of smoke, forms on their skin a black and
                    shining cake, through which the native colour, a yellowish brown, is scarcely
                    ever perceptible. Grease in Africa forms the chief distinction of rank,—the rich
                    besmearing themselves with fresh butter, while the poorer classes are obliged to
                    tear the fat from the bowels of slaughtered animals. They assign as a reason for
                    this singular practice an effect which has been readily admitted by judicious
                    travellers, namely, that such a coating has in this climate a most salutary
                    influence in defending them from the rays of the sun, and in averting many
                    cutaneous disorders. Nature seems to have aided the task of disfiguring them, by
                    covering the bead with irregular tufts of hard and coarse hair, and causing
                    singular prominences, composed of fat, to jut out in parts where they are least
                    ornamental. Nor do their habits of life present any thing to redeem this outward
                    deformity. Their kraals consist of a confused crowd of little conical hovels,
                    composed of twigs and earth, in which large families sit and sleep, without
                    having room to stand upright. The fire in the middle fills these mansions with
                    thick smoke, the floors of which are deeply covered with every species of filth.
                    At festivals, when an ox or a sheep is killed, the Hottentots rip open the
                    belly, tear out the entrails, which they throw on the coals, and feast on them
                    before the animal is completely dead. Yet they are a friendly, merry, hospitable
                    race, living together in the greatest affection and harmony. The sluggish and
                    senseless stupidity with which they have been so generally taxed, seems to have
                    been in a great measure produced by their degrading subjection to tire Dutch
                    boors. In their free state they had a republican form of polity, and <hi
                    rend="italic">kon¶uers</hi> or captains of the kraal, who led them to war, which
                    they carried on with extreme fury. This commander usually sounded a pipe or
                    flageolet, during which his men fought without intermission; but as soon as the
                    music ceased they began to retreat. The Hottentots direct their darts and
                    throwing-sticks with a sure aim, surround and attack wild animals with skill and
                    vigour, and evade their springs with a dexterity which no European can equal.
                    They tan, dress, and shape skins; make mats of flags and bulrushes; also twist
                    strings for their bows out of the sinews of animals; and even mould iron into
                    cutting instruments with considerable expertness. In their free and happy state
                    they displayed the same passion for the dance and song which is general
                    throughout Africa.”</p>
                <p>With respect to his religion, the unenlightened Hottentot, although he believed
                    in a good God and a malignant power, had neither temples nor priests; but with
                    superstitious veneration he hailed the new and full moon with dances and
                    rejoicings, prolonged throughout the night. Certain localities were held sacred
                    as the abodes of departed spirits. Lastly, the Hottentot had a little shining
                    beetle, which he exalted almost to the dignity of a deity. From the cruel
                    treatment which this unfortunate tribe has received from its provincial
                    oppressors, their number at present in the colony does not surpass 15,000. The
                    few kraals of independent Hottentots which still remain on its outer border are
                    supposed to amount to about 10,000.</p>
