                <p><label type="entry">GAUBIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jerome-David</hi></label>,
                    professor of medicine at Leyden, and afterwards fellow of the royal society of
                    London, was born at Heidelberg in the year 1705. From the Jesuits he received
                    the rudiments of his education, and was much esteemed by them on account of his
                    abilities; but his father afterwards sent him to the orphanhouse of Halle, lest
                    he should be obliged to abjure his religion. The nature of the discipline,
                    however, he found much too severe, and at his own request his father removed
                    him. His teacher at this hospital attributing the dislike of young Gaubius to
                    the want of genius, urged him to give his son some mechanical employment; but
                    his father thought proper to indulge his ardent desire after knowledge, and
                    accordingly sent him to Amsterdam to study under his uncle John, who was an
                    eminent physician there. After prosecuting his medical studies for some time at
                    Hordwyk, he resolved to visit Leyden, where Boerhaave was then professor, and
                    his penetrating eye soon discovered that Gaubius was possessed of talents above
                    mediocrity. This celebrated man honoured him with unlimited access to his house,
                    delighted in imparting instruction to him, and gradually forwarded the
                    cultivation of his mind. Gaubius took the degree of doctor at the age of twenty,
                    after a disputation on the nature of solids, containing an abstract of the
                    system which he himself subsequently followed in practice. He then travelled
                    through various parts of Europe, and when he returned to Heidelberg by way of
                    Strasburg, he was appointed city physician at Deventer, in the province
                    ofθveryssel; but he soon afterwards removed to Amsterdam. Boerhaave never lost
                    sight of his favourite pupil; and when the infirmities of old age and
                    indefatigable labour induced him to resign his chair, Gaubius was upon his
                    recommendation appointed to succeed him. In 1738, he published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Instructions for Writing Recipes,</hi> which was received with
                    merited approbation, as he had reduced the art from a mechanical into a
                    scientific form. His Principles of Nosology is perhaps his most masterly
                    performance, as it evinced that he was highly worthy of such a preceptor. The
                    next publication of Gaubius, which appeared in 1771, was his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Adversaria</hi><hi rend="italic">varii Argumenti,</hi> a work which was
                    particularly interesting to chemists; and his oration on the two-hundredth
                    anniversary of the academy of Leyden attracted considerable notice, as in it he
                    traced out, with his accustomed acuteness, the principal epochs of the arts and
                    sciences in Holland. He was likewise the author of numerous and valuable papers
                    in the Transactions of the Society of Haerlem, and editor of many excellent
                    performances, amongst which may be mentioned Cramer’s <hi rend="italic">Elementa
                    artis</hi><hi rend="italic">docimasticae,</hi> Albinus <hi rend="italic">de
                    presagienda vita</hi><hi rend="italic">et morte,</hi> and Swammerdam’s Book of
                    Nature, which he partly translated. His literary merit spread his fame beyond
                    the bounds of his native country, and pupils repaired to Leyden from every part
                    of Europe. In addition to his widely extended reputation, he was blessed with
                    the enjoyment of good health till he attained seventy years of age; and he died
                    on the 29th of November 1780, in his seventy-fifth year. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Institutiones Pathologice Medicinalis</hi> was deemed so valuable by Professor
                    Ackermann, that he published a fourth edition of the work at Nuremberg in
                    1787.</p>
