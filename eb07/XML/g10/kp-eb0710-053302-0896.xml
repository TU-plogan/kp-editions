                    Joseph</hi></label>, was born at Plymouth in 1636. He received his education in
                    the university of Oxford, and, in 1666, obtained the cure of Abbey-church at
                    Bath; in 1678, he became prebend of the church of Worcester, and died at Bath on
                    the 16th of November 1680, in the forty-fourth year of his age. This writer, the
                    first who, in England, presented philosophical scepticism under a systematic
                    form, deserves more marked attention than has hitherto been accorded to him; nor
                    can we observe without surprise that Brucker has not given him any place in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Critical History of Philosophy.</hi> There are two kinds of
                    scepticism, essentially distinct; one which, by professing absolute doubt, tends
                    to condemn human reason to a mortal lethargy; and another which, producing only
                    a relative doubt, serves rather to excite reason, by a wise distrust of itself,
                    to more severe and rigid examination. The first is only an arm of destruction;
                    the second is an instrument of censure and probation. It was this latter kind of
                    scepticism to which Glanvil wished to give systematic preparation, by tracing
                    out an intermediate path between that dogmatism which blindly affirms every
                    thing, and Pyrrhonism, which denies every thing in a manner equally blind, Two
                    parties then existed in England; one of which abused the name of philosophy, in
                    order to accredit atheism, and the other abused the name of religion, in order
                    to justify superstition. Glanvil deplored this double aberration; he felt that
                    philosophy itself required a reform, and he laboured to prepare rather than to
                    produce it himself. It is in this light, and from this point of view, that his
                    writings should be studied and judged. Of these, the two principal, both in
                    English, are, first, <hi rend="italic">The Vanity of Dogmatising,</hi> or
                    Confidence in Opinions, manifested in a Discourse of the shortness and
                    uncertainty of our knowledge of its principles, with Reflections on
                    Peripateticism, and an Apology for Philosophy, 1661, in 8vo; and, secondly, <hi
                    rend="italic">Scepsis Scientifica,</hi> or confessed Ignorance the way to
                    Science, an essay on the vanity of dogmatising, and confident opinion, London,
                    1665, in 4to. The latter of these works procured him the honour of being
                    admitted a member of the Royal Society of London. Montaigne and Charron appear
                    to have served as his guides, and he has borrowed much from both; he reviewed
                    the principal objects of human knowledge, and endeavoured to show, in regard to
                    each of these, the weakness and impotence of reason. The peripatetic doctrine,
                    and the system of Descartes, which he appears to have especially had it in view
                    to combat, themselves furnished him with arms; and in the rapid advancement of
                    physical science at this period, he also endeavours to discover grounds for
                    rendering more sensible our ignorance in the study of nature. Hobbes is the
                    frequent object of his criticism. In general he seeks to prevent the abuse of
                    rational speculations; and it is only in the observations to which they have led
                    that he seeks for considerations fitted to inspire the distrust which he
                    inculcates. His views respecting the sources of human error are presented with
                    much perspicuity and method, often with striking novelty. The manner in which he
                    treats the great question of causation is the more remarkable, because it
                    appears to have opened the way to Hume in an investigation which has· produced
                    one of the greatest revolutions which philosophy has experienced in our time.
                    According to him, we know only that things occur, and succeed one another, not
                    how they are produced; we see their relation of coincidence, but not the tie
                    which connects them; and hence the relation of the effect to the cause is, as
                    far as we are concerned, a fact, and not a veritable law. Glanvil compares
                    dogmatism to a narrow prison, in which the human mind is confined, and beyond
                    the walls of which it cannot extend its view. The offspring of ignorance and of
                    pride, dogmatism is, according to him, the father of errors; and scepticism is
                    called in to apply a remedy, not by employing negations as arbitrary, but by
                    weighing with impartiality the proofs. Doctrine like this was, however, liable
                    to be mistaken or misrepresented; and we need not wonder, therefore, that, at
                    the period when Glanvil wrote, he was considered by the greater number of
                    readers as an absolute sceptic, and treated as such. The partisans of the
                    prevailing systems regarded with more aversion the men who provoked discussion,
                    than they did those persons who rejected their doctrines without examination.
                    Hence Glanvil was very warmly attacked; but he justified himself in his answer
                    to one of his opponents, which is subjoined to his <hi rend="italic">Scepsis
                    Scientifìca</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> ami he also undertook the defence of
                    philosophy, conceiving that this belonged of right to those who desired to bring
                    her back to her proper and legitimate sphere. It is singular enough, however,
                    though by no means without example, that this writer, who had not only shown,
                    but even exaggerated, the infirmity of human reason, paid himself a strange
                    tribute to its weakness; for, after having combated scientific dogmatism, he not
                    only yielded to vulgar superstitions, but actually endeavoured to accredit them
                    in his Philosophical Considerations concerning the existence of Sorcerers and
                    Sorcery, published in 1666, in 4to. The story of the pretended drum, which was
                    said to have been heard every night in the house of an inhabitant of Wiltshire
                    (Mr Mum· pesson), a story which made much noise in the year 1663, and which is
                    supposed to have furnished Addison with the idea of his comedy of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Drum,</hi> appears to have given occasion to this work. It might
                    have been imagined that <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520909"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-0909-0534"/>guch a tale would have been treated with derision
                    by Glanvil, and that the philosopher could have had no other , object than to
                    turn into ridicule the credulity of his country. For such a supposition,
                    however, there seems to be little or no room, and, in point of fact, this
                    production gave rise to a controversy, which only terminated with the life of
                    Glanvil. At his death he left a piece entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saddu-cismus</hi><hi rend="italic">Triumphans,</hi> which was printed in 1681,
                    8vo, reprinted with some additions in 1682, and translated into German in 1701.
                    He had there collected twenty-six relations or stories of the same description
                    as that of the Drum, in order to establish, by a series of facts, the opinion
                    which he had expressed in his Philosophical Considerations. Glanvil supported a
                    much more honourable cause when he undertook the defence of the Royal Society of
                    London, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Plus ultra,</hi> or the Progress
                    and Advancement of Science since the time of Aristotle, 1658, in 12mo. His
                    object was to refute a foolish ecclesiastic who had alleged that Aristotle
                    possessed individually more knowledge than could be found in the Royal Society,
                    or even in all the men of the seventeenth century. By this production he drew
                    upon himself a violent antagonist in the person of one Stubbe, a physician at
                    Warwick; but, after an animated dispute, the doctor, by some mischance, lost his
                    life, and his generous antagonist, in a funeral sermon which he preached on the
                    occasion, pronounced an eulogium on his memory. Besides the works already
                    noticed, Glanvil wrote, 1. Lux Orientalis, 1662; 2. Philosophia Pia, or
                    Discourse on the Religious Character, and the Tendency of Experimental
                    Philosophy; 3. Essays on several important subjects in Philosophy and Religion,
                    1676, in 4to; 4. An Essay concerning Preaching; and 5. Sermons. After his death
                    in 1681, there were published sermons and other posthumous works in one volume
                    4to. The style of Glanvil is clear, easy, and animated; and to the student of
                    the philosophy of the human mind his works are full of instruction. <hi
