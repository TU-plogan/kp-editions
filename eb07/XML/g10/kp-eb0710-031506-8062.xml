                    born at Toledo, in 1503. He was the younger son of Garcilaso, counsellor of
                    state to terdinand and Isabella, their ambassador at the court of Rome, and
                    grand commander of Leon, and of Sanchette de Guzman, lady of Batres, a
                    considerable property of the illustrious house of Guzman, where may yet be seen
                    a fountain which has existed for several centuries, and still bears the name of
                    Garci)aso. Ferdinand V. conferred on the father of Garcilaso the name of Vega,
                    in memory of a single combat which the former maintained against one of the most
                    valiant of the Moors on the Vega, or plain of Grenada; and which was celebrated
                    in the Spanish romances and histories of that age. Garcilaso was intended by
                    nature for a rural and solitary life, at least if a judgment may be formed from
                    his poetical productions, which all breathe nothing but love and peace, and
                    manifest extreme gentleness of character. But his birth having called him to the
                    profession of arms, his life was passed in camps, and his career was brilliant
                    and tumultuous. He entered early into the army of Charles V., followed that
                    monarch in the war of the Milanese (1521), and, though still young,
                    distinguished himself by his valour, particularly at the battle of Pavia. In
                    1523 he served in the Spanish corps, which, having joined the imperial army,
                    distinguished itself by its bravery against the Turks. In acknowledgment of his
                    courage, Charles V. conferred on him, at Vienna, the cross of the order of St
                    James. Garcilaso, by his merit, established himself in the good graces of the
                    emperor; but a gallant adventure for ever deprived him of the favour which his
                    talents and bravery had won. One of his cousins having become enamoured of a
                    lady of the court, who, it seems, had gained the affections of Charles,
                    Garcilaso favoured by all means in his power the passion of his relation, whose
                    intentions were honourable. When the fact became known to the emperor, he sent
                    the cousin into exile, and banished Garcilaso to an island in the Danube. During
                    his detention, which was not of long duration, the latter composed one of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Condones,</hi> in which he deplores his misfortune, and at the
                    same time celebrates the charms of the country watered by the divine stream of
                    the Danube <hi rend="italic">(Danubio</hi><hi rend="italic">rio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">divino).</hi> In 1535, he served in the expedition which Charles
                    V. undertook against Tunis, whence he brought back nothing but wounds and glory.
                    He then passed some time in Naples and in Sicily, where he indulged in his
                    favourite occupation of poetry. Pouring out maledictions on war, as the bane of
                    nations and the destroyer of human happiness, he pleased himself with creating
                    an imaginary romantic Arcadia, free from all the passions, tumults, and
                    anxieties which distract men in this every-day common-place world; but
                    notwithstanding these benign and peaceful pictures painted by his fancy, he
                    still remained the soldier, and, in addition to his acknowledged courage,
                    evinced considerable military talents. Hence, in 1536, he marched with the
                    imperial army into France, having under his orders thirty companies of Spanish
                    troops. But this was the last campaign of Garcilaso, who, in the disastrous
                    retreat from Marseilles, found a death worthy of his valour. A number of French
                    peasants having occupied a tower, whence they greatly annoyed the imperial army
                    on its retreat, the emperor ordered Garcilaso to carry it by assault. He obeyed,
                    but executing his order with less prudence than valour, he mounted the first to
                    the assault, and was overthrown by a mass of stone, which struck him on the
                    head, and inflicted a mortal wound. He was conveyed in this state to Nice,
                    where, after lingering twenty hours in great agony, he expired in November 1536,
                    being then in the thirty-third year of his age. Arms and letters sincerely
                    deplored his loss; and the emperor himself was so touched, that when the tower
                    had been carried, he caused twenty-eight peasants who remained out of the fifty
                    who formed its garrison to be hanged on the spot where the poet-soldier had
                    fallen. At the age of twenty-eight Garcilaso<pb break="no" facs="nls:193518075"

                    Zuniga, by whom he had a son, who, like his father, fell in the flower of his
                    age (1569), in a combat with the Dutch.</p>
                <p>Although the military career of Garcilaso is not without glory, yet he owes his
                    refutation to his literary merit, more especially to the reformation he effected
                    in Spanish poetry, and which forms an epoch in the age in which he lived. For
                    several centuries before the birth of Garcilaso, the Spaniards possessed a
                    species of poetry.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    contained the poem of the Cid, written towards the middle of the eleventh

                    first known compositions were romances, produced probably in the mountains of
                    Asturias; and the first people amongst whom a less rude and incorrect kind of
                    poetry appeared, were the Valencians and the Catalans, who wrote in their own
                    particular language. The last of these troubadours was Jago Roig, who died at
                    the commencement of the fifteenth century.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    dialect prevailed, the only poetical compositions at first known were these
                    romances, composed of <hi rend="italic">redondillas</hi> or <hi rend="italic"

                    following, in which Alfonso the Wise relates that he had learned from a
                    celebrated alchemist how to make the philosopher’s stone, by means of which he
                    had been enabled to augment his revenues:</p>

                    juntos, despues solo yí&gt;.. Con que ιnuchas veces cresciò mi caudâl.</p>
                <p>In the same century, that is, about the middle of the thirteenth, a Benedictine
                    named Barceo introduced the verses called Martelliani by the Italians, and
                    Alexandrine by the French:</p>
                <p>Quiero far una prosa en roman paladino En el quai suele el pueblo hablar a su
                    vecino.</p>
                <p>But this metre has for a long time fallen into almost total disuse, except in
                    Spain. In fact, it was only under the reign of John II. a great protector of
                    letters, who swayed the sceptre from 1401 to 1454, that Spanish poetry assumed a
                    character truly national. This prince collected around him the ablest Valentian
                    troubadours, and the most renowned Castillian poets; and it was then that the
                    learned Marquis of Villenas, John of Mena, the Marquis Mendoza of Santillane,
                    John of the Encina, and others, appeared, and that versification was subjected
                    to some rules, conformably to the precepts laid down in <hi rend="italic">Arts
                    of Poetry</hi> composed by the two authors last named. But this versification
                    was still very rude, when Dante, Petrarch, and Sannazaro had already made
                    themselves admired in Italy and in all Europe, by the excellence and beauty of
                    their compositions. At length came Boscan and Garcilaso, who, united from their
                    earliest infancy in the closest friendship, and alike sensible of the merit of
                    the three great Italian poets, the perusal of whose works had formed at once
                    their taste and their understanding, resolved to effect a general reform in the
                    bad taste which still prevailed in their own country. Boscan was the first to
                    enter the field. He introduced the sonnet, the <hi rend="italic">canzoni,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">stanze,</hi> and the endecasyllabic measure of the
                    Italians; and his efforts were crowned with success. Garcilaso merely followed
                    Boscan, but, on the other hand, he had the talent to surpass him, and approached
                    more nearly to the sweetness and softness of Petrarch, whilst his rival imitated
                    the precision and energy of Dante. All the contemporary poets united in opposing
                    a reform the success of which would infer their condemnation; but although they
                    evoked the shades of their illustrious predecessors, the genius of the two wise
                    innovators triumphed over their cabals. Garcilaso and Boscan obtained the title
                    of Fathers of the Good School; Garcilaso was named the Spanish Petrarch, the
                    Prince of Spanish Poetry; and the desired reform was effected. It was followed
                    by good imitators,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These
                    imitators, in adopting the Italian metres introduced by Boβcan and Garcilaso,

                    had been known in Spain since the fourteenth century.</p></note> till the
                    apparition of Andalous Gongora, who appeared to have undertaken the task of
                    banishing for ever good taste from his country; but, in spite of all his
                    efforts, and those of his partisans, under the reign of Charles V. and the three
                    Philips, his successors, Spain was fertile in good poets; and, in recent times,
                    Iriarte, Cienfuegos, Moralin, Arellano, Quintana, and, above all,
                    Melendez-Valdez, have enabled their countrymen to taste the delights of true
                    poetry. Boscan, who survived Garcilaso six years, collected the works of the
                    latter; but death surprised him before he was enabled to give them to the world.
                    The first known edition is that of Venice, 1553, in 8vo. The celebrated
                    grammarian Sanchez, called in Latin Sanctius, had corrected what he found
                    defective in the oldest edition; but the most esteemed edition is that of
                    Madrid, 1765, in 16to, containing a preface and notes, which prove the anonymous
                    editor to have been an able and enlightened man of letters. It is not by the
                    multitude of his works that Garcilaso has secured immortality, since they are
                    all contained in a small volume; but this volume includes all that is necessary
                    to serve as a model to the best poets of the Spanish nation.</p>
                <p>The style peculiar to Garcilaso is the tender and the pathetic, which
                    predominates, in a high degree, in all his compositions. Amongst the sonnets,
                    which are thirty in number, may be particularly distinguished that one which
                    commences,</p>
                <p>O dulces prendas por mi mal ħalladas; and also another, not less beautiful,
                    beginning,</p>
                <p>Si quexas y lamentas pueden tanto, which Sismondi has translated with equal
                    elegance and precision.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    270.</p></note> But the composition which forms the glory of Garcilaso is the
                    first of his three eclogues, which has served as a model to a crowd of
                    imitators, who have not of course succeeded in approaching it. This poem,
                    consisting of about four hundred verses, was written at Naples, where the author
                    seems to have at once imbibed the spirit of Virgil and of Sannazaro. Two
                    shepherds, Salicio and Nemoroso, meet, and, by their plaintive songs, express
                    the grief occasioned to the one by the infidelity,</p>
                <p>Por tì silencio de la aelva umbrosa, and to the other, by the death, of his
                    shepherdess, Como al partir del sol la sombra cresce.</p>
                <p>In the first, there is a softness, a delicacy, a submission; <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193518088" xml:id="kp-eb0710-8088-0317"/>in the second a depth of
                    grief; in both a purity of pastoral ' sentiment, which strike us the more
                    forcibly when we recollect that the writer was a warrior destined to perish a
                    few months afterwards in leading an assault. Each verse charms at once by the
                    truth of an exalted but touching sentiment, by the happy choice of expression,
                    and by a harmony which never fails to satisfy even the most delicate ear.
                    Nevertheless, the song of Nemoroso is still more fascinating than that of his
                    associate, perhaps, because it moves us more gently. The passage where he speaks
                    of the buckle of his mistress’s hair,</p>
                <p>Una parte guarde de,tu cabellos, which he carries on his heart, and with which he
                    is resolved never to part, has no model, neither among the ancients nor among
                    the moderns.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Since the
                    eclogues of John of the Encina, pastoral poetry bad not made any progress in
                    Spain. Garrilaso imitated the eclogues of v⅛gil and of Sannazaro, and in this
                    imitation established the character of romantic poetry with the correctness of
                    the ancients, so that his eclogues, one of which is a masterpiece, greatly
                    surpass all the Italian pieces of the same description, if we except the Xrrodi
                    <hi rend="subscript"> u</hi> of Sannazara <hi rend="italic">(IMínturc</hi><hi
