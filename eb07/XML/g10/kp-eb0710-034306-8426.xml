                <p><label type="entry">GARONNE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Upper</hi></label>, a
                    department in the south-west of France, formed out of the ancient district
                    Toulousain, a part of Upper Languedoc, and the district of Comminges, a portion
                    of Gascony. It is bounded on the north by the department of Tarn-Garonne, on the
                    east by those of the Tarn and the Aude, on the south-east by that of Arriege, on
                    the south by Spain, and on the west by the departments of the Upper Pyrenees and
                    the Gers. The extent is 2175 square miles, or, according to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Statistique</hi><hi rend="italic">de la France,</hi> 618,558
                    hectares. The civil divisions are <pb break="no" facs="nls:193518439"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-8439-0344"/>four arrondissements, thirty-nine cantons, and 599
                    com- ' munes, inhabited by 454,727 individuals.</p>
                <p>The face of the country, in by far the greatest portion of the northern division
                    of the department, consists of low hills, and broad valleys between them; but
                    the southern part is a mountain district, which rises gradually towards the
                    Spanish frontier, where some of the elevations attain the height of 10,000 feet.
                    In the northern part the land is generally fertile; but in the southern it is
                    sterile, and, in the valleys, is better adapted for pasture than for tillage.
                    The chief river, which gives name to the department, is navigable for boats
                    above Toulouse, to Cazĕres for small boats, and below that city to the sea for
                    variously-sized larger vessels. In the Pyrenees are some small lakes: from one
                    of them, the Seculego, is a waterfall into another, the Espingo, which is near
                    800 feet high, and the latter lake is 4500 feet above the level of the sea. In
                    no part of the world is there a greater variety of picturesque scenery than the
                    Pyrenees present within this department.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants, like the others in these southern departments, speak a peculiar
                    patois, in which many Latin and Spanish words are intermixed. In some parts of
                    the Pyrenees, especially in the Valley of Luchon, are found the Cretins, there
                    called Cagots, with large and indistinct articulation, and a great degree of
                    stupidity, who reside in dwellings separated from the other inhabitants, by whom
                    all connection with them is viewed with abhorrence. The singularity is, that
                    none of this race are found on the Spanish side of the Pyrenees.</p>
                <p>The agriculture, except on the mountains, is well conducted, and the harvests,
                    especially of wheat, are very abundant; besides which, much maize is
                    occasionally grown. The neighbourhood of Toulouse is one of the most fruitful of
                    France, as well in corn as in pasture for cattle. Much fruit is produced, and
                    the vineyards are extensive, yielding wine of a medium quality, most of which is
                    consumed at home, or converted into brandy. The woods yield some ship-timber and
                    fuel, but suffered much during the Revolution.</p>
                <p>There are no mines worked except of iron upon a small scale, though copper and
                    lead are to be found in several parts. The manufacturing industry is almost
                    confined to Toulouse, the capital, where linen, woollen, and silk goods are
                    fabricated extensively, as well as snuff, starch, china, paper, hats, hose, and
                    some other articles. In the Pyrenees there is a considerable contraband trade
                    carried on with Spain.</p>
