                <p><label type="entry">GLAZING OF WINDOWS</label>.</p>
                <p>Before proceeding to speak of glazing, the order in which its various processes
                    present themselves naturally demands that we should say something of putty.</p>
                <p>This important and indispensable article in the glazier’s trade is composed of
                    whiting and linseed oil. Chalk is sometimes used instead of the former, but the
                    expense and labour incurred in preparing it is much greater, and besides it is
                    generally mixed with sand, so that it is no object to the glazier to employ it.
                    Whiting is in every way to be preferred; it must be thoroughly dried before the
                    oil is added to it, otherwise the union will not be effected, or at least it
                    will be very imperfect.</p>
                <p>After the whiting has been thoroughly dried and prepared, it ought to be passed
                    through a very fine sieve, and all the lumps and knots that remain pulverised,
                    and then also passed through the sieve. Great care must be taken to keep the
                    whiting free of sand and other extraneous substances.</p>
                <p>When putty is to be made, put the proper quantity of oil into a tub or other open
                    vessel, and gradually add the whiting whilst yet in a hot state, at the same
                    time keeping the whole in motion with a stick, until it becomes of a sufficient
                    consistency to admit of being wrought by the hand on a board or table. Having
                    been removed thither from the tub, it must be wrought up with dry whiting, until
                    it is converted into a solid compact mass. When brought to this state, it ought
                    to be put into a hollowed stone or mortar, and beat with a wooden mallet till it
                    becomes soft and tenacious, when more whiting must be added, until it has
                    attained a proper consistency.</p>
                <p>It is considered that the putty is improved if the whiting and oil, after being
                    mixed, are allowed to remain for about twenty hours before being wrought up.
                    After putty has been made, it should be firmly packed in a cask, from which it
                    may be taken from time to time, as it is required. It ought not to be used for
                    ten or twelve days after it is made, when its colour, from having at first been
                    a dull yellow, will have changed to a whitish free-stone, which renders it more
                    suitable for most purposes. After a lapse of six or eight weeks, the putty in
                    the cask will become hard; but it is easily restored to its original softness,
                    by being beat as before, and it is much improved by this second operation.</p>
                <p>Putty is made in England in large quantities, and is ground in a mill in the same
                    way as white lead; but this is no improvement, βs it is generally overwrought in
                    this method of preparation, and rendered so tough and tenacious that it does not
                    work well, and is entirely without that degree of pliability which putty ought
                    to possess.</p>
                <p>When putty is required of a superior degree of fineness, and which will also dry
                    quickly, add a little sugar of lead, or litharge; and if an increase of strength
                    be wanted, a little white lead.</p>
                <p>We now proceed to glazing.</p>
                <p>To glaze well, neatly, and expeditiously, simple as the operation may appear, is
                    an art for the thorough acquirement of which many years of practice are
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>When a glazier receives an order to glaze a house, he must first, of course,
                    proceed to measure the work to be done. In doing this, he must take the <hi
                    rend="italic">full</hi> size of the panes, that enough may be left for
                    stripping, so as to produce an accurate fit into the sashes. This fitting must
                    be performed with great care and nicety, leaving about one thirty-second part of
                    an inch of space on each side and end of the pane, between it and the check. In
                    other words, the pane must fill the space appropriated for it, to within the
                    thirty-second part of an inch, or thereabouts.</p>
                <p>This space is left to provide for such occurrences as the wood swelling with
                    moisture, or the building setting, in which cases the panes would be apt to
                    crack.</p>
                <p>When the panes have been fitted into the checks of the sashes in the manner
                    spoken of, they must be removed, and the checks well bedded with beat putty.
                    This done, the panes are again returned to their places, and gently pressed or
                    lodged into the bedding, the workman, as it were, humouring the glass should it
                    be bent or twisted, and taking care that there is no hard extraneous substance
                    mingled with the putty, which might endanger, if not actually break, the glass.
                    When a pane is perfectly bedded it lies quite firm, and does not spring from the
                    putty; but when, either from a perverse bend or twist in the glass, or any other
                    accidental cause, it happens that it cannot be made to go quite close to the
                    check, the vacant space must be carefully and neatly filled upon the back
                    puttying, otherwise the window will not be impervious to the weather, and will
                    be very apt to fall into decay by the admission of moisture.</p>
                <p>It may not be superfluous to observe here, that the convex or round side of the
                    pane, where such a shape occurs, should be presented to the outside, and the
                    concave or hollow to the inside. The reasons for recommending this disposition
                    of such panes are so obvious that they need hardly be enumerated. It may,
                    however, be stated generally, that when thus placed, they resist the weather
                    better than if the hollow sides were exposed to it.</p>
                <p>After the pane has been bedded, the next process is the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193521442" xml:id="kp-eb0710-1442-0575"/>outside puttying. This putty
                    should be kept in the fore check, about the thirty-second part of an inch below
                    the level of the inside check, so as to allow the thin layer of paint which
                    binds these two substances together to join the putty and glass; and that it may
                    not offend the eye by being seen from the inside; and that, when it is painted,
                    the brush may not encroach on any visible part of the pane, leaving those ragged
                    lines or marks which are so often seen from the inside on ill-finished windows,
                    and which are so displeasing to the eye. This operation, and finishing the
                    corners, are two nice points in the. art, and therefore, when properly done,
                    discover the neat-handed and skilful tradesman.</p>
                <p>It is the opinion of some experienced glaziers, that the inside puttying, which
                    is the next process, ought to be allowed to remain eight days before being
                    finished off, while others, again, say that this should be immediately done. The
                    experience of the writer inclines him to the former opinion. By standing over
                    for some little time, the putty acquires a hardness which admits of a better and
                    neater finish than when it is in the soft working state, and in this way also it
                    is not liable to shrink. Of course this is only recommended in cases of
                    extensive jobs. When only a few panes are done, it is better to finish them off
                    at once, than subject the employers to the inconvenience of a second visit from
                    the glazier for so trifling a purpose.</p>
                <p>When the finishing does take place, however, the putty must be cut clean off with
                    the putty knife, and on a level with the style of the astragals. Complete the
                    work by cleaning the glass and putty with a 000 duster brush, which removes all
                    dust and loose putty from the pane, <hi rend="italic">lightly</hi> and
                    effectually.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In taking

                    and impenetrable to the knife. In this case there are various means used to

                    >—</hi> The frames or sashes of a hothouse ought, before being glazed, to
                    receive two coats of white paint, to which a small portion of red lead has been
                    added to facilitate its drying, and to give increased strength and durability to
                    the paint.</p>
                <p>The panes in the roofs of hot-houses are generally of either of three forms; the
                    first is the square pattern; the second is the tapered, that is, terminating in
                    an obtuse angle; and the third the semicircular. The first is most generally
                    used; the second is considered an improvement on the first, in so far as the
                    tapered point carries off the rain down the centre of the pane, and thereby
                    preserves the astragals; but there is a loss in shaping the glass to the tapered
                    point. The third or semicircular is decidedly the best pattern of the three; the
                    water is not only drawn to the centre of the pane, and the astragals protected
                    from the rain, but this pattern has a more elegant appearance, when uniformly
                    glazed, than either of the two other shapes. There is no loss in cutting the
                    glass to the curve, and it is therefore not more expensive.</p>
                <p>The dimensions of hot-house panes are generally about six inches, and are made to
                    overlay each other, to an extent regulated by the circumstance of their being
                    puttied at the overlay or not.</p>
                <p>If it is intended to fill in the overlays with putty, they need not be more than
                    a quarter of an inch in depth; but if it is not intended to putty them, they
                    must then be at least five eighths of an mch.</p>
                <p>The overlays, however, ought always to be puttied, and that for two reasons.
                    First, because it will more certainly secure their being water-tight <hi
                    rend="subscript">;</hi> and because, in the next place, it will prevent the
                    breakage to which the panes are liable from the freezing of the water, or
                    moisture, which lodges in the overlay, and, expanding, shivers the glass in all
                    directions; when they are filled with putty, such an accident cannot happen.</p>
                <p>In glazing hot-house roofs, it must be observed, that the courses ought to run
                    from end to end, and that the smaller panes, when such are used, should be
                    reserved for the top.</p>
                <p>When sashes are glazed, they ought to stand for eight or ten days before taking
                    off the back putty, and they ought not to be painted for about three weeks
                    afterwards, that the putty may consolidate. Great care, too, should be taken,
                    when the sashes are newly glazed, that they be not in any way twisted or bent,
                    as such an accident would almost inevitably start the panes from their beds, and
                    thus render them pervious to water.</p>
                <p>When sashes are of considerable dimensions, say about six feet by three, they
                    should be strengthened by having two iron rods placed across them at equal
                    distances, and screwed to the astragals. This will serve to prevent the accident
                    of twisting, to which such frames are extremely liable, and which is very
                    injurious to them after they have been filled with glass.</p>
                <p>The putty used for glazing hot-houses ought to be of the very best description,
                    as, from the circumstance of its position, it is necessarily more exposed to the
                    action of the weather than in the perpendicular windows. The putty used for
                    filling in the overlays ought to be of black or lead colour, which, as every
                    glazier knows, is imparted to it by working it up with lamp-black; but as this
                    substance has the effect of weakening the putty, the defect may be remedied by
                    adding two pounds of white lead, ground in oil, to each stone of putty, and in a
                    similar proportion to smaller or greater quantities. Indeed all putty used in
                    glazing hot-houses ought to have a portion of white lead mixed with it, as it
                    adds greatly to its strength.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lattice or Lead Windows.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This
                    antique and singularly beautiful style of glazing has unaccountably fallen much
                    into disuse, although of late years it has certainly undergone something like a
                    resuscitation, in consequence of a revival of the public taste for stained
                    glass, and a growing predilection for Gothic architecture in churches, cottages,
                    and the like. For these, and for staircase windows, and indeed all windows
                    similarly situated, as in halls, lobbies, or the like, it is peculiarly
                    adapted.</p>
                <p>It may be proper to premise, that lead windows require stained or coloured glass
                    for producing their fullest and best effects, and it was with stained glass only
                    that they were originally constructed; but very neat and elegant windows are
                    executed in this style with plain glass, where variety and beauty of figure are
                    made to compensate foi the absence of colour</p>
                <p>Lead windows may be made to any pattern, and in this there is great scope for the
                    display of a correct taste. In the time of Elizabeth, this branch of the
                    glazier’s art was carried to great excellence, especially by one Walter Geddes,
                    who was employed in glazing most of the royal and public buildings of that
                    period. This person executed in this style some windows of transcendent beauty,
                    displaying an endless variety of the most elegant and elaborate figures. The
                    most useful and most common description of plain glass lead windows, however,
                    are those of the diamond or lozenge shape; but, as already said, they may be
                    made to any pattern desired. The following are a few specimens of lattice
                    windows. (See Plate <pb break="no" facs="nls:193521455"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-1455-0576"/>CCLXIX.) Fig. 1 is the east window of St Giles'
                    Church, Edinburgh. Fig. 2 is a less imposing, but still a very chaste and
                    beautiful, specimen of a lattice window. This has a beautiful effect by
                    introducing stained glass into the long skittle-shaped pieces, and in the
                    rosette in the centre. Fig. 3 represents the architecture of a window in Oxford
                    Cathedral, filled with stained glass in the Gothic style.</p>
                <p>The lead work can be adapted with ease to any pattern that may be chosen for the
                    glass; and it can likewise be made to any breadth, from one eighth to five
                    eighths of an inch. The one eighth, however, is only used for fancy work, and is
                    not as yet much in demand; that which is most generally used is three-eighth
                    lead. This width makes neater and better work than that of any other

                <p>The glazier may purchase prepared leading for windows in any quantity; but he
                    will produce it himself at half the cost, and probably more to his own
                    satisfaction. The apparatus and tools necessary for doing this are, a glazier’s
                    vice, or lead mill, moulds for casting the lead into slender bars or rods of
                    about eighteen inches in length, which is the first process; a three-fourth inch
                    chisel; a hard-wood fillet for forcing the glass into the grooves in the lead
                    frame-work; and an opener or wedge tool, made also of hard wood, or ebony, for
                    laying open the grooves for the reception of the glass; two copper bolts for
                    soldering, the end formed like an egg. A correct delineation of the vice or mill
                    alluded to is given in Plate CCLXX. in describing which, in its various
                    connected parts, the same letters of reference are adapted to the different
                    figures, so far as necessary, which, with the isometrical views, will facilitate

                    patterns, which are thus prepared for being forced through the machine. By an
                    ingenious construction of the handle, it is made to lock and unlock by inclined
                    planes, acting on studs, <hi rend="italic">aa.</hi> Fig. 2, a side view, also

                <p>The metal or cast being removed from the mould, a pair of the dies (one only of
                    each pair is represented), according to the pattern required, figs. 4, 5, 6, 7,
                    are placed in the machine, as seen at <hi rend="italic">cc,</hi> fig. 8,
                    isometrical view. After they are put in, a thin iron cover <hi rend="italic"
                    >(b,</hi> fig. 10), with an oblong hole in the middle, is put on to guide the
                    metal into the rollers. Figs. 9,10, and 11, represent three views of the machine
                    as prepared for operating. In figs. 9 and 11, the metal, <hi rend="italic"
                    >dd,</hi> is represented passing through the machine, which is accomplished by
                    turning the winch handle, <hi rend="italic">ee,</hi> acting on two equal sized
                    toothed wheels, <hi rend="italic">ff.</hi> On the axles of these are two
                    rollers, <hi rend="italic">gg,</hi> slightly serrated (dotted through in figs. 8
                    and 10); these rollers draw the metal through, while the dies give the desired
                    form. To allow the axles and rollers to be placed in the frame or body of the
                    machine, A, the cover, A, is removed by unscrewing the bolt, i, figs. 8, 10, 11.
                    The toothed wheels, <hi rend="italic">fj',</hi> are also taken off, by
                    unscrewing the nuts, A∕c. The tempering screw bolt, <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> is
                    for adjusting the dies after they are put iħ their place. The screw bolts, <hi

                <p>The lead intended to be employed in window making must be sqft, and of the very
                    best quality; and great care must be taken to have the moulds properly tempered,
                    otherwise the lead will not be equally diffused in them, and the castings
                    consequently not perfectly solid throughout, as they ought to be.</p>
                <p>If this is not attended to, that is, if the castings are not perfectly solid,
                    they will come out of the mill, to which they are presented after being taken
                    from the moulds, all fretted on the edges, and thus in a state totally unfit for
                    the purpose for which they were intended.</p>
                <p>The castings are, as already noticed, usually about eighteen inches in length,
                    and are afterwards extended by the mill represented by the figure above, to the
                    length of five or six feet.</p>
                <p>It may not be unnecessary to add, that the mill not only extends the lead, and
                    reduces it, at the pleasure of the operator, to the dimensions required, but at
                    the same time forms the grooves into which the edge of the glass is afterwards
                    introduced in forming the window.</p>
                <p>When the lead has been prepared in the manner described, the glazier ought to
                    proceed to cut out the panes wanted. For this operation he must prepare by first
                    outlining the full dimensions of the window, and then lining it off to the
                    pattern required, shaping the panes accordingly. If the window is of a large
                    size, this may be done by compartments, to be afterwards united, and thus be
                    more conveniently wrought. Great accuracy must be observed in cutting the panes,
                    or a very irregular panel will be produced, as those lines that ought to be
                    parallel or otherwise will not be correctly so, which will greatly injure the
                    appearance of the work.</p>
                <p>When all the glass has been cut for the window, the next thing to be done is to
                    open the grooves in the lead with the opener or wedge tool. The panes are then,
                    in order that they may be water-tight, fastened very firmly into the grooves
                    with the wooden fillet already spoken of (which may be fixed on the handle of
                    the chisel or cutting tooD, the parallel lines of lead being secured in their
                    proper places on the board, when the window is of the diamond shape, by a small
                    nail at either end, until the course is finished, when the work is permanently
                    fastened by running a small quantity of solder gently over the two connecting
                    pieces of lead at each joint, or angular point. When the window has been
                    completed, it should be removed from the working board to a flat table, and
                    there covered with a thick layer of cement, composed of white lead, lamp black,
                    red lead, litharge, and boiled linseed oil, with a half-worn paint brush, and
                    the composition carefully rubbed into every joint. This will render the window
                    completely impervious to the weather, as the cement, if properly laid on, will
                    fill every chink, where it will soon become as hard and durable as any other of
                    the materials of which the window is composed. When this operation has been
                    completed, clean the window with a cloth and whiting. Should the outside be
                    wanted black, omit the blacking in the first compost; and finish by laying on
                    the lamp black with a polishing brush.</p>
                <p>The window, on being fitted into the frame, that is, on ' being set in its place
                    in the building for which it is intended, ought to be supported with
                    three-eighth inch iron rods, extending three eighths of an inch beyond the
                    breadth of the frame on each side, running across it at the distance of from
                    twelve to fourteen inches from each other, and secured to the lead frame-work at
                    intervals, either with copper wire, or lead bands manufactured by the mill.
                    These rods, for obvious reasons, ought to be so arranged as to intersect the
                    window exactly at the terminating point of a row of the diamonds. For instance,
                    if the diamonds are each six inches in length or height, the first rod ought to
                    intersect the window at the top of the third row, or eighteen inches from the
                    bottom of the frame, and so on, until the window be equally divided in this way
                    throughout its whole length. If the diamond, again, be only three inches in
                    length, then the first rod ought to pass at the top of the fourth row, or twelve
                    inches from the bottom, this proportion of distance being, of course, maintained
                    throughout. The usual distance is fourteen inches, but this must be regulated by
                    the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193521468" xml:id="kp-eb0710-1468-0577"/>breadth of
                    the window between the mullions. If themul-lions are of stone, the grooves in
                    which the window is set ought to be filled up with Roman cement, or mastic. If
                    of wood, with oil putty.</p>
                <p>THE CUTTING DIAMOND.</p>
                <p>Before the introduction of the diamond as an agent in cutting glass, that
                    operation was performed by means of emery, sharp pointed instruments of the
                    hardest steel, and sometimes red-hot iron. These were the only contrivances
                    known and practised by the ancient glaziers.</p>
                <p>In considering the diamond in its relations to the purposes of the window-glass
                    cutter, there occur some circumstances not unworthy of remark. Amongst these, it
                    may be noticed, that the cutting point of the diamond must be a natural one; an
                    artificial point, however perfectly formed, will only scratch the glass, not cut
                    it. The diamond of a ring, for instance, will not cut a pane, but merely mark it
                    with rough superficial lines, which penetrate but a very little way inwards.
                    Artificial points, comers, or angles, therefore, produced by cutting the
                    diamond, are adapted only for writing or for drawing figures on glass, and such
                    were those used by Schwanhard, Rost, and the other old artists who were
                    celebrated for ornamenting glass vessels. The cutting diamond does not write so
                    well on glass, from the circumstance of its being apt to enter too deeply, and
                    take too firm a hold of the surface, and thus become intractable. It may further
                    be noticed, that an accidental point produced by fracturing the diamond, is as
                    unfit for cutting as an artificial one. Such a point will also merely scratch
                    the glass. No point, in short, that is not given by the natural formation of the
                    mineral, will answer the purposes of the window-glass cutter.</p>
                <p>The large sparks, as the diamonds used for cutting glass are called, are
                    generally preferred to the small ones, from the circumstance of their being
                    likely to possess, although this is by no means invariably the case, a number of
                    cutting points; while the very small sparks are not always found to possess more
                    than one. Thus, if the point of the latter is worn or broken off, although the
                    spark be turned, and reset in its socket, it will still be without the power of
                    cutting, and consequently useless, while the former, on undergoing the same
                    operation, will present a new and effective point.</p>
                <p>The large sparks are called <hi rend="italic">mother mark»,</hi> and are
                    sometimes cut down into as many smaller fragments bearing the same name, as
                    there are natural points in them. Each of these, therefore, can have only one
                    cutting point, and are consequently only proportionately valuable to the
                    glazier, since they cannot be restored by resetting.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Setting of Diamonds</hi> is a process with which every
                    glazier ought to be acquainted; nor is it an art of difficult acquirement; some
                    practice, and a little patience, are all that is necessary.</p>
                <p>After having selected a stone, as clear and pellucid as possible, resembling a
                    drop of water, and of an octoedrical shape, or as near to that form as it can be
                    procured, the workman proceeds to ascertain which is its cutting point, or, if
                    it has more than one, which is the best. This will be found to be that point
                    which has the cutting edges of the crystal placed exactly at right angles to
                    each other, and passing precisely through a point of intersection made by the
                    crossing of the edges.</p>
                <p>He then provides a piece of copper or brass wire, a quarter of an inch in
                    diameter, having <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> hole drilled in one of its ends
                    large enough to contain three fourths of the diamond to be set. Having
                    temporarily secured the diamond in this hole, the setter ascertains the cutting
                    point, by trying it on a piece of glass; and when he has discovered it, he marks
                    its position by making <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> slight notch in the wire
                    with a file or otherwise, exactly opposite to the cutting point, as a guide to
                    him in his operations when he comes to fix it permanently in the socket head of
                    the handle. When doing this, care is taken to keep it exactly parallel with the
                    inclined plane of the socket head.</p>
                <p>The cutting point having been ascertained, and the diamond fixed into its place,
                    the wire is then cut off about a Quarter of an inch below the diamond, and filed
                    down to ht exactly into the aperture in the socket head, into which it must be
                    soldered. The rough or superfluous metal around the stone is removed with a
                    file; and, lastly, the setting is polished with emery or sand paper. Such is the
                    most approved method of setting new diamonds, and it applies equally to the
                    resetting of old ones. But in the latter case, the first process, that of
                    detaching the stone from its bed, is accomplished either by means of a knife, or
                    by applying the blowpipe.</p>
                <p>The art of managing the diamonds in glass-cutting, so as to produce effective
                    results, can only be attained by considerable experience. The diamond must be
                    held in a particular position, and with a particular inclination, otherwise it
                    will not cut, and the slightest deviation from either renders an attempt to do
                    so abortive. In the hands of an inexperienced person, it merely scratches the
                    glass, leaving a long rough furrow, but no fissure. The glazier judges by his
                    ear of the cut made. When the cut is a clean and effective one, the diamond
                    produces, in the act of being drawn along, a sharp, keen, and equid sound. When
                    the cut is not a good one, this sound is harsh, grating, and irregular. On
                    perceiving this, the operator alters the inclination and position of his
                    diamond, until the proper sound is emitted, when he proceeds with his cut.</p>
                <p>Although the diamond cuts glass of an ordinary thickness with facility, it does
                    not easily cut that which is of more than a medium thickness. In such cases, the
                    desired division is effected by the application of a hot iron, which being
                    brought in contact with the glass at certain points, produces a fissure in the
                    direction required.</p>
                <p>The diamonds employed in glass-cutting, are of the description known by the
                    technical name of <hi rend="italic">bort,</hi> a classification which includes
                    all such pieces as are too small to be cut, or are of a bad colour, and
                    consequently unfit for ornamental purposes. These are accordingly selected from
                    the better sort, and sold separately, at an inferior price.</p>
                <p>Though there are many substances that will scratch glass, the diamond was thought
                    to be the only one that would cut it; but some experiments of Dr Wollaston have
                    shown that this is not strictly correct. That eminent philosopher gave to pieces
                    of sapphire, ruby, spinel ruby, rock crystal, and some other substances, that
                    peculiar curvilinear edge which forms the cutting point in the diamond, and in
                    which, and in its hardness, its singular property of cutting entirely lies, and
                    with these succeeded in cutting glass with a perfectly clear fissure. They
                    lasted, however, but for a very short time, soon losing their edge, although
                    prepared at a great expense of labour and care; while the diamond comes ready
                    formed from the hand of nature, and will last for many years.</p>
                <p>MANUFACTURE or FLINT-GLASS OR CRYSTAL.</p>
                <p>This is the species of glass of which the finest and most beautiful articles used
                    for domestic purposes or for ornament are made. It is also largely employed in
                    the manufacture of optical glasses, and for other philosophical purposes. It is
                    the heaviest, the most brilliant, and also the most costly, of all the vitrified
                    compounds. In order to convey an idea of the manufacture of flint-glass, we
                    propose to give an account of a work in the vicinity of Edinburgh. Our
                    description will be best understood by fire-quently<pb break="no"

                    Fig. 1 represents a cone twenty-two feet two inches in diameter at the bottom, '
                    eight feet diameter at the top, and sixty feet in height. It contains twelve
                    arches^ α is a front view of one of them. Each of these arches contains one pot,
                    and the whole of them are heated by means of flues which ramify round the whole
                    cone, proceeding from one general furnace. The furnace, which is circular, is
                    fifteen feet four inches in diameter, and six feet in height inside to the
                    centre of the crown. Fig. 2 represents a pot which is manufactured of
                    Stourbridge clay, of the best quality. From the bottom to the highest part the
                    pot is thirty-eight inches in height, and the width outside thirty-four inches.
                    The orifice of the pot measures about right inches across. About fourteen hours
                    are necessary before the pots can all be filled, on account of the metal sinking
                    into less bulk as it melts. During the whole time the furnace must be kept as
                    hot as possible. After the pots are all filled, about forty-four hours elapse
                    before the vitrified mass is brought to a proper state for working. More or less
                    time is necessary according to the state of the materials, and from time to time
                    the pots must be carefully scummed in order to remove any impurities.</p>
                <p>As in every other branch of glass making, the proportions of the ingredients used
                    for making flint-glass vary with almost every manufactory. The following is
                    reckoned an excellent compound. Fine white sand, six hundredweights and a half;
                    red lead or litharge <hi rend="italic">(minium),</hi> three hundredweights and a
                    half; calcined potash, two hundredweights; nitre, eighty-four pounds; manganese,
                    from eight to eighteen ounces, according to circumstances; arsenic, from one to
                    two pounds; cullet, or broken crystal, a quantity sufficient to fill up the
                    pots. The above quantities of materials fill two pots.' On the authority of the

                    rend="superscript"> l</hi> a very excellent article may be made from 120 parts
                    of fine white sand, forty parts wril purified pearl ash, thirty-five paru
                    litharge, thirteen parts nitre, and a small quantity of black oxide of
                    manganese. The principal difference between flint and other kinds of glass is in
                    there bring present in its composition a considerable quantity of some metallic
                    oxide. All metals in a state of oxidation will combine with silica and an alkali
                    to form glass. Only lead and bismuth, however, can be employed in sufficient
                    quantity so as to produce a bright colourless article. The other metals impart
                    various hues to the mass. Lead being the cheapest of the two metals, is that
                    universally employed. If it be used, however, in too great a quantity, it will
                    not only tinge the glass of a yellow colour, but produce an inconveniently soft
                    material.</p>
                <p>After the metal has been brought to a state when it is fit for being wrought, the
                    workmen commence operations. The implemenU which they use are few in number and
                    simple in construction. The first tool required is a hollow iron tube between
                    four and five feet in length, and one eighth of an inch in the bore; it is
                    technically called the <hi rend="italic">iron,</hi> and is dipped into the pot
                    in the manner represented in Plate CCLXXI. figs. 5 and 6. After a sufficient
                    quantity has been collected on the end of this rod, it is withdrawn from the pot
                    and suspended for a few seconds in a perpendicular position, that the glass,
                    which is at the under end, may be lengthened out beyond the rod. It is then
                    rolled upon the marver. This process, by which the glass is rolled into a
                    cylindrical form, is represented by fig. 7. The glass is now of a consistency to
                    admit ņf its being blown into a hollow globe, as exhibited in fig. 8. The globe,
                    however, not being rendered sufficiently thin by this first distension, it is
                    repeated until the vessel has assumed the dimensions required. In every case of
                    blowing, the pressure of the breath must be continued upon the tube for a short
                    while, to prevent the globe from collapsing, which would be the case were the
                    confined air allowed to escape. The external pressure would be greater than the
                    resistance offered from within. If it is required to elongate the globe, this
                    may be effected by dexterously whirling it in a circular manner through the air.
                    The crystal is now in a fit state for lying horizontally upon the <hi
                    rend="italic">chair arms,</hi> as shown in figs. 9 and 10. The chair arms are
                    merely two pieces of wood lying parallel to each other upon the workman’s seat
                    or chair. The arm which lies next the heated metal is protected from injury by
                    being covered with an iron plate. Another instrument, called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >punty</hi> or “pontil,” is employed. This is a solid iron rod of a cylindrical
                    shape, and smaller and lighter than the hollow tube at first used. A small
                    quantity of melted glass is collected upon one end of this by an assistant, and
                    applied to the end of the globe, as shown in fig. 9. The two masses of glass are
                    thus united together, and that attached to the hollow tube is easily separated
                    from it by touching it near to where the tube enters the globe, with a small
                    piece of iron wetted with water. By this means the glass cracks, and a smart
                    blow upon the iron tube completes the disunion. The workman now takes the punty
                    from his assistant, and laying it upon the chair arms, rolls it backwards and
                    forwards with his left arm, whilst with his right he moulds it into the various
                    shapes required, by means of a very few simple instruments. By one of these,
                    called a <hi rend="italic">procello,</hi> the blades of which are attached by an
                    elastic bow, like a pair of sugar tongs, the dimensions of the vessel can be
                    enlarged or contracted at pleasure. Any superfluous material is easily cut away
                    by means of a pair of scissars, glass when red hot being very easily divided.
                    For smoothing and equalizing the sides of the vessel, a piece of wood, generally
                    cedar, is used; and the workman is also furnished with compasses and graduated
                    scale, to ensure the regularity in shape and size required. The article being
                    finished, is detached from the punty in the same way as formerly, and weighed in
                    a pair of scales to see that there has been the proper quantity of glass
                    consumed in its manufacture. It is then carried by means of a pronged stick to
                    the annealing oven, or <hi rend="italic">lier</hi> as it is technically
                    called.</p>
                <p>The process of annealing is one of the last importance; because, were glass not
                    properly annealed, it would crack with eyen very slight changes of temperature;
                    see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Annealing</hi> in this work. Plate CCLXXI.
                    fig. 3, represents an annealing oven. It is simply a long, low, rectangular
                    chamber, heated at one end, and provided with various shallow iron trays, which
                    can be passed along the bottom of the chamber. Upon these trays the manufactured
                    goods are put; and the lier pans, as they are successively filled, are pushed
                    towards the colder end of the oven, from whence they are taken in a state little
                    warmer than the temperature of the external atmosphere.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Glass Cutting</hi> The cutting, or rather the grinding of
                    crystal, forms a distinct business in a flint-glass-house. In the manufactory
                    before alluded to, steam power is employed to give motion to the machinery by
                    which the process of cutting is effected. A shaft proceeding from the engine
                    causes the revolution of several large drums, which run along each side of the
                    cutting room. Upon these drums belts run, which proceeding upwards, pass over
                    smaller wheels (such as <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> fig. 4). By this means the
                    cutting wheel <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is made to revolve with great celerity.
                    Opposite it the workman is placed, and applies to the surface of the wheel the
                    article which is to be cut. Above the cutting wheel is a conical-shaped vessel
                    <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> made of wood, and filled with fine sand, which being
                    moistened with water, runs <pb break="no" facs="nls:193521494"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-1494-0579"/>through upon the cutting wheel at the lower
                    extremity, in a regular discharge. The hole in the bottom is of such dimensions,
                    and so situated, as to admit the escape of the requisite quantity of moistened
                    sand. Below the wheel is a vessel, ⅛ which receives the sand and water run down
                    upon the wheel. Every one who has seen a crystal shop, must have remarked the
                    infinitely varied appearances which the articles formed of flint-glass present.
                    It is evident that, to produce these, the wheels must be of very various forms,
                    broad, narrow, flat edged, mitre-edged, that is, having two faces, which form a
                    sharp angle at their point of meeting, convex, concave, &amp;c. They are made of
                    iron both cast and malleable, of Yorkshire stone, and of willow wood. The iron
                    wheels are used in the roughest part of the operations, and articles ground by
                    these are further smoothed down by a wheel of Yorkshire stone. Wooden wheels are
                    employed in the further smoothing and polishing of the crystal. For smoothing
                    the surface, the edge of the wheel, is dressed with either rotten stone or
                    pumice stone; and for imparting to it the highest degree of polish, putty powder
                    is employed.</p>
                <p>There are certain crystal shades in use for softening the light diffused by
                    lamps. The process by which this lessening of the transparency is effected i»
                    called frosting. The roughness is imparted to the inner, not the outer surface
                    of the vessel; and it is done by the former being fixed in a lathe, and rubbed
                    by a workman with a piece of wood covered with wet sand.</p>
                <p>BOTTLE-GLASS·</p>
                <p>Plate CCLXVΠI. fig. 4, is a ground plan, showing all the necessary buildings for
                    two bottle-houses, and in one of the houses the ground plan of a four-pot
                    furnace and ash arches. The furnace is an oblong square, similar to what we have
                    described the crown-furnace to be, but arched over in the barrel shape. It is
                    erected in the centre of the brick cone, above a cave, which admits the
                    atmosphere to the grating. The working holes of this fumace, opposite each pot,
                    for putting in the materials and taking out the liquid glass, are each about one
                    foot in diameter. At each angle of the furnace there is also a hole about the
                    same size communicating with the calcining arch, and admitting the flame from
                    the main furnace, which reverberates on and calcines the materials in the arch.
                    Fig. 1 shows the main furnace; 2, 3, 4, 5, the ash arches for calcining the
                    materials; 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, annealing arches; 12, two-pot arches; 13, what is
                    considered an improved plan; 14, clay-house, for picking, grinding, sifting, and
                    afterwards working the clay into paste for the purpose of manufacturing pots;
                    15, mill house for grinding clay; 16, a building containing a calcar furnace for
                    experiments, or for preparing the materials, when the ash arch attached to the
                    main furnace is under repair, including, 1, a sand crib, and 2, an ash crib for
                    sifting and mixing the materials, sufficient for two houses.</p>
                <p>The common green or bottle glass is made of the coarsest materials; sand, lime,
                    sometimes clay, any kind of alkali or alkaline ashes, whose cheapness may
                    recommend it to the manufacturer, and sometimes the vitreous slag produced from
                    the fusion of iron ore. The mixture most commonly used is soap-maker’s waste, in
                    the proportion of three measures to one measure of sand. The green colour of
                    this glass is occasioned by the existence of a portion of iron in the sand, and,
                    it may be. also in the vegetable ashes of which it is composed.</p>
                <p>To distinguish it from flint-glass, which pays a higher duty, government does not
                    allow the use of any but the coarsest kind of sea or river sand. When castor oil
                    or champaigne bottles are wanted, a portion of crown-glass cullet is added, to
                    improve the colour. The impurity of the alkali, and the abundance of fluxing
                    materials of an earthy nature, combined with the intense heat to which they are
                    subjected, occasion the existence of but a very small proportion of real saline
                    matter in the glass; and thereby render it better than flint-glass for holding
                    fluids possessing corrosive properties.</p>
                <p>The soap-maker’s waste is generally calcined in two of the coarse arches, figs. 3
                    and 4, which are kept at a strong red heat from twenty-four to thirty hours, the
                    time required to melt the materials and work them into glass, which is termed a
                    journey. After the soap-maker’s waste is taken out of the arch, it is ground and
                    mixed with sand in the proportions already mentioned. This mixture is put into
                    the fine arches, and again calcined during the working journey, which occupies
                    about ten or twelve hours more. When the journey is over, the pots are again
                    filled with the red-hot materials out of the fine calcining arch. Six hours are
                    required to melt this additional quantity of materials. The pots are again
                    filled up, and in about four hours this filling is also melted. The furnace is
                    then kept at the highest possible degree of heat, and in the course of from
                    twelve to sixteen hours, according as the experience of the founder may
                    determine, the materials in the pots are formed into a liquid glass fit for
                    making bottles. The furnace is now checked by closing the doors of the cave, and
                    the metal cooling, it becomes more dense, and all the extraneous matter not
                    formed into glass floats upon the top. Before beginning to work, this is skimmed
                    off in the way already described in our account of crown-glass making. A
                    sufficient quantity of coals is added at intervals, to keep the furnace at a
                    working heat till the journey is finished.</p>
                <p>After the pots have been skimmed, the person who begins the work is the gatherer,
                    who, after heating the pipe, gathers on it a small quantity of metal. After
                    allowing this to cool a little, he again gathers such a quantity as he conceives
                    to be sufficient to make a bottle. This is then handed to the blower, who, while
                    blowing through the tube, rolls the metal upon a stone, at the same time forming
                    the neck of the bottle. He then puts the metal into a brass or cast-iron mould
                    of the shape of the bottle wanted, and, continuing to blow through the tube,
                    brings it to the desired form. The patent mould now in use is made of brass, the
                    inside finely polished, divided into two pieces, which the workman, by pressing
                    a spring with his foot, opens and shuts at pleasure. The blower then hands it to
                    the finisher, who touches the neck of the bottle with a small piece of iron dipt
                    in water, which cuts it completely off from the pipe. He next attaches the
                    punty, which is a little metal gathered from the pot, to the bottom of the
                    bottle, and thereby gives it the shape which it usually presents. This punty may
                    be used for from eighteen to twenty-four dozen of bottles. It is occasionally
                    dipped into sand to prevent its adhering to the bottle. The finisher then warms
                    the bottle at the furnace, and taking out a small quantity of metal on what is
                    termed a ring iron, he turns it once round the mouth, forming the ring seen at
                    the mouth of bottles. He then employs a shears to give shape to the neck. One of
                    the blades of this shears has a piece of brass in the centre, tapered like a
                    common cork, which forms the inside mouth; to the other blade is attached a
                    piece of brass, used to form the ring. The bottle is then lifted by the neck on
                    a fork by a little fellow about ten years of age, and carried to the annealing
                    arch, where the bottles are placed in bins above one another. This arch is kept
                    s little below melting heat, till the whole quantity, which amounts to ten or
                    twelve gross in each arch, is deposited, when the fire is allowed to die
                    out.</p>
                <p>Such is a brief view of the various methods of manufacturing glass. The physical
                    properties of this useful sub <pb break="no" facs="nls:193521507"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-1507-0580"/>stance will naturally fall to be treated of under
                    the heads of the several sciences in which glass is employed.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of glass is subjected to the excise laws; and the duties are not
                    only very heavy, but the regulations for levying them are most complex and
                    oppressive. The injuries which are inflicted upon trade by such a system of
                    taxation are strikingly exemplified in the case of glass. In 1794, when the duty
                    was L.l. Is. 5d. per cwt. for plate and flint, the other kinds being taxed in
                    proportion, the quantities paying duty were as follow: Flint and plate,
                    67,615cwt j broad, 20,607; crown, 83,940; bottle, 227,467. The duties were
                    successively raised, until in 1813 they amounted to L.4. 18s. The result of this
                    was, that in 1816 the consumption had declined to, plate, 29,600; broad, 6140;
                    crown, 55,502; bottle, 155,595.</p>
                <p>In 1825 the duty was reduced one half, and the consumption rose to about what it
                    was in 1794. But since the wealth and population of the country have more than

                <p>We can only notice a few of the regulations as to the manufacture of glass. Every
                    glass-maker must take out an annual license, which costs him L.20 for each
                    glasshouse; and he must make entry at the next excise-office, of all
                    work-houses, furnaces, pots, pot-chambers, annealing arches, warehouses, and the
                    like, under a penalty of L.200. Previously to the charging of the pots, twelve
                    hours’ notice must be given in writing, of the time of beginning, the weiġht of
                    metal, and the species of glass, on pain of L.50. If any material or preparation
                    be put into a pot after notice has been given and a gauge taken by the officer,
                    a penalty of L.50 is incurred; and if the manufacture be of flint-glass, the
                    penalty is L.200. The officers are allowed to have access to the works at all
                    hours by day and night, any attempt to obstruct them incurring a penalty of
                    L.200; and the counterfeiting, altering, or effacing any marks made by them
                    being visited with a penalty of L.500; connivance at its being done subjects the
                    aggressor to a fine of L.200. The whole of the metal intended to be manufactured
                    into common-glass bottles is to be worked within sixteen hours next after the
                    same shall be begun; and when the bottles are put into the annealing arches,
                    manufacturers are then, in the presence of the officer, to charge the pots with
                    fresh materials, other than broken glass, not less than fifty pounds weight; and
                    declarations are to be delivered in writing, of the number of such bottles, on
                    penalty of L.100. Fraudulent weighing of glass is visited with a heavy penalty.
                    Notices are not to be given for drawing out bottles, but only between eight
                    o’clock in the morning and six o’clock in the afternoon. No crown-glass, German
                    sheet-glass, or broad window-glass, can be manufactured beyond the thickness of
                    one-ninth part of an inch, without being subjected to the duty paid on
                    plate-glass. Such are a few of the laws and regulations, alike vexatious and
                    impolitic, which have retarded the progress of glassmaking, and that too at a
                    time when almost every other species of manufacture had far more than doubled
                    itself. In fact, from the making of the pots themselves to the packing up of the
                    glass for sale, every thing is done after a certain manner, which is determined
                    by act of parliament. This being the case, how improvements are to be made in
                    the art it is difficult to conceive. The laws which regulate the packing and
                    exportation of glass are equally burdensome with those relative to its
                    manufacture. The amount of drawback allowed upon this article will be seen from
                    the table above given. (γ. γ. γ.) <pb break="no" facs="nls:193521520"

                    rend="italic smallcaps"> Glass.</hi> Professor Beckmann has proved, that, as
                    early as the year 1670, the art of etching upon glass was discovered by Henry
                    Schwanhard, son of George Schwanhard, who was a celebrated glass-cutter,
                    patronised by the Emperor Ferdinand III. about the middle of the last century.
                    At the time of his death, 1697, the father practised his art at Prague and
                    Ratisbon. Whether the son followed the same business at the same towns, or
                    removed to Nuremberg, is not very evident; but in the year above mentioned, some
                    <hi rend="italic">aqua-regia</hi> (nitre-muriatic acid) having accidentally
                    fallen on his spectacles, he was surprised to find the glass corroded by it, and
                    become quite soft. He thus, it is said, found himself in possession of a liquid
                    by which he could etch writing and figures upon plates of glass.</p>
                <p>But it is probable, as Beckmann seems to think, that he had discovered the
                    fluoric acid itself; for in the year 1725 there appeared in a periodical work
                    the following receipt for making a powerful acid, by which figures of every kind
                    can be etched upon glass.</p>
                <p>“When the <hi rend="italic">spiritus nitri</hi><hi rend="italic">per
                    distillationem</hi> has passed into the recipient, ply it with a strong fire,
                    and when well dephlegmated, pour it, as it corrodes ordinary glass, into a
                    Weidenberg flask. Then throw into it a pulverised green Bohemian emerald,
                    otherwise called <hi rend="italic">hesphorus</hi> (which, when reduced to
                    powder, and heated, emits in the dark a green light), and place it in warm sand
                    for twenty-four hours. Take a piece of glass well cleaned, and freed from all
                    grease by means of a ley; put a border of wax round it, about an inch in height,
                    and cover it all over with the above acid. The longer you let it stand so much
                    the better; and at the end of some time the glass will be corroded, and the
                    figures which have been traced out with sulphur and varnish will appear as if
                    raised above the pane of glass.”</p>
                <p>That the Bohemian emerald, or <hi rend="italic">hesphorus,</hi> mentioned in this
                    receipt, is green sparry fluor, cannot, says the professor, be doubted; and he
                    seems to have as little doubt of the receipt itself having passed from
                    Schwanhard and his scholars to the periodical work of 1725, from which it was
                    inserted in the Oekonomische Encyclopadie of Krunitz. This supposition certainly
                    acquires a considerable degree of probability from the similarity of
                    Schwanhard’s method of etching to that which is here recommended, and which is
                    so different from what is now followed. At present the glass is covered with a
                    varnish either of isinglass dissolved in water, or of turpentine oil mixed with
                    a little white lead, through which the figures to be etched are traced as on
                    copper; but Schwanhard, when he had drawn his figures, covered them with
                    varnish, and then by his liquid corroded the glass around them. His figures,
                    therefore, when the varnish was removed, remained smooth and clear, appearing
                    raised from a dim or dark ground; and Μ. Beckmann, who had persuaded some
                    ingenious artists to make trial of this ancient method of etching, declares that
                    such figures have a much better effect than those which are cut into the
                    glass.</p>
