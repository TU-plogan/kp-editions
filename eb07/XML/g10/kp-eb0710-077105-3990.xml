                <p><label type="entry">GRENADA</label>, an island in the West Indies, situated
                    between the parallels of 12. 20. and 11. 58. N. lat., and 61. 20. and 61. 35. W.
                    long. It was discovered in the year 1498, by Christopher Columbus, who found it
                    possessed by a numerous and warlike people, from whom, however, the Spaniards
                    were attracted by the nobler prize which they had to contend for upon the
                    American continent. The Charaibes remained in peaceful possession of their
                    territory until the year 1650, when Du Parquet, the French governor of
                    Martinique, sent out an expedition, consisting of 200 adventurers, to take
                    possession of it. This they finally effected, first by treachery, and then upon
                    the principle of wholesale extirpation. The inhabitants were divested of their
                    property by a fictitious purchase, and refusing to surrender their natural
                    heritage for a few knives, glass-beads, and other trinkets, a war ensued, which
                    ended in the extermination of the natives. The colony, however, underwent a
                    series of revolutions and calamities, but the result was the establishment of
                    the authority of Du Parquet and his lieutenant. In a few years, however, the
                    island became vested in the crown of France, after the colonists had severely
                    suffered from the cruelty and rapacity of an insolent governor. For many years
                    the colony remained in a state of poverty and depression; and the Abbé Raynal
                    informs us that, in 1700, the island contained no more than 251 whites and 525
                    blacks, who were employed on three plantations of sugar, and fifty-two of
                    indigo. Grenada surrendered on capitulation to Great Britain in 1762, to which
                    country it was finally ceded by the definitive treaty of peace which took place
                    in the year following. The island hav- ⅛g become a British colony, certain
                    stipulations were made in favour of the inhabitants; but it does not seem to
                    have prospered; and it was retaken by the French in 1779. By the general
                    pacification which took place in January 1783, it was restored to Great Britain,
                    to which it has ever since been attached, although the French, during an
                    insurrection of the slaves, which took place towards the close of the last
                    century, attempted again to obtain possession of it. Grenada is computed to be
                    about twenty-five miles in length, and twelve miles in breadth at the centre,
                    but it gradually narrows towards eithēr extremity. It contains about 80,000
                    acres of land, but the quantity actually under cultivation has never exceeded
                    60,000. The general aspect of Grenada is extremely lonely, but mountainous and
                    picturesque. The interior and northwest coast consist of continuous ridges of
                    hills, rounded in their outline, and clothed with vast forest trees and
                    brushwood. An irregular range of mountains runs across the island from north to
                    south, which in some parts has an elevation of 3000 feet above the level of the
                    sea. From this main chain several lesser ridges strike off, forming rich and
                    picturesque valleys. The island is in general very fertile and well
                    cultivated.</p>
                <p>With regard to the geology of Grenada, a regular definition of the stratification
                    can scarcely be given, on account of the country being rugged and abrupt. The
                    great mass of the mountains consist of sandstone, greywacke, hornblende, and
                    argillaceous schist. The animals of Grenada are few and uninteresting to the
                    naturalist The medium temperature throughout the year is estimated at eighty-two
                    degrees of Fahrenheit in the low country, but in the more elevated parts it is
                    of course lower. A considerable quantity of rain falls, and throughout the year
                    showers descend. Hurricanes are comparatively mild and infrequent, but shocks of
                    earthquakes are sometimes experienced. Of late years the climate has been
                    materially improved. Grenada is watered by rivers and fresh-water springs, which
                    derive their source from a lake called the Grand Etang, which is situated near
                    the centre of the island, at an elevation of 1740 feet, amidst mountain scenery.
                    Along thecoast are numerous safe and handsome bays and harbours. The chief
                    products are sugar, cocoa, coffee, and cotton; indigo and tobacco are also
                    raised, together with luxuriant crops of fruits and vegetables, which here grow
                    in great abundance, and arrive at high perfection. The waters abound with fish,
                    and there is also a profusion of wild game. The island is divided into six
                    parishes, St Patrick, St Andrew, St John, St Mark, St David, and St George. In
                    the last of these is situated the capital, St George, or George Town, which is
                    built upon a peninsula projecting into a spacious bay on the west or lee side of
                    the island, not far from the southern extremity. It is embosomed in an
                    amphitheatre of hills, and chiefly situated on elevations which rise from the
                    bay; the consequence is, that the streets are steep. The houses are well built,
                    and on the whole the town has a handsome appearance. It is divided by a ridge,
                    which, running into the sea, forms on one side what is termed the Carenage,
                    which is a large basin of water, surrounded by wharfs, and in the vicinity of
                    which the principal merchants reside. In this carenage the ships lie landlocked,
                    and in deep water, close to the wharfs. The entrance is defended by a citadel
                    called Fort George, which is built upon a rocky eminence. On the left the land
                    rises gradually to some height, on which elevation the fortifications of
                    Hospital Hill are erected, and a long ridge, which falls towards the middle,
                    connects this fort with Richmond heights, which constitute the background of the
                    scene, and which are also fortified. The ridge which connects Fort George with
                    Hospital Hill also divides the carenage from the larger portion of the town,
                    which contains the market-place, and looks upon the bay. Upon this hill are
                    built some of the principal houses, the church, and the parsonage. At its
                    extremity is the court-house, and, nearly opposite, the Catholic chapel. Besides
                    the carenage, there is another spacious<pb break="no" facs="nls:193524003"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4003-0772"/> sheet of water, called the Lagoon, which is
                    separated from the former by a reef passable only in boats. This of itself would
                    constitute an excellent harbour, and it was at one time contemplated to join the
                    two, but this has never been effected. The public buildings of George Town are
                    the court-house, which is a fine building, provided with etery necessary
                    accommodation; the jail, which is of considerable dimensions, having a yard and
                    tread-mill; the church, a handsome building, with a spire and clock; the Roman
                    Catholic chapel, the Methodist meeting-house, the custom-house, and the offices
                    of the secretary and treasurer. The market-place is a square piece of ground of
                    considerable dimensions, surrounded by houses irregularly built. The other towns
                    of Grenada are, properly speaking, only inconsiderable villages or hamlets,
                    which are generally situated at the bays or shipping places.</p>
                <p>Between St Vincent and Grenada there is a cluster of islands called Grenadines,
                    some of which are dependencies of Grenada. Of these, Cariacou is the most
                    important. It constitutes a parish containing 6913 acres of land, and is about
                    nineteen miles in circumference. It is fertile and well cultivated, but it
                    suffers from drought Cotton was formerly the chief article of cultivation, but
                    sugar is the staple article now raised. In a good season the average produce is
                    upwards of 2,000,000 lbs. The chief town is called Hillsborough: it contains a
                    church and rectory.</p>
                <p>The following return shows the different products of Grenada and the Grenadines
                    in 1830: Sugar, 22,100,953 pounds; rum, 890,434 gallons; molasses, 255,679
                    gallons; coffee, 26,122 pounds; cocoa, 337,903 pounds; cotton, 97,804 pounds.
                    The following is an account of the quantities of the three great articles,
                    sugar, coffee, and rum, imported from Grenada into the united kingdom, in the
                    year 1832: Sugar, 188,231 hundredweights, 1 quarter, 14 pounds; coffee, 8749
                    pounds; rum, 103,654 proof gallons. The official value of the imports into the
                    united kingdom from Grenada was, in 1806, L.509,010; in 1823, L.387,546; and in
                    1831, L.303,906. The declared value of British and Irish produce and
                    manufactures exported from the united kingdom to Grenada was, in 1823, L.67,792,
                    and in 1831, L.68,377. The number and tonnage of vessels to and from the united
                    kingdom and Grenada, for the years 1823 and 1831, were as follow:</p>
