                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    military order of knighthood, the most noble and ancient of any lay-order in the
                    world, instituted by Edward III. The knights companions are generally princes
                    and peers; and the king of England is the sovereign or chief of the order. The
                    number of knights was originally twenty-six; but six were added in 1786, on
                    account of the increase of the royal family. They are a college or corporation,
                    having a great and little seal.</p>
                <p>Their officers are a prelate, chancellor, registrar, king-at-arms, and usher of
                    the black rod. They have also a dean, and twelve canons and petty canons,
                    vergers, and twenty-six pensioners or poor knights. The prelate is the head.
                    This office is vested in the Bishop of Winchester, and has ever been so. Next to
                    the prelate is the chancellor, which office is vested in the Bishop of
                    Salisbury, who keeps the seals. The next is the registrar, wlκ&gt; by his oath
                    is to enter upon the registry, the scrutinies, elections, penalties, and other
                    acts of the order, with all fidelity. The Dean of Windsor is always registrar
                    <hi rend="italic">ex officio.</hi> The fourth officer is Garter and
                    king-at-arms, being two distinct offices united in one person. The Garter
                    carries the rod and sceptre <pb break="no" facs="nls:193518465"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-8465-0346"/>at the feast of St George, the protector of this
                    order, when the sovereign is present; he notifies the election of new knights,
                    attends the solemnity of their installation, carries the garter to foreign
                    princes, and others; and he is the principal officer within the college of arms,
                    and chief of the heralds. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">King-at-abms.)</hi> All
                    these officers except the prelate have fees and pensions. The college of the
                    order is seated in the castle of Windsor, within the chapel of St George, and
                    the charter-house, erected by the founder for that purpose. The habit and ensign
                    of the order are, a garter, mantle, cape, george, and collar. The three first
                    were assigned the knights companions by the founder, and the george and collar
                    by Henry VIII.</p>
                <p>The Garter challenges pre-eminence over all the other parts of the dress, by
                    reason that from it the noble order is denominated; that it is the first part of
                    the habit presented to foreign princes and absent knights, who, as well as all
                    other knights-elect, are therewith first adorned; and it is of so great honour,
                    that by the bare investiture with this noble ensign, the knights are esteemed
                    companions of the greatest military order in the world. It is worn on the left
                    leg, between the knee and calf, and is enamelled with this motto, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hani</hi><hi rend="italic">soit qui mal y pense;</hi> the meaning
                    of which is, that King Edward having laid claim to the kingdom of France,
                    retorted shame and defiance upon those who should dare to think amiss of the
                    justen-terprise he had undertaken for recovering his lawful right to that crown;
                    and that the bravery of those knights whom he had elected into this order was
                    such as would enable him to maintain the quarrel against those who thought ill
                    of it.</p>
                <p>The mantle is the chief of the vestments made use of upon all solemn occasions.
                    The colour of the mantle is by the statutes appointed to be blue. The length of
                    the train of the mantle alone distinguishes the sovereign from the knights
                    companions. To the collar of the mantle is fixed a pair of long strings,
                    anciently woven with blue silk only, but now twisted round, and made of Venice
                    gold and silk, of the colour of the robes, with knobs or buttons, and tassels at
                    the end. The left shoulder of the mantle has from the institution been adorned
                    with a large garter, with the device. Within this is the cross of the order,
                    which was ordained to be worn at all times by King Charles I. At length the star
                    was introduced, being a sort of cross irradiated with beams of silver. The
                    collar is appointed to be composed of pieces of gold in fashion of garters, the
                    ground enamelled blue, and the motto gold. When the knights wear not their
                    robes, they are to have a silver star on the left side; and they commonly bear
                    the picture of St George, enamelled on gold, and set with diamonds, at the end
                    of a blue ribbon, crossing the body from the left shoulder. They are not to
                    appear abroad without the garter, on penalty of six shillings and eightpence
                    paid to the registrar.</p>
                <p>The manner of electing a knight companion into this most noble order, and the
                    ceremonies of investiture, are as follows: When the sovereign designs to elect a

                    bordered with fine gold wire, having commonly the letters of the motto of the
                    same, is, at the time of election, buckled upon the left leg by two of the
                    senior companions, who receive it from the sovereign, to whom it was presented
                    upon a velvet cushion, by the Garter king-at-arms, with the usual reverence,
                    whilst the chancellor reads the following admonition, enjoined by the statutes:
                    “To the honour of God omnipotent, and in memorial of the blessed martyr St
                    George, tie about thy leg, for thy renown, this noble garter; wear it as the
                    symbol of the most illustrious order, never to be forgotten or laid aside; that
                    thereby thou mayest be admonished to be courageous; and having undertaken a just
                    war, in which thou shalt be engaged, thou mayest stand firm, valiantly fight,
                    and successfully conquer.” The princely garter being then buckled on, and the
                    word of its signification pronounced, the knight-elect is brought before the
                    sovereign, who puts about his neck, kneeling, a dark blue ribbon, whercunto is
                    appended, wrought in gold within the garter, the image of St George on
                    horseback, with his sword drawn, encountering the dragon. In the mean time, the
                    chancellor reads the following admonition: “Wear this ribbon about thy neck,
                    adorned with the image of the blessed martyr and soldier of Christ, St George,
                    by whose imitation provoked, thou mayest so overpass both prosperous and adverse
                    adventures, that having stoutly vanquished thy enemies both of body and soul,
                    thou mayest not only receive the praise of this transient combat, but be crowned
                    with the palm of eternal victory.” Then the knight elected kisses the
                    sovereign’s hand; thanks his majesty for the great honour done him; and rises up
                    and salutes all the companions severally, who return their congratulations.</p>
                <p>Since the institution of this order there have been eight emperors and
                    twenty-eight kings, besides numerous sovereign princes, enrolled as companions
                    thereof. Its origin is somewhat differently related. The common account is, that
                    the Countess of Salisbury at a ball happening to drop her garter, the king took
                    it up and presented it to her with these words, <hi rend="italic">Honi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">soit qui mal y pense,</hi> evil to him who evil thinks. This
                    accident, it is said, gave rise to the order and the motto, it being the spirit
                    of the times to mix love and war together; but as in the original statutes of
                    this order there is not the least conjecture to countenance such a feminine
                    institution, credit cannot be given to such tradition. Camden, Fern, and others,
                    take it to have been instituted on occasion of the victory obtained by Edward
                    over the French at the battle of Crescy. That prince, say some historians,
                    ordered his garter to be displayed as a signal of battle; and in commemoration
                    thereof, he made a garter the principal ornament of the order, erected in memory
                    of this signal victory, and a symbol of the indissoluble union of the
                    knights.</p>
                <p>It appears from Rastel’s <hi rend="italic">Chronicle,</hi> that this order was
                    devised by Richard I. at the siege of the city of Acre, when he caused
                    twenty-six knights to wear thongs of blue leather about their legs, and that it
                    was perfected in the nineteenth year of Edward III. In 1551 Edward VI. made some
                    alterations in the ritual of this order, which he composed in Latin, the
                    original being still extant in his own hand-writing. He there ordained that the
                    order should no longer be called the order of St George, but that of the garter;
                    and, instead of the george, hung at the collar, he substituted a cavalier
                    bearing a book on the point of his sword, with the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >protectio</hi> graven on the sword, and <hi rend="italic">verbum Dei</hi> on
                    the book.</p>

                    Kiny-at-Arms.</hi> This office was instituted by Henry V. Garter, and principal
                    king-at arms, are two distinct offices united in one person. Garter’s employment
                    is to attend the service of the order of the garter, for which he is allowed a
                    mantle and badge, a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193518478"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-8478-0347"/>house in Windsor Castle, and pensions both from
                    the sovereign and knights, and, lastly, fees. He also carries the rod and
                    sceptre at every feast of St George, when the sovereign is present, and notifies
                    the election of such as are newly chosen; attends the solemnity of their
                    installations, takes care of placing their arms over their seats, and carries
                    the garter to foreign kings and princes; for which services it has been usual to
                    join him in commission with some peer, or other person of distinction. The
                    Garter’s oath relates only to services being performed within the order, and is
                    taken in chapter before the sovereign knights.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Garter</hi> is also a term in heraldry, signifying the
                    moiety or half of a bend.</p>
