                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Light,</hi> whether obtained from natural or artificia
                    sources, is so necessary for the correct and successful execution of almost
                    every operation of human industry, that whatever is calculated to simplify the
                    means of procuring it, or to increase its intensity, cannot fail of being
                    attended with the most beneficial consequences to civilized society. For every
                    purpose to which it is applied, it must be admitted that the light of day, when
                    it can be enjoyed freely and without interruption, is, by far, the most
                    suitable; but in large and crowded cities, as well as in less favourable
                    situations in point of climate, where the sun is sometimes shrouded for days
                    together in dense and impenetrable clouds, it becomes expedient to compensate
                    for the absence of his rays by artificial substitutes, which, however inferior
                    in brilliancy and general usefulness, may nevertheless answer sufficiently well
                    in those cases where a less ample supply of light is requisite.</p>
                <p>Some substances, denominated <hi rend="italic">phosphorescent,</hi> have the
                    property of absorbing the solar rays, on being exposed for a short time to their
                    influence, and of emitting the light which they thus imbibe when they are
                    afterwards placed in the dark; but the feeble and transient illumination which
                    they shed, though sufficient to indicate their luminous condition, is totally
                    unfit to afford such a supply of light as is necessary for conducting any of the
                    operations of art, which must be performed with care and precision.</p>
                <p>During the process of combustion, however, a variety of inflammable substances,
                    both of animal and vegetable origin, are found to give out light, as well as
                    heat, when they undergo that species of decomposition; and hence, from the
                    earliest periods of human society, it has been customary to burn substances of
                    that description, for the purpose of obtaining artificial light. These
                    substances, which were generally of a fatty or oleaginous nature, are found,
                    when analyzed, to be composed chiefly of carbon and hydrogen. When they are
                    exposed to a certain pitch of temperature they are resolved into some of the
                    compound gases which result from the union of these elements, particularly
                    carburetted and bicarburetted hydrogen, or olefiant gas, both of which are
                    highly inflammable, and yield, during their combustion, a fine white light. To
                    facilitate the decomposition, and carry on the combustion with due economy, a
                    quantity of some fibrous substance, in the form of a wick, is connected with the
                    oleaginous matter, for the purpose of causing it to burn slowly and effectually.
                    Accordingly, if the flame be suddenly extinguished, the inflammable gas which is
                    formed by the decomposition of the matter in immediate contact with the wick is
                    observed to escape from it, and may be again set on fire by the application of a
                    lighted taper.</p>
                <p>When the light obtained from these substances must be frequently conveyed from
                    place to place, no arrangement can be more convenient for their decomposition
                    than that which is effected by means of the wick; but if it be to remain in a
                    permanent position, it will frequently be more advantageous to resolve the
                    oleaginous matter into gas, and then transmit it, in that state, through pipes,
                    to the various points where it is to be consumed.</p>
                <p>Though the different substances which have been used, from the earliest times,
                    for yielding artificial light, have always been actually resolved into gas
                    before they underwent the process of combustion, that fact was entirely unknown
                    till pneumatic chemistry unfolded the properties of the aerial bodies, which
                    perform so many important functions in the economy of nature, as well as in the
                    processes of the arts. The use of gas for the purpose of illumination is
                    therefore of recent date; but though late in its origin, the successive
                    improvements which the invention has received, from the joint labours of
                    chemists and practical engineers, have carried it, in a few years, to a pitch of
                    perfection to which little can be added, either to simplify the processes for
                    producing the gas itself, or improving its quality.</p>
                <p>Besides matters of an oleaginous nature, it has been ascertained that pit-coal
                    and other bituminous substances yield, when they are exposed in close vessels to
                    a high temperature, a large quantity of aerial matter, which is found to consist
                    of various gases, most of which are extremely inflammable. This fact seems to
                    have first attracted the notice of the Reverend Mr Clayton, who gives an account
                    of it in a memoir on the subject, which he published in the Transactions of the
                    Royal Society for the year 1739; and as his experiments furnish the earliest
                    evidence of the possibility of extracting from coal, by means of heat, a
                    permanently elastic fluid of an inflammable nature, we shall give the account of
                    the discovery in his own words: “Having introduced a quantity of coal into a
                    retort, and placed it over an open fire,” he states that “at first there came
                    over only phlegm, and afterwards a black oil, and then likewise a spirit arose
                    which I could noways condense; but it forced my lute, or broke my glasses. Once
                    when it had forced my lute, coming close thereto in order to repair it, I
                    observed that the spirit which issued out caught fire at the flame of the
                    candle, and continued burning with violence as it issued out in a stream, which
                    I blew out and lighted alternately for several times. I then had a mind to try
                    if 1 could save any of this spirit; in order to which I took a turbinated
                    receiver, and putting a candle to the pipe of the receiver whilst the spirit
                    rose, I observed that it catched flame, and continued burning at the end of the
                    pipe, though you could not observe what fed the flame. I then blew it out and
                    lighted it again several times; after which I fixed a bladder, squeezed, and
                    void of air, to the pipe of the receiver. The oil and flame descended into the
                    receiver, but the spirit still ascending, blew up the bladder. I then filled a
                    good many bladders therewith, and might have filled an inconceivable number
                    more; for the spirit continued to run for several hours, and filled the bladders
                    almost as fast as a man could have blown them with his mouth; and yet the
                    quantity of coals distilled was inconsiderable.</p>
                <p>“I kept this spirit in the bladders a considerable time, and endeavoured several
                    ways to condense it, but in vain; and when I had a mind to divert strangers or
                    friends, I have frequently taken one of these bladders, and pricked a hole
                    therein with a pin, and compressing gently the bladder near the flame of a
                    candle till it once took fire, it would then continue flaming till all the
                    spirit was compressed out of the bladder; which was the more surprising, because
                    no one could discern any difference in the appearance between this bladder and
                    those which are filled with common air.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Mr Clayton alludes to the discovery of the gas he obtained
                    from coal, in a letter to the Royal Society, dated May 12, 1688.</p></note></p>
                <p>It is evident from this narrative, related with so much simplicity, that an
                    accident which happened to Mr Clayton’s apparatus was the means of leading to
                    the discovery.</p>

                <p>of coal-gas; but it does not appear that he or any other individual thought of
                    applying the discovery to any practical purpose till the year 1792, when Mr
                    Murdoch, who then resided at Redruth, in Cornwall, commenced a series of
                    experiments upon the properties of the gases contained in different substances.
                    In the course of his researches he found that the gas obtained by distillation
                    from coal, peat, wood, and other inflammable substances, yielded a fine bright
                    light during its combustion; and it occurred to him, that by confining it in
                    proper vessels, and afterwards expelling it through pipes, it might be employed
                    as a convenient and economical substitute for lamps and candles.</p>
                <p>Mr Murdoch’s attention to the subject having been interrupted for some time by
                    his professional avocations, he resumed the consideration of it in 1797, when he
                    exhibited publicly the results of his more matured plans for the preparation of
                    coal-gas. The following year he constructed an apparatus at Soho ſoundery for
                    lighting that establishment, with suitable arrangements for the purification of
                    the gas; and these experiments, Dr Henry states, “were continued with occasional
                    interruptions until the epoch of the peace in 1802, when the illumination of the
                    Soho manufactory afforded an opportunity of making a public display of the new
                    lights; and they were made to constitute a principal feature in that
                    exhibition."</p>
                <p>In the brief sketch which we mean to give of the progress of gas-lighting, it may
                    be noticed that the Lyceum Theatre in London was lighted with gas in the course
                    of the years 1803-4, under the direction of Mr Winsor, who is entitled to no
                    small commendation for the warm interest he took in drawing the public attention
                    to the subject; and in 1804-ã Mr Murdoch had an opportunity of carrying his
                    plans into effect on a still larger scale, by means of the apparatus erected
                    under his superintendence in the extensive cotton-mills of Messrs Philips and
                    Son of Manchester.</p>
                <p>It has been alleged that gas-lights were used in France before that mode of
                    illumination was known in this country; butas the earliest exhibition of these
                    lights, on which the claim of priority of discovery is founded, took place at
                    Paris in 1802, it is evident, from the foregoing statements, that the exhibition
                    alluded to was ten years subsequent to the first experiments of Mr Murdoch on
                    the subject.</p>
                <p>It might have been interesting, in a statistical point of • view, to have laid
                    before our readers an account of the extent to which gas-lighting has been
                    carried throughout the kingdom; but in a matter which is still in progress, it
                    is not easy to procure documents that would be applicable to any particular
                    period of time. At the close of the year 1822, it appears, by the report of Sir
                    William Congreve, that the capital vested in the gas-works of the metropolis
                    amounted then to about a million sterling; while the pipes, connected with the
                    various establishments, embraced an extent of upwards of a hundred and fifty
                    miles. So rapid, indeed, has been the progress of this new mode of illumination,
                    that, in the course of a few years after it was first introduced, it was adopted
                    by all the principal towns in the kingdom, for lighting streets, as well as
                    shops and public edifices. In private houses it found its way more slowly,
                    partly from an apprehension, not entirely groundless, of the danger attending
                    the use of it; and partly, from the annoyance which was experienced in many
                    cases, through the careless and imperfect manner, in which the service-pipes
                    were at first fitted up. These inconveniencies have been, in a great measure, if
                    not wholly removed, by a more enlarged knowledge of the management of gas; and
                    at present there are few private houses, in large towns, which are not either
                    partially, or entirely lighted up by it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Site and general Arrangement of the Apparatus for the
                    Production and Purification of Coal-Gas.</hi></p>
                <p>In describing the site and general arrangements of a gas establishment, it is not
                    easy to give directions respecting points, which must be regulated, in every
                    case, by circumstances of a local nature; but when a choice of ground is in our
                    power, a spot ought to be selected having a central situation with regard to the
                    buildings, streets, &amp;c. it is to supply with light, and standing as nearly
                    as possible on a medium level with them. When the manufactory is placed
                    considerably below that level, the gas is apt to be propelled with too much
                    velocity through the burners; and when above it, an opposite inconvenience is
                    experienced, the gas being in that case necessarily subjected to an extra
                    pressure, by which the chance of its escape through any imperfection of the
                    pipes is proportionally increased. Of the two evils, therefore, the least
                    objectionable is that in which the situation of a gas-work is below the mean
                    level of the streets.</p>
                <p>But besides the conditions favourable to an equable and uniform distribution of
                    the gas at the different points to which it maybe conducted, there are other
                    considerations scarcely less important, which, in selecting a proper site for
                    the erection of the establishment, ought not to be disregarded. Among these may
                    be reckoned a regular supply of water for the various manipulations of the work;
                    and facility of access for the delivery of coal, and the removal of the coke,
                    tar, and other products of the distillation. Nor, in fixing the situation of an
                    establishment which is professedly erected for the public benefit, ought the
                    comfort or the interest of individuals to be entirely overlooked; for though a
                    gas-work may not prove, under proper management, a nuisance, it can never be
                    considered to be any advantage to the neighbourhood in which it is placed.</p>
                <p>The apparatus for the production and purification of coal-gas consist, in the
                    first place, of suitable vessels for decomposing by heat the coal from which the
                    gas is to be procured; secondly, of a series of pipes for conveying off the gas,
                    and conducting it into proper receptacles, where it may be separated from the
                    grosser products, which tend to impair the brilliancy of the light it is capable
                    of yielding; thirdly, of the condensing apparatus, for removing more effectually
                    the tar and other condensible substances that come over with the gas; fourthly,
                    of the purifying apparatus, for abstracting the sulphuretted hydrogen, carbonic
                    acid, &amp;c. by which the gas is contaminated; and, fifthly, of the gasometer
                    or gas holder, with its tank, into which the gas is finally received in a
                    purified state.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Retorts, or Vessels for decomposing the Coal.</hi></p>
                <p>The vessels employed for the decomposition of coal and other substances capable
                    of yielding carburetted hydrogen, by their destructive distillation, are usually
                    formed of cast iron, and termed <hi rend="italic">retorts.</hi> Various shapes
                    have been adopted in the construction of these vessels; nor have their forms
                    been more varied than the modes in which they have been disposed, in the
                    furnaces erected for their reception. In most instances, they have been
                    constructed of a cylindrical shape, varying in length, and diameter. Those first
                    employed were placed with their axis in a vertical direction; but experience
                    soon showed that this position was extremely inconvenient, on account of the
                    difficulty it occasioned of removing the coke, and other residuary matters,
                    after the coal had been carbonized. Attempts were made to remedy this
                    inconvenience, by enlarging the size of the retort, and introducing the coal
                    enclosed in a proper grating of iron, having the form of a cage. The increased
                    dimensions of the retort, from which the principal advantage to be derived from
                    this arrangement<pb break="no" facs="nls:193518517" xml:id="kp-eb0710-8517-0350"
                    /> was expected, were found, however, to present great obstacles to the complete
                    carbonization of the coal; for though the disengagement of gas during the first
                    stages of the process was sufficiently copious, it diminished rapidly the longer
                    the distillation was continued; a crust of coke being formed next the heated
                    metal, which not only opposed the transmission of the temperature to the
                    internal mass of coal, but gradually prevented, by its accumulation, the
                    extrication of the gas from the undecomposed portion of it.</p>
                <p>The retorts were, therefore, next placed in a horizontal position, as being not
                    only more favourable to the most economical distribution of the heat, but better
                    adapted to the introduction of the coal, and the subsequent removal of the coke,
                    after the carbonization was carried to a due extent. At first the heat was
                    applied directly to the lower part of the retort, but it was soon observed that
                    the high temperature to which it was necessary to expose it, for the perfect
                    decomposition of the coal, proved destructive to it, and rendered it useless
                    long before the upper part had sustained much injury. The next improvement was
                    accordingly to interpose an arch of brickwork between it and the furnace, and to
                    compensate for the diminished intensity of the heat by a more diffused
                    distribution of it over the surface of the retort. This was effected by causing
                    the flue of the furnace to return towards the mouth of the retort, and again
                    conducting it in an opposite direction, till the heated air finally escaped into
                    the chimney.</p>
                <p>This arrangement, which on the whole has been found to be the best, and is now
                    generally used, seems to admit of little improvement, unless with respect to the
                    shape of the retort. The cylindrical form has the advantage of possessing great
                    durability, but it is not so well fitted for rapid decomposition of the coal (on
                    which depends much of the good qualities of the gas) as the elliptical shape.
                    Retorts presenting a saddle-shaped section, when they are supposed to be cut
                    transversely, appear to be preferable even to those of an elliptical form; but
                    the greater expense of casting them, together with their inferiority in point of
                    durability, has prevented them from coming into extensive use.</p>
                <p>The temperature, best suited for the production of gas from coal, being what the
                    workmen term a <hi rend="italic">bright red,</hi> was found to be very
                    destructive to the retorts, when they were exposed to the direct action of the
                    fuel; and accordingly means were employed to protect them from the rapid
                    oxidation which they suffered under these circumstances, by interposing between
                    them and the furnace, a partition of fire tiles or arched bricks, with side
                    flues for the admission of the heated air. This arrangement is represented in
                    fig. 1, Plate CCLV,, where <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is the retort, <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> the grate of the furnace, e the fire-brick arch, and <hi
                    rend="italic">f f</hi> the side flues.</p>
                <p>With the view of occupying less room, and saving the expense of fuel, several
                    retorts are sometimes set together in an oven of brickwork, and heated by a
                    smaller number of furnaces than there are of retorts. By this arrangement the
                    fuel is certainly economized; but the plan is liable to the objection, that when
                    any one of the retorts is worn out, those connected with it cannot be used till
                    the faulty one is replaced; and though various expedients have been proposed for
                    obviating that inconvenience, none of them can be said to have effectually
                    answered the purpose. Fig. 2 and 3 represent varieties in the oven plan of
                    setting retorts.</p>
                <p>The fuel required for carbonizing a given quantity of coal may be stated to be,
                    in general, about two fifths of its weight. It has been affirmed, indeed, that
                    the decomposition has been effected at some establishments with less than
                    twenty-five per cent.;! ut if the retorts are maintain ed at a proper
                    temperature, and the carbonization is carried to a due extent, the fuel, however
                    well economized, will rarely be less than from thirty-five to forty per cent, of
                    the coal it is employed to decompose.</p>
                <p>The quantity of gas produced during the time the coal is undergoing decomposition
                    is extremely variable. From a small retort, exposed for eighty-five minutes to a
                    bright red heat, which was kept up with the utmost possible uniformity, the
                    following results were obtained from eight pounds of the Wemyss coal:</p>

                <p>At the time the process was terminated the extraction of aeriform matter had
                    nearly ceased, so that the quantity of gas yielded by a pound of the coal was
                    about five and a ’ half cubic feet. The same coal carbonized on the large scale
                    yielded, when the process was carried on for four hours, at the rate of four and
                    one third cubic feet of gas per pound. The weight of the coke in the above
                    experiment was 32,050 grains; and as the weight of the gas, the specific gravity
                    of which was ∙65, must have been 15,026 grains, the tar and other residuary
                    products, including the sulphuretted hydrogen abstracted by the process of
                    purification, must have amounted to 8924 grains.</p>
                <p>When the decomposition is effected on the large scale, the quantity of gas is
                    found to vary with the quality of the coal, and the manner in which the
                    operation is conducted. According to Mr Peckstone, a chaldron of Newcastle
                    Wa)Isend coal yields 10,000 cubic feet, being at the rate of 370∣ cubic feet per
                    hundredweight. At Edinburgh a hundredweight of cannel coal yields 430 feet and a
                    similar return from coal of the same species is obtained at Glasgow, and other
                    towns in Scotland.</p>
                <p>The quality of the gas yielded by coal varies greatly at different periods of the
                    carbonizing process. The first products, when the coal has not been previously
                    well dried, consist almost entirely of aqueous vapour and carbonic acid; these
                    are succeeded by light carburetted hydrogen, olefiant gas, and sulphuretted
                    hydrogen, which gradually diminish in quantity till towards the close of the
                    process, when almost the only products are carbonic oxide, and hydrogen. Hence
                    if the process be carried on too long, the gases obtained in the latter stages
                    of it will not only be useless for the purpose of yielding light, but the fuel
                    employed for their production will be expended in wasting the retorts to produce
                    substances which, we shall afterwards find, are calculated to impair the
                    illuminating power of the gases with which they are mixed. In the case of cannel
                    coal, the interval between the charges of the retorts should not exceed three
                    and a half or four hours; nor in the case of the Newcastle coal, which is not so
                    easily decomposed, ought that interval to extend beyond six hours.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Condensing Main and Dip Pipes.</hi></p>
                <p>From the retorts the gas, after its production, ascends by bent pipes, called the
                    <hi rend="italic">dip-pipes,</hi> into what is termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >condensing main,</hi> which is a large cast-iron pipe, about twelve or fifteen
                    inches in diameter, placed in a horizontal position, and supported by columns in
                    front of the brickwork which contains the retorts. This part of a gas apparatus
                    is intended to serve a twofold purpose: First, to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193518530" xml:id="kp-eb0710-8530-0351"/>condense the tar and grosser
                    products of distillation; and, ∣ secondly, to allow each of the retorts to be
                    charged singly . without permitting the gas produced from the rest, at . the
                    time that operation is going on, to make its escape. To ∣ accomplish these
                    objects, one end of the condensing main; is closed by a flanch; and the other,
                    where it is connect-ι ed with the pipes for conducting the gas towards the tar
                    vessel and purifying apparatus, has, crossing it, in the inside, a semi-flanch
                    or partition, occupying the lower half of the area of the section, by which the
                    condensing vessel is always kept half full of liquid matter.</p>
                <p>The dip-pipe, represented by <hi rend="italic">bcdh,</hi> fig. 1, Plate CCLV., is
                    connected by a flanch <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> with a branch-pipe rising from
                    the upper side of the condensing main; and as the lower end of it dips about two
                    inches below the level of the liquid matter, it is evident that no gas can
                    return and escape, when the mouth-piece <hi rend="italic">m</hi> of the retort
                    is removed, until it has forced the liquid matter over the bend <hi
                    rend="italic">cd;</hi> a result which is easily prevented by making <hi
                    rend="italic">dh</hi> of a suitable length. The upper part of the branch <hi
                    rend="italic">be of</hi> the dippipe is generally furnished with a ground plugp,
                    to allow the removal of the tarry matter, which is apt to accumulate, in a
                    concrete state, at the lower part of the pipe where it is nearest the
                    furnace.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Tar Apparatus.</hi></p>
                <p>After emerging from the lower end of the dip-pipe, the gas, now bereft of a
                    considerable portion of the vapour of water, tar, and oleaginous matter, which
                    ascend with it from the retort, is conveyed by pipes, for the purpose of being
                    completely freed from these impurities, into contrivances where a more perfect
                    condensation takes place. As the subsequent purification of the gas depends, in
                    no small degree, upon the perfect separation of the tar and other condensible
                    products by which it is accompanied, the construction of the vessels best
                    calculated for attaining that end, is a matter of the utmost importance; and
                    indeed it may be justly affirmed, that unless that separation be effectually
                    accomplished, the action of the chemical agents, to which the gas is afterwards
                    exposed, must be limited and imperfect.</p>
                <p>The first arrangements, employed for the purpose of condensation, were all
                    constructed on the supposition that the object would be best attained by causing
                    the gas to travel through a great extent of pipes, surrounded by cold water, and
                    winding through it, like the worm of a still, or ascending upwards and downwards
                    in a circuitous manner. One of these condensers is represented by figs. 4,5,6,
                    and 7, Plate CCLV., where ABCD is the bottom of the condenser, and EGHF the top;
                    IKLM and PQRO show the pipes in elevation. SKLT and SORT are sections of the
                    vessel below the condenser, for the reception of the tar, and other condensible
                    products. This vessel is divided by plates into a number of compartments which
                    have no communication with each other, except at the bottom, for allowing the
                    tar to be drawn off, by one discharging pipe <hi rend="italic">abc.</hi> The gas
                    is admitted at V, and after a repetition of ascents and descents, escapes at W,
                    to be afterwards conveyed to the purifying apparatus.</p>
                <p>A cylindrical pipe being the most capacious of all pipes having the same surface,
                    an improvement upon the condenser as here described, was conceived to be gained
                    by causing the gas to pass between plates of metal, forming a succession of
                    narrow chests or galleries; an arrangement by which every portion of the gas
                    being brought into more immediate contact with the sides of the condenser, it
                    was concluded the condensation would be proportionally more complete. Such an
                    apparatus is represented by fig. 8 9, and 10, Pla e CCLV., where ABDC represents
                    the bottom of the condenser, E the entrance, and F the exit aipe of the gas,
                    which passes between the plates, as indicated by the arrows. The bottom of the
                    plates <hi rend="italic">a, a, a</hi> have a slight inclination, so as to cause
                    the condensed products to flow towards the openings <hi rend="italic">a, b,
                    c,</hi> where they are conveyed by pipes into the general receptacle below, and
                    afterwards drawn off by the cock H.</p>
                <p>These tar vessels, and others of a similar form to accomplish the same purpose,
                    are constructed on the supposition that the tar and other condensible products
                    are held in a state of suspension in the gas by beat; and that nothing more is
                    necessary to produce their deposition, than exposure to a reduced temperature.
                    As it appeared, however, that a large portion of the gas, after leaving the
                    condensing main, was enveloped in thin films of tar and oleaginous matter, it
                    occurred to the writer of this article that the disengagement of it, from the
                    vesicles in which it was enclosed, might be more effectually promoted by
                    interrupting it in its progress through the condenser, than by mere exposure to
                    cold; and in conformity with this idea, he found that when the gas was forced to
                    make its way through brushwood, placed in proper vessels for the purpose, the
                    separation of the tar was more complete, than by the ordinary modes of
                    condensation. ABCD, fig. 1, Plate CCLVI, represents a tar condenser constructed
                    on that principle, <hi rend="italic">abed</hi> are large vessels, either of a
                    square or cylindrical form, for containing the brushwood and loose materials
                    through which the gas is made to pass; E being the pipe where it enters, and F
                    the pipe where it escapes, <hi rend="italic">er, er,</hi> pipes for conveying
                    the condensed products into the horizontal pipeGH, which communicates with the
                    tar receptacle M, by the bent pipe IK. The vessels containing the brushwood may
                    be surrounded with cold water, or with the tar pumped up from the tar
                    receptacle; but as the loose materials, through which the gas passes, seem to
                    have the principal share in condensing the tar, it appears to be of little
                    consequence whether the vessels containing it be surrounded with cold water or
                    not, provided the apparatus be placed in a shaded situation. <hi rend="italic"

                    the purposes of Illumination.</hi></p>
                <p>With the two compounds of hydrogen and carbon, viz. olefiant gas, and light
                    carburetted hydrogen, which are yielded by coal during its destructive
                    distillation by heat, several other products are obtained, which are not only
                    useless for the purpose of illumination, but calculated to diminish the
                    brilliancy of the light which is afforded by these gases, and even to prove a
                    source of serious nuisance during their combustion. Among these products of a
                    deleterious nature, are carbonic acid, and sulphuretted hydrogen; and, in
                    smaller quantity, carbonic oxide, nitrogen, and hydrogen. The first two are by
                    far the most objectionable of these impurities; and fortunately, their
                    separation can be effected more easily than that of the others, whose presence
                    is of less importance.</p>
                <p>Carbonic acid is readily absorbed by any of the alkalis or earthy bodies, in a
                    caustic state; and sulphuretted hydrogen, which possesses many of the properties
                    of an acid, unite« not only with the alkalis and alkaline earths, with which it
                    forms a species of salts termed <hi rend="italic">hydrosulphurets,</hi> but also
                    with the metallic oxides, most of which it reduces.</p>
                <p>The alkalis being too expensive to be used for separating carbonic acid and
                    sulphuretted hydrogen from coal-gas, a more economical substitute, and which
                    answers tin purpose almost equally well, is found in quicklime. This <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193518543" xml:id="kp-eb0710-8543-0352"/> substance is
                    accordingly used in every gas establishment on the large scale, in some form or
                    another, for the last step of the purifying process to which coak gas is
                    submitted to render it fit for combustion. It is employed in two states; either
                    in the condition of a thin paste, which the workmen call the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cream</hi> of lime, or of a moistened powder, such as lime assumes when it is
                    slaked with a little more than theusualquantity of water. The apparatus must
                    therefore be accommodated, in its construction and arrangement, to these
                    different conditions of the purifying material.</p>
                <p>When the lime is used in a liquid state, the gas is made to pass through it so as
                    to be as much as possible exposed to its action. One of the arrangements adopted
                    for the purpose is represented by fig. 2, Plate CCLVI., where <hi rend="italic"
                    >ua</hi> is an oblong close vessel, divided into a number of compartments formed
                    by vertical partitions, which are fastened to the top and sides, but open at the
                    bottom. The lower margin of the partitions is perforated with numerous small
                    holes through which the gas passes from one compartment to another; the cream of
                    lime being introduced in such quantity that its surface is above the level of
                    the uppermost row of holes. The gas enters by the pipe c, and, after bubbling
                    through the holes in the partitions, from cell to cell, makes its escape in a
                    purified state by the pipe <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> The liquid line is
                    introduced from time to time at <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and run off, after
                    being unfit for the purpose of purification, by the pipe <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.</hi></p>
                <p>It being highly conducive to the success of the purifying process that a
                    succession of fresh portions of the liquid lime should be brought in contact
                    with the gas as it passes through it, the material is kept, at some
                    establishments, in a state of constant agitation by means of machinery for the
                    purpose. Fig. 3 represents an arrangement of that kind which is used at some of
                    the London gas-works. <hi rend="italic">aaa</hi> is a flat cylindrical vessel in
                    which the purification is performed, the gas entering by the pipe <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> and escaping by the pipe <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> In the
                    inside of this vessel is another of a similar form <hi rend="italic">ff,</hi>
                    terminating at the bottom in a broad horizontal flanch or circular plate <hi
                    rend="italic">gg,</hi> and having revolving within it an agitator <hi
                    rend="italic">hh,</hi> which works in an air-tight stuffing box. The gas being
                    forced by the pressure from the retorts to descend below &lt;7, is more
                    effectually exposed in its progress to the action of the lime by the commotion
                    produced by the agitator, and finally ascends, in a purified state, through the
                    pipe <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> Fresh portions of the purifying material are
                    supplied from the vessel <hi rend="italic">k</hi> by means of the connecting
                    pipe <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the cream of lime,
                    after being saturated with the impurities, is withdrawn at <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.</hi> In large establishments the gas is forced in succession through several
                    vessels of the kind described, the cream of lime being changed in each of them
                    at different times, to render its action more uniform and regular.</p>
                <p>To supersede the necessity of using a series of purifiers, the following
                    arrangement has been adopted, which seems well calculated to insure great
                    regularity of action, with a simplification in the means of attaining it: <hi

                    position, and having a number of internal partitions Ä, A, rising nearly as high
                    as its axis, in which there works a spindle <hi rend="italic">kk</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> l</hi> carrying round with it a number of arms of

                    the upper extremity in a vessel αβ, ff, which is surmounted by another vessel

                    >η,</hi><hi rend="italic">n</hi> for agitating the cream of ]ime before it is
                    introduced into the vessel <hi rend="italic">aa,ff.</hi> The gas is introduced

                    bent pipe <hi rend="italic">g.</hi> The gas, ascending upwards in this machine,
                    has to pass in its progress among all the arms of the inclined axis; and being
                    thus exposed to the perpetual spray of the liquid lime, the supply of which is
                    constantly and regularly renewed, it finally escapes at <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    in a purified state.</p>
                <p>One of the objections against the method of purifying by the cream of lime, or
                    lime in a liquid state, is, that unless the gas be previously freed entirely
                    from tar, that substance, enveloping it with a thin film of oleaginous matter,
                    which has little tendency to unite with water, carries the gas along with it in
                    rolling bubbles, so that the internal parts of it can thus scarcely ever come
                    into contact with the purifying materials. In some of the arrangements, indeed,
                    which we have described, mechanical contrivances are employed to agitate and
                    disperse the gas, with the view of exposing every portion of it, more or less,
                    to the action of the lime; but these modes of promoting the efficacy of the
                    process cannot be resorted to without the aid of some moving power, which, in
                    many cases, must necessarily be attended with considerable trouble, as well as
                    additional expense. There is another objection to which this method of
                    purification, even if it required not the assistance of machinery, must always
                    be liable; namely, that the olefiant gas upon which the illuminating power
                    mainly depends, is largely absorbed by water, insomuch that either oil or coal
                    gas, standing a few days over that fluid, suffers a great deterioration of its
                    quality, and becomes in every respect less fit for the purposes of illumination.
                    When lime is used in the dry state, or rather in the state of a moistened
                    powder, for purifying coal-gas, neither of these objections is at all
                    applicable; and when the arrangements for that mode of purification are
                    contrived with a due regard to the simplicity and convenience of the
                    manipulations, the separation of the useless and noxious gases is effected more
                    easily, and not less effectually, than by the method of liquid lime. The
                    abstraction of the sulphuretted hydrogen becomes more , perfect, by adding to
                    the lime a small portion of the peroxide of manganese, which being a cheap
                    substance, adds very little to the expense of the process. This method of
                    purifying coal-gas having been adopted with the utmost success in many gas
                    establishments, we shall now proceed to explain the nature of the apparatus by
                    which it is carried into effect.</p>
                <p>Figs. 1 and 2, Plate CCLVIL, represent the elevation and plan of an apparatus for
                    dry lime, with the valves for regulating the direction of the gas when the
                    purifying materials require to be changed. PO and QR represent double chests,
                    formed of plates of cast iron, and which are thus capable of being water-luted
                    at <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> by means of an inverted vessel of the same form
                    <hi rend="italic">abed,</hi> and which is made of sheet iron. This vessel, when
                    the purifying process is going on, is kept down by means of cross bars <hi
                    rend="italic">g,g</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and it is furnished with a
                    stop-cock <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> for allowing the common air to escape from
                    it when it is let down into its position, and also for allowing the admission of
                    that air, when it must be raised for the purpose of changing the purifying
                    materials, without which the atmospheric pressure would render it extremely
                    difficult to remove the vessel. <hi rend="italic">X, x</hi> are bolt-eyes for
                    hooking the tackle which is employed to lift the inverted chest <hi
                    rend="italic">abed.</hi> The pipe T by which the gas is introduced rises above
                    the level of the lime contained in the uppermost sieve, so that the gas, after
                    issuing from it, spreads itself as pointed out by the arrows, and descends
                    downwards through the several layers of lime <hi rend="italic">o, o,</hi> till
                    it reaches the bottom of the chest, where it makes its escape at V, to pass, if
                    necessary, through a similar process in another chest, <hi rend="italic"
                    >h,</hi><hi rend="italic">h</hi> represent sections of the valves, which are
                    luted with mercury <pb break="no" facs="nls:193518556"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-8556-0353"/>(or with water when they are made sufficiently
                    deep), and arranged in such a manner that the pair G, H, and the pair L, M, one
                    of which must always be open when the other is shut, are so connected by a chain
                    passing over a pulley, that the same operation, which shuts the one, necessarily
                    opens the other. The valves I and K, which must in some cases be both shut at
                    the same time, are raised and depressed by separate levers. The weights N serve
                    to keep the valves in their proper position, when they are adjusted to a
                    particular mode of transmitting the gas.</p>
                <p>Having thus given a general description of the various parts of the apparatus, we
                    shall now proceed to explain the manner of managing the valves when the gas is
                    to pass through either of the chests singly, or through both in succession. If
                    it is to be transmitted through the chest OP only, then the valves H and M must
                    both be open; and of course G and L would be shut; also both K and I must be
                    shut. Again, if the gas were to be transmitted through the chest QR only, then
                    the valves G and L must be open, and all the rest would be shut. Lastly, if the
                    gas is to pass through both chests in succession, then the valves G, M, and K
                    must be open, and all the rest shut; or if we wished to make the gas pass
                    through the chests in a different order, the state of the valves might be
                    reversed.</p>
                <p>The quantity of lime necessary for purifying a given volume of coal-gas varies
                    with the quantity of sulphur contained in the coal from which the gas is
                    produced, and may be rated at from a tenth to a twentieth part of the weight of
                    the coal. It is proper, however, to examine at intervals, during the progress of
                    the purification, the state of the gas by such chemical tests as are calculated
                    to detect the presence of any of the deleterious substances with which it is
                    usually contaminated. Thus, carbonic acid is readily discovered by agitating a
                    small portion of the coal-gas with lime water in a limpid state, the solution
                    being quickly rendered turbid when the most minute quantity of that gas is
                    present. Sulphuretted hydrogen is discovered with equal facility by causing a
                    small current of coal-gas to play against a slip of paper moistened with a weak
                    solution of acetate of lead, or nitrate of silver, both of which instantly
                    become black when they are exposed to the action of sulphuretted hydrogen.</p>
                <p>Having thus explained the nature of the various processes, by which coal-gas is
                    freed from the different impurities with which it is contaminated, in the crude
                    state, we shall next describe the structure of the vessels which are employed
                    for storing it up, after it is duly purified and fitted for use.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gasometers for receiving and containing the Gas before it is
                    consumed.</hi></p>
                <p>As many disadvantages would be experienced by attempting to adjust the production
                    of the gas to the rate of its consumption, it is found to be more convenient, as
                    well as more economical, to store up such a portion of it, during the day, as
                    shall compensate for the deficiency of the supply that may be furnished during
                    the time the gas is consuming, in the course of the evening. The capacity of the
                    vessels used for this purpose, which are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >gasometers,</hi> must be regulated by a regard to that consideration.</p>
                <p>The form of the gasometer is generally that of an inverted cylindrical cup, the
                    diameter of which, when economy is studied, ought to be double of its depth, or
                    at least not more than two or three inches less. Gasometers are usually composed
                    of sheet iron, varying in weight from two to three lbs. to the square f∞t, well
                    riveted at the joints, and kept in shape by means of stays and braces formed of
                    cast or bar iron. The sheet iron is made to overlap at the joints, a slip of
                    canvass well besmeared with white-lead being interposed to secure perfect
                    tightness. The prismatic shape, though occasionally adopted, is not so
                    convenient as the cylindrical, partly on account of the difficulty of making it
                    retain its form, and partly on account of the greater quantity of material,
                    compared with the capacity, that is necessary for its construction.</p>
                <p>The gasometer is furnished with a tank, of the same form with itself, but a
                    little larger in dimensions, for containing the water, in which it is suspended
                    at different altitudes, by means of a chain and counterpoise, moving over
                    pullies. The tank is sometimes built of stone, but more frequently it is
                    constructed of cast-iron plates bolted together by flanches, with an interval
                    between them of about three eighths of an inch, which is afterwards filled up
                    with iron cement.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    following iron cement is recommended by Peckstone: Take iron turnings or

                    of sal ammoniac in powder, and one ounce of flowers of sulphur, by rubbing them
                    well together in a mortar; and afterwards keep the mixture dry till it may be
                    wanted for use. when it is so, for every part thereof, by measure, take twenty
                    parts of iron borings, prepared as above mentioned, and mix them well together
                    in a mortar or other iron vessel. The compound is to be brought to a proper
                    consistency by pouring water gently over it as it is mixing; and when used it
                    must be applied between the flanches by means of a blunted caulking
                    iron.</p></note></p>
                <p>A gasometer, such as has been described, is represented by fig. 1, Plate
                    CCLVIII., in which <hi rend="italic">aaaa</hi> is the gasometer, <hi
                    rend="italic">dd</hi> the suspension chain, <hi rend="italic">cc</hi> the
                    pullies, and e the counterpoise; also <hi rend="italic">bb</hi> is the tank, and
                    ff the pipes for introducing, and conducting off the gas.</p>
                <p>As the gasometer, when it is immersed in the water of the tank, suffers a loss of
                    weight equal to that of the portion of fluid it displaces, it is evident that
                    unless some arrangement be made to counteract the varying pressure which must
                    thus result from the different depths to which it may be immersed, the gas
                    contained in the gasometer will be expelled, at different times, with a varying
                    force. If, however, the weight of the chain of suspension, or rather the weight
                    of that portion of it whose length is the same as the height to which the
                    gasometer ascends, be equal to half the loss of weight which the gasometer
                    sustains by immersion in water, a perfect compensation will be made, and an
                    equilibrium will hold between the gasometer and its counterpoise, at all
                    altitudes. Thus, if the weight of the gasometer were five tons, or 11,200 lbs.,
                    and it lost by immersion a seventh part of its weight, or 1600 lbs., then the
                    weight of that portion of the chain, eaual in length to the highest ascent of
                    the gasometer, would require to be 800 lbs., and the weight of die counterpoise
                    11,200 — 800, or 10,400 lbs.</p>

                <p>Though the compensation, by this adjustment of the weight of the chain, answers
                    the purpose in the most effectual manner, the following method is by some deemed
                    preferable. Let the counterpoise (instead of having the form as shown at <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> in the figure) consist of a long cylindrical or <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193518569" xml:id="kp-eb0710-8569-0354"/> prismatic body,
                    as represented by the dots <hi rend="italic">g, g,</hi> having the area of its
                    horizontal section equal to the area of a similar section of the plates of the
                    gasometer, and be allowed to descend into the water as the gasometer rises out
                    of it. Also let the chain <hi rend="italic">d</hi> be of a weight equal (length
                    for length) to a column of water of equal bulk with the counterpoise. Then, if
                    the weight of the gasometer be, as already supposed, 11,200 lbs., the weight of
                    the counterpoise must be the same; but the weight of that portion of the chain
                    which, by the above arrangement, was only equal to half the loss of weight
                    sustained by the gasometer when immersed, must now be equal to the whole of that
                    weight.</p>

                <p>Though we have only shown, in both these modes of compensation, that an
                    equilibrium between the gasometer and its counterpoise holds, in the extreme
                    cases, it would be easy to prove that the same thing must subsist, at all the
                    intermediate elevations of the gasometer. At the same time it must be obvious
                    that these contrivances, however well calculated they may be to secure the
                    equilibrium alluded to, can have no effect in expelling the gas; and therefore,
                    when it is wished that the contents of the gasometer shall issue from it under a
                    certain pressure, the weight of the counterpoise must be diminished to a
                    suitable extent. Thus, if it were required that the pressure employed for
                    expelling the gas should be equal to that produced by a column of water three
                    fourths of an inch deep, then it would be necessary to diminish the weight of
                    the counterpoise by the weight of a column of water having the same diameter
                    with the gasometer, and an altitude of three fourths of an inch. If the diameter
                    of the gasometer above mentioned were, for example, 35 feet or 420 inches, the
                    weight of a cylindrical portion of water having that diameter, and a depth of
                    three fourths of an inch, would be, in grains, 420 <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> × ∙7854 × f × 252∙5 = 26236876 grs. or 3748 lbs.</p>
                <p>Hence it would be necessary to make the counterpoise 3748 lbs. lighter than it
                    was supposed to be, according to the above-mentioned arrangements, in order that
                    the gas might issue from the gasometer, under a pressure of three fourths of an
                    inch of water. If the calculation were conducted with extreme accuracy, the
                    specific gravity of the gas ought also to be taken under consideration; but the
                    object to be attained is not of so delicate a nature as to require an attention
                    to such minute circumstances. Besides, we shall afterwards find that the value
                    of the arrangements we have described for obtaining an uniform and equable
                    pressure is greatly diminished; and these are even entirely superseded by a
                    contrivance called the governor, to be afterwards explained.</p>
                <p>In situations where a sufficient depth of the tank cannot be easily obtained, an
                    expedient may be resorted to, such as is represented in fig. 2. The gasometer
                    consists of two parts, separable from each other; the one, <hi rend="italic"
                    >abba,</hi> having the form of the common gasometer, and the other, <hi
                    rend="italic">cccc,</hi> being open at the top as well as the bottom, but
                    connected with the other by a channel running around the bottom, which is filled
                    with water. The lower part has a recurved form at the top; and this portion of
                    it entering into the channel, becomes water-luted, by which the entire gasometer
                    is rendered air-tight, at the line of junction. Various other contrivances have
                    been proposed for saving room; but most of them answer the purpose so
                    imperfectly, that they are scarcely deserving of being noticed. We shall,
                    however, give a description of one of them, invented by Μ. Clegg, in which the
                    gas is expelled by the partial revolution of the gasometer.</p>
                <p>This kind of gasometer is represented in fig. 3, <hi rend="italic">aaa</hi> being
                    the cistern filled with water to the height of the dotted line; <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> the axle, which is hollow at each end, and works on
                    friction sectors; <hi rend="italic">ddd,</hi> a vessel supported by arms
                    proceeding from the axle, and formed of parts of two concentric cylinders, shut
                    at each end, and also at <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> except where the entrance and
                    exit gas-pipes passing from <hi rend="italic">g</hi> to the hollow axis are
                    connected (one of these only is shown in the figure, the other being directly
                    behind it); the end A is left open, and when the gasometer is filled with gas it
                    is just immersed in the water; i a pulley to which is attached a chain and
                    weight <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> disposed as represented. The whole apparatus is
                    constructed so as to be an equilibrium in every position, the framing being made
                    heavy at that part of the circle to which the gas-holder does not extend, so as
                    to counterbalance the matter opposed to it. The gas enters at one of the hollow
                    ends of the axis, and passes through one of the tubes <hi rend="italic">g</hi>
                    into the gasometer; and it is discharged under any required pressure, obtained
                    by means of the weight <hi rend="italic">ħ,</hi> through the other tube behind
                    <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> into the opposite extremity of the axis. Though this
                    kind of gasometer is more expensive than one of equal capacity of the common
                    form, yet requiring a shallow cistern for working in, it may be resorted to in
                    some cases with advantage.</p>
                <p>The gas is commonly introduced and conducted off by pipes, passing under the
                    bottom of the tank for containing the water, in which the gasometer floats; and
                    as these pipes are in many cases considerably below the level of the street
                    pipes with which they communicate, they are apt" to be filled up in the course
                    of time with the condensed water which passes off in a vaporous state with the
                    gas. To remedy this inconvenience, it is necessary to place vessels for
                    receiving that water, in connection with the entrance and exit pipes, so
                    contrived that the accumulated water may be easily removed from them when
                    required. One of these vessels, which are improperly termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >syphons,</hi> is represented by fig. 9. When the water rises to the height <hi
                    rend="italic">d, e,</hi> it is drawn off by means of a small suction pump,
                    introduced into the pipe <hi rend="italic">ac,</hi> which reaches within about
                    an inch of the bottom of the syphon. To prevent too much water being removed,
                    and thus allowing the gas to escape at <hi rend="italic">ac,</hi> the lower end
                    of the pipe of the suction pump should be perforated with small holes to as
                    great a distance as the water is to be left in depth; or, if deemed preferable,
                    the upper end of the pipe <hi rend="italic">ac</hi> may be rendered air-tight by
                    a screwed cap.</p>
                <p>When access to the bottom of the tank is difficult, swivel or flexible-jointed
                    tubes, disposed so as to rise and fall with the gasometer, are sometimes
                    resorted to. Jointed tubes, connected by means of water-lutes, are also
                    occasionally employed, and they are found to answer the purpose very well in
                    situations where the water is not exposed to frost. One of these is represented
                    in fig. 4, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> being the pipe by which the gas is
                    introduced, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> a vertical pipe admitting of a small

                <p>The gas being duly purified and prepared for combustion, the next point to be
                    considered is the transmission of it from the gasometer to the various places
                    where it is to be consumed. As it must sometimes be conveyed, particularly in
                    the case of large establishments, to the distance of several miles, it is
                    evident that unless the diameters of the various pipes through which it is to be
                    conducted have a due relation to the quantity of gas to be transmitted, there
                    will be a danger either of incurring an unnecessary expense, by making the pipes
                    too large; or, what is still worse, of being exposed to a deficiency of supply,
                    by making them too small. The first object, therefore, to be ascertained by the
                    engineer, is the probable number of lights that may be required in the various
                    streets and lanes in which these pipes are to be laid; and these being known,
                    the corresponding quantity of gas, according to the quality of it, may be
                    afterwards computed. With regard to the relative dimensions of the pipes at
                    different distances from the gaswork, the only general rule to be observed is,
                    that the sum of the areas of the sections of the main-pipes proceeding
                    immediately from the gasometer, should be equal to the sum of the areas of the
                    sections of the various branch-pipes which they supply with gas; and this rule,
                    with some little modification, should be followed in the case of the subordinate
                    ramifications.</p>
                <p>In the case of good coal-gas, we may safely reckon that one fourth of a cubic
                    foot of it will furnish the light of a moulded candle for an hour, of which one
                    pound will, when the candles are burnt in succession, last forty hours. On this
                    supposition, and assuming that the pressure upon the gas in the gasometer is
                    equal to three fourths of an inch of water, the diameters of pipes necessary for
                    conveying various quantities of gas may be stated as follows :—</p>

                </table>
                <p>This table has been deduced partly from theoretical considerations, and partly
                    from the results of experiment. Peckstone affirms, in his work on Gas-lighting,
                    that a pipe ten inches in diameter is capable of transmitting 50,000 cubic feet
                    of gas per hour, under a pressure of one inch of water, while, according to the
                    statement of Mr Creighton, such a pipe would scarcely convey the tenth part of
                    that quantity, under a pressure of from four eighths to three fourths of an inch
                    of water. It is impossible to reconcile these discordant statements, either by
                    an allowance for the difference of pressure, or the difference of the specific
                    gravities of the gases; for it ought to be kept in view that the discharge of
                    gas is directly proportional to the square root of the height of the column of
                    water by which it is pressed, and inversely as the square root of the specific
                    gravity of the gas. Both of these propositions, however, must be greatly
                    modified by friction, and consequently by the lengths of the pipes through which
                    the gas is conveyed. In the supply stated to be furnished by pipes of different
                    dimensions, we have deemed it safest rather to underrate the quantity, than
                    overrate it.</p>
                <p>The main-pipes are usually made of cast iron, joined together with socket joints,
                    in lengths of three yards. The depths of the sockets vary in pipes of different
                    sizes, from three to six inches, part of them being fitted with gasket to bring
                    the centres of the pipes into line, and the remainder with lead after the gasket
                    has been driven home with suitable chisels or caulking irons. The depth of lead
                    to secure a good joint, should not be less than an inch and a half; the interval
                    between the spigot and socket being from three eighths to seven eighths of an
                    inch, according to the diameter of the pipe.</p>
                <p>As a considerable quantity of water is carried off by the gas in the state of
                    vapour, which is afterwards condensed in the pipes, some arrangement must be
                    made for its collection and occasional removal; and accordingly, in laying the
                    pipes, care must be taken to give them a regularity of declivity towards one or
                    more points, where proper syphons, close vessels, and cocks must be placed, to
                    receive and discharge the collected water. When these precautions are neglected,
                    or when the levels are inaccurately taken, much annoyance is experienced; and as
                    the evil can only be corrected by lifting and rejoining the pipes, the utmost
                    attention should be paid to guard against it at first.</p>
                <p>For stopping off the gas in large pipes, valves luted with water or mercury,
                    according to the degree of pressure to be resisted, are usually employed. One of
                    the most simple forms of these valves is represented in fig. 8, Plate CCLVIII.
                    where <hi rend="italic">aa</hi> is the valve, having the shape of an inverted
                    cylindrical cup, which is raised and depressed by a rod c passing through an
                    air-tight stuffing-box; and <hi rend="italic">bb</hi> an annular cavity or
                    interval, partially filled with water or mercury, into which the valve descends
                    when it is shut.</p>
                <p>To convey the gas from the main-pipes, and distribute it through the various
                    apartments of dwelling-houses, pipes made of block-tin are generally used; these
                    being more durable and better adapted to the purpose than pipes composed of
                    copper or any other metal. In arranging the interior fittings, the same
                    precautions must be observed as were recommended in the case of the main-pipes,
                    viz. to give the various branches a due degree of inclination, so as to cause
                    all the condensed water to flow to one or more points, where proper cocks must
                    be placed for its removal. Unless this be done, the lights will be apt to
                    flicker, or be extinguished at times altogether. Nor is it of trivial moment to
                    enjoin the workmen, when they are soldering the service-pipes, to avoid with the
                    utmost care allowing any of the melted metal to find its way into the inside of
                    the pipes; it being in a great measure to this circumstance, that the deficiency
                    in the supply of gas, so frequently complained of, is chiefly owing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Governor or Regulator.</hi></p>
                <p>The quantity of gas consumed in large towns varying greatly at different times,
                    it is evidently a matter of some importance to the public, as well as to the
                    manufacturers of gas, that the supply of it should be duly adjusted to the
                    consumption; so that when the lamps are once regulated to a proper height of
                    flame, they may continue afterwards to burn with the same steady light
                    throughout the whole of the evening. Any contrivance that can accomplish so
                    desirable an object must save a great deal of trouble to the consumer of gas,
                    and much unnecessary waste of it to the manufacturer; and such is the design of
                    the governor or regulator. Fig.5,Plate CCLVI.representsoneof these contrivances,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193518595" xml:id="kp-eb0710-8595-0356"/><hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> being the pipe proceeding from the gasometer, by which the
                    gas is admitted, and <hi rend="italic">f</hi> the pipe by whicłi it escapes; c
                    is a valve of a conical form, fitted to the seat <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and
                    raised and depressed by means of the rod <hi rend="italic">dg,</hi> to which it
                    is attached; <hi rend="italic">ddd</hi> is an inverted conical vessel, formed of

                    >ee,</hi> in which water is contained to the level represented. The gas,
                    entering at <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> passes through the valve, fills the upper
                    part of the inverted vessel <hi rend="italic">dd,</hi> which it thus partially
                    raises, and escapes at/. If the pressure from the gasometer be unduly increased
                    or diminished, the buoyancy of <hi rend="italic">ddd</hi> will be increased or
                    diminished in like proportion, and the valve being by this means more or less
                    closed, the quantity of gas escaping at <hi rend="italic">f</hi> will be
                    unaltered. And not only will the governor accommodate itself to the varying
                    pressure of the gasometer, but also to the varying quantities of gas required to
                    escape at <hi rend="italic">f for</hi> the supply of the burners. Thus, if it
                    were necessary that less gas should pass through ∕ in consequence of the
                    extinction of a portion of the lights, the increased pressure which would thus
                    be produced at the gasometer would raise the governor, and partially shut the
                    valve, till the state of it was duly adapted to the requisite supply of gas.</p>
                <p>Fig. 6 is another contrivance for the same purpose, which acts in a similar
                    manner. The gas enters at <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and escapes at/ The valve

                    apparatus is the same as that of the contrivance we have already described. Both
                    of them must be regulated by weights applied to the vessels <hi rend="italic"
                    >dd;</hi> but these being once accommodated to the supply of gas, no further

                <p>The gas-meter is a simple but ingenious mechanical contrivance, the design of
                    which is to measure and record the quantity of gas passing through a pipe in any
                    given interval of time. The expense of these machines has hitherto formed the
                    principal objection against their use; but already they are largely employed by
                    several gas companies in England as well as in Scotland. They will probably be
                    found, upon trial, to be no less advantageous to the consumer than to the
                    manufacturer of gas, by allowing the former to use gas without any unnecessary
                    waste of it, and securing to the latter a fair and regular price for the
                    quantity of it actually consumed.</p>
                <p>Fig. 7, Plate CCLVI., exhibits sections of one of these gas-meters, where <hi
                    rend="italic">cc</hi> represents the outside case, having the form of a flat
                    cylinder; α is a tube which enters at the centre for admitting the gas, and <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> is another for conveying it off to the burners; <hi
                    rend="italic">g, g</hi> are two pivots, one supported by the tube <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> and the other by an external water-tight cup, projecting
                    from the outside casing, and in which is contained a toothed wheel A, fixed upon
                    the pivot, and connected with a train of wheel-work (not shown in the figure) to
                    register its revolutions. The pivots are fixed to and support a cylindrical
                    drum-shaped vessel <hi rend="italic">ddd,</hi> having openings <hi rend="italic"
                    >e, e, e, e,</hi> internal partitions <hi rend="italic">er, er, ep er,</hi> and
                    a centre piece <hi rend="italic">ffff</hi> as represented in the figure. The
                    machine is filled with water, poured in at <hi rend="italic">h</hi> up to the
                    level of i, and gas being admitted under a small pressure at <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> it enters into the upper part of the centre piece, and forces its way
                    through such of the openings∕ as are from time to time above the surface of the
                    water. By its action upon the partition nearest in contact with the water (to
                    the right hand of the figure, in which all the partitions or openings are
                    shown), a rotatory motion is communicated to the cylinder; the gas from the
                    opposite chamber being at the same time expelled by one of the openings e, and
                    afterwards escaping at <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> as already mentioned.</p>
                <p>As the quantity of gas which passes through the machine in any given time depends
                    not only upon its internal dimensions and the number of revolutions which it
                    performs, but also upon the level of the surface of the water in which the
                    cylinder revolves, due care must be taken to maintain the water at the same
                    level, for the regular action of the meter. This is easily accomplished, by
                    pouring in water when necessary, till the superfluous quantity is discharged by
                    an orifice properly placed for the purpose.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Burners.</hi></p>
                <p>The most economical mode of consuming gas, so as to obtain from a given volume of
                    it the greatest possible quantity of light, both in degree and duration, is a
                    problem of no less importance than that of the most suitable arrangements for
                    its production and purification. The presence of oxygen, in some form or
                    another, being essentially necessary to produce ordinary combustion, it follows,
                    that from whatever cause that principle may be deficient in quantity, the
                    combustion must be imperfect; and when this is the case, it appears that the
                    light yielded by the combustible body is also diminished in a proportional
                    degree. On the other hand, if the quantity of oxygen brought into contact with
                    the combustible body be more than sufficient for its entire combustion, the
                    superfluous quantity of that gas, instead of augmenting the effect, can only
                    lower the temperature, and diminish, it may be presumed, in a corresponding
                    degree, the intensity of the light. This must be the consequence if the
                    brilliancy of the light yielded by a combustible body depends at all upon the
                    temperature to which it is exposed during its combustion; and that this is the
                    case may be inferred from the simple fact of causing the flame of a jet of gas
                    to play, first against a sheet of ice, and then against a bar of red’-hot iron,
                    when the difference of the light will be such as to leave no doubt of the
                    influence of temperature upon its intensity. A similar result is obtained by
                    bringing the flames of two separate jets into contact, when an obvious increase
                    of light is perceived. From these simple facts it may be inferred, that though a
                    certain quantity of common air must be brought into contact with the inflamed
                    gas to produce the greatest intensity of light, whatever exceeds that quantity
                    will not only be useless, but, by diminishing the temperature of the flame, must
                    tend to impair the brilliancy of its light.</p>
                <p>But though the immediate cause of the light is probably the high temperature to
                    which the carbonaceous portion of the gas is exposed, the condition in which the
                    carbon exists, at the time it is so exposed, is of the utmost importance to the
                    effect. According to the opinion of Sir Humphry Davy, as adopted by Drs
                    Christison and Turner, “a white light is emitted only by those gases which
                    contain an element of so fixed a nature as not to be volatilizable by the heat
                    caused during the combustion of the gas; and that in coal-gas this fixed element
                    is charcoal, formed by the gas undergoing decomposition before it is burnt. The
                    white light is caused by the charcoal passing into a state, first of ignition,
                    and then of combustion. Consequently no white light can be produced by coal or
                    oil gas, without previous decomposition of the gas.”</p>
                <p>“That the gas undergoes decomposition before it burns, and that the carbonaceous
                    matter is burnt in the white part of the flame in the form of charcoal, is shown
                    by <pb break="no" facs="nls:193518608" xml:id="kp-eb0710-8608-0357"/>placing a
                    piece pf wire-gauze horizontally across the white part of the flame, when a
                    large quantity of charcoal will be seen to escape from it unburnt. And that this
                    previous change is necessary to the production of a brilliant white light, will
                    appear, if we consider the kind of flame which is produced when decomposition
                    does not previously take place. For example, if the gauze be brought down into
                    the blue part, which always forms the base of the flame, no charcoal will be
                    found to escape. Or, if the gauze be held at some distance above the burner, and
                    the gas be kindled not below but above it, by which· arrangement the air and the
                    gas are well mixed previous to combustion, the flame is blue, and gives hardly
                    any light. The reason is obviously, that in both cases the air is at once
                    supplied in such quantity in proportion to the gas, that the first effect of the
                    heat is to burn the gas, not to decompose it.” <hi rend="italic">{Edin. Phil.
                    Journ.</hi> No. XXV.)</p>
                <p>To these statements it may be added, that if a jet of oil or coal gas, burning
                    with a fine yellow flame in common air, be suddenly surrounded with an
                    atmosphere of oxygen gas, the colour instantly changes into a pale blue,
                    yielding the most feeble light; nor does the flame recover its brilliancy till
                    the oxygen is largely diluted with carbonic acid, when it burns for a short time
                    with greater splendour than at first. For though the light is greatly enfeebled
                    when the combustion of the gas takes place in pure oxygen, it becomes much more
                    vivid when the combustion is carried on in air, which is more largely charged
                    with oxygen than common air. Hence the brilliancy of the light appears to depend
                    upon two conditions: ls⅛ The perfect combustion of a portion of the gas, in an
                    undecomposed state; 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> the temperature produced by
                    that combustion upon the residual part, in a decomposed state. When a large
                    portion of the gas is consumed in the first condition, the temperature is
                    higher; but the undecomposed part is then too small in quantity to yield an
                    intense light, in consequence of the attenuated state of the carbon; and, on the
                    other hand, when a small portion of the gas is consumed in the undecomposed
                    state, the temperature produced is too feeble to raise the temperature of the
                    now partially decomposed part to a sufficient pitch for the full ignition of the
                    carbon.</p>
                <p>The conditions which thus seem to be necessary for obtaining the greatest portion
                    of light from the combustion of a given quantity of gas, while they are
                    perfectly consistent with the most anomalous facts presented by that process, so
                    they appear to afford the only sure principles upon which we can proceed in the
                    construction of gas-burners. One of the most obvious conclusions deducible from
                    these principles is, that whatever be the form of the gas-burner, its
                    construction should be such, that while it admits as much air, it should never
                    admit more than is barely sufficient for the perfect combustion of the gas.</p>
                <p>According to the experiments of Drs Christison and Turner, the character best
                    fitted for single-jet burners appears to be about one twenty-eighth of an inch
                    for coal-gas, and one forty-fifth for oil-gas. As these dimensions, however,
                    must vary with the quality of the gas, we consider one thirty-sixth of an inch
                    to be more applicable to the gas obtained from cannel coal, if its specific
                    gravity be not less than -65. Every form of burner composed of separate jets, in
                    which the gas is made to issue in a horizontal or oblique direction, gives a
                    consumption which increases in a much faster ratio than the light which it
                    yields; and consequently, however beautiful such burners may be in appearance,
                    they are far from being economical.</p>
                <p>One of the most useful forms of a burner with single jets, is where there are two
                    holes, and their directions are so inclined as to cause the streams of issuing
                    gas to cross, and exhibit during their combustion a broad continuous flame. This
                    burner, which is termed a <hi rend="italic">swallow-tail,</hi> is well adapted
                    for street-lights, as it gives a powerful light, and consumes a small quantity
                    of gas. When the gas is emitted by a narrow slit at the top of the burner, the
                    burner receives the name of a <hi rend="italic">bat-wing.</hi> Fig. 11, Plate
                    CCLVIII.</p>
                <p>But of all the forms of the burner, that upon the Argand principle, in which the
                    holes are arranged in a circle, so as to admit the air to have access to the
                    flame, externally as well as internally, is the most economical, and the best
                    calculated to secure the complete combustion of the gas. The diameter of the
                    holes should, in this burner, be about the fortieth part of an inch for coal-gas
                    of an ordinary good quality, and the distance between them should be such as to
                    allow the separate flame of the different jets to unite together and form a
                    continuous hollow cylinder of light. Fig. 12.</p>
                <p>The construction of burners, and the most economical mode of consuming gas,
                    having been examined with much philosophical precision by Drs Christison and
                    Turner, we shall extract from their elaborate dissertation on the subject, the
                    most valuable and important conclusions which these learned individuals deduced
                    from their experiments; and this we do with greater confidence, because the
                    results they obtained coincide very exactly with those we procured, when engaged
                    in the same inquiry. The three leading points to which they directed their
                    attention were, Is/, the length of flame most suitable for different burners;
                    2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> the form, magnitude, and position of the orifices
                    through which the gas is discharged; and, <hi rend="italic">Sdly,</hi> the
                    modifications of the light produced by the glass chimney of the Argand
                    burner.</p>
                <p>With regard to the length of flame which afforded the greatest light compared
                    with the expenditure of gas, they found that, in the case of the jet, the best
                    length for coal-gas was about five inches, and for oil-gas about four inches.
                    When the flame was kept shorter, the quantity of gas consumed was greater in
                    comparison of the light which it yielded; but no advantage was gained by
                    increasing the length beyond that mentioned as the most suitable for each gas;
                    the combustion becoming less perfect, and beginning to be accompanied with the
                    escape of the carbon in the form of smoke. Thus they found that, in the case of
                    coal-gas having the specific gravity ∙602, while the lights emitted from a
                    two-inch and a five-inch flame were as 556 to 1978, the corresponding
                    expenditures were to each other as 605 to 1437. But the light, in an economical
                    point of view, must be estimated inversely as the quantity of gas from which it
                    is obtained; and hence the ratio of the lights, in reference to the expenditure,
                    was as <hi rend="superscript"> t0</hi> ÷⅛V&gt; <hi rend="superscript"> bein</hi>
                    8 <hi rend="superscript"> as 100 t</hi> ° <hi rend="superscript"> 150</hi> ∙</p>
                <p>In the case of Argand burners, the augmentation of the light, in a ratio greater
                    than the expenditure, was exemplified in a still more remarkable degree. Thus
                    the following results were obtained with coal-gas of the specific gravity ∙605,
                    by elevating the flame of a five-holed burner, successively from half an inch to
                    five inches.</p>

                <p>These facts receive a satisfactory explanation from the general principles which
                    we have already laid down with respect to the combustion of the luminiferous
                    gases. When the flame is short, the supply of oxygen for the combustion is too
                    great; almost the whole of the gas is thus consumed before any portion of it can
                    undergo the decomposition which is necessary for the evolution of light; while
                    the temperature of the flame being reduced by the superfluous air which brushes
                    along its surface, the intensity of ignition, and with it the splendour of the
                    light, is proportionally diminished. This explanation is well illustrated by
                    partially shutting the central part of the burner, and thus interrupting the
                    supply of air to the internal surface of the flame; the moment this is done, the
                    length of the flame is increased, and a visible improvement of the light takes
                    place, thus indicating that more air was previously brought in contact with the
                    gas than was requisite for its perfect combustion.</p>
                <p>s The second point to which Drs Christison and Turner directed their attention
                    was the construction of the burner itself, particularly the magnitude and
                    position of the orifices at which the gas is emitted during its combustion. The
                    same principles which explained the relation between the light and the
                    expenditure, in the case of flames of different lengths, suggested the rule for
                    regulating the dimensions of the orifices; and accordingly they justly inferred
                    that, in a single jet, the diameter of the aperture ought to be such as to
                    ensure the complete combustion of the gas, without rendering it more vivid than
                    is necessary for that effect. If the orifice be too small, the greater portion
                    of the gas is liable to be consumed without suffering a previous decomposition,
                    and thus the light is extremely feeble; and, on the other hand, if the orifice
                    be too large, the surface of the flame exposed to the action of the air being
                    too small in comparison of the discharge of gas, the combustion is imperfect,
                    and the carbon, after being separated from the hydrogen, either burns at a low
                    temperature with a dusky flame; or, what is still worse, a large portion of it
                    passes off in the state of smoke. In conformity with these views, they
                    recommend, as we have already stated, a twenty-eighth of an inch for coal-gas,
                    and a forty-fifth for oil-gas, as the most suitable dimensions for single jets.
                    They acknowledge, however, that their experiments with coal-gas were too limited
                    to justify them in using very confident language on the subject; and we have
                    therefore the less hesitation in stating that we consider an orifice, varying in
                    diameter from a thirty-second to a thirty-sixth of an inch, as better adapted to
                    coal-gas of a specific gravity between ∙62 and ∙70.</p>
                <p>In Argand burners the diameter of the orifices ought to be a little smaller. Drs
                    Christison and Turner state that the diameter which appeared to answer best for
                    coal-gas of the specific gravity ∙6, when the holes are ten in a circle of three
                    tenths of an inch radius, was a thirty-second of an inch. We consider this,
                    however, to be too great for coal-gas of a better quality, and would recommend,
                    in preference, apertures varying in diameter from a thirty-sixth to a fortieth
                    of an inch.</p>
                <p>The distance between the jet-holes of Argand burners is a matter of no less
                    importance than the diameter of the orifices, and must be regulated by the same
                    principles. When they are so far asunder that the flames of the separate jets do
                    not coalesce, no advantage is derived from the Argand form; but when they unite,
                    and compose an uniform and unbroken surface of flame, the light is considerably
                    greater, compared with the expenditure of gas, than is obtained from detached
                    jets. In order to determine the most suitable distance at which the orifices of
                    Argand burners should be placed, Drs Christison and Turner took a burner six
                    tenths of an inch in diameter, which they caused to be drilled with eight, ten,
                    fifteen, twenty, and twenty-five holes, a fiftieth of an inch in diameter; and
                    having determined, with each of these burners, the light and expenditure, in the
                    case of oil-gas, they obtained the following results.</p>

                <p>As the standard of comparison was a single jet, burning with a four-inch flame,
                    the ratio of the light yielded b} which to the expenditure was expressed by 100,
                    it was inferred that no advantage is gained by giving the jets the Argand
                    arrangement with a burner of the dimensions above mentioned, if the holes are
                    only eight in number; and that the gain does not increase after the numbet
                    reaches to twenty. In the former case the distance ol the holes must have been
                    ∙2356 inch, or nearly one fourth of an inch, and, ib the latter, *0945; so that
                    the most advantageous distance for jet-holes of a fiftieth of an inch in
                    diameter would seem to be about <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛jths of an inch,
                    For coal-gas burners, however, the distance between the jet-holes ought to be
                    increased in a ratio varying inversely with the quality of the gas, or directly
                    as the diameters of the orifices themselves. Hence, if the coal-gas were of an
                    ordinary quality, the jet-holes should not be less than one eighth nor more than
                    one sixth of an inch from each other.</p>
                <p>The distance between the orifices being once assumed, serves to determine the
                    diameter of the circle of holes. Thus, in a burner of eighteen holes, each a
                    seventh of an inch asunder, the circumference ought to be 18 × - <hi
                    rend="subscript"> =</hi> 2∙57 inches, and consequently the diameter of the
                    circle 2∙57</p>
                <p>of holes should be = ' <hi rend="superscript"> 818</hi> inch. If the breadth of
                    the rim be supposed a tenth of an inch, and perhaps it ought not toexceed that
                    quantity, it may be proper, in the case of the larger burners, to contract the
                    lower part of the central air-hole, on account of the supply of air to the
                    inside surface of the flame increasing in a faster ratio than the number of
                    jets.</p>
                <p>The only remaining point to be considered with respect to the burner is the glass
                    chimney, which serves at once to protect the flame from irregular currents of
                    air, and to convey to the gas a due supply of it during combustion. When the
                    interval between the chimney and the external part of the flame is too great,
                    the tendency of the air to flow through the air-hole is diminished, and the
                    flame contracts towards the top, where it yields a dusky light, and indicates a
                    disposition to smoke. The diameter of the chimney should therefore be reduced
                    until it is perceived that the upper part of the flame is enlarged, and acquires
                    the same diameter as the lower part. When this is the case, the colour of the
                    flame is improved in brightness, and none of the carbon is uselessly wasted in
                    the formation of smoke. On the other hand, if the supply of air to the external
                    surface of the flame be diminished beyond a certain extent, either by reducing
                    the diameter of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193518634" xml:id="kp-eb0710-8634-0359"
                    />the glass chimney, or by any other means, the flux of air through the central
                    air-hole is unduly increased, the flame diverges in the form of a tulip till it
                    touches the chimney, and the supply of air to the outside of the flame being
                    thus interrupted, smoke is again produced. Hence the greatest degree of light,
                    in relation to the expenditure of gas, may be expected to be obtained when the
                    supply of air to the external and internal surface of the flame is so adjusted
                    by the diameter of the chimney that the flame is perfectly cylindrical, neither
                    burning with too much vivacity, nor showing any tendency to smoke. The length of
                    the glass chimney is of much less importance than its diameter, and may vary
                    from five to six inches.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Apparatus for Preparing Oil-Gas.</hi></p>
                <p>When tallow or oleaginous matter of any kind is raised to a certain pitch of
                    temperature, it is resolved into various gases, of which the compounds of carbon
                    and hydrogen, viz. olefiant gas or bicarburetted hydrogen, and light carburetted
                    hydrogen, are the principal, both in point of quantity and quality, for the
                    purposes of illumination. As oil contains in its composition a portion of
                    oxygen, existing most probably in union with hydrogen in the state of water,
                    that substance also yields, during its destructive distillation, a considerable
                    quantity of carbonic oxide, as well as traces of carbonic acid, hydrogen, and
                    even nitrogen. With these products, all of which are of a determinate character,
                    is found in greater or lesser abundance a quantity of a very inflammable
                    vapour,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The oleaginous
                    vapour alluded to consists, according to the experiments of Mr Faraday, of two
                    distinct compounds of carbon and hydrogen. One of these he terms <hi
                    rend="italic">bicarburet of hydrogen,</hi> which, by his analysis, is composed
                    of six proportions of carbon and three of hydrogen. The other compound, to which
                    Dr Thomson has given the name of <hi rend="italic">quadro-carburetted
                    hydrogen,</hi> consists of four proportions of carbon and four proportions of
                    hydrogen, existing in a different state of aggregation from that in which they
                    exist in bicarburetted hydrogen, the elementary constituents of which are in the
                    same proportion.</p></note> which seems to be a compound of carbon and
                    hydrogen.</p>
                <p>Oil-gas owes its illuminating power chiefly to the proportion of olefiant gas
                    which it contains, and the oleaginous vapour which is diffused through it; and
                    as both of these ingredients vary exceedingly with the temperature at which the
                    decomposition is effected, the quality of oilgas is extremely fluctuating. When
                    the temperature is too high, a portion of the olefiant gas and oleaginous vapour
                    is resolved, by the deposition of carbon, into light carburetted hydrogen; and
                    though the quantity of gas from a given portion of oil is thus increased, the
                    quality of it is diminished in a still higher ratio. On the other hand, if the
                    temperature be rather too low, a larger quantity of olefiant gas, mixed with a
                    greater proportion of oleaginous vapour, is obtained; but as the latter is
                    gradually and rapidly condensed when the gas is allowed to stand over water, the
                    higher illuminating power of this richer gas is more than counterbalanced by the
                    deficiency in its quantity, and the deterioration to which it is liable by
                    keeping.</p>
                <p>We are indebted to Dr Henry of Manchester for the first analysis of the aeriform
                    compounds obtained by the decomposition of oil by heat; and though his elaborate
                    researches can scarcely be said to have led to the determination of the precise
                    products of that decomposition, they furnish data from which their true nature
                    may be inferred, with a probability nearly as great as that which belongs to the
                    results of direct experiment. The principal difficulty of the analysis consists
                    in determining the condition in which the elementary principles of carbon and
                    hydrogen exist in union with each other, and reconciling the various
                    suppositions that may be made respecting the compounds thus formed, with the
                    specific gravity which belongs to the original gas, supposed to be produced by
                    their mixture.</p>
                <p>The results of Dr Henry’s first experiments were published in 1805; but it was
                    not till about ten years after that period that an apparatus for decomposing
                    oil, on a large scale for economical purposes, was constructed. In 1815 a patent
                    was obtained by Mr Taylor, in which he was afterwards joined by Mr Martineau,
                    for producing gas from oil, by means of an apparatus which was employed with
                    little variation in all the oil-gas establishments, which were subsequently
                    formed in various parts of the country. The general arrangements adopted in that
                    apparatus will be readily understood from figs. 5, 6, and 7, Plate CCLVIII.</p>
                <p>The retort <hi rend="italic">aaaa,</hi> has the form of a horse-shoe, being

                    and allowed to drop into the retort upon fragments of brick or coke heated to

                    from the retort, at the opposite limb where the oil entered through the upright

                    interest they had in the whale-fisheries, there was the strongest inducement to
                    foster the unfounded prejudices, which prevailed for some time against the use
                    of coal-gas. The exaggerated advantages which it was pretended would be derived
                    from compressing oil-gas, and thus rendering it portable, served to prolong the
                    gross delusions on the subject, under which the public mind, led astray as it
                    was, not less by novelty than by erroneous statements, so long laboured; nor
                    were these delusions fully removed, until a demonstration was given of the
                    failure of the scheme, in the decay of the costly edifices, and expensive
                    apparatus, which, in defiance of all sober calculation, had been constructed for
                    carrying it into effect.</p>

                    powers; it being by these methods that we ac quire a knowledge of one of the
                    most important tests, by which the comparative value of the gases can be
                    ascertained.</p>
                <p>- The first and most obvious of these tests is to determine the intensity of the
                    light which the gases are capable of diffusing during their combustion, upon a
                    white and smooth surface, directly exposed to its emanations. The determination
                    of that intensity is obtained with the greatest accuracy, not by a direct
                    comparison of the degree ol illumination shed on two separate surfaces, but by
                    means of a happy contrivance, first proposed by Count Rumford, which allows the
                    illuminated surfaces to be contrasted with each other on the same ground, and so
                    closely adjoining, that the eye can readily detect the slightest difference
                    between them. The contrivance, which is extremely simple and easily applied, is
                    as follows: Let A and B, fig. 8, Plate CCLVI., be two luminous objects; EF a
                    smooth and white surface, having the same inclination to the rays of light
                    emitted by A and B; and CD an opaque cylindrical rod parallel to the surface EF;
                    then it is evident that <hi rend="italic">aa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bb</hi>
                    will be the shadows of CD, in reference to the lights A and B. But the shadow
                    <hi rend="italic">aa</hi> being illuminated by the light B, and the shadow <hi
                    rend="italic">bb</hi> by the light A, it follows that if these shadows be
                    perfectly the same, in point of intensity of shade, the light yielded by A and B
                    must be the same in degree. If the shadows, however, be different, one of the
                    lights must be removed either further from EF or brought nearer to it, until the
                    shades seem to be exactly alike, when the light shed upon EF by A and B, must,
                    in point of intensity, be, as before, the same. But the intensity of light, like
                    that of other emanations proceeding in straight lines from a central point,
                    being inversely as the square of the distance, the relative degrees of light
                    emitted by A and B, must, in conformity with that principle, be proportional to
                    the squares of their respective distances from the surface, on which the shadows
                    are projected. Thus, if the light A was at the distance of fifteen feet, and the
                    light B at the distance of twenty-five feet, their relative illuminating powers
                    would be as the square of fifteen to the square of twenty-five; that is, as 225
                    to 625, or as 9 to 25. As the quantity of gas consumed in the same time to yield
                    the supposed lights might be different, it is evident that a correct estimate of
                    the absolute value of the gases, for the purpose of illumination, would not be
                    duly determined, unless that circumstance were also taken into account. But the
                    economical value of the gases, yielding equal degrees of light, being inversely
                    as the quantities consumed, it follows that that value will be directly as the
                    squares of the distances, at which the shadows are the same, and inversely, as
                    the rate of consumption. Thus, if we now suppose that the gas yielding the light
                    A consumed three cubic feet, in the same time that the gas yielding the light B
                    consumed five cubic feet, the value of the former would be to that of the
                    latter, as ⅜ is to ¾ <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>, or as three to five. In
                    obtaining the necessary data for determining the ratio of the lights, it may be
                    proper to add, that the screen on which the shadows are projected should be
                    guarded with the utmost care from all extraneous light. See PHOTOMETER.</p>
                <p>Though the determination of the intensity of light by the method of shadows is
                    extremely simple, and capable, when the necessary experiments are carefully
                    managed, of leading to all the precision which the nature of the problem
                    requires, it has been proposed, by those more conversant with chemical
                    researches, to ascertain the relative value of the gases used for illumination,
                    by finding the quantity of olefiant gas which they contain under equal volumes;
                    it being assumed that the illuminating power of the compound combustible gases
                    derived from the decomposition of oil and pit-coal, is directly proportional to
                    the quantity of that gas existingin their constitution. Though that supposition
                    is by no means a matter of certainty, or even of probability, we shall
                    nevertheless briefly explain the mode of analysis which is recommended by those
                    who have adopted it. According to the experiments of Dr Henry, chlorine has no
                    action upon any of the gases obtained from oil or coal, when the influence of
                    light is carefully excluded, with the exception of olefiant gas; and as chlorine
                    and olefiant gas unite together in equal volumes, this property affords an easy
                    mode of determining the quantity of the latter which may exist in any compound
                    gas of which it forms a constituent part. All that is required for the purpose
                    is to add somewhat more chlorine than is absolutely necessary for uniting with
                    the olefiant gas, and to allow the mixture to remain about fifteen minutes
                    completely excluded from light. The extent of the absorption being thus
                    observed, half the quantity of the gas which has disappeared of the whole
                    mixture will be olefiant gas. Thus, if twenty parts of chlorine by measure were
                    added to twenty-five of coal-gas, and if the mixture, after being allowed to
                    remain a sufficient length of time in the dark, was found to occupy thirty-six
                    measures, the absorption would be nine measures, and consequently the coal-gas
                    must have contained four and a half measures of olefiant gas, or eighteen per
                    cent. The quantity per cent, of olefiant gas is determined without calculation,
                    by adding to fifty measures of the gas to be analysed an equal volume of
                    chlorine; when the diminution of volume, in the graduated jar, is the quantity
                    which the gas contains per cent, of olefiant gas. Dr Fyfe states that the
                    illuminating power of the different specimens of oil and coal gas which he
                    subjected to this test bore a pretty exact ratio to the quantity of olefiant gas
                    they contained. One great advantage to be derived from this method of testing
                    the quality of any species of carburetted hydrogen containing olefiant gas in
                    its composition, is, that it admits of a comparison being made between gases in
                    different places and at different times, without the necessity of transporting
                    them to a distance, and making a simultaneous examination of their illuminating
                    properties.</p>
                <p>The specific gravity of oil and coal gas, and the quantity of oxygen which they
                    require for their perfect com-∣ bustion, have also been proposed as means of
                    ascertaining' their illuminating powers. The latter, however, even if <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> it were a correct test, is determined with
                    considerable dif^-; fìculty; and that little reliance can be placed upon the <hi
                    rend="subscript"> l</hi> former, may be inferred from the fact, that some of the
                    gases which are component parts of oil and coal gas have a great specific
                    gravity, without possessing any illuminating power. This will readily be

                <p>Though the examination of the relative values of oil and coal gas for the
                    purposes of illumination might seem to be an inquiry little calculated to awaken
                    party feeling, or lead to any great diversity of statement, there is perhaps no
                    subject of investigation that has been conducted with less candour and
                    impartiality. Nor is this remark merely applicable to the individuals who had an
                    obvious interest in supporting the superiority of either gas; for even men of
                    science, to whom it was apparently a matter of indifference which of the gases
                    ought to be preferred, lent in too many instances their authority to the
                    delusive and erroneous statements, which for a season misled public opinion on
                    the subject.</p>
                <p>As experience, the test to which all speculative doctrines relating to economy
                    and public utility must ultimately yield, has already decided that, in this
                    country at least, no establishment for manufacturing gas from oil can compete
                    with one in which it is prepared from coal, it is less necessary now than it was
                    formerly to lay before our readers a minute account of the comparative
                    advantages of the two systems; but as there may still be cases where, from the
                    scarcity of coal and the abundance of oil, it might be doubtful which of them
                    should be adopted, we shall briefly consider some of the leading points
                    connected with the two modes of illumination. These may be discussed under the
                    heads of, Isŕ, the illuminating power of the gases; 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>,
                    their purity; 3d, their heating power; 4M, their safety; and, 5M, their

                <p>1st, <hi rend="italic">The Jlluminalinĳ Power.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This
                    property may be considered either in regard to the relative light yielded by the
                    flames of the gases, when equal surfaces are taken, or with respect to the
                    absolute quantity of light furnished by equal volumes of the gases. In the
                    former case, though the light of oil-gas is certainly more brilliant than that
                    of coal, the difference is so slight that it is difficult to detect it by the
                    eye, or even by the method of shadows; but in the latter case, when the consumpt
                    of the gas, as well as the light which it yields, is taken into account, it
                    cannot be denied that the advantage is considerably in favour of oil-gas. In
                    consequence, however, of the great diversity of condition in which the two gases
                    are prepared, both with respect to their production and purification, the most
                    discordant statements have been given on this point. According to Mr Brande,
                    oilgas and coal-gas give equal degrees of light, when their volumes are as one
                    to two and a half; according to Dr Fyfe and Mr Leslie, when they are as one to
                    one and a half; and according to Mr Dalton, when they are as one to two and a
                    fourth. The greatest deviations were obtained by Messrs Phillips and Faraday,
                    and by Mr Ricardo, the former making the ratio as one to three and a half, and
                    the latter as one to four. The writer of this article, who made the comparison
                    between the two gases when each of them was of the best quality, found that a
                    very dense oil-gas, the specific gravity of which was l∙054, consumed at the
                    rate of 2779 cubic inches per hour, and yielded the light of thirteen and a half
                    tallow candles, being 206 cubic inches to give the light of a candle for an
                    hour; while a coal-gas, the specific gravity of which was ∙675, consumed at the
                    rate of 3900 cubic inches per hour, and yielded the light of thirteen candles,
                    being 300 cubic inches to give the light of a candle for an hour. From these
                    experiments the illuminating power of the oilgas was to that of the coal-gas as
                    206 to 300. It may be proper to add, that the oil-gas, after being kept five
                    days over water, consumed at the rate of 282 cubic inches per hour for the light
                    of a candle, and that the coal-gas kept in a similar manner, and for the same
                    length of time, consumed at the rate of 409 cubic inches per hour, and gave the
                    same degree of light. The deterioration produced on the oil-gas was therefore
                    thirty-seven per cent, and that on the coal-gas about thirty-six and a third.
                    According to the experiments of Drs Christison and Turner, when the oil-gas was
                    of the best, and the coal-gas of average quality, their relative illuminating
                    powers were as 100 to 260. This result, which was obtained from data obviously
                    unfavourable to coal-gas, cannot be admitted as exhibiting a fair estimate of
                    the illuminating power of the two gases; and as it may be presumed that, in some
                    of the other experiments which they performed with a view to determine the same
                    point, the effect of keeping the gases for different lengths of time over water
                    may have been overlooked, the results they obtained, which make the relative
                    powers of illumination as 100 to 233, are of less value. It appears that oil-gas
                    suffers more by keeping, even when it is not preserved over water, than
                    coal-gas. This seems to be owing to the deposition of an ethereal oil, already
                    noticed, which remains suspended in the gas for a short time after it has been
                    prepared, but which gradually separates from it when it cools, or is allowed to
                    remain in a state of repose. It is a singular fact, that though the specific
                    gravity of oil-gas, after it has been conveyed for some distance through pipes,
                    is materially diminished by the loss of this oleaginous vapour, scarcely any
                    trace of the latter is to be found in the vessels for collecting the condensed
                    matter, between the manufactory and the houses of the consumers of the gas. The
                    deterioration, however, is undoubted, and in some cases it amounts to thirty per
                    cent. We have even found that the best oil-gas, if kept for several weeks over
                    water, becomes so much debased in quality as to require 600 cubic inches per
                    hour to yield the light of one candle. Coal-gas suffers also by keeping, but in
                    an inferior degree; the olefiant gas, which it contains less abundantly, being
                    more largely absorbed, in the case of oil-gas, by the water over which it
                    stands.</p>
                <p>The mean result deduced by the writer of his article, from a very considerable
                    number of experiments performed with great care, and by means of suitable
                    apparatus for the purpose, is that 100 cubic inches of oil-gas are equal in
                    illuminating power to 160 of coal-gas, both being of good quality. The coal-gas,
                    it may be proper to mention, was produced from cannel coal, and purified without
                    coming in contact with water, by dry lime, or at least quicklime slightly
                    moistened, and mixed with a small portion of the peroxide of manganese. The
                    oil-gas was in most cases obtained by the patent apparatus of Taylor and
                    Martineau.</p>
                <p>2d, <hi rend="italic">The Purity.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Under the head of
                    purity we may consider the offensive smell-belonging to the materials from which
                    the gases are obtained; to the products connected with their decomposition; and
                    also to the gases themselves, as well as the tendency which the gases may have
                    to produce, during their combustion, substances capable of being deleterious to
                    health, or injuring any kind of household furniture exposed to their influence.
                    With respect to the first of these nuisances, it cannot be doubted that oil is
                    more apt to prove offensive to the neighbourhood than coal. The latter, if kept
                    for some months, only loses the water it had imbibed in the bowels of the earth,
                    and is thus rendered more fit for yielding a better gas, as well as one more
                    abundant in quantity; whereas the former becomes rancid and fetid by keeping,
                    and emits, by exposure, effluvia which are equally offensive and unwholesome.
                    The mere emptying of oil from one vessel to another, and especially the melting
                    of some kinds of it, which is necessary before it can be introduced into the
                    retorts, is attended with a degree of nuisance which no caution can entirely
                    prevent. To counterbalance these disadvantages, it must be admitted that the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193518673" xml:id="kp-eb0710-8673-0362"/> products^which
                    result from the decomposition of coal are not only of a more offensive nature,
                    but more abundant in quantity than those which are obtained from oil; and though
                    the extent of the nuisance which they occasion is greatly diminished in
                    well-regulated coal-gas works, by confining them in close vessels, it is
                    impossible altogether to prevent the annoyance to the neighbourhood, which their
                    removal from time to time produces.</p>
                <p>With respect to the smell of the two gases, they are so nearly the same when the
                    gases are properly purified, that it would be difficult to pronounce which of
                    them is least unpleasant. At any rate, when they are properly burnt, and
                    consumed without any portion of them being permitted to escape, no disagreeable
                    odour is perceptible; and, in this respect, either of them has a decided
                    advantage over tallow or oil used for the purpose of yielding light, and burnt,
                    according to the ordinary mode, with a wick.</p>
                <p>The most serious objection, however, against the use of coal-gas, was grounded on
                    the various impurities with which, in its crude state, it is more or less
                    contaminated. These impurities consist, as already stated in a preceding part of
                    this article, of tar, carbonic acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, and carbonate of
                    ammonia, some of which are so offensive that, without being freed from them,
                    coal-gas could never be brought into competition with oil-gas. When coal-gas was
                    first introduced, neither the tar nor the sulphuretted hydrogen was so
                    completely separated from it as to render it fit for being used in private
                    dwelling-houses; and accordingly strong prejudices continued to operate against
                    it, long after the cause which gave them birth had ceased to exist. As.it .is
                    now generally admitted, however, that coal-gas is so effectually purified, in
                    many establishments for its production, as not to exhibit the slightest trace of
                    sulphur when exposed to the most delicate fests for detecting the presence of
                    that substance, its value for the purpose of illumination, as contrasted with
                    that of oil-gas, must rest chiefly on considerations of economy. It has been
                    alleged, indeed, by Mr Brande, that though no indications of the existence of
                    sulphur in coal-gas could be discovered in it before it was burnt, he could
                    never procure any which did not afford traces “very minute” of sulphurous acid
                    during its combustion. But if he had submitted oil-gas to the same ordeal he
                    would have obtained a like result; a portion of sulphur being expelled from the
                    coke which is used in the retorts for decomposing the oil, and which sulphur
                    accordingly unites itself with the gas at the moment of its formation, and may
                    be detected by exposing the condensed aqueous vapour which is formed during its
                    combustion, to the action of the nitrate or acetate of barytes. In this respect,
                    therefore, the two gases must be admitted to be on the same footing.</p>
                <p>Under the head of purity it may not be improper to notice the quantity of aqueous
                    vapour which is produced during the combustion of the gases, by their union with
                    the oxygen of the atmosphere, as the water thus formed may be conceived to
                    possess in some measure the character of a nuisance. To obtain a correct
                    estimate of the quantity of this water, generated in any case, it will be
                    necessary to take into account the proportional relation between the volumes of
                    the gases yielding equal degrees of illumination, and the quantities of hydrogen
                    contained in these volumes. With respect to the former of these pointe, we have
                    already stated that 100 volumes of oil-gas are equal to 160 of coal-gas; but the
                    actual composition of the gases is still involved in some obscurity. According
                    to the experiments of Dr Henry,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>But as 82∙2 parts of carburetted hydrogen must have contained, in the condensed
                    state, 164∙4 parts of hydrogen; if to this be added the hydrogen of the olefiant
                    gas 26, we obtain 190∙4 for the whole quantity of hydrogen in the coal-gas.
                    Combining the results thus obtained with the numbers expressing the ratio of the
                    volumes of the gases, giving equal degrees of illumination, it appears that the
                    quantity of water generated by oil-gas will be to that generated in the same
                    time by coal-gas, as 100 × 172∙1 to 160 X 190∙4, being as 17,210 to 30,464, or
                    as five to nine nearly. Hence coal-gas must produce nearly twice as much watery
                    vapour in an apartment, during its combustion, as oil-gas yielding the same
                    degree of illumination.</p>
                <p>To determine how far the moisture thus generated may ι be regarded as a nuisance,
                    we shall make an exact calcu-ι lation in the case of an apartment, which we
                    shall suppose <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> to be twenty feet long, sixteen
                    feet broad, and eleven feet ' high, and containing therefore 6,082,560 cubic
                    inches. To light a room of these dimensions in the way commonly done with
                    coal-gas would require three Argand burners, each yielding the light of ten
                    candles, and consuming about 10,000 cubic inches of gas per hour. Now, as 100
                    cubic inches of coal-gas of ordinary quality contain, as we have already seen,
                    190∙4 of hydrogen in a condensed state, the quantity of the latter gas consumed
                    by the burners would be 19,040 cubic inches, which would yield 4284 grains of
                    aqueous vapour per hour. This quantity of water, diffused equally over the whole
                    apartment, would add about <hi rend="subscript"> τj</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript">
                    σ</hi> th part of a grain to the moisture previously existing in each cubic
                    inch. This may appear to be a very inconsiderable quantity; but as it is about a
                    fifth part of the whole of the moisture capable of existing in the air of the
                    atmosphere at the ordinary temperature of our rooms in winter, it would be
                    sufficient to occasion perfect dampness in an apartment, at that season, in the
                    course of four hours. In consequence, however, of the external cold, this state
                    of things never takes place, the greater part of the floating vapour being
                    reduced to the liquid form by condensation against the windows, long before the
                    air of the apartment is generally affected by it.</p>

                    them yielded, when they were exposed to that process. The apparatus we used for
                    the purpose was extremely simple, and of the following construction: <hi

                    composed of two concentric cylinders of tin-plate, which was furnished with a

                    diameter, and the internal <hi rend="italic">ow,fehg,</hi> three inches, the
                    former being twelve inches deep, and the latter six. From the bottom of the

                    of which was to carry off the air contaminated by combustion. When the apparatus
                    was used, a quantity of water at a fixed temperature was poured into the space
                    between the cylinders, till it stood at a mark <hi rend="italic">nn</hi> in the

                    experiments, equal portions of pounded ice were sometimes mixed with the water,

                    >—</hi> The explosive force of the gases, when they are mixed with various
                    proportions of common air, and the limits within which the explosive range is
                    confined in the case of each gas, may be considered under this head.</p>
                <p>Among the other delusive statements brought forward with so much confidence in
                    favour of oil-gas, it was even maintained, that while coal-gas is capable, when
                    mixed with common air, of producing the most violent explosions, the former was
                    almost exempt from that source of accident. Nor was this absurd and erroneous
                    opinion confined to the ignorant and ill-informed upon the subject; for we find
                    that Sir W. Congreve, in the report which he drew up for the instruction of the
                    British Government, on the state of gas-light establishments in the metropolis,
                    actually affirms in that document, that “the most important feature in the use
                    of oil-gas is its safety; as, from the very narrow limits of the explosive
                    mixture that can be formed of this gas and atmospheric air, it is scarcely
                    possible that an accident can occur.” Now, with regard to the limits of
                    explosion thus adverted to, we have found, by the most precise experiments,
                    varied in every conceivable way, that in general one volume of oil-gas will not
                    explode with less than three and a half volumes of common air, nor with more
                    than sixteen volumes; the explosion being most violent when the common air is
                    ten times the volume of the gas; in which case we found that a third part of a
                    cubic inch of oil-gas was capable of displacing with violence a cylindrical mass
                    of iron upwards of forty pounds in weight. One specimen of oil-gas of the
                    specific gravity l∙054, when it was newly prepared, and which, being kept two
                    days, became of the specific gravity ∙955, could not be made to explode with
                    less than seven and a half volumes of common air; but it continued to explode
                    till it was mixed with twenty-one volumes, when that effect could no longer be
                    produced. In the case of coal-gas the explosive range was more definite, and
                    less subject to variation in the proportions of its admixture with common air,
                    than oil-gas; the limits being between five and sixteen of common air to one of
                    the gas, almost invariably. The violence of the explosion was also greatly
                    inferior to that of an equal volume of oil-gas, as might readily be inferred
                    from its constitution. And not only are the explosions of oil-gas more
                    formidable than those of coal-gas, but, in consequence of the specific gravity
                    of the former approaching nearer to that of common air, they are, contrary to
                    the assertion of Sir W. Congreve, more likely to occur; so that in both these
                    respects oil-gas must be pronounced to be more dangerous than coal-gas.</p>
                <p>As it must be evident from what we have stated, that a considerable degree of
                    danger may be connected with the use of gas, whether obtained from oil or from
                    coal, it may not be improper now to examine a little more in detail the real
                    extent of this evil, in order that, by a due knowledge of the sources from which
                    it is most likely to arise, we may be prepared to guard against ns consequences;
                    or, if that be wholly impossible, to enable us at least to judge how far the
                    economy, and other advantages of this mode of obtaining artificial light may be
                    regarded as an adequate compensation, for the risk incurred in adopting it. On
                    this subject, where the safety of the public is so extensively involved, we wish
                    to use the language of caution, but not that of timidity; and while we admit
                    that in a few instances accidents of the most fatal nature have occurred from
                    the use of gas, we hesitate not to aflirm that these accidents might generally
                    be traced either to gross ignorance, or culpable negligence, on the part of
                    those who were the victims of them. Accordingly, we find that since the nature
                    of gas has become better known, the accidents from its use are few and trifling.
                    The danger, however, was regarded by the British legislature to be of too
                    serious a nature to be left entirely to the discretion of the manufacturers of
                    gas; and an inquiry into the subject was accordingly institutedin 1814, by order
                    of the Secretary of State for the Home Department. This led to a report from the
                    Royal Society, which was followed by a more minute examination of the subject by
                    Sir William Congreve, who was appointed by Government to prepare a report on the
                    state of the gas-works, in and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193518699"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-8699-0364"/>• about the metropolis. In this report, which was
                    laid before the public in 1824, Sir William Congreve arranges the dangers from
                    the explosion of gas, as well as those arising from peculiar defects in the
                    construction of the works, under three heads :—</p>
                <p>Is/, That which may occur at the gasometer.</p>
                <p>2d7y, That which may arise after the gas is expelled from the gasometer, in its
                    passage through the main-pipes under the streets.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">3dty,</hi> That which accompanies the use of it in the building
                    where it is consumed.</p>
                <p>In considering the chance of explosions occurring at the gasometer-house, he
                    begins with remarking, that, in the</p>
                <p>• first filling of a new gasometer with gas, or in remitting one which, from any
                    cause, may have been emptied, there is no contrivance for “exhausting the
                    atmospheric air;” and accordingly accidents, he states, have actually occurred
                    in the first filling. In proof of this assertion he mentions that “an explosion
                    happened at Manchester, in consequence of the people carrying lights about the
                    gasometer to ascertain if it was air-tight in the act of filling, and very
                    serious mischief ensued. The gasometer was blown to pieces, the house destroyed;
                    one man is said to have been killed, and others severely injured.” Now, this
                    source of danger is easily avoided, not by any “contrivance for exhausting the
                    air,” but simply by expelling it before the gas is introduced; precisely in the
                    same manner as the gas itself is expelled by the pressure of the gasometer.</p>
                <p>The next cause of explosion to which he adverts, is that arising from a gasometer
                    not perfectly air-tight being prevented from sinking by some defect in its chain
                    of suspension. This, however, is a very imaginary case, and so unlikely to
                    happen, that it is quite unnecessary to examine the supposed consequences by
                    which it would be followed, these being of so contingent a nature as to be
                    barely within the range of possibility.</p>
                <p>If the causes of explosion which we have noticed admit of being obviated by a
                    proper construction of the gas apparatus, and a moderate degree of caution on
                    the part of the workmen, there are others which Sir William Congreve has
                    mentioned that are scarcely deserving of any consideration, such as the danger
                    of explosion by lightning, and the chance of the counterpoise of the gasometer
                    falling by the breaking of its suspension-chain. On the first of these sources
                    of danger he remarks, “That it appeared to him such a combustion by lightning or
                    otherwise would produce very destructive effects to the neighbouring buildings
                    and gasometers, merely by the sudden rarefaction and expansion of the air caused
                    by it; and would, in fact, produce a violent detonation and concussion, without
                    supposing any combination of oxygen and hydrogen, but merely by the simple
                    conflagration of the hydrogen.” Are we to infer from these observations, that
                    Sir William Congreve thought it possible that hydrogen can undergo any species
                    of conflagration, however “simple,” without the presence of oxygen? or did he
                    merely mean to affirm, that if a gasometer were destroyed by lightning, and its
                    contents violently discharged into the air, the dreadful effects would be
                    produced which he describes? As we cannot suppose he entertained the former
                    opinion, we need merely say with respect to the second, that it is not only in
                    the highest degree improbable, but calculated to excite alarm when no reasonable
                    cause for it exists. For, granting that a gasometer were struck by lightning,
                    the electric fluid would either glide silently along its metallic sides to the
                    earth, or, if it penetrated the gas, produce no change on its condition beyond a
                    slight and partial enlargement of its bulk.</p>
                <p>With respect to the danger arising from the breaking of the suspension-chain of
                    the gasometer, Sir W. Congreve stated, that the gasometers are made so heavy as
                    to require sometimes a counterpoise of six or seven tons; and he adds, that “if
                    one of these weights should be detached while the gasometer is at work, the
                    pressure of that gasometer on the gas would, on a sudden, be so greatly
                    increased, that the lamps connected with it would immediately flare up to a
                    great height, and in many situations (in shops particularly) set fire to the
                    premises before the lamps could be turned off." This seems to be a most alarming
                    source of danger; and the importance of it weighed so much on the mind of Sir
                    William, that he mentions it in more than one part of his Report. It may be
                    proper, therefore, to examine how far it is calculated to produce the direful
                    consequences which he dreaded from its occurrence. The sudden disengagement of a
                    weight of six or seven tons, with the increase of a corresponding pressure on
                    the gasometer, appears at first sight to be an event likely to be attended with
                    some of the evils, which, it is so confidently stated, would result from it; but
                    the case is quite a hypothetical one; and had Sir W. Congreve reflected for a
                    moment that the pressure of even six or seven tons diffused over a surface of
                    1200 square feet, would be no more than 550 grains on a square inch, or equal to
                    the pressure of about two inches of water, he never would have introduced into
                    his Report such a groundless cause for alarm. The truth is, that the falling of
                    the counterpoise would increase the pressure upon the gas from three fourths of
                    an inch to perhaps two and a half inches of water; and, by doing so, might
                    excite a little momentary surprise on the part of the consumers of the gas, at
                    the unusual size of their lights; but such an occurrence could not by any means
                    produce the fatal consequences ascribed to it.</p>
                <p>The danger to which the community is exposed from the risk of accidents, by the
                    transmissions of the gas through the main-pipes, and its escape from these by
                    leakage, into cellars and other subterraneous places, where it' may accumulate
                    in considerable quantity, in admixture; with common air, is deserving of more
                    serious examination. It is to this cause, indeed, that we must ascribe the
                    principal accidents that have happened from the use of gas; and the utmost care
                    ought to be taken to guard against their occurrence. The best protection from
                    this source of danger is to be found by trying, with a forcing pump, all the
                    pipes before they are laid, and executing the different joints, where they are
                    connected, with a suitable quantity of lead, and in the most careful manner.
                    When clay can be easily procured, additional security is obtained by beating it
                    well into the tracks after the pipes are laid, so as to surround them with a
                    coating of it to the extent of several inches. This precaution is not only a
                    safeguard against the escape of the gas, but highly conducive to the durability
                    of the pipes.</p>
                <p>The last kind of danger to be considered is that which attends the use of gas,
                    through ignorance or negligence, in the building where it is consumed. It has
                    already been stated, that coal-gas will not explode unless it be mixed with more
                    than three, but less than fifteen times its own bulk. If we take the last
                    proportion, being the one from which danger is most to be apprehended in
                    dwellinghouses, it appears that the air of an apartment could not be brought to
                    a state which would place it within the range of explosion, unless it contained
                    a quantity of gas, in admixture with it, equal to one fifteenth part of itself.
                    The most probable way of such a state of things occurring, would be the neglect
                    of turning the stop-cocks of the burners after the extinction of the light. If
                    this were done in an apartment fifteen feet square and ten feet high, and
                    containing therefore 2250 cubic feet, it would require at least 150 cubic feet
                    of gas to be thrown into it before the adulterated air could explode. Now 150
                    cubic feet <pb break="no" facs="nls:193518712" xml:id="kp-eb0710-8712-0365"/>of
                    gas would afford a light equal to that of sixty candles burning for ten hours
                    together,—a quantity of light which, being ten times more than could ever be
                    required for an apartment of the size specified, it may reasonably be concluded,
                    that unless a room were of very small dimensions, and furnished with more gas
                    burners than necessary, little danger could arise even from the culpable neglect
                    of the stop-cocks. At the same time it ought to be noticed, that if the air of a
                    room were undisturbed, it is possible that a limited portion of it, sufficient
                    to occasion a dangerous explosion, might be brought to a detonating condition in
                    the immediate vicinity of the burner, though the rest of the air in the
                    apartment were not in that state. On the whole, therefore, while we are
                    decidedly of opinion that the risk of using gas is a great deal less than is
                    generally imagined, perhaps the best security to the public will be found to,
                    result from an exaggerated representation of its dangers. 1 ime, and the
                    experience of its advantages, will gradually remove unfounded prejudices against
                    its use, and ultimately render it the most general, as well as the most useful
                    and economical, mode of obtaining artificial light.</p>

                    >—</hi> Having examined at some length the more important of the physical
                    properties of the two gases, so far as these are connected with their utility
                    for the purpose of illumination, we shall, lastly, consider the relative
                    advantages which they possess in a commercial point of view. From a due
                    consideration of these properties, it can scarcely be doubted that, if the two
                    gases could be procured equally cheap, so as to afford an equal extent and an
                    equal degree of illumination at the same expense, most people would be disposed
                    to give a preference to oil-gas. The reasons however for doing so are by no
                    means of a kind to supersede the necessity of instituting a comparison between
                    the costs of their production; and in this respect, indeed, we shall find reason
                    to wonder by what sophistry and misrepresentation oil-gas could have maintained
                    so long a doubtful competition with coal-gas.</p>
                <p>Though the results of experiments on a small scale are frequently inapplicable to
                    extensive establishments, and, in the hands of rash and speculative men, often
                    lay the foundation of ruinous consequences, yet, when examined with due caution,
                    they are far from being of no value, but, on the contrary, frequently furnish
                    data from which much useful information is derived. Thus, we can ascertain from
                    experiments on such a scale, what quantity of gas is yielded from a particular
                    species of coal, and what quantity is obtained from a certain kind of oil. From
                    experiments of that description, it has been found that a pound of cannel coal
                    yields, at an average, from five to six cubic feet of gas, and a gallon of
                    whale-oil from eighty to a hundred cubic feet of it; and hence we may safely
                    infer, that sixteen pounds of that species of coal would produce as much gas as
                    a gallon of whale-oil. Now, sixteen pounds of coal, at 15 s. per ton, would cost
                    lįd.; and therefore, if we reckon the oil at 2β. per gallon, it would appear
                    that coal-gas costs little more than one twentieth part of an equal volume of
                    oil-gas. It must not be inferred, however, from this result, that it would be
                    proportionally more advantageous to employ coal in preference to oil, for the
                    manufacture of gas; it being possible that the smaller expense of the process of
                    decomposition, and the difference of the illuminating powers of the gases, may
                    compensate, to a certain extent, for so great an inequality in the cost of the
                    materials of production. It will be necessary, therefore, to consider these
                    points in detail, before we can form a true estimate of the relative economy of
                    the two modes of illumination.</p>
                <p>Before entering upon this inquiry, it may be proper to mention that a gallon of
                    whale-oil of the specific gravity •925 weighs almost exactly 53,950 grains. It
                    will be necessary to keep this fact in view, to check the extravagant statements
                    which have been given respecting the number of cubic feet of gas yielded by a
                    gallon of oil, which in some cases have been rated so high that the weight of
                    the gas would have exceeded the weight of the materials from which it was
                    pretended to be derived. On this point we have it in our power to furnish the
                    result of two years’ experience, from an exact register of the quantity of gas
                    yielded by the patent apparatus of Taylor and Martineau, at Kinfauns Castle, the
                    residence of Lord Gray, from which it appears to be exactly 70; cubic feet.
                    Hence the prime cost of a thousand cubic feet, if the oil were L.25 per ton,
                    would be 28s., independently of the expense of manipulation, and the interest of
                    capital. 11 we allow it to be only 26s., as stated by the patentees themselves,
                    we shall find that, even on this admission, oilgas cannot for a moment bear a
                    comparison in point ol economy with coal-gas. For if we compare this cost of
                    oil-gas, which, we must remember, is exclusive of the expense of production,
                    with the actual cost of a thousand cubic feet of coal-gas, which at an average
                    may be reckoned 5s. 3d., including every expense of outlay, we shall find the
                    one to bear to the other the ratio of about five to one. But as coal-gas is
                    inferior in illuminating power to oil-gas, in the proportion of 100 to 160, by
                    allowing for this difference of quality, it would appear that the prime cost of
                    coal-gas is less than one third of the cost of the mere oil requisite to yield
                    an equivalent quantity of oil-gas<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>At the Perth gas-work it appears, by the result of a year’s
                    experience, that 6,179,670 cubic feet of coal-gas are sold for L.2696. 15s- 9d.,
                    being at the rate of nearly 8s. 9d. for a thousand cubic feet, or Us. for an
                    equivalent quantity of oil-gas. But the cost of the oil which yields that
                    quantity of gas being 26s∙, it is evident, that without taking into account the
                    expense of the manipulations and interest of capital, a lose of 12s. would be
                    incurred on every 26s. expended for oil, in order to enable oil-gas to be
                    brought into competition with coal-gas. ð <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>One of the delusive representations respecting oil-gas, by which the public were
                    for a season misled, was, that more light was obtained from oil reduced to the
                    gaseous state, than that substance is capable of yielding when it is burnt in
                    the ordinary way. The incorrectness, however, of this assertion is clearly
                    demonstrated by the following exposition: a gallon of whale-oil consumed with a
                    wick, in <hi rend="italic">a good</hi> Argand lamp, we found, by the method of
                    shadows, to yield the light of ten tallow candles for seventy hours, or that of
                    seven hundred candles for one hour. But, according to the statement of Taylor
                    and Martineau, one and a half cubic feet of oil-gas give the light of ten
                    candles for the same time; and therefore a gallon of oil, yielding seventy and
                    three fourths cubic feet, ought to afford the light of 472 candles for an hour.
                    Hence the loss of light by decomposing the oil is in the ratio of 700 to 472, or
                    about thirty-two and a half per cent. This result coincides very nearly with
                    that which we obtain by comparing the weight of the gas with the original weight
                    of the oil, as already stated to be obtained at Lord Gray’s gaswork. For the
                    weight of seventy and three fourths cubic feet of oil-gas having the specific
                    gravity ∙92 (the average specific gravity we found it to have), ought to be
                    34,573 grains; and as a gallon of oil weighs 53,950 grains, the loss by
                    decomposition is 19,377 grains, or nearly thirty-six per cent.</p>
                <p>It appears from these statements, that while coal is converted<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193518725" xml:id="kp-eb0710-8725-0366"/> by its decomposition at a
                    gas-work into a substance greatly more valuable than the material in its
                    original condition, oil is reduced by the same process into one of diminished
                    value; insomuch that the manipulations and the capital expended upon an oil-gas
                    establishment are actually applied to reduce to the extent of thirty per cent,
                    the intrinsic value of the raw material, which, it was pretended, they improve
                    in an equal degree. Add to this, that the loss of gas in the main pipes is found
                    to be fully twenty per cent., and it follows that the light from oil-gas is
                    obtained at twice the expense at which it may be procured immediately from the
                    oil itself.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hints respecting the Improvement of Coal-Gas.</hi></p>
                <p>Of all the combustible bodies having an elementary character, carbon and hydrogen
                    are not only the most widely and copiously diffused throughout the three
                    kingdoms of nature, but best adapted by far for the evolution of light during
                    their combustion. It is only, however, when they are united together in due
                    proportion that they answer the purpose most effectually; and, indeed, in a
                    separate state, their illuminating powers are so feeble, that even when their
                    combustion is accelerated and rendered more perfect by the presence of oxygen,
                    the light they yield is yet unfit for many of the useful ends to which light is
                    subservient. The substances in which carbon and hydrogen are united in the best
                    proportion, for the production of light, are pit-coal in the mineral kingdom,
                    and oils and fatty matter in the animal and vegetable.</p>
                <p>The great abundance of coal, and the comparative cheapness at which it can be
                    obtained, give it a decided advantage in point of economy over oleaginous
                    matter, whether of animal or vegetable origin; while the processes of
                    decomposing it, with the view of converting it into a volatile and elastic
                    product, have been so much improved as to render the gas which it yields equally
                    fit for the purpose of illumination with the more costly gases obtained from the
                    oils.</p>
                <p>The gas produced by the decomposition of coal and oleaginous matter at a high
                    temperature is a compound of carbon and hydrogen, and consists chiefly of two
                    gases, in which these elementary substances exist in definite proportions. One
                    of these gases is termed carburetted hydrogen, and the other olefiant gas or
                    bicarburetted hydrogen. The former contains one atom of carbon united with two
                    atoms of hydrogen, and the latter an atom of each of these elements.</p>
                <p>Of these two compounds of hydrogen and carbon, that which contains the largest
                    proportion of the latter element is found to yield, during its combustion, the
                    most brilliant light, and that to for a longer period of time. And, indeed, so
                    great is the difference in these respects, that the hydrogen may not improperly
                    be regarded as the mere solvent or vehicle of the carbon, acting the part of
                    wick, and thus presenting that substance in a state sufficiently comminuted for
                    its more perfect combustion. Accordingly, the more abundantly the hydrogen is
                    impregnated with carbon, the greater may we expect to be its illuminating power,
                    and the fitter in every respect for yielding artificial light. These views are
                    fully supported by experiment; for not only is the brilliancy of the light
                    modified by the quantity of carbon held in solution by the hydrogen, but the
                    time which a given portion of the gas takes to consume away by combustion is
                    affected by it in a still greater degree.</p>
                <p>To determine in what ratio the illuminating power of the gases obtained both from
                    oil and coal was reduced <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> by diluting them in
                    various proportions with hydrogen, we instituted a series of experiments, the
                    results of which are of considerable importance, inasmuch as they decid-, edly
                    indicate, not only that the mixture is deteriorated,' but that the same quantity
                    of carbonaceous matter yields, less light the more largely it is diluted with
                    hydrogen.</p>
                <p>In the first experiment we took a portion of coal-gas of the specific gravity
                    ∙67, which we found consumed at the rate of 4400 cubic inches per hour, and
                    yielded the light of eleven candles, being 400 cubic inches per hour for the
                    light of one candle. This gas being diluted with a fourth part of its bulk of
                    pure hydrogen, acquired the specific gravity ∙55, and wasted away at the rate of
                    6545 cubic inches per hour, yielding the light of ten candles. As a fifth part
                    of the compound gas was hydrogen, the remaining four fifths, amounting to 5236
                    cubic inches, was the quantity of the coal-gas which, in its diluted state, gave
                    the light of ten candies for an hour; so that 524 cubic inches of the original
                    coal-gas were requisite to give the light of one candle for the same time. But,
                    in its unmixed state, 400 cubic inches were sufficient to give the light of one
                    candle for an hour; and consequently, the deterioration occasioned by the
                    dilution was in the ratio of 524 to 400, or of 100 to 76, being 24 per cent. It
                    must be distinctly kept in view that the deterioration has been reckoned, not
                    with respect to the whole volume of the mixture (in which case it would have
                    been 39 per cent.), but simply in reference to the coal-gas itself, and
                    therefore the experiment, so far as it goes, justifies us in adopting the
                    conclusion, that had the hydrogen existed originally in union with the coal-gas,
                    the latter would have improved in quality 24 per cent, by its abstraction; <hi
                    rend="italic">because the residuary portion would not only have lasted longer,
                    but yielded during its combustion a superior light.</hi></p>
                <p>In a second experiment, conducted in a similar manner, in which the proportion of
                    hydrogen was one third of the quantity of the coal-gas, the deterioration was 27
                    per cent.; in a third experiment, the proportion of hydrogen being a half of the
                    volume of the coal-gas, the deterioration amounted to 31 per cent.; and, in a
                    fourth experiment, the quantity of hydrogen being exactly equal to that of the
                    coal-gas, the deterioration extended to 36 per cent.</p>
                <p>These results indicate a progressive deterioration in the quality of coal-gas by
                    the admixture of hydrogen; and the important conclusion to which they lead is,
                    that the abstraction or removal of the latter, though diminishing the entire
                    volume, would improve the nature of the residuary portion, not only in a higher
                    ratio than the loss which the whole sustained in its bulk, but render that
                    portion capable of yielding, for a longer period of time, a greater light than
                    it could have done in its original state. Hence it may be inferred that the
                    illuminating power of coal-gas, whether considered with respect to the cost of
                    its production or the intensity of its light, admits of being improved; first,
                    by impregnating the hydrogenous element more largely with carbon; secondly, by
                    preventing the disengagement of hydrogen in a free state during the
                    carbonization of the coal; and lastly, by detaching a portion of that gas from
                    coal-gas when it already exists in admixture with it.</p>
                <p>The first of these modes of improvement seems to be practicable, at least to a
                    certain extent, by thoroughly drying the coal<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>&gt; The coal for making gas ought to be kept
                    for several months well protected from moisture before it is used for the
                    purpose. This is a point of the utmost importance in the manu£ieture of
                    gas.</p></note> before it is introduced into the retorts, and modifying the
                    pressure under which the gas is generated. The second, by intermixing with the
                    coal some substance which is at once capable of uniting with the hydrogen, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193518738" xml:id="kp-eb0710-8738-0367"/> and of being
                    afterwards detached, in its combined state, from the coal-gas with which it is
                    mixed. Such a substance is sulphur; and accordingly we find that the coal in
                    which sulphur abounds, though it yields an impure gas, yet, when duly purified,
                    that gas is of a superior quality to what is obtained from coal containing
                    sulphur in more sparing quantity. With respect to the third mode of improvement,
                    we are unfortunately, in the present state of our knowledge, acquainted with no
                    method of detaching hydrogen from the gases with which it is mixed in oil or
                    coal gas, that would not impair the illuminating power of these gases, to a
                    greater extent perhaps than the benefit that would be derived from the removal
                    of the hydrogen.</p>
                <p>To determine the diminution of the illuminating power produced by separating the
                    particles of the inflammable gas during its combustion, and thus diminishing the
                    temperature of the flame, it occurred to the writer of the present article, that
                    nitrogen, neither having the property of supporting combustion, nor of adding to
                    the quantity of combustible matter submitted to that process, was well fitted to
                    answer the intended purpose; and accordingly, on mixing coal-gas of ordinary
                    quality (which, when burnt alone, yielded the light of twelve candles when it
                    consumed 5400 cubic inches per hour) with varying portions of nitrogen, results
                    were obtained which implied that the diminution of the intensity of the light
                    proceeded in a ratio much more rapid, than was observed when the gas was diluted
                    with hydrogen. Thus, when six volumes of the coal-gas were mixed with one volume
                    of nitrogen, the expenditure per hour was 6000 cubic inches, and the light
                    equivalent to that of nine candles, being 667 cubic inches per hour for the
                    light of one candle. But one sixth of the whole being nitrogen, the remaining
                    four sixths, amounting to 556 cubic inches, was the quantity of the coal-gas,
                    which, in its diluted state, afforded the light of a candle for an hour. On the
                    other hand, the quantity of the coal-gas requisite, in its unadulterated state,
                    to give an equal degree of illumination, being <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> ∣J
                    <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>, or 450 cubic inches, it follows that the
                    deterioration was in the ratio of 556 to 450, or 100 to 81 nearly.</p>
                <p>By diluting the same coal-gas with other proportions of nitrogen as subjoined,
                    and afterwards applying to each of the results the same kind of reduction, as
                    that which we have already made, we have deduced the following table, which
                    exhibits the gradual deterioration of the illuminating power of the same
                    quantity of coal-gas, produced by the mere separation of the atoms of the gas,
                    during its combustion.</p>

                <p>When carbonic acid was used instead of nitrogen, similar results were obtained;
                    only the deterioration was considerably greater. Thus, when five volumes of the
                    coal-gas were mixed with one volume of carbonic acid, the illuminating power was
                    reduced from 100 to 30, whereas in the case of the nitrogen it was from 100 to
                    69. It is therefore a fortunate circumstance that carbonic acid, which is so apt
                    to be generated during the production of coal-gas, and has so debasing an
                    influence upon its illuminating power, is readily absorbed by a variety of
                    substances; while nitrogen, the less injurious, as well as the less abundant
                    accompaniment, cannot be separated from the other gases with which it may exist
                    in mixture, by any process yet known.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Deterioration of Gat by keeping ft after it it
                    prepared.</hi></p>
                <p>Both oil and coal gas suffer, by keeping, a gradual loss in their power of
                    illumination, which seems to increase in a more rapid ratio than the time they
                    are kept. The deterioration, though greatest when the gases are allowed to stand
                    over water, takes place in a considerable degree even when they are kept over
                    oil, or in air-tight vessels. Hence it may be presumed that the carbon held in
                    solution by the hydrogen, is separated from that element, partly by its own
                    gravity, and partly perhaps by uniting with the oxygen of a portion of the water
                    over which it is suspended.</p>
                <p>To whatever cause the deterioration is owing, the fact itself is undoubted. Thus,
                    an oil-gas which, when newly prepared, bad the specific gravity l∙054, gave the
                    light of a candle for an hour when it consumed 200 cubic inches; kept two days,
                    it gave the same light with a consumpt of 215 cubic inches per hour; and kept
                    four days, it required, for the same light, 240 cubic inches per hour. In the
                    case of a portion of coal-gas, which, when newly prepared, required 404 cubic
                    inches to yield the light of a candle for an hour; the same gas kept two days
                    required 430 cubic inches; and kept four days, 460 cubic inches to yield the
                    same light. These results indicate a progressive deterioration in the quality of
                    the gases, increasing with the length of time they are kept; and it is deserving
                    of remark, that in both gases the diminution of the illuminating power decreases
                    in a faster ratio than the time increases. After being kept three weeks, the
                    oilgas was so much debased in quality that it required 606 cubic inches of it to
                    yield the light of a candle for an hour; and hence its illuminating power was
                    reduced to one third of what it was when the gas was newly made. From these
                    experiments it may obviously be inferred, that both oil and coal gas should be
                    used as soon as possible after they are prepared.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Economy of Coal-Gas.</hi></p>
                <p>Among the advantages which have resulted from the introduction of coal-gas, we
                    may reckon, 1st, its compa-1 rative cheapness; and, <hi rend="italic"
                    >'2dly,</hi> its superiority to all the other' modes of artificial
                    illumination.</p>
                <p>In forming a comparative estimate of the cost of coal-; gas, and that of the
                    other means employed for procuring <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> artificial
                    light, we may contrast it with the expense of <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> wax,
                    tallow, and oil, the ordinary substances used for the' purpose. It deserves to
                    be remarked, however, that while <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> the price of
                    coal, in consequence of the regular and abundant supply of that article, is
                    liable to little fluctuation, the cost of wax, tallow, and oil, on account of
                    the more precarious nature of the sources from which they are obtained, varies
                    exceedingly in different seasons. The very extensive use, too, into which
                    coal-gas has been brought, has produced a considerable effect upon the price of
                    oil and tallow, as well as of wax; so that a comparative estimate of the expense
                    of procuring the same extent of illumination from coal-gas and from these
                    substances, must appear less favourable to the former than would have been the
                    case, had the comparison been made when gas was first introduced. But assuming
                    that a pound of tallow candles, which last, when burnt in succession, forty
                    hours, costs ninepence; that a gallon of oil, yielding the light of six hundred
                    candles for an hour, costs two shillings; that the expense of the light from wax
                    is three times as great as from tallow; and that a thousand cubic feet of
                    coal-gas cost nine shillings; we may state the relative cost of the same degree
                    of illumination from these different substances, after making a suitable

                <p>But the light obtained from coal-gas is not only procured at a smaller expense;
                    it is also more convenient for most purposes than the light yielded by other
                    substances. In the ordinary mode of lighting by tallow and oil, the light
                    derived from their combustion cannot be diminished in intensity without
                    considerable disadvantage and trouble; whereas, in the case of gas, it maybe
                    reduced in an instant from the most perfect splendour to the feeblest degree of
                    illumination, by the simple adjustment of the stop-cock. The advantages arising
                    from this easy method of regulating the light of gas, when it is used in the
                    chambers of the sick, and indeed in all apartments, where a variable, but
                    uninterrupted supply of light must be kept up, can only be duly estimated by
                    those who have experienced them. To every branch of manufacturing industry which
                    requires a steady and powerful light, the benefits which have resulted from the
                    introduction of coal-gas are not less important In many operations the light may
                    be conveyed by means of flexible pipes, connected together with ball and
                    socket-joints, so as to be almost in contact with the fabric it is intended to
                    illuminate, without the slightest risk of injury; and it may be kept in the same
                    state for many hours in succession, or altered, as circumstances may render
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>For lighting churches, theatres, and other public buildings, where a strong and
                    uniform light is required, gas answers the purpose more effectually than any
                    other mode of illumination; partly, from the facility of its application, and
                    partly, from the diversified and tasteful manner, in which the jets of flame may
                    be exhibited in various kinds of burners.</p>
                <p>As a street light, its superiority is universally admitted; and from that
                    application of gas it cannot be doubted that the metropolis, and other large
                    towns, have derived great additional security against the perpetration of
                    nocturnal crimes, as well as the means of carrying on the ordinary business of
                    life during the evening, with nearly the same convenience, as during the full
                    light of day. (v. v. v.)</p>
