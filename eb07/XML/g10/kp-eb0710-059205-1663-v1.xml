                <p><label type="entry">GNOSTICS</label>, ancient heretics, who arose principally in
                    the East, from the very origin of Christianity. It appears, from several
                    passages in the sacred writings, that many persons were infected with the
                    Gnostic heresy in the first century, though the sect did not render itself
                    conspicuous, either for number or reputation, before the time of Hadrian, when
                    some writers erroneously date its rise. The name is formed of the Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">gnosticus,</hi> and that from the Greek y&gt;«ď-nxoí, <hi
                    rend="italic">knowing,</hi> a verbal derivative of <hi rend="italic">γιn&gt;βxω,
                    I know</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and was adopted by the members of this sect,
                    as if they were the only persons who had the true knowledge of Christianity.
                    Accordingly, they looked upon all other Christians as simple, ignorant, and
                    barbarous persons, who explained and interpreted the sacred writings in a too
                    low, literal, and unedifying signification.</p>
                <p>At first the Gnostics were only the philosophers and wits of those times, who
                    formed for themselves a peculiar system of theology, agreeably to the philosophy
                    of Pythagoras and of Plato, to which they accommodated all their interpretations
                    of Scripture. But Gnostics afterwards became a general name, comprehending
                    different sects and parties of heretics, who appeared in the first centuries,
                    and who, though they differed amongst themselves as to circumstances, yet all
                    agreed in some common principles. They were such as corrupted the doctrine of
                    the gospel by a profane intermixture with its divine truths of the tenets of the
                    oriental philosophy concerning the origin of evil and the creation of the world.
                    Such were the Valentinians, Simonians, Carpocratians, Nicolaitans, and
                    others.</p>
                <p>The denomination of Gnostics was also sometimes ap-Clied more particularly to the
                    successors of the first Nico-ιitans and Carpocratians in the second century.
                    Such as desire to become thoroughly acquainted with their doctrines, reveries,
                    and visions, may consult Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clemens Alexandrinus, Origen, and
                    Epiphanius, particularly the first of these writers, who narrates their opinions
                    at large, and at the same time confutes them; indeed he dwells more expressly on
                    the Valentinians than any other sort of Gnostics; but he shows the general
                    principles upon which all their mistaken opinions were founded, and the method
                    they followed in explaining Scripture. He accuses them of introducing into
                    religion certain vain and ridiculous genealogies, that is, a kind of divine
                    processions or emanations, which had no foundation except in their own wild
                    imaginations.</p>
                <p>In fact, the Gnostics admitted that these aeons or emanations were nowhere
                    expressly delivered in the sacred writings; but insisted, at the same time, that
                    Jesus Christ had intimated them in parables to such as could understand him.
                    They built their theology not only upon the gospel»</p>

                <p>and the epistles of St Paul, but also upon the law of Moses and the prophets. The
                    writings of the latter were peculiarly serviceable to them, on account of the
                    allegories and allusions with which they abound, and which are capable of
                    different interpretations; but their doctrine concerning the creation of the
                    world by one or more inferior beings of an evil or imperfect nature, led them to
                    deny the divine authority of those books of the Old Testament which contradicted
                    this idle fiction, and filled them with an abhorrence of the religion of Moses,
                    who, they alleged, was actuated by the malignant author of this world, and
                    consulted his own glory and authority, not the real advantage of men. Their
                    persuasion that evil resided in matter, as its centre and source, made them
                    treat the body with contempt, discourage marriage, and reject the doctrine of
                    the resurrection of the body and its re-union with the immortal spirit. Their
                    notion that malevolent genii presided in nature, and occasioned diseases and
                    calamities, wars and desolations, induced them to apply themselves to the study
                    of magic, in order to weaken the powers or to suspend the influence of their
                    malignant agents.</p>
                <p>The Gnostics considered Jesus Christ as the Son of God, and consequently inferior
                    to the Father, as a being who came into the world for the rescue and happiness
                    of miserable mortals, oppressed by matter and evil beings; but they rejected our
                    Lord’s humanity, upon the principle that every thing corporeal is essentially
                    and intrinsically evil; and hence the greater part of them denied the reality of
                    his sufferings. They attached great value to the beginning of the gospel of St
                    John, where they fancied that they saw their aeons, or emanations, under the
                    Word, the Life, and the Light. They divided all nature into three kinds of
                    beings, <hi rend="italic">hylic</hi> or material, <hi rend="italic">psychic</hi>
                    or animal, <hi rend="italic">and pneumatic</hi> or spiritual. Upon the same
                    principle they also distinguished three sorts of men; material, animal, and
                    spiritual. The first, who were material, and incapable of knowledge, inevitably
                    perished, both soul and body; the third, such as the Gnostics themselves
                    pretended to be, were all certainly saved; but the psychic, or animal, who were
                    intermediate between the two others, were capable either of being saved or
                    damned, according to their good or evil actions.</p>
                <p>With regard to their moral doctrines and conduct, they were much divided. The
                    greater part of the sect adopted austere rules of life, recommended rigorous
                    abstinence, and prescribed severe bodily mortifications, with the view of
                    purifying and exalting the mind. Some, however, maintained that there was no
                    moral difference in human actions, and thus confounding right and wrong, gave a
                    loose rein to the passions, asserting the innocence of following blindly all
                    their impulses, and of living according to their tumultuous dictates. They
                    supported their opinions and practice by various authorities; some referred to
                    fictitious and apocryphal writings of Adam, Abraham, Zoroaster, Christ, and his
                    apostles; others boasted that they, had deduced their sentiments from certain
                    doctrines of Christ which had been concealed from the vulgar; others affirmed
                    that they had arrived at superior degrees of wisdom by an innate vigour of mind;
                    and others asserted that they were instructed in these mysterious parts of
                    theological science by Theudas, a disciple of St Paul, and by Matthias, one of
                    the friends of our Lord. The tene.ts of the ancient Gnostics were revived in
                    Spain in the fourth century, by a sect called the Prisci)lianists.</p>
                <p>The appellation of Gnostic sometimes also occurs in a good sense, in the writings
                    of the ancient ecclesiastical authors, particularly those of Clemens
                    Alexandrinus, who, in the person of his Gnostic, describes the characters and
                    qualities of a perfect Christian. This point he labours in the seventh book of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Stromata,</hi> where he shows that none but the Gnostic or
                    learned person has any true religion. He affirms, that were it possible for the
                    knowledge of God to be separated from eternal salvation, the Gnostic would make
                    no scruple in preferring the knowledge; and that if God would promise him
                    impunity for doing any thing he had once spoken against, or offer him heaven on
                    those terms, he would never alter his measures. In this sense the father uses
                    Gnostics, in opposition to the heretics of the same name; affirming that the
                    true Gnostic is he who has grown old in the study of the Holy Scriptures, and
                    who preserves the orthodox doctrine of the apostles and of the church; whereas
                    the false Gnostic abandons all the apostolical traditions, imagining himself
                    wiser than even the apostles. But the name of Gnostic, which was originally the
                    most glorious, became at length infamous from the idle opinions and dissolute
                    lives of the persons who affected it.</p>
