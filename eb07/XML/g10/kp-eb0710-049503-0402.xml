                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">GHAUTS</label>. The term of Ghaut signifies originally a pass
                    through the mountains, or the place where boats land. But it has been applied to
                    designate the mountainous chains which run in a direction nearly north and south
                    through southern India. These are divided into the Eastern and Western Ghauts.
                    The eastern ridge commences in the south, to the north of the Cavery, in about
                    latitude 11. 20. north, and extends, with little interruption, and nearly in a
                    straight line, to the banks of the Kistnah, in latitude 16. north. The height of
                    this ridge has never been accurately ascertained throughout its whole extent. It
                    is estimated, however, to rise at its highest part, which is opposite Madras, to
                    the height of 3000 feet; and Bangalore, which is within the chain, was found by
                    barometrical observation to be 2900 feet above the level of the sea. Dr
                    Buchanan, who had an excellent opportunity of observing the strata of these
                    mountains, where the rock was cut away to form the road, describes their
                    component parts to be granite, consisting of white felspar and quartz, with dark
                    green mica, in a small proportion to the other two ingredients. The rocks appear
                    to be stratified; but the strata are broken and confused. In some places they
                    are almost horizontal, and in others vertical, with all intermediate degrees of
                    inclination. The country above the Ghauts, about Naickan Eray, rises into swells
                    like the land in many parts of England, and is overlooked by high barren peaks,
                    which close the view to the eastward. The country is but poorly cultivated, and
                    is far from populous. Dr Buchanan judged that not above one half of the country
                    had been ploughed; and about a tenth part of the whole rises into hills too
                    steep for the plough. The soil in the gently swelling ground is very poor, and
                    covered with coppice, having a few large trees intermixed. The coppice land
                    serves for pasture; and the bushes supply the natives with fuel. Reservoirs are
                    constructed like those below the Ghauts; and the watered fields are productive
                    in rice. The want of water, however, is the great drawback on agriculture
                    throughout all the eastern parts of the Upper Carnatic. The mountains produce
                    iron ore, which is washed down by the torrents, and, being found in the form of
                    black sand, is smelted by the natives. Each forge pays a certain tribute in
                    iron, for permission to carry on the work. These mountains abound in rude and
                    magnificent scenery, and there is a number of passes through them, the principal
                    of which are those leading to Seringapatam and Poonah. Many of these roads have
                    been, formed with great labour across the mountains; but they are soon ploughed
                    into inequalities by the mountain torrents, and are thus as rough as before.
                    Among the lofty peaks of these mountains large tracts of barren land are to be
                    found; the country is naked, and is not even clothed with forests. The hills
                    next the Vellore road by Sautghur are covered with large stones, among which
                    grow many small trees and shrubs, with occasionally a tamarind tree of great age
                    and size. The pass here has been greatly improved, being widened and levelled
                    since the conquest by the British; and is now practicable for artillery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ghauts,</hi><hi rend="italic">Western.</hi> This great chain
                    of mountains runs along the peninsula of Hindustan, from Cape Comorin to the
                    Tuptee or Surat river, at the distance of not more than sixty or seventy, and in
                    some places not above forty miles from the western shore of the Indian
                    peninsula, namely, the coasts of Malabar, Canara, &amp;c.; and they are
                    frequently visible from the sea, to which at one point they approach within six
                    miles. By this peculiar configuration of the country all the great rivers of the
                    peninsula of India run down the eastern slope of these mountains into the Bay of
                    Bengal, there not being sufficient space for the collection of any great body of
                    water on the western declivity, which is of greater elevation, and more abrupt
                    in its ascent. The range is generally computed to rise to between 3000 and 4000
                    feet above the level of the sea-These mountains do not terminate in a point or
                    promontory, but bend eastward in a wavy line parallel to the river, and are
                    afterwards lost among the hills in the neighbourhood of Boorhanpoor. These hills
                    extend about 800 miles in length, with the exception of a break in the ridge
                    about sixteen miles wide, where the river Paniany takes its course from the
                    Coimbetore country to the sea; and here it is well known that ships which
                    navigate the Malabar coast during the north-east monsoons commonly experience a
                    stronger gale in the neighbourhood of Paniany than elsewhere; a circumstance
                    which Major Rennell ascribes to this opening in the Ghaut Mountains.<note

                    >Memoir of a Map of Hindurtan,</hi> p. 196.</p></note> The altitude of this
                    mountain chain is sufficient to intercept the great body of the clouds which are
                    alternately impelled across the continent of India by the south-west and
                    north-east monsoons; and accordingly these winds occasion a rainy season on one
                    side of the mountains only, so that while the periodical rains are deluging the
                    country on one side, the weather is serene and dry on the other. But it is only
                    a particular tract of country that is sheltered from rain by the ridge of the
                    Ghauts; for the clouds do pass over, but at too great a height and too much
                    attenuated to be condensed into rain. At a greater distance, however, they
                    collect into masses, and occasion a rainy season in the countries farther to
                    leeward. Thus, at Nagpoor, in the very centre of India, the seasons differ but
                    little from their usual course in Bengal and on the western side of India. They
                    have a rainy season occasioned by the south-west monsoon, though it is not so
                    violent as in Bengal. At the mouth of the Godavery, and in the neighbourhood,
                    the south-west monsoon occasions a rainy season, when the Godavery is swollen
                    and overflows; and this country is about the same distance to leeward of the
                    Ghauts as Nagpoor. Major Rennell suggests that the clouds which occasion the
                    rainy season at the mouth of the Godavery may come from Cape Comorin, though
                    from the prevalence of westerly<pb break="no" facs="nls:193520415"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-0415-0496"/> winds this appears doubtful. But it is certain
                    that the clouds which bring rain at Nagpoor must pass over the Ghauts. Madras
                    lies in the sheltered tract, though at least 300 miles to leeward of the Ghauts.
                    The country near the mouth of the Godavery is about 200 miles more. It would be
                    curious, if we had facts for such a speculation, to trace the limits between wet
                    and dry, and thus to ascertain the influence which this elevated and extensive
                    mountain chain exercises on the climate of the Indian peninsula; but without
                    fuller and more minute information we can scarcely enter into such an
                    inquiry.</p>
                <p>The Western Ghauts, about the fifteenth degree of north latitude, although they
                    are steep and stony, are by no means rugged or broken with rocks. On the
                    contrary, in the country near Cutaki the stones are buried in a rich mould, and
                    in many places are not visible until they are dug up. Thus, instead of the
                    naked, sun-burnt, rocky peaks, so common in the eastern chain, these mountains
                    are clothed with stately forests. Dr Buchanan mentions that he had nowhere seen
                    finer trees, nor any bamboos that could be compared ‘to those he saw there.
                    These bamboos compose a large part of the forest; they grow in detached clumps,
                    with open spaces between, and equal in height to the most stately palms, which
                    are also found in great abundance. There is no underwood nor creepers to
                    interrupt the traveller who may choose to wander in any direction through these
                    woods. But there are numerous tigers, which, joined to the unhealthiness of the
                    climate, renders any long stay there uncomfortable. About midway up the mountain
                    the teak becomes common; but it is very inferior in size to other trees. Hoads
                    have been formed through these mountains with great labour, out of a bed of
                    loose rock. These roads are ploughed up by torrents during the rainy season,
                    which wash away their softer parts, and leave single rocks of four or five feet
                    diameter standing in the centre. The difficulty formerly experienced in
                    penetrating these mountain passes was very great. In 1791, when the Bombay army
                    was advancing to the Mysore through the Poodicherrim pass, it required two days
                    to draw up twenty light field-pieces two miles, and three weeks to bring up the
                    other artillery to the top of the Ghauts.</p>
