                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> name was given by the Romans to a country
                    inhabited by various small tribes, under different names, and probably of
                    different origins, but who were so nearly similar in manners, language, and
                    religion, as to lead those further advanced in civilization to confound them all
                    under one common denomination. Under that denomination was comprehended not only
                    the country now called Germany, but Denmark, Norway, Swe&lt;len, Finland,
                    Livonia, and Prussia. The name is said to be derived from two words, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ghar man</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Wehr-man,</hi> meaning war-man
                    or warrior, which is also the signification of two other words, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ale man,</hi> of the same import. They were by themselves called
                    Teutones, from one of their national divinities, Teut, or, as is sometimes said,
                    Thuiskon, who seems to have been the general object of veneration, and from whom
                    the name is derived which is now assumed by all the people who call their
                    country Teutchland or Deutchland.</p>
                <p>The Rhine on the west, and the Vistula on the east, were considered, at the most
                    remote periods, as the boundaries of Germany; whilst on the north it extended
                    along the ocean and the Baltic Sea, and on the south was terminated by the river
                    Danube. But such boundaries were by no means definite; for many German tribes
                    inhabited the southern banks of the Rhine as far as the Scheldt. Between the
                    Rhine and the Mosellewere the Ubii; and higher up, but beyond the latter river,
                    were the Treviri, and then the Triboci, the Neimetes, and the Vangiones. The
                    Mediomatrici were planted along the Moselle, near the site of the present city
                    of Metz; and above them, on the Rhine, in the present Swiss canton of Basil,
                    were the Raurici or Rauraci. The ancient nations of Vindelicia were settled
                    between the sources of the Rhine and of the Danube. Noricum was inhabited by
                    several tribes between the rivers Drave and Danube, and comprehended the
                    provinces now known by the names of Austria, Styria, Carinthia, Tyrol, and
                    Bavaria. Beyond the Danube, to the westward of the Marcomanni, the country was
                    occupied by the Hermunduri, and extended to the north along the Hercynian
                    Mountains to the river Sala. A nation beyond the Hercynian Mountains, known then
                    as the Boiohemum, and in modern times as Bohemia, were in contact with the
                    Quadii, whose territory, now called Moravia, touched, on its southern part, the
                    Danube. These two tribes, with the Marcomanni, and some smaller clans, were
                    comprehended under the general name of Suevi, a people who at a subsequent
                    period forced their way into Spain, and established themselves in that
                    peniiisUla as a warlike and independent nation. The Suevi were a powerful
                    nation, who extended themselves along the Hercynian Forest, through which they
                    penetrated, and occupied a tract of land extending from the Vistula to the Elbe.
                    Among their possessions were the divisions which subsequently obtained the names
                    of Saxony, Brandenburg, Lusatia, and Silesia. One subdivision of them, called
                    the Semnones, grew sufficiently powerful to seize some of the richest provinces
                    of Gaul; whilst another, the Aestii, possessed the borders of the Baltic Sea,
                    whence they drew much amber, of which they made use in traffic with the
                    surrounding tribes. These last, according to Tacitus, were worshippers of the
                    mother of the gods, and relied on her for protection. They are said to have been
                    more industrious than the rest of the Germans in the cultivation of their lands,
                    and at a very early period produced corn. Their amber was reported to have been
                    obtained by diving in the rivers and the sea. This substance was then highly
                    estimated; and at a subsequent period, in the reign of Nero, a Roman knight is
                    stated to have purchased for that emperor, of the Aestii, at one time thirteen
                    thousand pounds weight, amongst which was a single piece weighing thirteen
                    pounds. At a still later period, a letter is found in Cassiodorus, in which
                    Theodoric, king of the Goths, gives thanks to the Aestii for a present of amber,
                    and in return assures them of his friendship and protection.</p>
                <p>In the interior of Germany, the Cimbri and the Saxons were possessed of the
                    country north of the Elbe; whilst on the south side of that stream the Chauci
                    were the masters of the district through which the Weser flows, and were in
                    contact with the two smaller tribes of the Cherusci and Chamavi. The Frisii were
                    distinguished as the Upper and the Lower, and were separated from the Chauci by
                    the river Ems, anti from each other by a branch of the Rhine; whilst beyond the
                    Yssel were some migratory tribes, the Bruckteri and the Marsi. The Uspetes were
                    established on the river Luppia, now the Lippe; and beyond that stream were the
                    Usipetes, who were celebrated for changing their residence, and were thence to
                    be found in other districts. The Teucteri were settled on the Rhine, in the
                    country of the Menopii; and next to them the Jubones, near the modern Juliers.
                    The Catti or Cotti inhabited parts of Hesse and Thuringia, extending from the
                    Hartz Mountains to the Rhine and the Weser. Their southern neighbours were the
                    Sedusi, bordering on Suabia, where they came in contact with the Marcomanni, who
                    have been already mentioned.</p>
                <p>Such are the best accounts which can be collected from Caesar, Tacitus, and
                    Ptolemy, respecting the localities of the various tribes who inhabited Germany
                    before the period of the intercourse between them and the Romans. It has been
                    justly remarked, that whilst modem nations are fixed and permanent societies,
                    connected amongst themselves by laws and government, and bound to their native
                    soil by arts and agriculture, the German tribes were only voluntary and
                    fluctuating associations of soldiers, almost of savages; and the same territory
                    often changed its inhabitants in the course of conquest or of emigration. A
                    victorious state often communicated its own name to a vanquished people.
                    Sometimes crowds of volunteers flocked from all parts to the standard of a
                    victorious leader; his camp became their country, and some event soon gave a new
                    but general name to the mixed community. Thus the distinctions of ferocious
                    invaders were perpetually varied by themselves, and naturally confounded the
                    astonished subjects of the Roman empire.</p>
                <p>It is probable that the accounts of the numbers of the German people, as
                    transmitted by early writers, are grossly exaggerated. In great and civilized
                    states, millions of subjects pursue their peaceful avocations in silence and
                    obscurity; but in a state of rude republicanism, or of civil commotions, almost
                    every member of the community is called into active exertion; and thus, with
                    their irregular divisions, their restless motions, their profusion of kings and
                    warriors, and numerous contests, they present to our minds an appearance of
                    numbers very far beyond the reality, which is still further strengthened by the
                    most splendid appellations being frequently and repeatedly applied to
                    inconsiderable objects. When the Romans first became acquainted with Germany,
                    about the year 640 from the building of their capital, or more than 100 years
                    before the commencement of the Christian era, the natives had advanced but a few
                    steps from the savage state. Even in the subsequent age, as Tacitus affirms,
                    they were so ignorant of the use of letters as to be unable to transmit from one
                    generation to another any annals of their country, or any knowledge of the
                    agreeable or useful arts of life. In an extent very far <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193520129" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0129-0474"/>surpassing modem Germany,
                    Ptolemy speaks of ninety toŵns or cities; whilst Tacitus asserts, as a
                    well-known fact, that in his time they had no cities, and that they affected to
                    despise the buildings constructed by Roman industry, as places of confinement
                    rather than of security. Their dwellings were not even contiguous, nor formed
                    into villages, but each of these barbarians fixed his independent dwelling on
                    any spot which a plain, a wood, or a stream of good water, invited him to settle
                    on; and in constructing his hut, neither stone, brick, nor tiles were employed.
                    Built of timber, they were very low, and covered with straw, having a hole to
                    allow of the emission of the smoke.</p>
                <p>The clothing was of the simplest kind, notwithstanding the inclemency of the
                    climate in a territory covered with woods, and not ameliorated by cultivation.
                    In the more northern parts scanty garments of furs were used; and in the south
                    some coarse linen, spun and woven by the females. Their food consisted chiefly
                    of wild animals, or of the flesh of their large herds of cows and of horses,
                    which were nearly in the state of their original wildness. A small quantity of
                    corn was the only produce of the soil; the use of gardens, orchards, and
                    artificial meadows, was unknown; nor could any great improvement in agriculture
                    have existed, where a new division of the land took place annually, and a great
                    part lay waste and without any tillage. The Germans seem to have learned the
                    process of brewing or of distillation, as they made intoxicating liquors from
                    wheat and barley, in the use or abuse of which they indulged to the greatest
                    excess in social meetings and public assemblies. Drinking and gambling were
                    their highest gratifications. They gloried in passing whole days and nights at
                    the table; and the blood of guests, often of friends and relations, stained
                    their drunken assemblies. The desperate gamester often staked his person and his
                    liberty on the cast of a dice, and then patiently submitted to the decision, and
                    was sold into slavery by his more fortunate competitor.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the grossness of manners amongst the German tribes, the females
                    were held in high estimation; and whilst the men were brave, the women were
                    chaste. Polygamy was not in use excepting amongst the princes; and amongst them
                    only for the sake of multiplying their alliances. Divorces were prohibited by
                    manners rather than by laws. Adulteries were punished as rare and inexpiable
                    crimes; nor was seduction justified by example and fashion. The unpolished wives
                    of the Germans partook of few of those gratifications which tend to inflame the
                    passions, and their fidelity was in some measure secured by the exposure to
                    which they were subject in the open huts, and by poverty, solitude, and the
                    painful cares of domestic occupation. Besides these restraints, the Germans
                    treated their women with esteem and confidence, consulted them on every occasion
                    of importance, and fondly believed that in their breasts resided a sanctity and
                    wisdom more than human. Some of these interpreters of fate, such as Velleda in
                    the Batavian war, governed, in the name of the deity, the fiercest nations of
                    Germany. The rest of the sex were respected as the free and equal companions of
                    soldiers, associated even by the ceremony of marriage to a life of toil, of
                    danger, and of glory. In their great invasions, the camp of the barbarians was
                    filled with a multitude of women, who remained firm and undaunted amidst the
                    sound of arms, the various forms of destruction, and the honourable wounds of
                    their sons and husbands. Fainting armies of Germans have more than once been
                    driven back upon the enemy by the generous despair of the women, who dreaded
                    death much less than servitude. If the day was irrecoverably lost, they well
                    knew how to deliver themselves and their children, with their own hands, from an
                    insulting victor. Heroines of such a description may claim admiration, but they
                    can scarcely inspire the passion of love. They who attempt to imitate the
                    sterner virtues of man must lose the attractive softness of their own sex, which
                    is their principal charm. Conscious pride taught the German matrons to suppress
                    every tender emotion which stood in competition with honour; and the first
                    honour of the sex has ever been that of chastity.</p>
                <p>The Germans were a warlike people, notwithstanding which their government was a
                    species of democracy, although a few of the tribes on the shores of the Baltic
                    acknowledged the authority of kings; but such kings owed their power as
                    frequently to their valour or their eloquence as to their descent; and with all
                    of them the power was tempered by the prevalence of popular assemblies. The
                    assembly of the warriors of the tribe was convened at stated seasons, or on
                    sudden emergencies. When a youth had attained the age of manhood, he was
                    introduced into the general council of his countrymen, solemnly invested with a
                    shield and a spear, and adopted as an equal and worthy member of the
                    commonwealth. In such assemblies, the trial of public offences, the election of
                    magistrates, and the great affairs of peace or war, were determined by
                    independent votes. Sometimes these important questions were previously
                    considered and prepared in a committee or select council of the principal
                    chieftains. The magistrates might deliberate and persuade, but the people only
                    could resolve and execute; and hence the resolutions were for the most part
                    hasty and violent. They too often turned away with indignant contempt from the
                    remonstrances of justice and policy, and signified by a hollow murmur their
                    dislike of such timid councils. But when a popular orator proposed to vindicate
                    the meanest citizen from either foreign or domestic injury, or called upon his
                    countrymen to follow some enterprise of danger and of glory, the applause of the
                    assembly was displayed by a loud clashing of shields and spears; for the Germans
                    always assembled in arms, and it was to be dreaded lest an irregular multitude,
                    inflamed by faction and strong liquors, should use their arms to enforce as well
                    as to declare their furious resolutions.</p>
                <p>A general of the tribe was elected on occasions of danger; and if the danger was
                    pressing and extensive, several tribes concurred in the choice of the same
                    general. The bravest warrior was named to lead his countrymen into the field by
                    his example rather than by his commands; but this power, however limited, was
                    still invidious. It expired with the war, and in time of peace the German tribes
                    acknowledged not any supreme chief. Princes were, however, appointed in the
                    general assembly, to administer justice, or rather to compose differences, in
                    their respective districts. In the choice of these magistrates, as much regard
                    was shown to birth as to merit To each was assigned by the public a guard and a
                    council of a hundred persons; and the first of Sie princes appears to have
                    enjoyed a pre-eminence of rank and honour which sometimes tempted the Romans to
                    compliment them with the regal title.</p>
                <p>The comparative view of the powers of the magistrates, in two remarkable
                    instances, is alone sufficient to represent the whole system of German manners.
                    The disposal of the landed property within their district was absolutely vested
                    in their hands, and they distributed it every year according to a new division.
                    At the same time they were not authorized to punish with death, to imprison, or
                    even to strike, a private citizen.</p>
                <p>The Germans respected only those duties which they imposed on themselves. The
                    most obscure soldier resisted with disdain the authority of the magistrates.
                    “The noblest youths,” says Tacitus, “blushed not to be numbered amongst the
                    faithful companions of some renowned chief, to whom they devoted their arms and
                    service. A noble emulation prevailed among the companions to obtain the first
                    place in the esteem of their chief, among the chiefs to acquire the greatest
                    number of valiant companions. The glory of such heroes diffused itself beyond
                    the narrow limits<pb break="no" facs="nls:193520142"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-0142-0475"/> of their own tribe. Presents and embassies
                    solicited their friendship, and the fame of their arms often ensured victory to
                    the party they espoused. In the hour of danger it was shameful for the chief to
                    be surpassed in valour by his companions, and shameful for the companions not to
                    equal the valour of their chief. To survive his fall in battle was indelible
                    infamy. The chiefs combated for victory, the companions for the chief. The
                    noblest warriors, whenever their native country was sunk in the laziness of
                    peace, maintained their numerous bands in some distant scene of action, to
                    exercise their restless spirit, and to acquire renown by voluntary dangers.
                    Gifts worthy of soldiers, the warlike steed, the bloody and ever-victorious
                    lance, were the rewards which the companions claimed from the liberality of
                    their chief. The rude plenty of his hospitable board was the only pay which he
                    could bestow, or they would accept. War, rapine, and the freewill offerings of
                    his friends, supplied the materials of this munificence.” This institution,
                    however it might accidentally weaken the several republics, invigorated the
                    general character of the Germans, and even ripened amongst them all the virtues
                    of which barbarians are susceptible; the faith, valour, and hospitality so
                    conspicuous long afterwards in the ages of chivalry.</p>
                <p>The religion of the Germans was as gross as that of other nations in the same low
                    stage of civilization. They adored the sun and the moon, the fire and the earth,
                    together with those imaginary deities who were supposed to preside over the most
                    important occupations of human life. They were persuaded that, by some
                    ridiculous arts of divination, they could discover the will of the superior
                    beings, and that human sacrifices were the most precious and acceptable offering
                    to their altars. They seem to have adopted no images as visible objects of
                    worship, nor to have constructed any edifices for the celebration of religious
                    rites. Their only temples were dark and ancient groves, consecrated by the
                    reverence of successive generations. Their secret gloom, the imagined residence
                    of an invisible power, by presenting no distinct object of fear or worship,
                    impressed the mind with a still deeper sense of religious horror; and the
                    priests, rude and illiterate as they were, had been taught by experience the use
                    of every artifice which could preserve and fortify impressions so well suited to
                    promote their own interest.</p>
                <p>The German priests had assumed a jurisdiction even in temporal concerns which the
                    magistrate could not venture to exercise; and the haughty warrior submitted to
                    the lash of correction, when it was inflicted, not by any human power, but by
                    the immediate order of the god of war. Thus the defects of civil policy were
                    sometimes supplied by the interposition of ecclesiastical authority. The latter
                    was constantly exerted to maintain silence and decency in the popular
                    assemblies, and was sometimes extended to a more enlarged concern for the
                    national welfare. A solemn procession was occasionally celebrated in what are
                    now the countries of Mecklenburg and Pome-ran ’ a∙ The unknown symbol of the
                    earth, covered with a thick veil, was placed on a carriage drawn by cows; and in
                    this manner the goddess, whose common residence was in the island of Rügen,
                    visited several adjacent tribes of her worshippers. During her progress the
                    sound of war was hushed, quarrels were suspended, arms laid aside, and the
                    restless Germans had an opportunity of tasting the blessings of peace and of
                    harmony. The íruce of God, so often and so ineffectually proclaimed by the
                    clergy of the eleventh century, was an obvious imitation or continuation of this
                    ancient custom.</p>
                <p>But the influence of religion was far more powerful to inflame dhan to moderate
                    the fierce passions of the Germans. The consecrated standards, long preserved in
                    the groves of superstmon, were placed in the front of the battle; and the
                    hostile army was devoted with dire execrations to the gods of war and of
                    thunder. With the Germans cowardice was the most unpardonable of sins. A brave
                    man was the worthy favourite of the martial deities. He who had lost his shield
                    was banished alike from the civil and the religious assemblies of his
                    countrymen. Some of the northern tribes seem to have embraced the doctrine of
                    transmigration; others imagined a gross paradise of immortal drunkenness. All
                    agreed that a life spent in arms, and a glorious death in battle, were the best
                    preparations for a happy futurity, either in this or another world.</p>
                <p>That singular order of men, the bards, have attracted to them the attention of
                    all who have attempted to investigate the antiquities of the Celts, the
                    Scandinavians, and the Germans. It is not easy, however, to calculate the
                    enthusiasm of arms and glory which they kindled in the breasts of their
                    audience. It was in the hour of battle, or in the feast of victory, that the
                    bards celebrated the glory of the heroes of ancient days, the ancestors of those
                    warlike chieftains who listened with transport to their artless but animated
                    strains. The view of arms and of danger heightened the effect of the military
                    song; and the passions which it tended to excite, the desire of fame, and the
                    contempt of death, were the habitual sentiments of a German mind.</p>
                <p>Such is the description of the manners, characters, and propensities of the
                    ancient Germans, as delineated by Tacitus, and by which, in spite of their
                    climate, their want of learning and the arts, and the absence of fixed laws,
                    they were formed into a people of military heroes, and enabled to carry on
                    formidable hostilities, during more than two centuries, with the mighty power of
                    the Romans.</p>
                <p>The early history of the Germans, like that of all nations who had no written
                    records, is involved in much obscurity. The first knowledge of their
                    transactions was that of the invasion of the country by the Gauls, commanded by
                    Segovesus, king of the Celtae; whilst his brother Bellovesus marched with
                    another army into Italy; both of which divisions are said to have been directed
                    by the flight of birds. Segovesus crossed the Rhine, and gained a settlement
                    near the Hercynian Forest. The Germans, however, soon acted on the offensive,
                    and expelled the Gauls, and, by the assistance of the Belgae, one of their most
                    warlike tribes, gained possession of some territory to the west of the Rhine,
                    where they were enabled to fix and maintain themselves so firmly as never to be
                    driven out, and whence they extended themselves to the sea-coasts of Britain,
                    and even drove its inhabitants into the interior. The Germans and the Gauls,
                    thus brought into contact with each other, continued to hold vacillating
                    intercourse, sometimes at war, at other times in alliance in opposition to the
                    power of the conquering and disciplined Romans. The Germans, under the name of
                    Cimbri, then invaded the territory of Rome, and spread such terror that Marius,
                    by a deviation from the law, was appointed consul to command an army against
                    them. After various marches during some years, in 102 before Christ, Marius,
                    with an army of 52,000 men, attacked the barbariam on the banks of the Rhone,
                    and, though they are said to have mustered 300,000 foot and 15,000 horse,
                    completely defeated them, with a loss of 150,000 killed and 60,00t prisoners.
                    Many, preferring death to slavery, underwent military execution; and a few were
                    scattered over Gaul or crossed the Danube, and so escaped to their own coun
                    try.</p>
                <p>After Julius Caesar had completed the subjugationorGaul, and extended his
                    conquest to the Rhine, he first became acquainted with the German name.
                    Ariovistus the leader of a tribe that dwelt to the south of the Da nube,
                    attempted to fix his establishment in Gaul, but wat <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193520155" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0155-0476"/>defeated by Caesar, and, with
                    the loss of 80,000 men, was driven across the Rhine, though two tribes of his
                    followers remained on the west side of that river; and the fugitives who
                    returned augmented the numbers of the German tribe of the Marcomanni. Caesar
                    built a bridge over the Rhine, and twice passed that river at the head of his
                    army, not with the view of permanent conquest, but to secure his province of
                    Gaul against the attacks of the barbarians; and he also took many of the Germans
                    into his pay, first in the war with the Gauls, and afterwards in the civil
                    contest with Pompey. The civil wars, which occupied first Caesar and Pompey, and
                    afterwards Mark Antony and Brutus and Cassius, left the Germans opportunities to
                    attempt incursions. The confederation of the Segambri passed the Rhine, and
                    having repelled the attack of Agrippa, settled themselves on the western side of
                    that river; but a few years afterwards they were defeated by Lollius the legate
                    of Augustus, when, 14 years before Christ, Drusus, the son-in-law of the
                    emperor, constructed several fortresses along that river, to prevent the
                    incursions of the Germans. He proceeded with success, and penetrated as far as
                    the Elbe. He died in the year 8 before Christ, and was succeeded by Tiberius,
                    who during his command not only sustained the power which Drusus had acquired,
                    but extended it towards the north; and, by intrigues among the natives, as much
                    as by his force, induced many of the tribes to solicit peace, and excited others
                    to enter into the military service of Rome. The body-guard of Augustus was
                    composed of German volunteers, amongst whom was the distinguished noble whose
                    name has descended to posterity, being sometimes called Hermanus, and at others
                    Arminius, who received the privileges of a Roman citizen and the dignity of a
                    Roman knight. He was the son of Sigmer, a prince of the Cherusci, and had been
                    educated in Rome, and early appointed an officer in the army of Augustus, but is
                    said never to have lost the relish for the customs of his ancestors, nor his
                    zeal for the independence of his country; and during the course of his
                    instruction in arts and in arms he warmly cherished the hope of adapting these
                    instructions to the purpose of freeing his country from the Roman yoke. He felt
                    a confidence that all the discipline of the Roman armies would be unable in a
                    fair field to resist the raw bravery of his unpolished countrymen.</p>
                <p>The best legions of Rome were intrusted to the command of Quintilius Varus, with
                    the superintendence of the territories on the right bank of the Rhine, which had
                    been added by Drusus to the Roman dominion. He was confident in the power of his
                    military superiority, and thought, in addition to that, to secure obedience by
                    changing the customs and principles of the Germans, and thus converting them
                    into useful subjects. For this purpose he took with him a great number of civil
                    officers, lawyers, and men of letters, to introduce the new order of things.
                    These measures roused the jealousy of a people enamoured of their freedom, and
                    disseminated the seeds of insurrection amongst all the tribes situated between
                    the Rhine and the Elbe. Arminius availed himself of this spirit to form
                    alliances in opposition to Varus, amongst all the military leaders of the
                    districts. It happened most opportunely for the purpose of Arminius, that, in
                    the year 9 <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.,</hi> a general revolt broke out on the
                    Roman frontiers of Dalmatia and Pannonia. It is doubtful if this was connected
                    with the plans of Arminius, but it helped to strengthen the confederacy which
                    had been entered into by those tribes which were in possession of the country
                    bounded by the Rhine, the Saale, and the Elbe. This confederacy was not broken
                    up by the treason of one of the chiefs, Segestes, the leader of the Catti, who
                    communicated to the Roman commander the plan and the detail of the intended
                    insurrection, which was received by Varus with the contempt which reliance upon
                    the WUrtibere and discipline of his troops nad inspired. Arminius redoubled his
                    assiduities to remove suspicion, if any existed, of his fidelity to the Roman
                    cause, and succeeded, by pointing the attention of Varus to some irruptions
                    which, at the instigation of the confederacy, had broken out on the banks of the
                    Weser. These small but concerted disturbances were intended to inveigle the
                    Roman commander to advance into the interior of the country; and.the leaders of
                    the German troops in the pay of Rome, who were involved in the confederacy with
                    Arminius, by the display of unbounded zeal and obedience, agreed in urging the
                    Roman commander not to wait for further displays of resistance, but to advance
                    with his three legions and the auxiliaries, and to extinguish the rebellion in
                    its focal point. In vain did Segestes repeat his warnings. Nothing could shake
                    the confidence of Varus in Arminius, and the confederates and the Romans plunged
                    deeper and deeper into the heart of the country, where the snares had been laid
                    for their destruction. Near the sources of the river Lippe, in the country of
                    the Bructeri, after a long and wearisome march through woods and morasses, the
                    Romans saw themselves enclosed on every side in a hollow surrounded by hills
                    whose summits were all occupied by the natives. At this moment intelligence
                    arrived that Arminius with the rear division, consisting of stipendaries, which
                    he commanded, had declared against the Romans, and had been the moving spring of
                    the whole operations. Varus saw clearly destruction before him; for though
                    discipline and courage might prolong the contest, it could inspire no hopes of a
                    successful issue.</p>
                <p>Three days of suffering and ineffectual hostilities compelled the Romans to
                    submit. Varus chose death rather than disgrace. Three Roman eagles were taken;
                    and a limit was thus set to the advances of the Romans towards the north, which
                    they were never afterwards enabled to pass. The Germans disgraced their victory
                    by useless cruelties. Some of the men of letters and artiste who were taken had
                    their hands cut off, and others were blinded. The site of this memorable event
                    cannot be clearly ascertained by any records, but it is generally placed by the
                    antiquarians of Germany near the sources of the rivers Lippe and Ems, not far
                    from where now stands the small city of Detmold. The event occurred in the ninth
                    year of our era.</p>
                <p>When Arminius had thus restored the ancient freedom to his country, he destroyed
                    the fortresses which the Romans had constructed on the Rhine, the Elbe, and the
                    Weser, and exerted himself to rouse the military spirit of the Germans, and
                    taught them to rely on that spirit rather than on the strongest fortifications.
                    A civil war soon broke out amongst the natives themselves, and the party opposed
                    to Arminius was headed by Segestes. That prince applied to the Romans for
                    assistance, and was aided by their general Germanicus, when he was surrounded by
                    the troops of Arminius. His deliverance was effected with but little loss on
                    either side; but the wife of Arminius was taken prisoner by Segestes, and on
                    being carried before the Roman general, maintained a spirit and dignity which is
                    highly applauded by Tacitus. The treachery of Segestes animated the exertions of
                    Arminius, and he was offered assistance by l&gt;is uncle Inguiomar, a leader of
                    a tribe, and celebrated as a warrior. Arminius attempted also to gain to his
                    party his brother Flavius, who like himself had been educated in Italy, but who
                    resolutely maintained his fidelity to the Roman power. Arminius desired a
                    meeting with Flavius, and they saw and conversed with each other across the
                    river Weser. The expostulations and the inducements of Arminius were
                    ineffectual; the brothers became exasperated against each other, and would have
                    proceeded to feats of arms if they had not <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520168"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-0168-0477"/>been separated by the stream, and at length been
                    borne away from the scene by their respective partisans.</p>
                <p>Germanicus the Roman commander once more attacked the army of Arminius, and
                    gained a splendid but useless victory on the plain of Idistavius, on the banks
                    of the Weser; but having excited the suspicious jealousy of the Emperor
                    Tiberius, the necessary succours were withheld, and Arminius was soon enabled
                    again to make head against the Romans, and caused them to suspend their attempts
                    on the freedom of Germany. This temporary tranquillity, however, gave rise to an
                    intestine war.</p>
                <p>Marobodue, a leader of the Marcomanni, but who had been educated in the court of
                    Augustus, was enabled by his address and his power to unite many tribes of the
                    Suevi in a confederacy with his own nation, which collectively assumed the name
                    of the Marcomanni. At the head of this powerful league he attacked and conquered
                    the nation of the Boii, seated in the south of Bohemia and a part of Franconia,
                    and founded a formidable state, which extended over the Hermundurins, the Quadi,
                    the Longobards, and the Semnones, and could bring into the field 70,000
                    warriors. Augustus had given orders to Tiberius to suppress with twelve legions
                    the power of Marobodue, but a general insurrection of the Dalmatian tribes
                    compelled him to conclude a peace which secured to him no benefit. The
                    subsequent disasters of the Romans in Western Germany suspended all attacks on
                    the Marcomanni, who continued to excite insurrections in the south of
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>Two great powers were thus formed, the Marcomanni and the Cherusci, the one under
                    Marobodue and the other under Arminius. Between these, dissensions speedily
                    arose. On one side the Longobards and the Semnones, wearied by the oppressions
                    of Marobodus, deserted his party and united with the Cherusci; and on the other
                    side Inguiomer, the uncle of Arminius, from jealousy of his nephew, was induced
                    to pass from his party to that of the Marcomanni. After a war between these two
                    confederations, which was carried on with all that systematic regularity which
                    the two commanders had learned in the Roman legions, the Cherusci remained
                    conquerors. Tiberius, instead of giving that aid to Marobodus which he eagerly
                    asked, left him exposed during two years to the attacks of Catualda the Goth,
                    who compelled him to abandon his territory and seek refuge amongst the Romans;
                    and Catualda was soon exposed to the same fate by the hostilities of the
                    Hermundurins, who had obtained the lead among the confederates which were headed
                    by Arminius.</p>
                <p>The death of Arminius occurred in the year 21 <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.,</hi> at
                    the age of thirty-seven years, during the twelve last of which he had gloriously
                    and happily conducted the affairs of his country with the applause of his
                    followers, to whom, after his death, he continued an object of the highest
                    veneration. He was indeed suspected of designs to introduce royalty and to
                    assume the kingly dignity, but it is now impossible to confirm or refute the
                    charge which has been brought against his memory.</p>
                <p>After the death of their leader, the Cherusci, owing to interna disputes,
                    gradually lost the rank they had held, and at length allowed the Romans to
                    nominate a king of their country, who assumed the name of Italicus, and was the
                    last branch of the family <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> f Arminius. Under him
                    they quarrelled with their allies the Longobards, and soon sunk down into an
                    insignificant tribe, inhabiting the district to the south of the Hartz
                    Mountains. About the same time, in the west of Germany, the Catti raised
                    themselves to a state of some consideration, and, whilst the Romans were
                    occupied in suppressing an insurrection of the Frisii, seized the fortresses
                    constructed on the Rhine. They were assailed by Galba, and induced to cede the
                    territory included between the Lahn, the Maine, and the Rhine, to the Romans,
                    who parcelled it out among the most meritorious of their warriors. In the year
                    58 the Catti and the Hermunduri contended for the salt springs on the river
                    Saale in Franconia. The numerous followers of Marobodus and of Catualda had
                    established themselves about the same time on the Danube, between the rivers
                    Gran and Morava, and there, under Vannius, whom they had received as a king from
                    the Romans, founded a new kingdom, which was soon felt to be oppressive to the
                    people. Although Vannius had found allies in the Sarmatian Jaziges, yet he could
                    not resist the confederacy formed against him by the Hermunduri, Lygerii, and
                    the Western Quadi, but fled from his kingdom and took refuge with the Romans,
                    when he was succeeded by his nephew Sido, who had performed some important
                    services for the Emperor Vespasian. In the west the Batavians, by an obstinate
                    struggle, shook the Roman power, which was only retained by extraordinary
                    exertions. About this period began the war which finally terminated in the
                    downfall of Rome. The Suevi were attacked by the Lygerii, and applied for aid to
                    Domitian, who sent them a hundred horse soldiers, the smallness of which number
                    was deemed an affront, and induced them to form a confederacy with the Jaziges,
                    which threatened Dacia and Pannonia. Domitian was defeated, but Trajan proved
                    more successful; but afterwards war broke out more fiercely under Antoninus
                    Philosophus. The barbarians disquieted the empire on two sides without
                    cessation. On one side small but numerous hordes of the Goths arrived in Dacia
                    to establish themselves by force of arms; but these were removed by having a
                    still better country pointed out to them in a southern direction. But the more
                    terrific hostilities were those carried on by the Marcomanni, who had combined
                    with the Hermunduri and the Quadi. Marcus Aurelius contended with them during
                    his whole life; and Commodus purchased a peace with them in 180 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> At the same time the Catti laid waste Rhaetia and
                    Gaul, and the Cherusci drove the Longobards back on the Elbe, and advanced
                    themselves under the name of Franks. About the year 220 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.
                    d.</hi> new tribes of Germans assailed the falling empire. The Visigoths, the
                    Gepides, and Herulians, attacked the Romans in Dacia; whilst about the same time
                    a new race called the Alemanni, a mixed tribe, of Sclavonic origin, made their
                    appearance in Southern Germany, in opposition to whom was constructed the
                    celebrated <hi rend="italic">Vallum</hi><hi rend="italic">Romanorum,</hi> the
                    traces of which are still visible from Jaxthausen to Öhringen. The power of Rome
                    gradually sunk, partly from the constant and increasing hostilities of the
                    Germans and other barbarous tribes, and partly from internal dissensions. As
                    that empire was weakened, the Franks advanced to Spain, and under Probus
                    conquered also the Batavian peninsula. Thus the Franks and Alemanns remained the
                    most powerful of the German nation. The former of these lost the Batavian
                    territory to the Saxons, and the latter were humbled before the Romans in the
                    last victory obtained by that mighty people. At the beginning of the fifth
                    century the barbarians assailed the empire on every side. The Vandals, Suevi,
                    and Alani became masters of Gaul and Spain. They were followed by the successful
                    Burgundians and the Western Goths; to the Burgundians succeeded the Franks, to
                    the Western Goths succeeded the Eastern Goths, and to them the Lombards. Then
                    began that stream of emigration which poured from the north to the south, and,
                    as a conquering power, became the founders of the subsequent European kingdoms.
                    A new change was given to the face of Europe by those vast emigrations of
                    people, mostly Germans, though some came from countries farther eastward than
                    Germany, which gradually overspread and subdued the west, introduced new forms
                    of society, and framed languages, which, with but little variation, have
                    continued till the present time. The new states, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193520181" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0181-0478"/>formed out of what had
                    previously been portions of the Roman empire, though often at war with each
                    other, and differing in smaller matters, chiefly arising from difference of soil
                    and climate, were united in one similar system of policy and domestic
                    government, and had those common habits strengthened by the providential
                    introduction of the Christian religion, to which, though varying in some points
                    of faith, they all in process of time professed adherence. We have here space
                    only for a slight sketch of the history of those emigrations the beneficial
                    effects of which we now enjoy, and to which, during a period of more than a
                    thousand years, Europe has been indebted for the great advancement in the arts
                    and the policy of civilization which has raised it above the other portions of
                    the habitable globe.</p>
                <p>These emigrations, which thus revolutionized Europe, began from the Frozen Ocean,
                    extended themselves to the Atlantic Sea, and stretched over a portion of
                    Northern Africa. They continued from the year 375, when the Huns first broke
                    into Europe, till 568, when the Lombards had completed their conquest of the
                    Roman empire. The causes of these excursions of whole tribes were various,
                    arising in some cases from excessive population, in others from the pressure of
                    more remote tribes, and in aD from the charms of the beautiful and
                    well-cultivated provinces which the Romans had gradually added to their
                    dominions. At a more early period single tribes in small parties had changed
                    their domicils, and thereby prepared the way for the greater emigrations. The
                    constant conquests of the too extended empire began in the middle of the third
                    century to make it totter under its own weight. Some powerful emperors, indeed,
                    especially Constantine and Theodosius, suspended its fall; but others, under the
                    pressure of circumstances, and from short-sighted policy, had taken parties of
                    the barbarians into their pay, and, as a reward for their military services, had
                    granted them lands to establish themselves on, on the frontiers of the empire.
                    In this way settlements were granted to the Franks in Belgian Gaul, and to the
                    Alani, the Vandals, and the Goths, in Dacia, Pannonia, and Thrace.</p>
                <p>Many individuals of skill and courage were appointed to offices of high power and
                    trust, and two of them, Ruffin and Stilicho, to the command of armies. The
                    consequence of this was, that as they improved in education, they became fully
                    acquainted with the weakness of the Roman government, and accustomed themselves
                    to consider it as a prey, on which in due time they might seize.</p>
                <p>The first movement towards the emigrations was given from the farthest part of
                    Northern Asia, where a wild and warlike tribe, probably of Mongul or Kalmuck
                    origin, were settled on the confines of China. These, expelled from their own
                    settlements about the end of the first century,extended themselves towards the
                    west, and drove the Alani, a tribe from Caucasus, out of Asiatic Sarmatia, and
                    also dislodged the Western Goths, who were settled in ancient Dacia, and in the
                    district between the Dniester, the Danube, and the Vistula. A portion of the
                    Alani, after long wanderings, arrived on the Danube in what is now Hungary;
                    connected themselves there with the Vandals, an original north German colony,
                    who had been planted there about one hundred years, and, together, pressed
                    forward into Germany, where they further strengthened themselves by a union with
                    the Suevi, another German tribe which had been settled on the Upper Danube.
                    These three populations, thus united, pressed forward to the Rhine, passed that
                    river into Gaul, captured Mayence, Strasburg, and other flourishing cities, and
                    devastated the whole country.</p>
                <p>After these united people had in a few years spread desolation over a great part
                    of Gaul, they pressed on towards the Pyrenees, and entered Spain. They subdued
                    nearly the whole of that country about the year 411, divided it by lot amongst
                    themselves, and left a very small portion of it only in the possession of the
                    Roman garrisons. They however retained their former discipline and courage, and
                    formed an alliance with some of the Western Goths who had penetrated into Spain,
                    and attacked the conquerors. The Alani, who had founded a kingdom in Lusitania,
                    now Portugal, were completely overcome in 418; and the remnant of them, after
                    their defeat, received protection from the Vandals; and hence from that time
                    their name is no more to be found. They carried on the war with the Romans, and
                    thereby gained the ascendency over them, when, in 427, they formed the
                    resolution to pass over into Africa. The kingdom founded there by Genseric,
                    after maintaining itself a hundred and five years, was at last subdued by
                    Belisarius, the general of the Greek emperor Justinian. The Suevi, who after the
                    departure of the Vandals remained in Spain, extended and maintained their power
                    till they were defeated and scattered by the W <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>
                    eβtern Goths in 584. The Huns, with whom these movements had originated,
                    established themselves in 377 in Pannonia, whence, conducted by their king
                    Attila, they made a wasting campaign in Gaul; but that leader having met with a
                    signal defeat in 451, turned towards Italy, and could scarcely be induced to
                    spare Rome itself and to quit Italy. After his death in 453 the kingdom of the
                    Huns disappeared, its inhabitants having been scattered and lost among the
                    tribes of the Goths and Gepides.</p>
                <p>The most dangerous enemies of the Romans were the Goths, to whom reference has
                    before been made. They were a tribe of Germans originally established in East
                    Prussia, on the shores of the Baltic, but had extended themselves through
                    Poland, to the Black Sea, and had spread themselves over the Roman provinces on
                    the Danube. In the third century, Rome found it necessary, or at least
                    convenient, to allow of their establishment in Dacia. This powerful nation, the
                    first amongst the Germane who embraced the Christian religion, was divided into
                    two branches. The Eastern Goths were established on the river Don and the Black
                    Sea, and the Western Goths between the Dniester, the Danube, and the Vistula. As
                    they were assailed by the advancing Huns, and compelled to abandon their
                    settlements about the year 375, the Romans conceded to them other settlements in
                    the interior of their empire. The Western Goths, under their king Alaric,
                    attacked the Romans in Italy in 403, several times assailed Rome itself, and
                    conquered and plundered it in</p>
                <p>410. His successor Ataulf led his followers into Gaul in</p>
                <p>411, and from thence into Spain, where was erected the largest Gothic kingdom,
                    which from 624 comprehended the whole of the Peninsula, with a part of France
                    and some portions of Africa, and was only terminated in 711, by the victory of
                    the invading Moors at the battle of Xeres.</p>
                <p>The Eastern Goths had been settled by the Romans in the country of Moesia, now
                    known by the names of Bulgaria and of Servia. Odoacer, the chief of two German
                    tribes, the Heruli and the Rugieri, who had served under the Roman standards,
                    became the master of Rome and of all Italy. But he was subdued by Theodoric king
                    of the Western Goths, who thus succeeded to supreme power in Italy in the year
                    493.</p>
                <p>Though Theodoric was one of the greatest characters of his age, the kingdom he
                    founded proved but of short duration. The Emperor Justinian, after his successes
                    in Africa, attacked the power of the Goths, and by his generals, first
                    Belisarius and afterwards Narses, once more, in 554, restored Italy to the
                    dominion of the Greek empire. The Gothic sovereigns then disappeared, and in a
                    few years no trace of them remained except their name, which has been applied to
                    a peculiar style of architecture.</p>

                    greater part of Italy fell under the power of the Longobards or Lombards.
                    According to some accounts, they were a tribe from Scandinavia, but according to
                    others, a branch of the great German family of the Suevi, who in earlier times
                    had inhabited those parts on the Elbe which are now known as Luneburg, and who
                    had, after various excursions, been settled in Pannonia about 527. They advanced
                    from thence, in 568, towards Italy, and under their king Alboin made a conquest
                    of nearly the whole peninsula; a feat which was easily effected, owing to its
                    desolatq. and depopulated condition. The chief opposition they encountered was
                    from the city of Pavia, which, after a siege of three years, was captured in
                    572, and made the capital of the kingdom. Lombardy flourished during two
                    centuries, till it fell under the power of the Emperor Charlemagne in the year
                    774.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>' See Luden’s <hi

                <p>The history of Germany between the years 560 and 670 is wholly destitute of the
                    materials necessary to frame a consecutive narrative. The only writer of the
                    period was Gregory bishop of Tours, and his attention was wholly engrossed by
                    the events of the Frank kingdom which had sprung up in Gaul, and had begun to
                    decline, the manners, laws, and customs of which he has faithfully represented.
                    The only part of his voluminous work which relates to Germany, is an account of
                    an alliance formed between the Bavarians and Longobards, which offended the
                    Franks, and proved the cause of hostile movements, which, however, were speedily
                    and pacifically terminated in 589. From the death of Dagobert in 632, the
                    dominions of the Frankish kings of the Merovingian race were gradually
                    diminished. One portion after another fell into the hands of great lay or
                    ecclesiastical feudatories; but these circumstances seem to have had little
                    effect on the German tribes. They scarcely interfered in the Frankish contests;
                    and though not without internal controversies and contentions, these were of
                    local and temporary importance only, and seldom produced extensive or calamitous
                    convulsions. Preparations for defence against the Franks were carried on; some
                    fortresses were constructed, and military discipline was maintained. But the
                    most distinguished feature of the century, was the spread of the Christian
                    faith. A saint from Ireland, with his assistants, laboured amongst the German
                    tribes with great diligence and success. The cross of Christ had been planted
                    among them, and publicly acknowledged as their standard; but the remains of
                    heathenism, with its superstitions, were cherished by the great mass of the rude
                    people, and the sacred rites of the Druids were performed in their hallowed
                    groves.</p>
                <p>St Columba indeed found almost everywhere Christian priests, but their knowledge
                    was slight, many of their ceremonies were idolatrous, their faith was wavering,
                    and, what to the Irish saint was most annoying, their dependence on the see of
                    Rome slightly if at all acknowledged.</p>
                <p>The success of the Irish missionaries is much lauded by the monkish writers of
                    the ages that followed their exertions; and whatever effect they may have
                    produced upon the manners and morals of the Germans, it must be acknowledged
                    that they were successful in bringing that people into that close connection
                    with the great head of the Christian church, which became, in a succession of
                    centuries, under the guidance of Providence, one of the means of their
                    advancement in civilization.</p>
                <p>During the same period was laid the foundation of those small sovereign states
                    which successively grew up in Germany under ecclesiastical and lay chiefs, who
                    bore the titles of archbishops, bishops, abbots, princes, dukes, counts,
                    margraves, landgraves, and barons. These, in process of time, had the indirect
                    choice of the emperor, who assumed the title of Chief of the Holy Roman Empire,
                    and was elected to that dignity by princes called electors, who were
                    independent, though nominally the household officers of the reigning emperor.
                    The emperor Charlemagne was the real founder of the holy Roman empire, although
                    that name was not given to it until a later period. He was of the race of the
                    Frankish kings, the son of Pepin and the grandson of Charles Martel, and,
                    jointly with his brother Carloman, ascended the throne of Gaul in 768. He was
                    one of those extraordinary characters calculated to change the face of the
                    civilized world. The history of his actions, during a long and glorious reign of
                    forty-seven years, would relate his transactions in France, Spain, Italy, and
                    Germany, but must here be restricted to those which relate to the last of those
                    countries. (See article <hi rend="smallcaps">France.)</hi> The death of Carloman
                    in 771 gave him the sole command of France, and his authority extended over
                    Italy and a portion of Germany. He wished to obtain more power in that
                    direction, and resolved to attack the Saxons, and made religion one of the
                    pretexts for his attempt. The Saxons were a pagan people settled in Holstein and
                    Westphalia, between the Weset and the Elbe, and, like all people in a barbarous
                    state, thought themselves warranted by this independence in making incursions on
                    their neighbours. They were frequently defeated, and made treaties of peace,
                    which they soon broke, and thus continued until they were completely subdued in
                    803, when Charlemagne settled some ol them in Flanders, and others in
                    Switzerland, whilst the country was occupied by a Vandal tribe from
                    Mecklenburg.</p>
                <p>This long resistance of so weak a power was owing to the enlistments of the
                    troops of Charlemagne being bul for one year, and to the other wars in which he
                    was engaged with the Lombards, the Danes, aad the Saracens, aı well as with some
                    of the feudatories in his patrimonial dominions. He had long nourished the
                    desire-to become emperor of the West, and had negotiated a treaty of marriage
                    with Irene, empress of Constantinople, which woulc have led to a general union
                    of all Christendom under ont head, but which was frustrated by the death of that
                    princess. He was, however, in the year 800, crowned in Rome, by Pope Leo III.
                    and acknowledged as emperor of the West in all the extensive dominions he had
                    obtained. He reigned as emperor fourteen years, and died in 814, al Aachen or
                    Aix-la-Chapelle in Germany, which had beer early selected as his favourite
                    residence.</p>
                <p>The German empire may be dated from the treaty ol Verdun in 843, by which the
                    Frankish kingdom was divided. Lorraine was added to it in 924. Otto the Grea∣
                    brought the kingdom of Italy in 961, and the imperial dominions in that country
                    in 962, into close connection witl the empire of Germany, which then for the
                    first time received the appellation of the Holy Roman Empire. Bui the Italian
                    states were rather feudatories than subjects o: that empire, and this slight
                    bond was in a few years dissolved. Bohemia was a part of the empire under Otto
                    and continued to be so considered until a later period For a short time the
                    kings of Denmark owned allegiance on account of Jutland, and the king of Poland
                    on accoum of Silesia, a state of things which continued till 1355 Hungary was
                    also a part of the empire from 1045 till the reign of Henry IV. Prussia
                    likewise, the possession ol the Teutonic order, stood in the same relation to
                    the empire from 1230 to 1525, and Livonia from 1205 to 1556.</p>

                <p>The Emperor Conrad II., in 1033, united a part of the kingdom of Lower Burgundy
                    with the empire, which thus comprehended Franche-Comté, Dauphine, the Lyonnois,
                    West Switzerland, Provence, and Savoy. These portions were, however, one after
                    another separated from it; and in 1648, when Switzerland and the United
                    Netherlands were declared independent, none of them remained to the empire but
                    Savoy, Mompelgard, and the bishopric of Basil. The principles which regulated
                    the intercourse of the emperor with the several princes, and of those princes
                    with each other, were grounded, not, as in other states, on charters granted by
                    the chief, but on resolutions adopted at various times amongst the several
                    states in general assemblies. The most memorable of these resolutions were, lit,
                    that of internal peace in 1495; 2&lt;7Zy, the Golden Bull, so called from having
                    a seal of gold appended to it. This was agreed to under the Emperor Charles IV.
                    in 1356, and confirmed at two subsequent diets or assemblies, which were held at
                    Nuremburg and Metz. The chief object of it was to secure to the several states
                    the right of independent voting in the election of an emperor. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sdlÿ,</hi> The treaty of Passau in 1552, or rather that concluded in
                    consequence of it at Augsburg in 1555. This treaty established religious peace,
                    and conferred on the several sovereigns who had embraced the Lutheran religion
                    the free exercise of it in their dominions; and to the subjects the right to
                    change their religion, and to leave the dominions without permission from the
                    princes. <hi rend="italic">⅛thly,</hi> The treaty of Westphalia, concluded in
                    1648, which extended freedom of religion to those who had embraced the reformed
                    or Calvinistic religion, as well as to the Lutherans.</p>
                <p>Germany was divided, in 1500, under the Emperor Maximilian I. into six circles,
                    viz. Franconia, Bavaria, Suabia, Upper Rhine, Westphalia, and Saxony. These were
                    increased in 1512 to ten, by adding to them the circles of Austria and Burgundy,
                    and forming two circles out of that of Saxony, and two out of that of the Rhine.
                    But Lausatia, Silesia, Bohemia, Moravia, and other countries, though encompassed
                    by the empire, were nevertheless not included in it. Each of these circles had
                    at its head an ecclesiastical and a lay prince, who assembled the states of the
                    circle, communicated between the emperor and them, and called their attention to
                    the civil or military affairs of the body. Besides these, each circle had a
                    military chief, generally denominated the field-marshal, who commanded the
                    forces, and had the care of providing subsistence, arms, and other stores. In
                    the assembly of the states a majority decided every question; but the decision
                    required to be conformable to the general laws of the empire.</p>
                <p>After the reformation of religion at the treaty of Westphalia, the circles were
                    divided into Catholic, Protestant, and mixed. The circles of Austria, Bavaria,
                    and Burgundy belonged to the first; to the second appertained Saxony; and to the
                    third the remainder.</p>
                <p>The imperial dignity was retained by the family of Charlemagne till the year 888.
                    After that time it was elective, although for a long period there was a general
                    adherence to the family which had been once chosen. At the commencement, the
                    emperor was elected by the whole of the princes, whether lay or ecclesiastical;
                    but during an interregnum, which lasted from 1197 to 1272, the highest or
                    arch-princes, called <hi rend="italic">kurfursten,</hi> assumed the exclusive
                    right of electing, and by a subsequent union amongst themselves, at the election
                    of Charles IV. in 1356, secured the power they claimed. Frankfort was the place
                    of election to which the Archbishop of Mentz summoned the princes or their
                    ambassadors who were allowed to vote; but none of them was to be attended by
                    more than two hundred followers, of whom only fifty were permitted to be armed.
                    All strangers, even sovereigns, and the ambassadors of foreign potentates, were
                    commanded to leave the city on the day of election. After the choice had been
                    concluded, the person chosen, or his representative for him, required to take
                    the prescribed oaths to maintain the golden bull and the several capitulations.
                    He was then led into St Bartholomew’s Church, and declared emperor. At an early
                    period the pope was requested to crown the emperor; butin 1338 it was ordered by
                    Louis the Bavarian, that the dignity and power should be assumed without the
                    ceremony of papal assent or consecration. The coronation was fixed by
                    Charlemagne to be performed at Aix-la-Chapelle; but it was afterwards enacted at
                    Frankfort, whence the standards and jewels used on the occasion were removed,
                    part to Nuremburg, and part to Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>
                <p>It became usual, during the lifetime of an emperor, to choose a successor to the
                    imperial dignity; and the person so chosen was designated king of the Romans.
                    This institution first arose in 1220, when Henry VIL, a son of the Emperor
                    Frederick II., was elected. He was bound to take oaths similar to those enjoined
                    upon the emperor; but during his lifetime he was forbidden to mingle in the
                    public business of the empire. In case of the death, of the minority, or of a
                    protracted absence of the emperor, the golden bull had provided that the Prince
                    of Saxony should exercise vicariate power in Saxony and Westphalia, and the
                    Prince of Alsace similar power in Franconia, Suabia, and the Rhenish circles.
                    They could call assemblies, collect and control the finances, and administer
                    justice; but they had no power to grant imperial dignities or feudal estates. In
                    neither of the circles of Austria or Bavaria was any provision made for the
                    exercise of this vicariate power.</p>
                <p>The states of the empire, or general assembly, consisted of the clergy and laity,
                    who held their property direct from the empire. The first comprehended the
                    archbishops, bishops, prelates, abbots, abbesses, and the masters of the
                    Teutonic and St John’sorders; the second included arch-princes, dukes-princes,
                    landgraves, margraves, burgraves, graffs or counts, and the free imperial
                    cities. After the peace of Westphalia, the states were divided into the Catholic
                    and the Protestant portions, who on many subjects deliberated and resolved
                    separately. Whilst the inferior princes exercised the executive and legal
                    authority within their own states, those greater affairs which related to the
                    empire in general, and to the respective connection of one sovereignty with
                    another, were brought under the notice of the general assembly, in which the
                    emperor presided either personally or by his commissary, who was always a prince
                    of the empire, and who was attended by an assessor. The assembly was divided
                    into three benches or colleges, in which every thing was decided by a majority
                    of voices; but at a subsequent sitting they were united, and then the majority
                    of the three benches determined the final resolution. Many subjects were
                    intrusted to the examination of imperial deputations or committees. The power of
                    making war or concluding peace belonged to the assembly, but was sometimes
                    intrusted solely to the emperor, though only in pressing emergencies. The
                    emperor had originally the power of nominating to the ecclesiastical dignities;
                    but the popes gradually so intruded their authority, as to reduce the monarch’s
                    power to almost a shadow. After the peace of Westphalia, the empire was divided
                    between the three religions. In the Catholic states, the pope and the bishops
                    had usurped the judicial power, and administered it according to the canon law.
                    In the Protestant parts, all the juridical power of the church was abolished,
                    and the affairs of religion were left to the management of consistories chosen
                    from among the subjects, in most cases on the nomination of the princes.</p>
                <p>The power of coining money appertained originally to <pb break="no"

                    gradually obtained by several of the chiefs of the respective states; but the
                    fineness and the weight of the coin were directed by the authority of the
                    emperor and the general assembly. The tolls on certain rivers and roads, the
                    regulation of the great fairs of Frankfort, Brunswick, and Leipsic, and the
                    conveyance of letters by post, as well as providing post-horses, were the
                    regalia of the emperor; and the latter were granted hereditarily to die prince
                    of taxes, whose successors, even to the present day, have some power and some
                    profit connected with them. The degrees in the universities were conferred in
                    the name of the emperor; and, through α prince named by him, called the
                    Pfabzgrave, the doctors, licentiates, advocates, solicitors, notaries, and other
                    legal officers, were admitted to practise their professions in the courts of
                    law.</p>
                <p>The finances of Germany, viewed as one empire, were under the direction of the
                    general assembly. The contributions were called Roman months, each of which
                    amounted to a force of 20,000 infantry and 4000 cavalry; and the number of these
                    months which were granted to the emperor was adapted to the occasion that
                    required them. These were divided among the several states, and called their
                    contingents. They were, however, in process bf time, frequently converted into
                    payments in money, at stipulated rates. In later times each Roman month was
                    estimated at 128,000 florins, or about L. 12,000 sterling. This tax was paid
                    either at Augsburg, Frankfort, Nuremburg, or at Leipsic, and the collectors of
                    it were called Pfenning-meister.</p>
                <p>Many of the individual princes were under greater or less restraint ja the
                    exercise of power, from the rights of their state assemblies; and when there was
                    a collision between them, an appeal was made to the imperial tribunals. To those
                    courts the princes were answerable for the debts they incurred, and by them
                    their dominions were on some occasions put in a state of sequestration; but in
                    other of the principalities there were no assemblies of the states, and
                    consequently less limitation of powers, though in them the sovereign could be
                    brought under the authority of the imperial chamber, and obliged to fulfil his
                    engagements.</p>
                <p>This sketch of the ancient constitution of the German empire is interesting, from
                    the length of time which it lasted, and from having, during ten centuries, with
                    all its complexity and impediments, preserved, among the many independent states
                    of which it was composed, a feeling of nationality, which is still cherished by
                    all who are descended from the rude and ancient tribes of German origin. This
                    constitution gave to Germany but little other unity, and less power, and
                    rendered the greatest of the European kingdoms the weakest of them all. It kept
                    them, however, from suffering the misery of a conquered and an oppressed people,
                    and has led them to a degree of intellectual culture, in which they have been
                    equalled by few, and exceeded by no other nation. Perhaps the distribution of
                    the territory in such small sovereignties was one of the most effectual means of
                    advancing and securing that reformation of religion, which all Protestants
                    regard as one of the greatest blessings to the whole human race.</p>
                <p>The history of Germany in modern times is so much connected with that of the rest
                    of Europe, especially during the wars of the last and the present century, that
                    a narration of it would only be a repetition of what is to be found in this work
                    under the heads of <hi rend="smallcaps">Europe, France,</hi> and especially <hi

                <p>The peace of Presburg m December 1805 first gave occasion for the dissolution of
                    the ancient constitution of Germany. By that treaty the Dukes of Bavaria and
                    Wurtemberg were raised to the rank of kings, and the Prince of <hi

                    <hi rend="subscript"> c</hi> arch-chancellor of the empire declared to the
                    assembled diet, that, though contrary to law, he had nominated Cardinal Fesch,
                    the uncle of Bonaparte, as his coadjutor and successor; and on the 12th of July
                    the new kings of Bavaria and Wurtemberg, and sixteen other princes, formally
                    announced to the Emperor Francis II. their separation from the empire, and
                    invited the other princes to join them in a new alliance. The Emperor Francis on
                    the 6th of August issued a declaration of his withdrawing from the head of the
                    empire, abandoning the title of Emperor of Germany, and assuming that of Emperor
                    of Austria.</p>
                <p>In the room of this dissolved constitution, of nearly a thousand years’
                    continuance, the several states which had been accomplices in its destruction,
                    with some others added to them, formed what was called the Confederation of the
                    Rhine, which, by February 1808, had received the adhesion of most of the
                    princes, and placed Bonaparte at its head, under the title of protector. Two
                    years afterwards, the protector, by his sole decree, united the rivers Scheldt,
                    Meuse, Rhine, Ems, Weser, and the mouths of the Elbe, to France, and robbed of
                    their dominions several of the smaller princes, whom he had contracted to
                    defend. With these augmentations he continued his aggressions till the
                    dispersion of his army in Russia.</p>
                <p>As the events which produced the deliverance of Germany from the yoke of France
                    belong to the history of that country as much as to this, our notices of it here
                    must be brief. After the destruction of that vast army which penetrated into
                    Russia, almost all the states of the north of Germany, with Prussia at their
                    head, declared war against France. An army was quickly collected from the French
                    conscription, and, with a wonderful celerity, Bonaparte, at its head, was
                    enabled to penetrate into Saxony, to threaten Prussia, and exhibit a force which
                    he supposed would overawe Austria. The battles of Lutzen and Dresden, in 1813,
                    produced an armistice, during the continuance of which negotiations for peace
                    between Russia and Prussia on one side, and France on the other, were carried on
                    under the mediation of the Emperor of Austria. But as peace could not be
                    concluded, Austria was induced to join the allies against France. During these
                    periods a spirit had risen in Germany which animated all classes of its
                    inhabitants, so that those powers which still clung to the interests of France
                    could place no reliance on the support of their subjects. Bonaparte, overpowered
                    by numbers, with an army of raw troops from his own dominions, and with troops
                    of doubtful fidelity from the dominions of his allies, was surrounded, and,
                    after being compelled to retreat from Dresden, fought the important battle of
                    Leipsic against the armies of Russia, Austria, Prussia, and Sweden. The issue of
                    that battle was not considered as doubtful even from its commencement; but,
                    during the contest, the Saxon division of the army marched from their station in
                    the French line, and took up their position with the Prussians. The result of
                    the battle was a hurried retreat from Leipsic to the frontier of France, which
                    was then the river Rhine. On the retreat to the Rhine, the shattered remains of
                    the French army were interrupted by the forces of Bavaria. A battle was fought
                    at Hanau, about twelve miles from Frankfort, which, though gained by the French,
                    tended only to hasten their flight, and led to the loss of much that remained of
                    their stores, arms, and ammunition.</p>
                <p>By the end of the year 1813, the French were totally expelled from every part of
                    Germany, and the occupation of Paris by the allies, early in 1814,' led to
                    general tranquillity. The Congress of Vienna soon afterwards met, and never was
                    a body of plenipotentiaries plunged into such a labyrinth of difficulties. The
                    great extent of country which had been delivered, and was without any
                    government; the number of claims urged either from previous possession, or from
                    active service in effecting the deliverance<pb break="no" facs="nls:193520233"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-0233-0482"/>; were such as to perplex with difficulties which
                    appeared to be nearly insuperable, and, in whatever way they were terminated,
                    must necessarily have left great dissatisfaction. They were, however, so settled
                    as to leave Germany in the state described in the preceding pages; and whether
                    they could have been adjusted with more regard to the principles of equity is
                    not for us to decide.</p>
                <p>The return of Bonaparte from Elba produced most gigantic efforts upon the part of
                    all those smaller sovereigns who had been reinstated in their dominions by his
                    downfall. The number of troops actually mustered and prepared to march when the
                    battle of Waterloo took place and suspended them, amounted to more than
                    1,200,000 men. They were not indeed all armed, but many more men could have been
                    raised if arms for them could have been procured. These efforts, added to the
                    costly exertions made in the war of the deliverance, have encumbered with debts
                    almost every state, as is noticed in the detailed account of them. These debts,
                    however, have not been solely created by the events in question. The ephemeral
                    kingdom of Westphalia, formed for Jerome Bonaparte, extended over Hanover,
                    Brunswick, and Cassel, as well as the circle from which it was denominated.
                    During his government, aD the different portions of his kingdom had incurred
                    vast debts in executing his projects. These debts were owing to individuals or
                    corporate bodies within the dominions attached by the congress to their new
                    sovereigns; and the princes, for the sake of the people, were compelled to
                    assume the debts, and provide means for their liquidation, and the payment in
                    the mean time of the interest. Thus the ungrateful task of providing for the
                    expenditure attending the subjection of their states, as well as for their
                    liberation, became one of the first duties on their resumption of power. This
                    odious consequence of former circumstances has been industriously improved by
                    the enemies of tranquillity, and has created considerable discontent.</p>
                <p>These feelings of discontent were chiefly confined to writers in periodical
                    papers of the smaller kind, and to associations amongst the young men in those
                    universities in which the discipline was the most relaxed. The demonstrations of
                    this dissatisfied state of the public mind were few, and scarcely noticed except
                    in narrow circles. The murder of Kotzebue by Sandt, and a similar attempt on the
                    life of Ibell, the minister of Nassau, were tokens of great excitement amongst a
                    few fanatics; but the judicial inquiries which followed these transactions
                    seemed to the governments to prove that the mischievous views of insurrection or
                    assassination were confined to a very narrow circle. There was no interruption
                    to the full exercise of the powers of the law, nor any necessity for increasing
                    the military establishments. The Revolution in Paris in 1830 produced, however,
                    considerable excitement in several parts of Germany, particularly in Hanover and
                    in Saxony, and also in Brunswick, though in the latter country it was more owing
                    to the personal character and conduct of the sovereign, which led to his
                    deposition and to the investing of the power in the hands of his brother. In
                    Hanover, the suspension of the university of Gottingen, and the mild but firm
                    measures of the government, soon led to tranquillity; and in Saxony, though some
                    mischief was effected, it was but of short duration, and the kingdom soon
                    returned to that tranquil state which is habitual to the greater part of its
                    inhabitants. The establishment of the present German confederation, consisting
                    of ambassadors from all the states, in number proportioned to their extent and
                    population, has concentrated the power of the whole body of the princes, and
                    appears calculated to give stability to ancient and respected institutions.
                    These representatives were seventy in number, but are now reduced to
                    sixty-nine,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This
                    diminution of the number has been caused by the duchy of Saxe∙Gotha having been
                    divided between two other states.</p></note> as appears by the table which
                    follows; and in some cases they act by a committee of seventeen. In the general
                    body, two thirds are required to make a law; in the smaller body a bare majority
                    is sufficient, but in both assemblies Austria and Prussia have a great
                    preponderance. Austria is the president in both these bodies, and has the
                    casting vote when an equality of opinions is experienced. It is not our design
                    to condemn or applaud the constitution; but it is powerful to suppress
                    insurrection, and to propagate general regulations, and is said to have been
                    found highly beneficial in the arrangement of differences between the
                    governments of the several states of which it is composed.</p>
                <p>Within the limits of Germany are portions of kingdoms, parts of the territory of
                    which are not within the sphere of the confederation; thus Austria, Prussia, the
                    Netherlands, and Denmark, have parts only of Germany within their dominions, and
                    therefore will here receive such notice as is merely necessary to give a view of
                    the whole of Germany. Austria and Denmark have already been noticed in this
                    work, and the kingdoms of the Netherlands and of Prussia will occur in their
                    alphabetical order.</p>
                <p>The four kingdoms of Bavaria, Hanover, Saxony, and Wurtemberg, are too important
                    to be wholly included in a general article. Bavaria has been already treated of
                    separately, and the other three will be noticed in their proper places.</p>
                <p>According to its present boundaries, Germany extends from 45° to 54° 20 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> north latitude, and from 5° 43 <hi rend="superscript"
                    > ,</hi> to 20° 50 ’ east longitude from London. It is bounded on the north by
                    the German Ocean, by Denmark, and the Baltic Sea; on the east by West Prussia,
                    Poland, Cracow, Gallicia, and Illyria; on the south by the Adriatic Sea, Italy,
                    and the Helvetic provinces; on the east by France and the kingdom of the
                    Netherlands. Its whole extent, including'rivers and lakes, is 248,832 English
                    square miles.</p>
                <p>The southern part of Germany is either covered or penetrated with steep
                    mountains, one part of which extends from the Alps, and the other from the
                    Carpathian range. These mountains gradually lose themselves in advancing
                    northward; and from the last of them, the Hartz, upon the confines of Hanover,
                    begins that vast plain which extends over the north of Germany, through Prussia
                    and Poland, and a considerable part of Russia. This plain was probably covered
                    by the water long after the more southern parts had emerged from the ocean, the
                    evidences of which are apparent in the turf moors of the sandy districts, where
                    expensive embankments and dikes are necessary to preserve the land from
                    inundation.</p>
                <p>The soil is generally productive. The plains in the north have indeed much arid
                    sandy land; but nature has provided along the borders of the rivers some rich
                    and fruitful soils, where the most abundant harvests are gathered. The south has
                    also on its mountains much barren or slightly productive land; but the beautiful
                    valleys and small plains between the hills rival in fertility the best alluvial
                    lands on the banks of the northern rivers. In general the soil in the north is
                    heavy, and in the south light; the former most adapted for corn, and the latter
                    for vines. The best soil is in the middle, between the mountains and the sandy
                    plains. In Bohemia, Silesia, Franconia, Saxony, and on the Rhine, the proportion
                    of good soil is much greater than in the north or the south.</p>
                <p>Some of the loftiest mountains of Germany are those springing from the great mass
                    of the Alps, and divided into <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520246"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-0246-0483"/>the Rhoetian and the None; and several of the
                    peaks of these reach the line of perpetual snow. The eastern branch of the Noric
                    chain runs through the Austrian dominions, and loses one part of that chain in
                    Silesia, whilst another enters Hungary. The other branch runs through Bavaria
                    and Wurtemberg, to the west of the Black Forest, and is connected with the
                    Odenwald, the Fichtelgebirge, and the mountains of Thuringia. It stretches to
                    the Hartz, and the mountains through which the Weser forces its passage, soon
                    after which it is lost. Several other chains branch from these greater ones; and
                    some of their peaks attain a considerable elevation. The principal mountains,
                    and their height above the level of the sea, are as follows; but in their
                    progress to the north their gradual declension in height is remarkable :—</p>

                <p>The mountains are generally covered with forests; to the southward, where they
                    are the most lofty, with pines; and to the northward, with various deciduous
                    trees. If at the present day the <hi rend="italic">terra tylυis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">horrida</hi> of Tacitus cannot be found in Germany, it is still
                    the most abundantly wooded territory in Europe.</p>
                <p>Germany has seven large rivers which pass through it to the sea; and in their
                    passage receive the various smaller streams which issue from the mountains, and
                    spread fertility over this well-watered country. The Danube rises in the dukedom
                    of Baden, becomes navigable for small craft at Ulm, receives the large rivers
                    Lech, Iser, Inn, Ens, and March, and, after a course of 430 miles, exclusively
                    of its curvatures, waters Hungary in its way to the Black Sea. The Rhine, rising
                    in Switzerland, and navigable from its entrance into Germany, has a course,
                    exclusive of its windings, of 460 miles, before it enters the kingdom of the
                    Netherlands. In its progress it receives the navigable rivers Neckar, Lahn, and
                    Moselle, the Saar, the Roer, and the Lippe.</p>
                <p>The Weser rises in middle Germany, from two springs which form the Fulda and the
                    Werra, and at their junction takes the name which it carries to the ocean, and
                    under which name it runs, without noticing its bendings, 190 miles. It becomes
                    navigable at Minden for boats, and at Vegefach, near Bremen, for ships. The
                    Elbe, like the Weser, from its rise to its junction with the ocean, is wholly a
                    Ģerman river. It becomes navigable near its source, runs a course of 520 miles,
                    and is the most considerable channel of commerce with foreign countries, through
                    the ports of Hamburg and Altona. It receives the navigable rivers Moldau, Eger,
                    Saale, Havel, Spree, Ilmenau, and Steckinitz, besides fifty smaller streams. The
                    Oder becomes navigable for boats at Ratisbon, and running, in the Prussian part
                    of Germany, a course of 380 miles, empties itself into the Baltic Sea in
                    Pomerania. It receives the rivers Bober, Neisse, and Warthe, besides many
                    smaller streams. The Eloch is the only German river which runs to the Adriatic
                    Sea. It passes through the Tyrol, and only becomes navigable after it has
                    entered Italy. The Ems is a river of short course, rising in Prussia, and
                    passing through the province of East Friesland, now belonging to Hanover, whence
                    it becomes navigable, and soon enters the sea near the city of Emden in two
                    branches.</p>
                <p>The forming a junction between these great rivers, by means of canals, is an
                    object of vast importance, and some progress towards effecting it has been made.
                    The Holstein Canal unites the German Ocean with the Baltic Sea from the river
                    Eider. The Plauen Canal unites the Havel with the Elbe, or rather facilitates
                    and shortens the passage. The Finnow Canal forms a communication between the
                    Havel and the Oder. The Frederick William’s Canal unites the Spree and the Oder.
                    The Pappenburg Canal is designed to unite the Ems with the Elbe. Lastly, the
                    Vienna Canal is now completed, and forms a communica* tion between the Danube
                    and the Adriatic Sea.</p>
                <p>The whole of Germany being in the temperate zone, though, from the variations of
                    elevation and the difference of latitude, it differs in climate, is generally
                    very healthy, The most mild and beautiful are the middle provinces, between the
                    48th and 51st degree. In the south, under the influence of the Alps, the air is
                    raw and cold; whilst in the plains and open valleys the climate of the finest
                    parts of Italy is enjoyed. The northern provinces are colder, damper, and more
                    ungenial, and near the stagnant lakes unwholesome. The weather undergoes extreme
                    variations, and the frost is frequently seen at a late period of the year The
                    inhabitants there too feel the effect of heavy fogs, ant sometimes of tremendous
                    storms. No volcanoes are no« in existence; and though the remains of them are to
                    be seen in many places, they are not supposed to have beer in activity since the
                    antediluvian ages. Earthquakes are scarcely felt, and have never been
                    injuriously experienced; and the country is free from the musquitos, which so
                    much annoy the inhabitants of Italy. Vines, maise. and rice, grow as far north
                    as latitude 51; but beyond that they do not arrive at full perfection. The olive
                    and the silk-worm are only raised on that small portion ol Germany to the south
                    of the 46th degree.</p>
                <p>The original German horses are of a very inferior race, and the specimens of
                    them, where they have not been improved by the intermixture of other breeds,
                    generally bad but from this must be excepted those of Mecklenburg, East
                    Friesland, Holstein, and Luneburg, which, for draft or for heavy dragoons, are
                    admirable races, and have beer propagated over all Europe. Horses for pleasure,
                    or foi mounting light cavalry, must be brought from other countries; but the
                    jennets, a light small breed, are good and quiet. Asses are not common even in
                    the southern part of the country. Mules are to be seen in Hanover, neaι the
                    Hartz Forest, and in the Tyrolese portion of German) they are the common beasts
                    of burden.</p>
                <p>The cows are of various breeds; but the handsomest are those from East Friesland,
                    Oldenburg, Holstein, and the other provinces on the borders of the German Ocean,
                    though generally known under the name of East Frieslanders. The Hungarian breed
                    prevails in many parts, but is esteemed more for the ease with which the animals
                    arc fattened than for the purposes of the dairy. A third sort o∣ cows is the
                    Swiss breed, which does not come wholly fron ’ the Alpine regions, but is
                    furnished by Wurtemberg, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520259"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-0259-0484"/>a part of Bavaria. The breed of Germany,
                    originating from the mixture of these races, is well adapted for the dairy; but,
                    either from want of appropriate qualities in the animals, or from the imperfect
                    manner of fattening them, the oxen, when killed, are seldom more than 500 pounds
                    weight, and the average of them considerably lighter. Some attempts are now
                    making to improve the breed, by the introduction of the Tyrolese bull; perhaps
                    the most perfect animal of the cow kind for meat and for draft, and which, when
                    crossed with the best milkers, produces the most complete cattle. The common
                    practice in Germany, of killing the calves from ten to sixteen days old,
                    produces very bad veal; but some of the beef, especially near the banks of the
                    Elbe, is excellent.</p>
                <p>The proper German sheep are a mixture of the original coarse-woolled race,
                    crossed by a breed from Ardennes. In a part of Illyria they have the sheep of
                    Padua. The fine-woolled sheep of Spain have, however, been introduced by many of
                    the princes, and have been vastly extended, especially in Saxony, Silesia, and
                    Brandenburg, and will probably, at no distant period, be the principal, if not
                    the sole race. The badness of their flesh is of less consequence in Germany than
                    in England; because, in the former country, it is not worth more than the annual
                    clipping of the wool, which can be sent to richer countries, where they can
                    afford to pay high prices for it; but the flesh must be consumed at home, and
                    therefore sells for little.</p>
                <p>Goats are common in all the states, but are only to be seen in large flocks in
                    the more mountainous parts. Swine are the most important kind of live stock in
                    Bavaria, Westphalia, Hanover, Mecklenburg, and Pomerania. They are of three
                    different breeds; the long white, bent in the back; the short white, or yellow,
                    with the same kind of back; and the black, or yellow, of a short make; but these
                    different breeds are becoming much mingled together.</p>
                <p>The forests of Germany abound with untamed animals, which afford sport to its
                    princes and nobles, and furnish a considerable quantity of aliment to the higher
                    and middle classes of the people, as the noble sportsmen generally sell their
                    prey, and are obliged to dispose of it cheap. Wild deer of various kinds, and
                    wild swine, are very numerous in many parts of the country. With them, foxes are
                    found in some districts in prodigious numbers; but the hunting of these animals
                    is less an object with sportsmen in Germany than with us, as the lynxes are very
                    numerous, especially in the mountains in the south, and the chase of them is
                    found to be the most exciting of all rural sports. At a hunting on the estate of
                    one nobleman in Bohemia, during three days of 1818, more than 12,000 head of
                    game were killed; and in Saxony between 2000 and 3000 hares were shot in one
                    day, and sold for about one shilling each. There are bears in the southern
                    parts, in Illyria, in the Steyermark, and the Tyrol, of the small black kind,
                    more dangerous to the bee-hives, and the smaller animals, than to man. Wolves
                    are few now, and only found in the Trans-Rhenish provinces. In some of the
                    mountains the beaver is found, though but rarely, and some other animals,
                    principally valuable for their fur. The most annoying animal is the field-mouse,
                    of a species called the hamster, which is found in thousands in Saxony, and does
                    incredible injury to the productions of the soil. In the months between the 9th
                    May and the 9th September 1817, the corporation of the city of Gotha paid
                    rewards for killing 89,565 of these mischievous animals.</p>
                <p>Domesticated birds are very plentiful, but especially ducks and geese. The latter
                    form an important portion <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> f . <hi

                    houses in the country cure from fifty to a hundred for their winter consumption.
                    Wild birds are more numerous in Germany than in any other part of Europe. Wild
                    geese, bustards, grouse, blackcocks, woodcocks, wild ducks, widgeons, teal, and
                    snipes, are most abundant. Besides these, the smaller kinds of birds, as larks,
                    thrushes, and sparrows, and the singing birds, especially bullfinches and canary
                    birds, are plentiful. The latter are chiefly taken in the Hartz Forest, and are
                    circulated throughout all Europe.</p>
                <p>The three seas which border on Germany abound with fish. Besides the kinds which
                    are caught in the ocean, the Baltic Sea and the Adriatic furnish their peculiar
                    species. Amongst those of the former are the dersh and the klipfish <hi
                    rend="italic">(anarchico)</hi>; and of the latter the tunny, the Sardinia, and
                    many others. The greater part of the fish consumed in Germany is, however, the
                    produce of the rivers and lakes, which supply in great abundance eels, lampreys,
                    trout, salmon, sturgeon, perch, pike, salmontrout, barbel, carp, craw-fish, and
                    many others. With these various kinds the markets in the cities are most
                    profusely supplied.</p>
                <p>The rearing of bees in the north, and especially in Lausatia, is productive of
                    much honey and wax, which form important articles, both for domestic use and for
                    foreign trade.</p>
                <p>The great production of Germany, as of every other European country, is grain of
                    various kinds. Wheat, rye, maize, rice, barley, oats, beans, peas, and
                    buckwheat, are the most important of these. In the south, more wheat than rye is
                    grown; but in the north, the proportion of rye to wheat is eight to one. In the
                    north, most oats are cultivated; in the south, more barley. Maize and rice are
                    peculiar to the south; buckwheat and peas are alike in every part.</p>
                <p>The productions arising from garden culture are very great. Potatoes are
                    sometimes cultivated with the spade, sometimes with the plough; but the increase
                    of their growth has been very rapid of late years, and probably furnishes as
                    much human aliment as grain. The cabbages of all the Brassica tribe receive much
                    attention, and are raised in great quantities. Turnips are cultivated with
                    little care, merely as food for man, andere not extensively used for feeding
                    cattle. The superior kinds of fruit are best in the middle and southern
                    provinces; but in the north the apples, plums, and pears, are good and most
                    abundant. The Pearmain apple, which has spread throughout all the countries of
                    Europe from Germany, is found in the highest perfection in Stettin, Bostock, and
                    the Tyrol. Chestnuts and almonds are almost exclusively grown in the southern
                    parts, towards Illyria and the Tyrol; and in the same vicinity the melons and
                    other fruits, which in our climate and the north of Germany require artificial
                    heat, are raised in the open air.</p>
                <p>Vines were originally planted in Germany by the Romans. They are now cultivated
                    successfully on the bankι of the Rhine, the Maine, the Moselle, the Danube, the
                    Mur, the Etsch, and the Save, where they produce win¢ as highly esteemed as any
                    in Europe. The most valued of all the wines is that produced on the banks of
                    th&lt; Rhine, known in England by the name of Old Hock, frorr the vineyards of
                    Hockheim, where the best kind is made The principal sorts, from the places of
                    their growth, are denominated Johannisberg, Rudesheim, Hockheim, Markobrunn, and
                    Lieb∙frauenmilch. The next in value are tin wines of the Maine, called Leisten
                    wine, Stein wine, am Steyer wine. The wines from the Danube are next iι
                    estimation, and to them succeed those from the Tyrol ant the banks of the
                    Moselle. The other wines near the lake o Constance, and in Bohemia, are much
                    inferior; and thos&lt; produced near to Naumberg, Jena, and Meissen in Saxony
                    and to Zullichau in Silesia, are of very indifferent flavour <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193520272" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0272-0485"/>especially after a moist
                    summer, and scarcely merit the name of wine, though, from their great abundance,
                    they become very useful to the inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Neither the quantity nor the quality of the oil produced from olives in Germany
                    is material; it is conĥned to a small district of the south. Great quantities of
                    rape and linseed oil are expressed; and for the more common purposes, the oil of
                    herrings, seals, and other aquatic animals, is very abundant.</p>
                <p>But the staple production of Germany is flax, which is grown in almost every
                    village, and is spun into yarn. The best is produced in Silesia, in Westphalia,
                    in Hanover, in Brunswick, and in Bohemia; but even these kinds do not attain a
                    length or fineness of fibre equal to the flax of Flanders. Hemp is raised in
                    Baden, Wurtemberg, Westphalia, Hesse-Darmstadt, and Luneburg, but scarcely
                    produces sufficient for the consumption of the country. Tobacco has been long
                    cultivated in Baden, on the Rhine, and near Magdeburg, and during the existence
                    of the French continental system had been very much extended; but the return of
                    peace checked its progress, and the cultivation of it is again confined to those
                    parts here mentioned, where, from long habit, it has become almost indigenous.
                    Various roots were cultivated for the production of sugar during the continuance
                    of that system, but they now scarcely deserve notice, as they are nearly
                    abandoned. Woad, saffron, annise-seed, cummin-seed, hops, rhubarb, camomile
                    flowers, and Iceland-moss, are native and considerable productions. The forests
                    of Germany, besides their abundant supply of fuel to the inhabitants, furnish
                    much wood, both for building houses and ships; and if ever the water
                    communication should be much extended, so as to bring the largest trees with
                    facility to the shores of the ocean, they will become a most valuable source of
                    wealth.</p>
                <p>No part of Europe yields a greater variety or abundance of mineral productions,
                    and in no part of the world are the mines worked with so much skill or so much
                    economy. Precious stones are discovered in many parts; rock-crystal, amethysts,
                    topazes, are found in Bavaria; calcedony, agate, petchstein, and
                    porcelain-jasper, in Bohemia; barytes in many parts; marbles, gypsum, and
                    alabaster, in Bohemia; alum near Töplitz; rock-salt and Glauber salts in various
                    parts; and abundance of the earths calculated for making earthenware, from the
                    coarsest description to the finest porcelain. Fossil coal is found in many
                    districts, and much of it is consumed; but the cheapness of wood, and the
                    prejudices of the people against the use of it in their houses, has operated to
                    prevent the mines from being completely explored or worked to anything
                    approaching the extent of which they are capable. Gold is procured, though in
                    very small quantities, by washing, in Saltzburg, in Bohemia, in the Rammelsberg,
                    and. in Silesia. Silver and cinnabar are raised from the mines of the Erzgebirge
                    in Saxony. Iron, copper, tin, lead, calamine, bismuth, cobalt, nickel, titanium,
                    arsenic, and almost every other mineral, is more or less raised from the mines.
                    The abundance of mineral substances everywhere scattered, and which it would be
                    difficult to enumerate, have promoted the study of mineralogy, and given birth
                    to the school of Freyburg, whence, under the direction of Werner, the
                    mineralogical knowledge of the earth has been widely extended.</p>
                <p>The annual supply from the mines of Germany is as follows:</p>

                <p>The inhabitants are of two original races; the ancient Germans and the
                    Sclavonians. The former are divided into High and Low Germans, speaking a
                    language somewhat different, but possessing great similarity in habits,
                    characters, and dispositions. The Low German, or, as it is <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193520285" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0285-0486"/>called, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Platt Deutsche,</hi> prevails among all the people in Lower Saxony, Westphalia,
                    Holstein, Mecklenburg, Brandenburg, and Pomerania; but as the service in the
                    churches, and the instruction in the schools, is in High German, all even of the
                    peasantry understand that language, though they prefer their own dialect. In the
                    southern parts, where only High German is spoken, the peasantry use a <hi
                    rend="italic">patois</hi> which is scarcely more intelligible to those
                    unaccustomed to it than the <hi rend="italic">Platt Deutsche.</hi> The
                    descendants of the Sclavonians reside all to the eastward of the Elbe. They
                    retain their original language, with a great mixture of German words; and they
                    are far behind their neighbours in cultivation, but are an industrious and
                    patient people. They form nearly one sixth of the inhabitants. In the south are
                    same few of Italian origin; and colonies of French, originally Protestant
                    refugees, are established in many places, where they retain a connection with
                    each other, founded upon privileges granted at the time of their emigration. But
                    all these scarcely amount to more than 250,000. The Jews are 248,749 souls; of
                    whom 83,077 are in Austria, 57,353 in Prussia, 22,000 in Bavaria, 8319 in
                    Wurtemberg, 8000 in Hanover, 8300 in Hesse-Darmstadt, 15,079 in Hesse-Cassel,
                    14,378 in Holstein, 16,000 in the free cities, and the remainder are scattered
                    over the other states.</p>
                <p>By the terms of the confederation, the three Christian sects, Catholics,
                    Lutherans, and Reformed, are on an equal footing in all the states of the union,
                    and the religious profession of the princes has very little influence upon that
                    of the subjects. The Catholics are the great majority in Austria, Bavaria,
                    Baden, and Luxembourg, and form a numerous body in Prussia, Wurtemberg,
                    Hesse-Darmstadt, Hesse-Cassel, and Hanover, amounting in all to 21,000,000
                    individuals. The Protestants of the two confessions have approached each other
                    so nearly as to form almost but one church, and in many parts they are
                    amalgamated together. Their whole number is about 14,000,000. The smaller
                    Christian sects, Menonites, Hussites, Moravians, and a few of the Greek church,
                    are not together more in number than the Jews, who, as before stated, do not
                    exceed 250,000.</p>
                <p>The knowledge of the German people probably exceeds that of every other. They
                    have men of eminence in every department of literature, and can enumerate those
                    who have made discoveries or improvements in every branch of science. It is not,
                    however, so much from the merits of their eminent men, great and useful as they
                    have been, as from the general diffusion of knowledge, that the character of the
                    nation must be estimated. Its literature is not the work of its princes and
                    nobles, but arises from the general taste for reading and accumulating knowledge
                    which so extensively prevails, and which descends lower in the scale of society
                    than in almost any other country of the civilized world. Although for two
                    hundred years literature has prevailed much in Germany, it was only about the
                    middle of the last century that, by the poets and critics, the language became
                    polished, without diminishing its force, and was purified from many of those
                    vulgarisms which had disgusted the English, French, and Italian literati. The
                    learned men had more sedulously studied the ancient languages of Greece and Rome
                    than the improvement of their own; but, in the middle of the last century, a
                    race of authors appeared, with whom arose the commencement of the golden age of
                    literature. Gotsched, Lessing, Adelung, and Campe, were amongst the first who
                    imparted to their countrymen the knowledge of the powers and of the beauty of
                    their native tongue. Poetry soon lent its aid, and furthered what the prose
                    writers had begun; it broke forth suddenly as from a dark cloud, and threw a
                    radiance on almost every subject which, in any age or country, the muse has ever
                    attempted. With Haller, Gellert, and Hagedorn, began that chain of poetical
                    writers which has continued to be extended to the present day. The poetical
                    epistles of Michaelis, Ebert, Gotter, and Jacobi, will ever be read with
                    delight. In descriptive poetry Von Kleist, Thümmel, and Wolfgang, have been
                    distinguished; but especially Goethe, whose name is known in every corner of
                    Europe. In satire, Rabener, Musaeus, Lichtenberg, and Fulk, excelled; in elegy,
                    Holtz, Bürger, Weisse, Schmidt, and Herder; in fables, Gellert, Lessing,
                    Willamow, and Pfeffel; in poetic tales, Wieland, Blumauer, Rost, and Nicoay. The
                    name of K lopstock will ever be reverenced by those who venerate heroic or
                    religious poetry. The lyric poems of Schiller, of the two Schlegels, of Bos, and
                    Ramler, are beautiful specimens of the powers of the German language. Amongst
                    the most eminent of the poets of Germany the name of Goethe cannot be passed
                    over without some mention being made beyond the bare announcement. He has been,
                    during a long life recently closed, the wonder and the delight of all who can
                    understand his language. His works embrace every species of poetry, and are all
                    marked with originality, force, pathos, and nature. He appeared with wonderful
                    applause as a writer, first in 1773, and continued to interest, amuse, and
                    instruct his country during more than fifty years, retaining to the last his
                    powers of critical reflection and of accurate and spirited composition. The
                    theatrical productions have kept pace with the other species of poetical
                    composition. In tragedy, Schiller, Goethe, Lessing, Collen, and Grillparzer,
                    have distinguished themselves; whilst lfland, Kotzebue, Brand, Grossman,
                    Schroeder, and a host of other writers, have appeared in comedy.</p>
                <p>German writers of prose have been neither fewer nor less able, though their names
                    have not been so far extended in other countries as those of the poets and
                    theatrical authors. In religious compositions, Mosheim, Sack, Jerusalem,
                    Spalding, Zollikofer, and Teller, are destined to futurity, after having
                    delighted and edified the existing generation. In epistolary writing, few in any
                    language have exceeded Gellert, Winkelman, Abt, and Garve, whilst Mendelsohn has
                    been unrivalled in his dialogues. The race of novel and romance writers has been
                    too numerous to be recited; and the latter have displayed a power over the human
                    passions and feelings which has scarcely been equalled by the writers of other
                    nations. In didactic writings, those of Scheibart, Lessing, Winkelman, Iselin,
                    Sonnenfels, Moser, Zimmerman, Eberhard, Bötticher, and Forster, have displayed
                    great talent; and on subjects of education, Basedow, Campe, Trapp, Salzman, and
                    Pestalozzi, have discovered vast powers of mind directed to one of the most
                    important subjects.</p>
                <p>In classical literature the Germans have thoroughly imbibed the spirit of the
                    ages when Greece and Rome were at the highest pinnacle of literary glory. The
                    names of Ernesti, Heyne, Gesner, Camerarius, Fabri, Wyttenbach, Wolf, and
                    Scheller, are familiar to the Latin scholars of every country; as are those of
                    Michaelis, Hottinger, Von der Hardt, Eichorn, Griesbach, and Paulus, to the
                    Greek student; but perhaps, of all the classical scholars of Europe, none have
                    equalled the stupendous learning of the elder Schweighaeuser, whose edition of
                    Herodotus, with his lexico, and his extracts from Polybius, Athenaeus, Arrian,
                    Simplicius, Epictetus, and others, have rendered him an object of admiration to
                    the learned of every country.</p>
                <p>The Germans have been ever distinguished for that diligence and patience in
                    examination which are the great requisites in geographical and statistical
                    authors. None in any country has exceeded Busching, and many living authors are
                    now following his steps with equal success.</p>
                <p>The Germans claim the honour of having been the revivers<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193520298" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0298-0487"/> of the Grecian mathematics,
                    and the glory of having ascertained, by their countryman Copernicus, the true
                    system of astronomy. Kepler is considered as the father of dioptrics,
                    Tscħernhausen the inventor of burning glasses, Leibnitz the discoverer of the
                    differential calculus, and Lieberkuhn the greatest improver of the solar
                    microscope. Euler was distinguished by his powers of analysis; and Kepler,
                    Mayer, Herschel, Bode, Von Zach, and 01- bers, by their skill in astronomy.
                    Metaphysics engaged the close attention of Wolf, Leibnitz, Kant, and their
                    scholars, Fichte, Schelling, and Plainer.</p>
                <p>Although in natural history Germany has produced neither a Linnaeus nor a Buffon,
                    yet Blumenbach, Zimmerman, Pallas, and Fabricius in zoology; Haller, Gleiditsch,
                    Hofman, and Sprengel in botany; and Werner in mineralogy, would not be unfit
                    associates of those great names.</p>
                <p>In natural philosophy the Germans claim for Guerike the discovery of the
                    air-pump; for Fahrenheit the thermometer; and for Hausen the invention, and for
                    Marun the perfecting, of electrical machines; and they are proud to reckon
                    amongst their chemists the names of Stahl, Hofman, Margrof, Born, Klaproth, and
                    Humboldt. In medicine, besides Paracelsus and Stahl, they boast with great
                    reason of Hofman, Tissot, Haller, Unzer, and Huefland, with many others of great
                    though inferior name.</p>
                <p>In jurisprudence the Germans long took the lead in Europe; and in theology Luther
                    and Melancthon have, by the translation of the sacred books, and by their
                    writings, produced a mighty change through all the most enlightened nations of
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>It is, however, somewhat singular, that in a country of so much learning and such
                    research, in which antiquities have been sedulously studied, where the
                    numismatic collections are so numerous, and where ancient documents are so
                    carefully preserved, scarcely any historian has appeared who deserves a higher
                    name than that of a chronicler.</p>
                <p>The fine arts have been cultivated, especially music, with much success. No
                    nation has produced more celebrated composers than Gluch, Handel, Haydn, Bach,
                    and, above all, perhaps, Mozart. Statuary has been practised more by Italians in
                    this country than by natives. Painters have risen to no very great excellence,
                    with the exception of Albert Durer, Kranach, and Holbein; but to those of a more
                    recent date must be added Mengs, and, in our own time, Angelica Kaufman,
                    Hackert, and one or two others.</p>
                <p>The circulation of books, produced from the pens of ten thousand writers, is
                    facilitated by the two fairs of Leipsic, to which the publishers from all parts
                    of Germany resort with the new works they have printed at their own residences.
                    This general rendezvous becomes the focus of literary information. The
                    publications are made known, their respective merits are discussed, and the
                    different booksellers exchange with each other the productions of their
                    respective provinces, which are thus spread over the extensive country in which
                    the language is used with great regularity, and at a very trifling expense in
                    advertising.</p>
                <p>One evil is much complained of, namely, the want of protection for literary
                    property; which arises from the great number of sovereigns in whose dominions
                    the same language is spoken. The best productions of the north are frequently
                    pirated in the south. The king of Saxony has indeed prohibited the circulation
                    of pirated editions at Leipsic during the fairs; but that is found insufficient
                    to protect authors whose productions combine excellence with popularity. The
                    average number of works published of late years at Leipsic has been about six
                    thousand, amounting to about ten thousand volumes, which probably is more than
                    all the other presses of Europe deliver. The press in Germany is nearly free;
                    for though in some states there is a previous censorship, yet it is conducted on
                    liberal principles, and is seldom exercised except on small political works
                    which display more heat than light, or on the class of periodical publications
                    of less than twelve sheets.</p>
                <p>No other part of Europe enjoys advantages for education equal to Germany,
                    especially the northern parts of it. The parochial schools are so universal,
                    that none but the wilfully ignorant, or those of imperfect faculties, can be
                    strangers to reading, writing, and the first rules of arithmetic. The schools
                    for classical instruction, denominated <hi rend="italic">Gymnasiums,
                    Pedagogiums,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lyceums,</hi> are found in almost every
                    large town, and dispense learning at a very cheap rate. The universities are
                    sufficiently numerous and sufficiently endowed to provide instruction in the
                    higher branches of knowledge upon terms nearly if not altogether gratuitous.

                <p>Besides these universities, there are in almost all the capitals of every state
                    institutions for instructing pupils in the various learning of the medical,
                    clerical, legal, and military professions, and of agriculture, mining, and the
                    management of forest lands. There are also abundance of learned societies spread
                    over the whole of Germany, many of which have, in the course of years, been
                    enabled to assemble such large collections of natural and artificial curiosities
                    as afford valuable assistance to those engaged in the pursuit of knowledge.</p>
                <p>The public libraries collected in the different cities far exceed any thing that
                    has been known in other countries. These valuable collections are managed with
                    the greatest liberality; all of them are open for inspection and perusal at all
                    proper seasons; and from most of them the readers may be supplied at their own
                    residences. They thus become active and efficient fountains of knowledge. It
                    would be tiresome to give a list which should comprehend all those the number of
                    volumes in which exceed 10,000; but we shall present one of those whose volumes
                    are not less than 50,000: viz. Vienna, 550,000 volumes, including manuscripts
                    and local and temporary works; Munich, 400,000 volumes in the royal central
                    library; Göttingen, 280,000 volumes, including some thousand valuable
                    manuscripts; Dresden, 250,000 printed volumes, and 104,000 manuscripts and
                    smaller works; Wolfenbuttel, 190,000 printed volumes, 44,000 manuscripts, and
                    6000 Bibles; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520311" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0311-0488"
                    />Stutgardt, 170,000 volumes, besides 12,000 Bibles of all languages and
                    editions; Berlin,300,000volumes, in seven public libraries; Weimar, 110,000
                    volumes, and 20,000 smaller works; Prague, 110,000 volumes; Frankfort, 100,000
                    volumes, in several public libraries; Hamburg and Breslau have 100,000 each in
                    their public libraries; Mentz, 90,000; Darmstadt, 85,000; Cassel, 70,000; Gratz,
                    70,000; Gotha, 60,000; Marburg, 55,000; Jena, 50,000. The number of books in all
                    Germany, in such libraries and other institutions as are open to the public, has
                    been estimated at 5,000,000 volumes.</p>
                <p>The collections of pictures and of antiquities correspond in extent and in
                    excellence to the public libraries. The gallery of Dresden, now that the
                    pictures which were plundered by France have been sent back from the Louvre to
                    the places whence they had been taken, is the first in Europe. The collections
                    at Berlin, Brunswick, Cassel, and Augsburg, are also very fine; and many private
                    assemblages of pictures, particularly those of the Princes Liechtenstein,
                    Kaunitz, Esterhazy, and Count Schonbrun, are of the very first class. The
                    antique cabinets of Dresden, Munich, and Cassel, are filled with curiosities
                    from remote ages and distant nations; and the cabinets of natural history at
                    Vienna, Berlin, Dresden, Cassel, Manheim, Jena, Munich, and Gotha, are most
                    richly filled.</p>
                <p>The greater part of the land in Germany is held by those ancient feudal tenures
                    which formerly prevailed in every part of Europe. The possessors of the soil, of
                    whom in every state the sovereign is by far the greatest, have under them a
                    species of customary tenants called subjects (Unterthaner), who have the
                    cultivation of common fields divided into small portions, without the
                    intervention of fences. As soon as the corn is removed from the field, the lord
                    has the right of pasture; and owing to these circumstances it is impossible to
                    deviate from an ancient practice, by which the different portions of the common
                    land must be devoted to particular kinds of crops at specific periods. The
                    rotation almost universally prescribed, and known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">drey feld landwirthìhafì,</hi> consists of a fallow, succeeded by
                    two crops of grain. The fallow, however, generally bears a crop, which is
                    usually either flax, peas, or, very commonly of late, potatoes; in consequence
                    of a crop on the fallow, the land is seldom płoperly cleaned of weeds. To this
                    fallow crop generally succeeds winter corn, either wheat or rye; but, in the
                    north, the proportion of the latter to the former is as four to one, and in many
                    parts, especially in Pomerania, ten to one. In the southern states, the two
                    kinds of grain are nearly equally cultivated. To the winter corn succeeds barley
                    or oats, as the land is better adapted for the one or the other, or as may have
                    been settled between the ancestors of the present lords and their tenants in
                    remote periods. By this mode of cultivation, the earth yields but a small
                    increase. Tħe tenants can keep but little live stock, and therefore make but
                    little manure. The live stock they do keep is generally fed throughout the
                    winter with straw, and the addition recently of potatoes, with a small portion
                    of corn; and what dung they do produce is consequently of a very weak quality.
                    These tenants are commonly holders of small portions of land, which, in many
                    instances, is necessarily divided at their decease among all their children; and
                    thus the evil of the cottage system of small farms is clearly experienced. The
                    villages are crowded with little proprietors, who have not either the
                    conventional or the pecuniary power to improve the soil, who live in a state
                    inferior to labourers, and who, from the smallness of their farms, can only
                    obtain subsistence by living on the cheapest diet, which of late, as in Ireland,
                    is principally potatoes. Upon this system, the number of husbandmen increases
                    with considerable rapidity; they form soldiers, and when called out by the
                    military conscriptions of their princes, are placed in a better situation than
                    when living on their farms.</p>
                <p>In this condition of the community, the only land which can be well cuirivated is
                    the small portion of demesne which is in the hands of the lords, who, from their
                    stock of cattle, could make manure to dress and improve the soil. These demesne
                    lands are, however, though cultivated for the lords, ploughed by the tenants,
                    who are bound by their tenures to do certain stipulated work for their
                    superiors. The consequence of this is, that the work is badly performed, and at
                    such seasons as best suits the tenant’s own labour. The demesnes, too, fee) the
                    want of capital; for the lords have little besides their estates and the cattle
                    upon them, and these being too generally left to the care of managers, who are
                    less thrifty than as proprietors they would be, suffer considerably from that
                    circumstance.</p>
                <p>The foregoing sketch is a description of the practice on the far greater portion
                    of the land in Germany; and, in consequence of it, the soil, though superior in
                    original fecundity to the greater part of England, is gradually deteriorating,
                    and does not at present yield more than five eighths of what we raise upon the
                    same quantity of land. From the poorer classes eating nothing but rye or
                    potatoes, and from having three fourths of its population employed in
                    agriculture, Germany is enabled to export corn in most years; but when an
                    unpropitious season occurs the distress is dreadful, and is increased by the
                    smallness of the different states, and the power being restricted of circulating
                    grain freely from one to another; an evil which was severely felt and lamentably
                    deplored in the calamitous year 1817.</p>
                <p>The land of Germany produces but little beyond the absolute and indispensable
                    wants of its inhabitants, except in wine, flax, and wool. The culture of the
                    vine is much less attended to than in France; and wine is the production of but
                    a very small portion when compared with the whole extent of the country, whereas
                    in France almost every part yields it. The quantity made in Germany is not
                    calculated at more than about one sixth of what France supplies; the whole is
                    computed to be nearly two million pipes of one hundred gallons each; but a very
                    small part of this finds its way to foreign countries.</p>
                <p>The flax frequently forming, as before stated, the fallow crop, is important from
                    the employment it affords, during the long and cold nights of their severe
                    winter, to the female members of the peasants’ families, and from the trade it
                    creates in the export of its productions in the form of yarn or of linen
                    cloth.</p>
                <p>Wool is generally the property of the lord, and its annual clip is frequently the
                    principal revenue derived from extensive possessions. This has induced many to
                    pay great attention to the improvement of the wool, and much of it, especially
                    from Saxony, is superior to any that the Merino flocks of Spain afford. It is
                    within the few years which have elapsed since the expulsion of the French, that
                    the great extension of the breed of fine-woolled sheep has taken place. The
                    implements of husbandry are in a very imperfect state, and as much so from want
                    of information as from want of capital in Germany. The ploughs are generally
                    small, light, and without a due curvature in the mould-board. The harrows are
                    frequently of wood. That useful implement the roller is rarely seen; the waggons
                    and carts are badly constructed, and the harness of all consists either of ropes
                    or twisted straw.</p>
                <p>There are exceptions to these observations on the agriculture of Germany, but
                    they are too few to merit any particular notice.</p>
                <p>Germany is generally a manufacturing country, and can supply itself with by far
                    the greater part of all the commodities which it needs. The manufacturers of
                    that country<pb break="no" facs="nls:193520324" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0324-0489"/>
                    are not placed in different district«, but in the same towns; and in almost
                    every town of a moderate population, woollen, linen, cotton, silk, and iron
                    wares are made. Thus their establishments are mostly upon a small scale, and
                    they cannot avail themselves of those minute divisions of labour which are
                    essential to the perfecting and to the cheapness of the goods. Linens are the
                    most valuable article, and are made, from the coarse ones of Westphalia, which
                    are used for negro clothing, to the finest shirting and table linen of Silesia
                    and Saxony, and of all the intermediate qualities. Woollens of all kinds are
                    made, and are sufficient for the consumption, so that those of England and
                    France are scarcely needed; nor do the Germans allow that any foreign fine linen
                    cloth is equal, either in quality or price, to those manufactured in Saxony,
                    Silesia, and the newly acquired Prussian provinces on the Rhine, from wool of
                    native growth. The cassimeres and Vigo-nia cloths, in that last-mentioned
                    district in the towns of Eupen, Machren, and Aachen, are preferred to any which
                    are brought from other countries. The fabrics of cotton had much increased
                    during the continental system of exclusion, and had arrived at a considerable
                    degree of perfection; but the return of tranquillity has checked the progress of
                    aD, and annihilated many. The most considerable districts for these kinds of
                    goods are the kingdom of Saxony, the Prussian provinces of Juliers, Berg, and
                    Cleves, and on the banks of the Ens, in the Austrian dominions. The silk
                    manufactures have never been considerable; some goods of the kind are made in
                    many of the cities, but the principal establishments are in Vienna, at Roveredo
                    in the Tyrol, at Creveldt, at Cologne, and at Berlin. Leather, iron, steel, and
                    the wares prepared from them, are made at home. Porcelain and common earthenware
                    are well made, and the two great royal manufactories of the first at Berlin and
                    Dresden equal any from Sèvre, from Worcester, or Etruria. The glassware of
                    Bohemia, though of a very bad quality, is universally diffused, not only
                    throughout Germany, but in most other parts of the world. Paper is a
                    considerable article amongst the German manufactories. That for printing is
                    coarse, and of a bad colour, and the writing paper is very imperfectly made.
                    There are 506 mills, which deliver annually about 60,000 bales, but none of it
                    goes to other countries. Chemical preparations are made upon an extensive scale,
                    and comprehend alum, vitriol, smalts, white lead, Prussian blue, sal ammoniac,
                    and verdigris. Salt and sugar are refined for home consumption. Tobacco, snuff,
                    wax, and oils from plants, are also supplied from domestic manufactories. The
                    quantity of beer furnished by the breweries in every town in the north is very
                    great, and the distilleries of ardent spirits from grain form a most extensive
                    manufactory; vinegar is mostly prepared from grapes in those districts where
                    they do not ripen sufficiently to be made into wine. The minuter articles, such
                    as musical, mathematical, surgical, and optical instruments, with watches and
                    clocks, are well and cheaply made. Wooden toys and plaited straw are important
                    objects of employment to many of the inhabitants. Most of the fabrics of Germany
                    are fettered by the laws of the guilds, or corporations, to which the masters
                    are obliged to belong; and this acts as an impediment to their arriving at a
                    high degree of perfection.</p>
                <p>The commerce of Germany, conducted by means of shipping, centres principally in
                    the Prussian ports, or in the free cities, and may be best treated of under each
                    of them. The commerce with France, Italy, Turkey, Poland, and Russia, is by no
                    means great. The articles produced on the borders of each are too similar to
                    cause a necessity for an interchange; and the heavier articles, which are
                    produced ata distance from the respective boundaries, will, in few instances,
                    bear the expense of land carriage. The trade which is purely internal, or
                    amongst the different states, is much less than might be expected, and much less
                    than it would be if there existed less of a monopolizing spirit among the
                    cities, and less of jealousy among the several sovereigns. The greater part of
                    the internal trade consists in the sale of wines, and of foreign colonial
                    produce, which the capitalists in the cities collect and sell in smaller
                    quantities to the shops in the provincial towns.</p>
                <p>As the other independent states of Germany are separately described in this work,
                    and Baden only referred to Germany, in the alphabetical order, the following is
                    a more especial notice of it.</p>
                <p>It is a grand duchy, is bounded on the north-east by Bavaria, on the east by
                    Wurtemberg and Hohenzollern, on the south-east by the lake of Constance, on the
                    south by Switzerland, and on the west and north-west by France. It extends over
                    6008 square miles, and has been recently divided into four circles, thus:</p>

                <p>The face of the country is peculiarly striking. On the western side a most
                    fertile stripe of land is bounded by the river Rhine, from which rises that mass
                    of mountains oŋ the east known as the Black Forest, one of the peaks of which is
                    of the height of 4600 feet. In the valleys the husbandry is good and productive,
                    and the crops of hemp, madder, tobacco, poppies, beans, and potatoes, are most
                    luxuriant. Even in the mountainous parts, rye, wheat, and oats are extensively
                    cultivated, but much of the surface is covered with woods. A considerable extent
                    of pasture land supplies the duchy with good butter, meal, and some cheese. The
                    vineyards are extensive, occupying one tenth of the country, and producing
                    various kinds of excellent wine; and the gardens and orchards supply abundance
                    of fruits of the best description, and especially almonds, chestnuts, and
                    walnuts, at very cheap rates. Though not more than half the land is cultivated,
                    the supply of every agricultural product is more than sufficient for the
                    inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The mining concerns are numerous but not large, and yield commonly 5000 ounces of
                    silver, 400 quintals of copper, 2000 of lead, 320 of cobalt, and iron to the
                    extent of İOŎO tons. The mineral springs are numerous, but those of the greatest
                    celebrity in the duchy of Baden are almost exclusively resorted to by visitors
                    for health or pleasure.</p>
                <p>Baden is a manufacturing country for many articles, the value of which arises
                    almost wholly from the labour employed in their preparation. In some years
                    110,000 wooden clocks and 50,000 dozen of wooden spoons are made. These are only
                    a part of the numerous smaller kinds of ware which the ingenuity of the
                    inhabitants prepares. Besides these, there are manufactures of linen and woollen
                    goods produced, but of the coarser sorts.</p>
                <p>The reigning house has risen to its present dignity and consideration since the
                    peace ofLunevillein 1801, when its territory extended only over 1554 square
                    miles, inhabited by 210,000 people. By the treaty then made, the dominions were
                    nearly doubled, and further augmen ted by the treaty of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193520337" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0337-0490"/>Presburg in 1803; and by some
                    smaller additions at subsequent periods, it has attained its present extent. A
                    constitution has been given by the prince, by which an upper and a lower house
                    of legislators is established. The revenues amount to about L.1,000,000
                    annually; and the expenditure, including a sinking fund for the discharge of the
                    public debt, is about equal to it. Since the general peace, the debt has been
                    gradually diminished, from L.2,000,000 to its present amount, which in 1832 was
                    L. 1,300,000. The regular army consists of 8000 infantry, 1500 cavalry, and 850
                    artillery. The contingent to the German confederation is fixed at 10,000 men.
                    The three religions arc equally established, but the prince adheres to the
                    Lutheran church. The Catholics are the most numerous body, being about 800,000.
                    The Lutherans and Calvinists have united since 1821, and amount to 365,000; and
                    there are nearly 20,000 Jews. There are two universities, that of Heidelburg for
                    the Protestants, the oldest in Germany, and that at Freyburg for the Catholics.
                    The principal cities and their population are as follows:</p>
