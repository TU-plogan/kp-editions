                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">GORDIANUS</label>, an illustrious Roman senator, who claimed
                    his descent on the father’s side from the Gracchi, and on the mother’s from the
                    Emperor Trajan. He seems to have been one of the richest senators of Rome, but
                    his unambitious spirit, and his devotion to the study of literature, probably
                    saved him from a violent death and the loss of his property. He was raised to
                    the dignity ol aedile in the reign of Caracalla, and the magnificence of the
                    public shows he exhibited far surpassed any thing which Rome had ever witnessed.
                    He was twice raised to the dignity of consul, by Caracalla <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a. ð.</hi> 213, and by Alexander <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 229. His long
                    life was spent in the study of letters; nor does he seem to have taken an active
                    part in public affairs till he was named proconsul ol Africa by the senate, an
                    appointment which was highly approved of by Alexander, whose original letter on
                    the subject to the senate is still preserved. <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Aug.</hi>
                    p. 152.) When the tyrant Maximin succeeded to the throne, he appointed a
                    procurator of Africa worthy of himself, who exacted with the utmost severity the
                    taxes he himself had imposed; but being murdered by the people, they proclaimed
                    Gordian and his son emperors, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 237. At first
                    unwilling to accept the honour, he at length yielded to the pressing invitation
                    of the people. The Gordiani erected their court at Carthage, and no sooner did
                    the deputation sent by the emperors to the senate make its appearance, than that
                    body joyfully confirmed their election. Meanwhile Capelianus, governor of
                    Mauritania, marched against Carthage with such rapidity, that they were unable
                    to collect troops in sufficient numbers to op&lt; <pb break="no"

                    fell at the head of a few guards; and his father, whose reign had not exceeded
                    thirty-six days, put an end to his life on the first news of the defeat. Gordian
                    was the author of a poem, in thirty books, on the actions of Antoninus Pius and
                    Marcus Aurelius. <hi rend="italic">(Ħerodian,</hi> vii.; <hi rend="italic">Hist.
                    Aug.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Gordianus,</hi> surnamed the Pius, was grandson
                    of the elder Gordian. When the news of his grandfather’s death reached Rome, the
                    senators elected Maximus and Balbinus emperors, as best fitted to oppose the
                    threatened attack of Maximin; but the people insisted that one of the family of
                    Gordian should also be raised to the empire. This boy was only thirteen years of
                    age; and when Maximus and Balbinus fell in an insurrection of the soldiers,
                    Gordian was left as sole emperor. Having married Fabia Sabina Tranquillina, the
                    daughter of his master of rhetoric, he appointed his father-in law Micitheus
                    prefect of the praetorian guards, and through his assistance emancipated himself
                    from the hands of his mother’s eunuchs. Micitheus proved himself an able
                    minister, and discharged the military duties of his office with vigour and
                    ability. He induced the young emperor to proceed against the Persians, who had
                    invaded Mesopotamia, and during the whole of the expedition Micitheus watched
                    over the safety and discipline of the army. Micitheus, however, died, with
                    strong suspicions of having been poisoned by Philip, his successor in the
                    prefecture. A short time afterwards a sedition broke out among the soldiers,
                    which was fomented by Philip, and Gordian was killed, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.
