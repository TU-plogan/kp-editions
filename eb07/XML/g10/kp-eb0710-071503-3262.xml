                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    was descended of an ancient and honourable family, and born at Delft, in
                    Holland, on the 27th of September 1688. The name of his family was properly
                    Storm van s’Gravesande. He studied the civil law at Leyden; but the mathematics,
                    for which he had evinced an early inclination, were his favourite pursuit. When
                    he had taken his doctor’s degree in 1707, he settled at the Hague, where he
                    practised at the bar, and cultivated the acquaintance of learned men. In the
                    month of May 1713, he, in conjunction with a society of young men distinguished
                    for their acquirements, undertook the composition of a periodical review
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Littéraire,</hi> which was continued without interruption until
                    the year 1722. In 1715, 'sGravesande, in the capacity of secretary of legation,
                    accompanied the deputies of the states-general, sent to London to compliment
                    George I. on his accession to the throne; and having there formed a connection
                    with Dr Burnet, bishop of Salisbury, he was admitted a member of the Royal
                    Society. He returned the following year to the Hague, and, in 1715, was
                    appointed ordinary professor of mathematics and astronomy in the academy of
                    Leyden. During the vacations of 1721 and 1722, 'sGravesande made two journeys to
                    Cassel to visit the landgrave of Hesse, a prince who showed an enlightened taste
                    for experimental philosophy, and generously promoted its advancement. In 1724,
                    he resigned the rectorship of the academy, to which he had previously been
                    promoted, and on this occasion pronounced a discourse <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Evidentia,</hi> which has been prefixed to the third
                    edition of his Elements of Physics. In 1730, he added to his ordinary course
                    civil and military architecture, which he taught in Dutch; and, in 1734, he was
                    also appointed to teach philosophy, including logic, mewphysics, and ethics. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> sGravesande died on the 28th of February 1742, at the
                    age of fifty-five, after a period of protracted suffering, during which he
                    preserved unimpaired all his characteristic vivacity. His principal works are as
                    follow, viz. 1. Essai de Perspective, Hague, 1711; 2. Physices Elementa
                    Mathematica, experimentis confirmata, sive Introductio ad Philosophiam
                    Newtonianam, Hague, in two vols. 4to; 3. Philosophia: Newtonianae Institutiones
                    in usus academico, an abridgment of the preceding, Leyden, 1723, 1728, and 1744;
                    4. Matheseos Universalis Elementa, quibus accedunt, specimen commentarii in
                    Arithmeticam universalem Newtoni, et de determinanda forma serici infinitae
                    adsumtae Nova Regula, Leyden, 1727, in 8vo; 5. Introductio ad Philosophiam,
                    Metaphysicam et Logicam continens, Leyden, 1736, 1737. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionaire</hi><hi rend="italic">Historique</hi> of Prosper Marchand may be
                    found a detailed biography of ’ sGravesande by Allemand, the editor of the work,
                    who was intimately connected with ’ sGravesande and his family.</p>
