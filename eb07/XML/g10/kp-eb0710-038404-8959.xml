                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    laborious jurisconsult of the sixteenth century, with more erudition than taste
                    or judgment, was born in 1551 at Castello-di-San-Genesio, in the march of
                    Ancona, and studied at Perugia, where he took the degree of doctor in civil law
                    at the age of twenty-one. Soon afterwards he obtained the situation of judge in
                    the city of Ascoli; but not having it in his power to profess there in security
                    the Protestant religion, of which he was an ardent follower, he went to seek an
                    asylum in Carnio∣a, and ultimately in England. During his stay at London, where
                    he continued for several years, he lived entirely on the bounty of some generous
                    friends of the sciences. At length the Earl of Leicester, his protector,
                    procured him, in 1587, the chair of law in the university of Oxford, of which he
                    was chancellor. This place, with the appointment which Gentilis soon afterwards
                    received of perpetual advocate of the subjects of the king of Spain, in all
                    causes which they might have in England, enabled him to spend the remainder of
                    his days in comfort. He died at the commencement of the year 1611. The labours
                    of Albericüs Gentilis in jurisprudence give him but small claims to our esteem.
                    His views are often erroneous, and the sound doctrines which may be found in his
                    works are buried in a mass of citations without end, from the philo-gophers<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193518972" xml:id="kp-eb0710-8972-0385"/>, fathers, poets,
                    historians, and jurisconsults. This enormous erudition betrayed him into
                    inconsistencies in matters of importance; and hence has Bayle reproached , him
                    with having indirectly sanctioned Catholic opinions on some controverted points,
                    although he was otherwise a zealous Protestant. But his treatises on the law of
                    nations have rendered his name worthy of a place in the history of
                    jurisprudence. His book <hi rend="italic">De Jure Belli</hi> contains excellent
                    views on a science which Aristotle and Cicero have not even touched on; and if
                    the author has not sufficiently fathomed his subject, and too frequently decided
                    by the precepts of religion and morality questions which are purely political,
                    he has at least the merit of having furnished abundant materials toGrotius, who
                    knew better how to use them. An exact list of his works may be found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> of Niceron (tomes xv. and xx.); but it may be
                    sufficient here to indicate the following: 1. Liber Conditionum, Wittemberg,
                    1580, 8vo; 2. De Juris Interpretibus dialogi sex, London, 4to; 3. De injustitia

                    1604 and 1605, 8vo; 8. De Linguarum mixtura disputatio parergica, Hanau, 1604,

                    note, left his native country that he might openly profess the Protestant
                    religion. He obtained the professorship of Roman law at Altorf, through the
                    influence of Hugues Doneau, in which situation he soon distinguished himself by
                    his success as a teacher, combining considerable learning with a brilliant
                    imagination, and a ready elocution. He died of a dysentery, on the 6th of August
                    1616, leaving several works, amongst which may be mentioned, 1. De Donationibus
                    inter virum et uxorem libri iv. Frankfort, 1604, in 4to; 2. De Erroribus
                    Testamentorum a Testatoribus ipsis commissis, et de dividuis et individuis
                    obligationibus, Strasburg, 1699, in 8vo.</p>
