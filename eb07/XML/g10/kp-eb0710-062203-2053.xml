                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p>I.— 77∕β <hi rend="italic">End of Government, viz. the Good or Benefit for the
                    sake of which it exists.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> question with respect
                    to Government is a question about the adaptation of means to an end.
                    Notwithstanding the portion of discourse which has been bestowed upon this
                    subject, it is surprising to find, on a close inspection, how few of its
                    principles are settled. The reason is, that the ends and means have not been
                    analysed; and it is only a general and undistinguishing conception of them which
                    is found in the minds of the greatest number of men. Things, in this situation,
                    give rise to interminable disputes; more especially when the deliberation is
                    subject, as here, to the strongest action of personal interest.</p>
                <p>In a discourse limited as the present, it would be obviously vain to attempt the
                    accomplishment of such a task as that of the analysis we have mentioned. The
                    mode, however, in which the operation should be conducted, may perhaps be
                    described, and evidence enough exhibited to show in what road we must travel, to
                    approach the goal at which so many have vainly endeavoured to arrive.</p>
                <p>The end of Government has been described in a great variety of expressions. By
                    Locke it was said to be “the public good ;” by others it has been described as
                    being “the greatest happiness of the greatest number.” These, and equivalent
                    expressions, are just; but they are defective, inasmuch as the particular ideas
                    which they embrace are indistinctly announced; and different conceptions are by
                    means of them raised in different minds, and even in the same mind on different
                    occasions.</p>
                <p>It is immediately obvious, that a wide and difficult field is presented, and that
                    the whole science of human nature must be explored, to lay a foundation for the
                    science of Government.</p>
                <p>To understand what is included in the happiness of the greatest number, we must
                    understand what is included in the happiness of the individuals of whom it is
                    composed.</p>
                <p>That dissection of human nature which would be necessary for exhibiting, on
                    proper evidence, the primary elements into which human happiness may be
                    resolved, it is not compatible with the present design to undertake. We must
                    content ourselves with assuming certain results.</p>
                <p>We may allow, for example, in general terms, that the lot of every human being is
                    determined by his pains and pleasures; and that his happiness corresponds with
                    the degree in which his pleasures are great, and his pains are small.</p>
                <p>Human pains and pleasures are derived from two sources: they are produced either
                    by our fellow-men, or by causes independent of other men.</p>
                <p>We may assume it as another principle, that the concern of Government is with the
                    former of these two sources; that its business is to increase to the utmost the
                    pleasures, and diminish to the utmost the pains, which men derive from one
                    another.</p>
                <p>Of the laws of nature, on which the condition of man depends, that which is
                    attended with the greatest number of consequences, is the necessity of labour
                    for obtaining the means of subsistence, as well as the means of the greatest
                    part of our pleasures. This is, no doubt, the primary cause of Government; for
                    if nature had produced spontaneously all the objects which we desire, and in
                    sufficient abundance for the desires of all, there would have been no source of
                    dispute or of injury among men; nor would any man have possessed the means of
                    ever acquiring authority over another.</p>
                <p>The results are exceedingly different, when nature produces the objects of desire
                    not in sufficient abundance for all. The source of dispute is then exhaustless;
                    and every man has the means of acquiring authority over others, in proportion to
                    the quantity of those objects which he is able to possess.</p>
                <p>In this case, the end to be obtained, through Government as the means, is, to
                    make that distribution of the scanty materials of happiness which would ensure
                    the greatest sum of it in the members of the community, taken altogether;
                    preventing every individual, or combination of individuals, from interfering
                    with that distribution, or making any man to have less than bis share.</p>
                <p>When it is considered that most of the objects of desire, and even the means of
                    subsistence, are the product of labour, it is evident that the means of ensuring
                    labour must be provided for as the foundation of all.</p>
                <p>The means for the ensuring of labour are of two sorts; the one made out of the
                    matter of evil, the other made out of the matter of good.</p>
                <p>The first sort is commonly denominated force; and under its application the
                    labourers are slaves. This mode of procuring labour we need not consider; for if
                    the end of Government be to produce the greatest happiness of the greatest
                    number, that end cannot be attained by making the greatest number slaves.</p>
                <p>The other mode of obtaining labour is by allurement, or the advantage which it
                    brings. To obtain all the objects of desire in the greatest possible quantity,
                    we must obtain labour in the greatest possible quantity; and, to obtain labour
                    in the greatest possible quantity, we must raise to the greatest possible height
                    the advantage attached to labour. It is impossible to attach to labour a greater
                    degree of advantage than the whole of the product of labour. Why so? Because, if
                    you give more to one man than the produce of his labour, you can do so only by
                    taking it away from the produce of some other man’s labour. The greatest
                    possible happiness of society is, therefore, attained by ensuring to every man
                    the greatest possible quantity of the produce of his labour.</p>
                <p>How is this to be accomplished? for it is obvious that every man who has not all
                    the objects of his desire, has inducement to take them from any other man who is
                    weaker than himself: and how is he to be prevented?</p>
                <p>One mode is sufficiently obvious; and it does not appear that there is any other:
                    The union of a certain number of men, to protect one another. The object, it is
                    plain, can best be attained when a great number of men combine, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193522066" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2066-0623"/>and delegate to a small
                    number the power necessary for protecting them all. This is Government.</p>
                <p>With respect to the end of Government, or that for the sake of which it exists,
                    it is not conceived to be necessary, on the present occasion, that the analysis
                    should be car« ried any further. What follows is an attempt to analyze the
                    means.</p>
                <p>II.— <hi rend="italic">The Means of attaining the End of Government, viz. Power,
                    and Securities against the Abuse of that Power.</hi></p>
                <p>Two things are here to be considered; the power with which the small number are
                    intrusted; and the use which they are to make of it. -</p>
                <p>With respect to the first, there is no difficulty. The elements out of which the
                    power of coercing others is fabricated, are obvious to all. Of these we shall,
                    therefore, not lengthen this article by any explanation.</p>
                <p>All the difficult questions of Government relate to the means of restraining
                    those in whose hands are lodged the powers necessary for the protection of all,
                    from making a bad use of it.</p>
                <p>Whatever would be the temptations under which individuals would lie, if there was
                    no Government, to take the objects of desire from others weaker than themselves,
                    under the same temptations the members of Government lie, to take the objects of
                    desire from the members of the community, if they are not prevented from doing
                    so. Whatever, then, are the reasons for establishing Government, the very same
                    exactly are the reasons for establishing securities, that those intrusted with
                    the powers necessary for protecting others make use of them for that purpose
                    solely, and not for the purpose of taking from the members of the community the
                    objects of desire.</p>
                <p>Ill <hi rend="italic">That die requisite Securities against the Abuse of</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Power are not found in any of the simple Forms of
                    Government.</hi></p>
                <p>There are three modes in which it may be supposed that the powers for the
                    protection of the community are capable of being exercised. The community may
                    undertake the protection of itself, and of its members. The powers of protection
                    may be placed in the hands of a few. And, lastly, they may be placed in the
                    hands of an individual. The Many, the Few, the One; these varieties appear to
                    exhaust the subject. It is not possible to conceive any hands, or combination of
                    hands, in which the powers of protection can be lodged, which will not fall
                    under one or other of these descriptions. And these varieties correspond to the
                    three forms of Government, the Democratical, the Aristocratical, and the
                    Monarchical.</p>
                <p>It will be necessary to look somewhat closely at each of these forms in their
                    order.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">The Democraticał.</hi> It is obviously impossible that
                    the community in a body can be present to afford protection to each of its
                    members. It must employ individuals for that purpose. Employing individuals, it
                    must choose them; it must lay down the rules under which they are to act; and it
                    must punish them, if they act in disconfor-mity to those rules. In these
                    functions are included the three great operations of Government; Administration,
                    Legislation, and Judicature. The community, to perform any of these operations,
                    must be assembled. This circumstance alone seems to form a conclusive objection
                    against the democratical form. To assemble the whole of a community as often as
                    the business of Government requires performance, would almost preclude the
                    existence of labour; hence that of property; and hence the existence of the
                    community itself.</p>
                <p>There is another objection, not less conclusive. A whole community would form a
                    numerous assembly. But all numerous assemblies are essentially incapable of
                    business. It is unnecessary to be tedious in the proof of this proposition. In
                    an assembly, every thing must be done by speaking and assenting. But where the
                    assembly is numerous, so many persons desire to speak, and feelings, by mutual
                    inflammation, become so violent, that calm and effectual deliberation is
                    impossible.</p>
                <p>It may be taken, therefore, as a position, from which there will be no dissent,
                    that a community in mass is ill adapted for the business of Government. There is
                    no principle more in conformity with the sentiments and the practice of the
                    people than this. The management of the joint affaire of any considerable body
                    of the people they never undertake for themselves. What they uniformly do is, to
                    choose a certain number of themselves to be the actors in their stead. Even in
                    the case of a common benefit club, the members choose a committee of management,
                    and content themselves with a general control.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">The Aristocratical.</hi> This term applies to all those
                    cases in which the powers of Government are held by any number of persons
                    intermediate between a single person and the majority. When the number is small,
                    it is common to call the Government an Oligarchy; when it is considerable, to
                    call it an Aristocracy. The cases are essentially the same, because the motives
                    which operate in both are the same. This is a proposition which carries, we
                    think, its own evidence along with it. We, therefore, assume it as a point which
                    will not be disputed.</p>
                <p>The source of evil is radically different in the case of aristocracy, from what
                    it is in that of democracy.</p>
                <p>The community cannot have an interest opposite to its interest. To affirm this
                    would be a contradiction in terms. The community within itself, and with respect
                    to itself, can have no sinister interest. One community may intend the evil of
                    another; never its own. This is an indubitable proposition, and one of great
                    importance. The community may act wrong from mistake. To suppose that it could
                    from design, would be to suppose that human beings can wish their own
                    misery.</p>
                <p>The circumstances from which the inaptitude of the community, as a body, for the
                    business of Government, arises, namely, the inconvenience of assembling them,
                    and the inconvenience of their numbers when assembled, do not necessarily exist
                    in the case of aristocracy. If the number of those who hold among them the
                    powers of Government is so great as to make it inconvenient to assemble them, or
                    impossible for them to deliberate calmly when assembled, this is only an
                    objection to so extended an aristocracy, and has no application to an
                    aristocracy not too numerous, when assembled, for the best exercise of
                    deliberation.</p>
                <p>The question is, whether such an aristocracy may be trusted to make that use of
                    the powers of Government which is most conducive to the end for which Government
                    exists?</p>
                <p>There may be a strong presumption that any aristocracy, monopolizing the powers
                    of Government, would not possess intellectual powers in any very high
                    perfection. Intellectual powers are the offspring of labour. But an hereditary
                    aristocracy are deprived of the strongest motives to labour. The greater part of
                    them will, therefore, be defective in those mental powers. This is one
                    objection, and an important one, though not the greatest.</p>
                <p>We have already observed, that the reason for which Government exists is, that
                    one man, if stronger than another, will take from him whatever that other
                    possesses and he desires. But if one man will do this, so will several. And if
                    powers are put into the hands of a comparatively small number, called an
                    aristocracy, powers which muke them stronger than the rest of the commu∙</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522079" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2079-0624"/>
                <p>nity, they will take from the rest of the community as much as they please of the
                    objects of desire. They will thus defeat the very end for which Government was
                    instituted. The unfitness, therefore, of an aristocracy to be intrusted with the
                    powers of Government, rests on demonstration.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="smallcaps">The Monarchical.</hi> It will be seen, and therefore
                    words to make it manifest are unnecessary, that, in most respects, the
                    monarchical form of Government agrees with the aristocratical, and is liable to
                    the same objections.</p>
                <p>If Government is founded upon this, as a law of human nature, that a man, if
                    able, will take from others any thing which they have and he desires, it is
                    sufficiently evident that when a man is called a king, it does not change his
                    nature; so that when he has got power to enable him to take from every man what
                    be pleases, he will take whatever he pleases. To suppose that he will not, is to
                    affirm that Government is unnecessary; and that human beings will abstain from
                    injuring one another of their own accord.</p>
                <p>It is very evident that this reasoning extends to every modification of the
                    smaller number. Whenever the powers of Government are placed in any hands other
                    than those of the community, whether those of one man, of a few, or of several,
                    those principles of human nature which imply that Government is at all
                    necessary, imply that those persons will make use of them to defeat the very end
                    for which Government exists.</p>
                <p>IV.— <hi rend="italic">An Objection stated, and answered.</hi></p>
                <p>One observation, however, suggests itself. Allowing, it may be said, that this
                    deduction is perfect, and the inference founded upon it indisputable, it is yet
                    true, that if there were no Government, every man would be exposed to
                    depredation from every man; but, under an aristocracy, he is exposed to it only
                    from a few; under a monarchy, only from one.</p>
                <p>This is a highly-important objection, and deserves to be minutely
                    investigated.</p>
                <p>It is sufficiently obvious, that, if every man is liable to be deprived of what
                    he possesses at the will of every man stronger than himself, the existence of
                    property is impossible; and, if the existence of property is impossible, so also
                    is that of labour, of the means of subsistence for an enlarged community, and
                    hence of the community itself. If the members of such a community are liable to
                    deprivation by only a few hundred men, the members of an aristocracy, it may not
                    be impossible to satiate that limited number with a limited portion of the
                    objects belonging to all. Allowing this view of the subject to be correct, it
                    follows, that the smaller the number of hands into which the powers of
                    Government are permitted to pass, the happier it will be for the community: that
                    an oligarchy, therefore, is better than an aristocracy, and a monarchy better
                    than either.</p>
                <p>This view of the subject deserves to be the more carefully considered, because
                    the conclusion to which it leads is the same with that which has been adopted
                    and promulgated by some of the most profound and most benevolent investigators
                    of human affairs. That Government by one man, altogether unlimited and
                    uncontrolled, is better than Government by any modification of aristocracy, is
                    the celebrated αpιmon of Mr Hobbes, and of the French <hi rend="italic"
                    >Economists,</hi> supported on reasonings which it is not easy to controvert.
                    Government by the many they with reason considered an impossibility. They
                    inferred, therefore, that, ⅛ the best° <hi rend="superscript"> ss</hi> *^ <hi

                    rend="superscript"> overnm</hi> θ∏t&gt; absolute monarchy</p>
                <p>Experience, if we look only at the outside of the facts, appears to be divided on
                    this subject. Absolute monarchy, under Neros and Caligulas, under such men as
                    emperors of Morocco and sultans of Turkey, is the scourge of human nature. On
                    the other side, the people of Denmark, tired out with the oppression of an
                    aristocracy, resolved that their king should be absolute; and, under their absol
                    ute monarch, are as well governed as any people in Europe. In Greece,
                    notwithstanding the defects of democracy, human nature ran a more brilliant
                    career than it has ever done in any other age or country.</p>
                <p>As the surface of history affords, therefore, no certain principle of decision,
                    we must go beyond the surface, and penetrate to the springs within.</p>
                <p>When it is said that one man, or a limited number of men, will soon be satiated
                    with the objects of desire, and, when they have taken from the community what
                    suffices to satiate them, will protect its members in the enjoyment of the
                    remainder, an important element of the calculation is left out. Human beings are
                    not a passive substance. If human beings, in respect to their rulers, were the
                    same as sheep in respect to their shepherd; and if the king or the aristocracy
                    were as totally exempt from all fear of resistance from the people, and all
                    chance of obtaining more obedience from severity, as the shepherd in the case of
                    the sheep, it does appear that there would be a limit to the motive for taking
                    to one’s self the objects of desire. The case will be found to be very much
                    altered when the idea is taken into the account, first, of the resistance to his
                    will which one human being n,∙by expect from another; and, secondly, of that
                    perfection in obedience which fear alone can produce.</p>
                <p>That one human being will desire to render the person and property of another
                    subservient to his pleasures, notwithstanding the pain or loss of pleasure which
                    it may occasion to that other individual, is the foundation of Government. The
                    desire of the object implies the desire of the power necessary to accomplish the
                    object. The desire, therefore, of that power which is necessary to render the
                    persons and properties of human beings subservient to our pleasures, is a grand
                    governing law of human nature.</p>
                <p>What is implied in that desire of power, and, what is the extent to which it
                    carries the actions of men, are the questions which it is necessary to resolve,
                    in order to discover the limit which nature has set to the desire on the part of
                    a king, or an aristocracy, to inflict evil upon the community for their own
                    advantage.</p>
                <p>Power is a means to an end. The end is every thing, without exception, which the
                    human being calls pleasure and the removal of pain. The grand instrument for
                    attaining what a man likes is the actions of other men. Power, in its most
                    appropriate signification, therefore, means security for the conformity between
                    the will of one man and the acts of other men. This, we presume, is not a
                    proposition which will be disputed. The master has power over his servant,
                    because when he wills him to do so and so, or, in other words, expresses a
                    desire that he would do so and so, he possesses a kind of security that the
                    actions of the man will correspond to his desire. The general commands his
                    soldiers to perform certain operations, the king commands his subjects to act in
                    a certain manner; and their power is complete or not complete, in proportion as
                    the conformity is complete or not complete between the actions willed and the
                    actions performed. The actions of other men, considered as means for the
                    attainment of the objects of our desire, are perfect or imperfect, in proportion
                    as they are or are not certainly and invariably correspondent to our will. There
                    is no limit, therefore, to the demand of security for the perfection of that
                    correspondence. A man is never satisfied with a smaller degree if he can obtain
                    a greater. And as there is no man whatsoever, whose acts, in some degree or
                    other, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522092" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2092-0625"/>in some
                    way or other, more immediately or more remotely, may not have some influence as
                    means to our ends, there is no man, the conformity of whose acts to our will we
                    would not give something to secure. The demand, therefore, of power over the
                    acts of other men is really boundless. It is boundless in two ways; boundless in
                    the number of persons to whom we would extend it, and boundless in its degree
                    over the actions of each.</p>
                <p>It would be nugatory to say, with a view to explain away this important
                    principle, that some human beings may be so remotely connected with our
                    interests as to make the desire of a conformity between our will and their
                    actions evanescent. It is quite enough to assume, what nobody will deny, that
                    our desire of that conformity is unlimited, in respect to all those men whose
                    actions can be supposed to have any influence on our pains and pleasures. With
                    respect to the rulers of a community, this at least is certain, that they have a
                    desire for the uniformity between their will and the actions of every man in the
                    community. And for our present purpose this is as wide a field as we need to
                    embrace.</p>
                <p>With respect to the community, then, we deem it an established truth, that the
                    rulers, one or a few, desire an exact conformity between their will and the acts
                    of every member of the community. It remains for us to inquire to what
                    description of acts it is the nature of this desire to give existence.</p>
                <p>There are two classes of means by which the conformity between the will of one
                    man and the acts of other men may be accomplished. The one is pleasure, the
                    other pain.</p>
                <p>With regard to securities of the pleasurable sort for obtaining a conformity
                    between one man’s will and the acts of other men, it is evident, from
                    experience, that when a man possesses a command over the objects of desire, he
                    may, by imparting those objects to other men, ensure, to a great extent,
                    conformity between his will and their actions. It follows, and is also matter of
                    experience, that the greater the quantity of the objects of desire which he may
                    thus impart to other men, the greater is the number of men between whose actions
                    and his own will he can ensure a conformity. As it has been demonstrated that
                    there is no limit to the number of men whose actions we desire to have
                    conformable to our will, it follows, with equal evidence, that there is no limit
                    to the command which we desire to possess over the objects which ensure this
                    result.</p>
                <p>It is, therefore, not true that there is in the mind of a king, or in the minds
                    of an aristocracy, any point of saturation with the objects of desire. The
                    opinion, in examination of which we have gone through the preceding analysis,
                    that a king or an aristocracy may be satiated with the objects of desire, and,
                    after being satiated, leave to the members of the community the greater part of
                    what belongs to them, is an opinion founded upon a partial and incomplete view
                    of the laws of human nature.</p>
                <p>We have next to consider the securities of the painful sort which may be employed
                    for attaining conformity between the acts of one man and the will of
                    another.</p>
                <p>We <hi rend="italic">are of</hi> opinion, that the importance of this part of the
                    subject has not been duly considered; and that the business of government will
                    be ill understood till its numerous consequences have been fully developed.</p>
                <p>Pleasure appears to be a feeble instrument of obedience in comparison with pain.
                    It is much more easy to despise pleasure than pain. Above all, it is important
                    to consider, that in this class of instruments is included the power of taking
                    away life, and with it of taking away not only all the pleasures of reality,
                    but, what goes so far beyond them, all the pleasures of hope. This class of
                    securities is, therefore, incomparably the strongest. He who desires obedience,
                    to a high degree of exactness, cannot be satisfied with the power of giving
                    pleasure; he must have the power of inflicting pain. He who desires it to the
                    highest possible degree of exactness, must desire power of inflicting pain
                    suflicient at least to ensure that degree of exactness; that is, an unlimited
                    power of inflicting pain; for, as there is no possible mark by which to
                    distinguish what is sufficient and what is not, and as the human mind sets no
                    bounds to its avidity for the securities of what it deems eminently good, it is
                    sure to extend, beyond almost any limits, its desire of the power of giving pain
                    to others.</p>
                <p>It may, however, be said, that how inseparable a part soever of human nature it
                    may appear to be, to desire to possess unlimited power of inflicting pain upon
                    others, it does not follow, that those who possess it will have a desire to make
                    use of it.</p>
                <p>This is the next part of the inquiry upon which we have to enter; and we need not
                    add, that it merits all the attention of those who would possess correct ideas
                    upon a subject which involves the greatest interests of mankind.</p>
                <p>The chain of inference, in this case, is close and strong, to a most unusual
                    degree. A man desires that the actions of other men shall be instantly and
                    accurately correspondent to his will. He desires that the actions of the
                    greatest possible number shall be so. Terror is the grand instrument. Terror can
                    work only through assurance that evil will follow any want of conformity between
                    the will and the actions willed. Every failure must, therefore, be punished. As
                    there are no bounds to the mind’s desire of its pleasure, there are of course no
                    bounds to its desire of perfection in the instruments of that pleasure. There
                    are, therefore, no bounds to its desire of exactness in the conformity between
                    its will and the actions willed; and, by consequence, to the strength of that
                    terror which is its procuring cause. Every, the most minute failure, must be
                    visited with the heaviest infliction; and, as failure in extreme exactness must
                    frequently happen, the occasions of cruelty must be incessant.</p>
                <p>We have thus arrived at several conclusions of the highest possible importance.
                    We have seen, that the very principle of human nature upon which the necessity
                    of Government is founded, the propensity of one man to possess himself of the
                    objects of desire at the cost of another, leads on, by infallible sequence,
                    where power over a community is attained, and nothing checks, not only to that
                    degree of plunder which leaves the members (excepting always the recipients and
                    instruments of the plunder) the bare means of subsistence, but to that degree of
                    cruelty which is necessary to keep in existence the most intense terror.</p>
                <p>The world affords some decisive experiments upon human nature, in exact
                    conformity with these conclusions. An English gentleman may be taken as a
                    favourable specimen of civilization, of knowledge, of humanity, of all the
                    qualities, in short, that make human nature estimable. The degree in which he
                    desires to possess power over his fellow-creatures, and the degree of oppression
                    to which he finds motives for carrying the exercise of that power, will afford a
                    standard from which, assuredly, there can be no appeal. W'herever the same
                    motives exist, the same conduct, as that displayed by the English gentleman, may
                    be expected to follow, in all men not farther advanced in human excellence than
                    him. In the West Indies, before that vigilant attention of the English nation,
                    which, for many years before emancipation, had imposed a check upon the masters
                    of slaves, there was not a perfect absence of all check upon the dreadful
                    propensities of power. But yet it is true, that these propensities led English
                    gentlemen, not only to deprive their slaves of property, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193522105" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2105-0626"/>and to make property of their
                    fellow-creatures, but to treat them with a degree of cruelty, the very
                    description of which froze the blood of their countrymen, who were placed in
                    less unfavourable circumstances. The motives of this deplorable conduct are
                    exactly those which we have described above, as arising out of the universal
                    desire to render the actions of other men exactly conformable to our will. It is
                    of great importance to remark, that not one item in the motives which had led
                    English gentlemen to make slaves of their fellow-creatures, and to reduce them
                    to the very worst condition in which the negroes have been found in the West
                    Indies, can be shown to be wanting, or to be less strong, in the set of motives
                    which universally operate upon the men who have power over their
                    fellow-creatures. It is proved, therefore, by the closest deduction from the
                    acknowledged laws of human nature, and by direct and decisive experiments, that
                    the ruling one, or the ruling few, would, if checks did not operate in the way
                    of prevention, reduce the great mass of the people subject to their power, at
                    least to the condition of negroes in the West Indies.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An acute sense of this important truth is
                    expressed by the President Montesquieu: “c ’ est une experience etemelle, que

                    des limites.”— <hi rend="italic">Esprit de Loir,</hi> ii. 4.</p></note></p>
                <p>We have thus seen, that of the forms of Government which have been called the
                    three simple forms, not one is adequate to the ends which Government is
                    appointed to secure; that the community itself, which alone is free from motives
                    opposite to those ends, is incapacitated by its numbers from performing the
                    business of Government; and that whether Government is intrusted to one or a
                    few, they have not only motives opposite to those ends, but motives which will
                    carry them, if unchecked, to inflict the greatest evils.</p>
                <p>These conclusions are so conformable to ordinary conceptions, that it would

                    some of our subsequent investigations, to have taken any pains with the proof of
                    them. In this country at least, it will be remarked, in conformity with so many
                    writers, that the imperfection of the three simple forms of Government is
                    apparent; that the ends of Government can be attained in perfection only, as
                    under the British constitution, by an union of all the three.</p>

                <p>The doctrine of the union of the three simple forms of Government is the next
                    part of this important subject which we are called upon to examine.</p>
                <p>The first thing which it is obvious to remark upon it is, that it has been
                    customary, in regard to this part of the inquiry, to beg the question. The good
                    effects which have been ascribed to the union of the three simple forms of
                    Government, have been <hi rend="italic">supposed;</hi> and the supposition has
                    commonly been allowed. No proof has been adduced; or if any thing have the
                    appearance of proof, it is the reference to the British constitution. The
                    British constitution, it has been said, is an union of the three simple forms of
                    Government; and the British Government is excellent. To render the instance of
                    the British government in any degree a proof of the doctrine in question, it is
                    evident that three points must be established; 1st, That the British Government
                    is not i∏ show, but in substance, an union of the three simple forms; <hi
                    rend="italic">%dly,</hi> That it has peculiar excellence; and, <hi rend="italic"
                    >'idly,</hi> That its excellence arises from the union so supposed, and not from
                    any other cause· As these points have always been taken for granted without
                    examination, the question with respect to the effects of an union of the three
                    simple forms of Government may be considered as yet unsolved.</p>
                <p>The positions which we have already established with regard to human nature, and
                    which we assume as foundations, are these: That the actions of men are governed
                    by their wills, and their wills by their desires: That their desires are
                    directed to pleasure and relief from pain as <hi rend="italic">ends,</hi> and to
                    wealth and power as the principal means: That to the desire of these means there
                    is no limit; and that the actions which flow from this unlimited desire are the
                    constituents whereof bad Government is made. Reasoning correctly from these
                    acknowledged laws of human nature, we shall presently discover what opinion,
                    with respect to the mixture of the different species of Government, it will be
                    incumbent upon us to adopt.</p>
                <p>The theory in question implies, that of the powers of Government, one portion is
                    held by the king, one by the aristocracy, and one by the people. It also
                    implies, that there is on the part of each of them a certain unity of will,
                    otherwise they would not act as three separate powers. This being understood, we
                    proceed to the inquiry.</p>
                <p>From the principles which we have already laid down, it follows, that of the
                    objects of human desire—and, speaking,more definitely, of the means to the ends
                    of human desire, namely, wealth and power—each of the three parties will
                    endeavour to obtain as much as possible.</p>
                <p>After what has been said, it is not suspected that any reader will deny this
                    proposition; but it is of importance that he keep in his mind a very clear
                    conception of it.</p>
                <p>If any expedient presents itself to any of the supposed parties, effectual to
                    said end, and not opposed to any preferred object of pursuit, we may infer, with
                    certainty, that it will be adopted. One effectual expedient is not more
                    effectual than obvious. Any two of the parties, by combining, may swallow up the
                    third. That such combination will take place, appears to be as certain as any
                    thing which depends upon human will; because there are strong motives in favour
                    of it, and none that can be conceived in opposition to it. Whether the portions
                    of power, as originally distributed to the parties, be supposed to be equal or
                    unequal, the mixture of three of the kinds of Government, it is thus evident,
                    cannot possibly exist.</p>
                <p>This proposition appears to be so perfectly proved, that we do not think it
                    necessary to dwell here upon the subject. As a part, however, of this doctrine,
                    of the mixture of the simple forms of Government, it may be proper to inquire,
                    whether an union may not be possible of two of them.</p>
                <p>Three varieties of this union may be conceived; the union of the monarchy with
                    aristocracy, or the union of either with democracy.</p>
                <p>Let us first suppose that monarchy is united with aristocracy. Their power is
                    equal or not equal. If it is not equal, it follows, as a necessary consequence,
                    from the principles which we have already established, that the stronger will
                    take from the weaker, till it engrosses the whole. The only question, therefore,
                    is, What will happen when the power is equal?</p>
                <p>In the first place, it seems impossible that such equality should ever exist. How
                    is it to be established? Or by what criterion is it to be ascertained? If there
                    is no such criterion, it must, in all cases, be the result of chance. If so, the
                    chances against it are as infinite to one. The idea, therefore, is whoUy
                    chimerical and absurd.</p>
                <p>Besides, a disposition to overrate one’s own advantages, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193522118" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2118-0627"/>and underrate those of other
                    men, is a known law of human nature. Suppose, what would be little less than
                    miraculous, that equality were established, this propensity would lead each of
                    the parties to conceive itself the strongest. The consequence would be, that
                    they would go to war, and contend till one or other was subdued. Either those
                    laws of human nature, upon which all reasoning with respect to Government
                    proceeds, must be denied, and then the utility of Government itself may be
                    denied, or this conclusion is demonstrated. Again, if this equality were
                    established, is there a human being who can suppose that it would last? If any
                    thing be known about human affairs it is this, that they are in perpetual
                    change. If nothing else interfered, the difference of men in respect of talents
                    would abundantly produce the effect. Suppose your equality to be established at
                    the time when your king is a man of talents, and suppose his successor to be the
                    reverse; your equality no longer exists. The moment one of the parties is
                    superior, it begins to profit by its superiority, and the inequality is daily
                    increased. It. is unnecessary to extend the investigation to the remaining
                    cases, the union of democracy w⅛h either of the other two kinds of Government.
                    It is very evident that the same reasoning would lead to the same results.</p>
                <p>In this doctrine of the mixture of the simple forms of government is included the
                    celebrated theory of the balance among the component parts of a Government. By
                    this it is supposed, that, when a Government is composed of monarchy,
                    aristocracy, and democracy, they balance one another, and by mutual checks
                    produce good Government. A few words will suffice to show, that, if any theory
                    deserve the epithets of “wild, visionary, chimerical,” it is that of the
                    balance. If there are three powers, how is it possible to prevent two of them
                    from combining to swallow up the third ř</p>
                <p>The analysis which we have already performed, will enable us to trace rapidly the
                    concatenation of causes and effects in this imagined case.</p>
                <p>We have already seen that the interest of the community, considered in the
                    aggregate, or in the democratical point of view, is, that each individual should
                    receive protection, and that the powers which are constituted for that purpose
                    should be employed exclusively for that purpose. As this is a proposition wholly
                    indisputable, it is also one to which all correct reasoning upon matters of
                    Government must have a perpetual reference.</p>
                <p>We have also seen that the interest of the king, and of the governing
                    aristocracy, is directly the reverse; it is to have unlimited power over the
                    rest of the community, and to use it for their own advantage. In the supposed
                    case of the balance of the monarchical, aristocratical, and democratical powers,
                    it cannot be for the interest of either the monarchy or the aristocracy to
                    combine with the democracy; because it is the interest of the democracy, or
                    community at large, that neither the king nor the aristocracy should have one
                    particle of power, or one particle of the wealth of the community, for their own
                    advantage.</p>
                <p>The democracy or community have all possible motives to endeavour to prevent the
                    monarchy and aristocracy from exercising power, or obtaining the wealth of the
                    community, for their own advantage. The monarchy and aristocracy have all
                    possible motives for endeavouring to obtain unlimited power over the persons and
                    property of the community. The consequence is inevitable; they have all possible
                    motives for combining to obtain that power; and unless the people have power
                    enough to be a match for both, they have no protection. The balance, therefore,
                    is a thing, the existence of which, upon the best possible evidence, is to be
                    regarded as impossible. The appearances which have given colour to the
                    supposition are altogether delusive.</p>
                <p>VI.— <hi rend="italic">In the Representative System atone the Securities for good
                    Government are</hi><hi rend="italic">to be</hi><hi rend="italic">found.</hi></p>
                <p>What then is to be done? For, according to this reasoning, we may be told that
                    good Government appears to be impossible. The people, as a body, cannot perform
                    the business of Government for themselves. If the powers of Government are
                    intrusted to one man, or a few men, and a monarchy, or governing aristocracy, is
                    formed, the results are fatal; and it appears that a combination of the simple
                    forms is impossible.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the truth of these propositions, it is not yet proved that good
                    Government is impossible. For though the people, who cannot exercise the powers
                    of Government themselves, must intrust them to some one individual or set of
                    individuals, and such individuals will infallibly have the strongest motives to
                    make a bad use of them, it is possible that checks may be found sufficient to
                    prevent them. The next subject of inquiry, then, is the doctrine of checks. It
                    is sufficiently conformable to the established and fashionable opinions to say,
                    that, upon the right constitution of checks, all goodness of Government depends.
                    To this proposition we fully subscribe. Nothing, therefore, can exceed the
                    importance of correct conclusions upon this subject. After the developments
                    already made, it is hoped that the inquiry will be neither intricate nor
                    unsatisfactory.</p>
                <p>In the grand discovery of modern times, the system of representation, the
                    solution of all the difficulties, both speculative and practical, will perhaps
                    be found. If it cannot, we seem to be forced upon the extraordinary conclusion,
                    that good Government is impossible. For as there is no individual, or
                    combination of individuals, except the community itself, who would not have an
                    interest in bad Government, if intrusted with its powers; and as the community
                    itself is incapable of exercising those powers, and must intrust them to some
                    individual or combination of individuals, the conclusion is obvious. The
                    community itself must check those individuals, else they will follow their
                    interest, and produce bad Government.</p>
                <p>But how is it the community can check? The community can act only when assembled;
                    and then it is incapable of acting.</p>
                <p>The community, however, can choose representatives, and the question is, whether
                    the representatives of the community can operate as a check ř</p>
                <p>VII <hi rend="italic">What is required in a Representative Body, to make</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">it a security for good Government ĩ</hi></p>
                <p>We may begin by laying down two propositions, which appear to involve a great
                    portion of the inquiry; and about which it is unlikely that there will be any
                    dispute.</p>
                <p>I. The checking body must have a degree of power sufficient for the business of
                    checking.</p>
                <p>II. It must have an identity of interest with the community; otherwise it will
                    make a mischievous use of its power.</p>
                <p>I.· To measure the degree of power which is requisite upon any occasion, we must
                    consider the degree of power which is necessary to be overcome. Just as much as
                    suffices for that purpose is requisite, and no more. We have then to inquire
                    what power it is which the representatives of the community, acting as a check,
                    need power to overcome. The answer here is easily given. It is all that power,
                    wheresoever lodged, which they, in whose hands it is lodged, have an interest in
                    misusing. We have already seen, that to whomsoever the community intrusts the
                    powers of Government, whether one, or a few, they have an interest in misusing
                    them. All the power, therefore, which the one or the few, or which the one and
                    the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522131" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2131-0628"/>few
                    combined, can apply to ensure the accomplishment of their sinister ends, the
                    checking body must have power to overcome, otherwise its check will be
                    unavailing. In other words, there will be no check.</p>
                <p>This is so exceedingly evident, that we hardly think it necessary to say another
                    word in illustration of it. If a king is prompted by the inherent principles of
                    human nature to seek the gratification of his will; and if he finds an obstacle
                    in that pursuit, he removes it, of course, if he can. If any man, or any set of
                    men, oppose him, he overcomes them, if he is able; and to prevent him, they
                    must, at the least, have equal power with himself.</p>
                <p>The same is the case with an aristocracy. To oppose them with success in pursuing
                    their interest at the expense of the community, the checking body must have
                    power successfully to resist whatever power they possess. If there is both a
                    king and an aristocracy, and if they would combine to put down the checking
                    force, and to pursue their mutual interest at the expense of the community, the
                    checking body must have sufficient power successfully to resist the united power
                    of both king and aristocracy.</p>
                <p>These conclusions are not only indisputable, but the very theory of the British
                    constitution is erected upon them. The House of Commons, according to that
                    theory, is the checking body. It is also an admitted doctrine, that if the king
                    had the power of bearing down any opposition to his will that could be made by
                    the House of Commons, or if the king and the House of Lords combined had the
                    power of bearing down its opposition to their joint will, it would cease to have
                    the power of checking them: it must, therefore, have a power sufficient to
                    overcome the united power of both.</p>
                <p>II. All the questions which relate to the degree of power necessary to be given
                    to that checking body, on the perfection of whose operations all the goodness of
                    Government depends, are thus pretty easily solved. The grand difficulty consists
                    in finding the means of constituting a checking body, whose powers shall not be
                    turned against the community for whose protection it is created.</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that if power is granted to a body of men called
                    representatives, they, like any other men, will use their power, not for the
                    advantage of the community, but for their own advantage, if they can. The only
                    question is, therefore, how they can be prevented? in other words, how are the
                    interests of the representatives to be identified with those of the
                    community?</p>
                <p>Each representative may be considered in two capacities; in his capacity of
                    representative, in which he has the exercise of power oyer others; and in his
                    capacity of member of the community, in which others have the exercise of power
                    over him.</p>
                <p>If things were so arranged, that, in his capacity of representative, it would be
                    impossible for him to do himself so much good by misgovernment, as he would do
                    himself harm in his capacity of member of the community, the object would be
                    accomplished. We have already seen, that the amount of power assigned to the
                    checking body cannot be diminished beyond a certain amount. It must be
                    sufficient to overcome all resistance on the part of all <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>this, then, is the instrument; lessening of duration is the instrument by wh ch,
                    if by any thing, the object is to be attained. The smaller the period of time
                    during which <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> “y™J <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi>
                    retains his capacity of representative, as compared with the time in which he is
                    simply a member of the community the more difficult it will be to compensate the
                    sacrifice of the interests of the longer period, by the profits of misgovernment
                    during the shorter.</p>
                <p>This is an old and approved method of identifying as nearly as possible the
                    interests of those who rule with the interests of those who are ruled. It is in
                    pursuance of this advantage that the members of the British House of Commons
                    have always been chosen for a limited period. If the members were hereditary, or
                    even if they were chosen for life, every inquirer would immediately pronounce
                    that they would employ, for their own advantage, the powers intrusted to them;
                    and that they would <hi rend="italic">go</hi> just as far in abusing the persons
                    and properties of the people, as their estimate of the powers and spirit of the
                    people to resist them would allow them to contemplate as safe.</p>
                <p>As it thus appears, by the consent of all men, from the time when the Romans made
                    their consuls annual, down to the present day, that the end is to be attained by
                    limiting the duration, either of the acting, or (which is better) of the
                    checking power, the next question is, to what degree should the limitation
                    proceed?</p>
                <p>The general answer is plain. It should proceed, till met by overbalancing
                    inconveniences on the other side. What then are the inconveniences which are
                    likely to flow from a too limited duration?</p>
                <p>They are of two sorts; those which affect the performance of the service for
                    which the individuals are chosen, and those which arise from the trouble of
                    election. It is sufficiently obvious, that the business of Government requires
                    time to perform it. The matter must be proposed, deliberated upon, a resolution
                    must be taken and executed. If the powers of Government were to be shifted from
                    one set of hands to another every day, the business of Government could not
                    proceed. Two conclusions, then, we may adopt with perfect certainty; that
                    whatsoever time is necessary to perform the periodical round of the stated
                    operations of Government, this should be allotted to those who are invested with
                    the checking powers; and, secondly, that no time which is not necessary for that
                    purpose should by any means be allotted to them. With respect to the
                    inconvenience arising from frequency of election, though it is evident that the
                    trouble of election, which is always something, should not be repeated oftener
                    than is necessary, no great allowance will need to be made for it, because it
                    may easily be reduced to an inconsiderable amount.</p>
                <p>As it thus appears that limiting the duration of their power is a security
                    against the sinister interest of the people’s representatives, so it appears
                    that it is the only security of which the nature of the case admits. The only
                    other means which could be employed to that end would be punishment on account
                    of abuse. It is easy, however, to see that punishment could not be effectually
                    applied. In order to punishment, definition is required of the punishable acts;
                    and proof must be established of the commission. But abuses of power may be
                    carried to a great extent, without allowing the means of proving a determinate
                    offence. No part of political experience is more perfect than this.</p>
                <p>If the limiting of duration be the only security, it is unnecessary to speak of
                    the importance which ought to be attached to it.</p>
                <p>In the principle of limiting the duration of the power delegated to the
                    representatives of the people, is not included the idea of changing them. The
                    same individual may be chosen any number of times. The check of the short period
                    for which he is chosen, and during which he can promote his sinister interest,
                    is the same upon the man who has been chosen and re-chosen twenty times, as upon
                    the man who has been chosen for the first time. And there is good reason for
                    always re-electing the man who has done his duty, because the longer he serves,
                    the better acquainted he becomes with the business of the service. Upon this <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193522144" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2144-0629"/> principle of
                    re-choosing, or of the permanency of the individual, united with the power of
                    change, has been recommended the plan of permanent service with perpetual power
                    of removal. This, it has been said, reduces the period within which the
                    representative can promote his sinister interest, to the narrowest possible
                    limits; because the moment when his constituents begin to suspect him, that
                    moment they may turn him out. On the other hand, if he continues faithful, the
                    trouble of election is performed once for all, and the man serves as long as he
                    lives. Some disadvantages, on the other hand, would accompany this plan. The
                    present, however, is not the occasion on which the balance of different plans is
                    capable of being settled</p>
                <p>VΠI <hi rend="italic">What is required in the Elective Body, to secure
                    the</hi><hi rend="italic">requisite Properties in the Representative
                    Body.</hi></p>
                <p>Having considered the means which are capable of being employed for identifying
                    the interest of the representatives when chosen, with that of the persons who
                    choose them, it remains that we endeavour to bring to view the principles which
                    ought to guide in determining who the persons are by whom the act of choosing
                    ought to be performed.</p>
                <p>It is most evident that upon this question every thing depends. It can be of no
                    consequence to ensure, by shortness of duration, a conformity between the
                    conduct of the representatives and the will of those who appoint them, if those
                    who appoint them have an interest opposite to that of the community; because
                    those who choose will, according to the principles of human nature, make choice
                    of such persons as will act according to their wishes. As this is a direct
                    inference from the very principle on which Government itself is founded, we
                    assume it as indisputable.</p>
                <p>We have seen already, that if one man has power over others placed in his hands,
                    he will make use of it for an evil purpose, for the purpose of rendering those
                    other men the abject instruments of his will. If we, then, suppose that one man
                    has the power of choosing the representatives of the people, it follows that he
                    will choose men who will use their power as representatives for the promotion of
                    this his sinister interest.</p>
                <p>We have likewise seen, that when a few men have power given them over others,
                    they will make use of it exactly for the same ends, and to the same extent, as
                    the one man. It equally follows, that if a small number of men have the choice
                    of the representatives, such representatives will be chosen as will promote the
                    interests of that small number, by reducing, if possible, the rest of the
                    community to be the abject and helpless slaves of their will.</p>
                <p>In all these cases it is obvious and indisputable, that all the benefits of the
                    representative system are lost. The representative system is, in that case, only
                    an operose and clumsy machinery for doing that which might as well be done
                    without it; reducing the community to subjection under the one or the few.</p>
                <p>When we say the few, it is seen that in this case it is of no importance whether
                    we mean a few hundreds or a few thousands, or even many thousands. The operation
                    of the sinister interest is the same; and the fate is the same of all that part
                    of the community over whom the power is exercised. A numerous aristocracy has
                    never been found to be less oppressive than an aristocracy confined to a
                    few.</p>
                <p>The general conclusion, therefore, which is evidently established, is this; that
                    the benefits of the representative system are lost, in all cases in which the
                    interests of the choosing body are not the same with those of the community.</p>
                <p>It is very evident, that if the community itself were the choosing body, the
                    interest of the community and that of the choosing body would be the same. The
                    question is, whether that of any portion of the ∞mmunity, if erected into the
                    choosing body, would remain the same?</p>
                <p>One thing is pretty clear, that all those individuals whose interests are
                    indisputably included in those of other individuals, may be struck off without
                    inconvenience. In this light may be viewed all children up to a certain age,
                    whose interests are involved in those of their parents. In this light also women
                    may be regarded, the interest of almost all of whom is involved either in that
                    of their fathers or in that of their husbands.</p>
                <p>Having ascertained that an interest identical with that of the whole community is
                    to be found in the aggregate males of an age to be regarded as sui <hi
                    rend="italic">juris,</hi> who may be deemed the natural representatives of the
                    whole population, we have to go on and inquire whether this requisite quality
                    may not be found in some less number, some aliquot part of that body.</p>
                <p>As degrees of mental qualities are not easily ascertained, outward and visible
                    signs must be taken to distinguish, for this purpose, one part of these males
                    from another. Applicable signs of this description appear to be three; years,
                    property, profession or mode of life.</p>
                <p>According to the first of these means of distinction, a portion of the males, to
                    any degree limited, may be taken, by prescribing an advanced period of life at
                    which the power of voting for a representative should commence. According to the
                    second, the elective body may be limited, by allowing a vote to those only who
                    possess a certain amount of property or of income. According to the third, they
                    may be limited, by allowing a vote only to such persons as belong to certain
                    professions, or certain connexions and interests. What we have to inquire is, if
                    the interest of the number, limited and set apart, upon any of those principles,
                    as the organ of choice for a body of representatives, will be the same with the
                    interest of the community?</p>
                <p>With respect to the first principle of selection, that of age, it would appear
                    that a considerable latitude may be taken without inconvenience. Suppose the age
                    of forty were prescribed as that at which the right of suffrage should commence,
                    scarcely any laws could be made for the benefit of all the men of forty, which
                    would not be laws for the benefit of all the rest of the community.</p>
                <p>The great principle of security here is, that the men of forty have a deep
                    interest in the welfare of the younger men; for otherwise it might be objected
                    with perfect truth, that if decisive power were placed in the hands of men of
                    forty years of age, they would have an interest, just as any other detached
                    portion of the community, in pursuing that career which we have already
                    described, for reducing the rest of the community to the state of abject slaves.
                    But the great majority of old men have sons, whose interest they regard as an
                    essential part .of their own. This is a law of human nature. There is,
                    therefore, no great danger that, in such an arrangement as this, the interests
                    of the young would be greatly sacrificed to those of the old.</p>
                <p>We come next to the inquiry, whether the interest of a body of electors,
                    constituted by the possession of a certain amount of property or income, would
                    be the same with the interest of the community?</p>
                <p>It will not be disputed, that, if the qualification were raised so high that only
                    a few hundreds possessed it, the case would be exactly the same with that of the
                    consign, ment of the electoral suffrage to an aristocracy. This we have already
                    considered, and have seen that it differs in form rather than substance from a
                    simple aristocracy. We have likewise seen, that it alters not the case in regard
                    to the community, whether the aristocracy be some hundreds or some thousands.
                    One thing is, therefore, completely ascertained, that a pecuniary qualification,
                    unless <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522157" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2157-0630"/>it were
                    very low, would only create an aristocratical government, and produce all the
                    evils which we have shown to belong to that organ of misrule.</p>
                <p>This question, however, deserves to be a little more minutely considered. Let us
                    next take the opposite extreme. Let us suppose that the qualification is very
                    low, so low as to include the great majority of the people. It would not be easy
                    for the people who have very little property, to separate their interests from
                    those of the people who have none. It is not the interest of those who have
                    little property to give undue advantages to the possession of property, which
                    those who have the great portions of it would turn against themselves.</p>
                <p>It may, therefore, be said, that there would be no evil in a low qualification.
                    It can hardly be said, however, on the other hand, that there would be any good;
                    for if the whole mass of the people who have some property would make a good
                    choice, it will hardly be pretended that, added to them, the comparatively small
                    number of those who have none, and whose minds are naturally and almost
                    necessarily governed by the minds of those who have, would be able to make the
                    choice a bad one.</p>
                <p>We have ascertained, therefore, two points. We have ascertained that a very low
                    qualification is of no use, as affording no security for a good choice, beyond
                    that which would exist if no pecuniary qualification was required. We have
                    likewise ascertained, that a qualification so high as to constitute an
                    aristocracy of wealth, though it were a very numerous one, would leave the
                    community without protection, and exposed to all the evils of unbridled power.
                    The only question, therefore, is, whether, between these extremes, there is any
                    qualification which would remove the right of suffrage from the people of small,
                    or of no property, and yet constitute an elective body, the interest of which
                    would be identical with that of the community?</p>
                <p>ft is not easy to find any satisfactory principle to guide us in our researches,
                    and to tell us where we should fix. The qualification must either be such as to
                    embrace the majority of the population, or some thing less than the majority.
                    Suppose, in the first place, that it embraces the majority, the question is,
                    whether the majority would have an interest in oppressing those who, upon this
                    supposition, would be deprived of political power? If we reduce the calculation
                    to its elements, we shall see that the interest which they would have, of this
                    deplorable kind, though it would be something, would not be very great. Each man
                    of the majority, if the majority were constituted the governing body, would have
                    something less than the benefit of oppressing a single man. If the majority were
                    twice as great as the minority, each man of the majority would only have one
                    half the benefit of oppressing.a single man. In that case, the benefits of good
                    government, accruing to all, might be expected to overbalance to the several
                    members of such an elective body the benefits of misrule peculiar to themselves.
                    Good Government would, therefore, have a tolerable security. Suppose, in the
                    second place, that the qualification did not admit a body of electors so large
                    as the majority; in that case, taking again the calculation in its elements, we
                    shall see that each man would have a benefit equal to that derived from the
                    oppression of more than one man; and that, in proportion as the elective body
                    constituted a smaller and smaller minority, the benefit of misrule to the
                    elective body would be increased, and bad Government would be ensured.</p>
                <p>It seems hardly necessary to carry the analysis of the pecuniary qualification,
                    as the principle for choosing an elective body, any farther.</p>
                <p>We have only remaining the third plan for constituting an elective body.
                    According to the scheme in question, the best elective body is that which
                    consists of certain classes, professions, or fraternities. The notion is, that
                    when these fraternities or bodies are represented, the community itself is
                    represented. The way in which, according to the patrons of this theory, the
                    effect is brought about, is this. Though it is perfectly true that each of these
                    fraternities would profit by misrule, and have the strongest interest in
                    promoting it; yet, if three or four such fraternities are appointed to act in
                    conjunction, they will not profit by misrule, and will have an interest in
                    nothing but good Government.</p>
                <p>This theory of representation we shall not attempt to trace farther back than the
                    year 1793. In the debate on the motion of Mr, afterwards Earl Grey, for a reform
                    in the system of representation, on the 6th of May of that year, Mr Jenkinson,
                    afterwards Earl of Liverpool, brought forward this theory of representation, and
                    urged it in opposition to all idea of reform in the British House of Commons, in
                    terms.as clear and distinct as those in which it has since been clothed by other
                    leading men on both sides of that House. We shall transcribe the passage from
                    the speech of the latter, omitting, for the sake of abbreviation, all those
                    expressions which are unnecessary for conveying a knowledge of the plan, and of
                    the reasons upon which it was founded.</p>
                <p>“Supposing it agreed,” he said, “that the House of Commons is meant to be a
                    legislative body, representing all descriptions of men in the country, he
                    supposed every person would agree that the landed interest ought to have the
                    preponderant weight. The landed interest was, in fact, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >stamina</hi> of the country. In the second place, in a commercial country like
                    this, the manufacturing and commercial interest oughţ to have a considerable
                    weight, secondary to the landed interest, but secondary to the landed interest
                    only. But was this all that was necessary? There were other descriptions of
                    people, which, to distinguish them from those already mentioned, he should style
                    professional people, and whom he considered as absolutely necessary to the
                    composition of a House of Commons. By professional people, he meant those
                    members of the House of Commons who wished to raise themselves to the great
                    offices of the state; those that were in the army, those that were in the navy,
                    those that were in the law.” He then, as a reason for desiring to have those
                    whom he calls <hi rend="superscript"> ,r</hi> professional people” in the
                    composition of the House of Commons, gives it as a fact, that country gentlemen
                    and merchants seldom desire, and seldom have motives for desiring, to be
                    ministers and other great officers of state. These ministers and officers,
                    however, ought to be made out of the House of Commons. Therefore, you ought to
                    have “professional people” of whom to make them. Nor was this all. “There was
                    anothor reason why these persons were absolutely necessary. We were constantly
                    in the habit of discussing in that house all the important concerns of the
                    state. It was necessary, therefore, that there should be persons in the practice
                    of debating such questions.” “There was a third reason, which, to lus mind, was
                    stronger than all the rest. -Suppose that in that house there were only country
                    gentlemen; they would not then be the representatives of the nation, but of the
                    landholders. Suppose there were in that house only commercial persons; they
                    would not be the representatives of the nation, but of the commercial interests
                    of the nation. Suppose the landed and commercial interest could both find their
                    way into the house; the landed interest would be able, if it had nothing but the
                    commercial interest to combat with, to prevent that interest from having its due
                    weight in the constitution. All descriptions of persons in the country would
                    thus, in fact, be at the mercy of the landholders.” He adds, “the professional
                    persons are, then, what makes this house the representatives of the people. They
                    have collectively no <hi rend="italic">esprit de corps,</hi> and prevent an; <hi
                    rend="italic">espnt de corps</hi> from affecting the proceedings of the house
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522170" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2170-0631"/>Neither the
                    landed nor commercial interest can materially affect each other; and the
                    interests of the different professions of the country are fairly considered. The
                    honourable gentleman (Mr Grey), and the petition on this table, rather proposed
                    uniformity of election. His ideas were the reverse—that the modes of election
                    ought to be as varied as possible; because, if there was but one mode of
                    election, there would, generally speaking, be but one description of persons in
                    that house; and by a varied mode of election only could that variety be
                    secured.”</p>
                <p>There is great vagueness undoubtedly in the language here employed, and abundant
                    wavering and uncertainty in the ideas. But the ideas regarding this theory
                    appear in the same half-formed state in every speech and writing in which we
                    have seen it adduced. The mist, indeed, by which it has been kept surrounded
                    alone creates the difficulty; because it cannot be known precisely how any thing
                    is good or bad till it is precisely known what it is.</p>
                <p>According to the ideas of Lord Liverpool, the landholders ought to be
                    represented; the merchants and manufacturers ought to be represented; the
                    officers of the army and navy ought to be represented; and the practitioners of
                    the law ought to be represented. Other patrons of the scheme have added, that
                    literary men ought to be represented. And these, we believe, are almost all the
                    fraternities which have been named for this purpose by any of the advocates of
                    representation by clubs. To ensure the choice of representatives of the
                    landholders, landholders.must be the choosers; to ensure the choice of
                    representatives of the merchants and manufacturers, merchants and manufacturers
                    must be the choosers; and so with respect to the other fraternities, whether few
                    or many. Thus it must be at least in <hi rend="italic">substance,</hi> whatever
                    the <hi rend="italic">form</hi> under which the visible acts may be performed.
                    According to the scheme in question, these several fraternities are represented
                    <hi rend="italic">directly</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the rest of the
                    community is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> represented directly; but it will be
                    said by the patrons of that scheme, that it is represented <hi rend="italic"
                    >virtually,</hi> which, in this case, answers the same purpose.</p>
                <p>From what has already been ascertained, it will appear certain, that each of
                    these fraternities has its sinister interest, and will be led to seek the
                    benefit of misrule, if it is able to obtain it. This is frankly and distinctly
                    avowed by Lord Liverpool; and by those by whom it is not avowed, it seems
                    impossible to suppose that it should be disputed.</p>
                <p>Let us now, then, observe the very principle upon which this theory must be
                    supported. Three, or four, or five, or more clubs of men, have unlimited power
                    over the whole community put into their hands. These clubs have, each and all of
                    them, an interest, an interest the same with that which governs all other
                    rulers, in misgovernment, in converting the persons and properties of the rest
                    of the community wholly to their own benefit Having this interest, says the
                    theory, they will not make use of it, but will use all their powers for the
                    benefit of the community. Unless this proposition can be supported, the theory
                    is one of the shallowest by which the pretenders to political wisdom have ever
                    exposed themselves.</p>
                <p>Let us resume the proposition. Three, or four, or five fraternities of men,
                    composing a small part of the community, have all the powers of Government
                    placed in their hands. If they oppose and contend with one another, they will be
                    unable to convert these powers to their own benefit. If they agree, they will be
                    able to convert them wholly to their own benefit, and to do with the rest of the
                    community just what they please. The patrons of this system of representation
                    assume, that these fraternities will be sure to take that course which is <hi
                    rend="italic">contrary</hi> to their interest. The course which is <hi
                    rend="italic">according</hi> to their interest, appears as if it had never
                    presented itself to their imaginations.</p>
                <p>There being -two courses which the clubs may pursue, one contrary to their
                    interest, the other agreeable to it, the patrons of the club system must prove,
                    they must place it beyond all doubt, that the clubs will follow the first
                    course, and not follow the secont; if not, the world will laugh at a theory
                    which is founded upon a direct contradiction of one of the fundamental
                    principles of human nature.</p>
                <p>In supposing that clubs or societies of men are governed, like men individually,
                    by their interests, we are surely following a pretty complete experience. In the
                    idea that a certain number of those clubs can unite to pursue a common interest,
                    there is surely nothing more extraordinary, than that as many individuals should
                    unite to pursue a common interest. Lord Liverpool talks of an <hi rend="italic"
                    >esprit de corps</hi> belonging to a class of landholders, made up of the
                    different bodies of landholders in every county in the kingdom. He talks of an
                    <hi rend="italic">esprit de corps</hi> in a class of merchants and
                    manufacturers, made up of the different bodies of merchants and manufacturers in
                    the several great towns and manufacturing districts in the kingdom. What, then,
                    is meant by an <hi rend="italic">esprit de carps ĩ</hi> Nothing else but a union
                    for the pursuit of a common interest. To the several clubs supposed in the
                    present theory, a common interest is created by the very circumstance of their
                    composing the representing and represented bodies. Unless the patrons of this
                    theory can prove to us, contrary to all experience, that a common interest
                    cannot create an <hi rend="italic">esprit de corps</hi> in men in combinations,
                    as well as in men individually, we are under the necessity of believing, that an
                    <hi rend="italic">esprit de carps</hi> would be formed in the classes separated
                    from the rest of the community for the purposes of representation; that they
                    would pursue their common interest; and inflict all the evils upon the rest of
                    the community to which the pursuit of that interest would lead.</p>
                <p>It is not included in the idea of this union for the pursuit of a common
                    interest, that the clubs or sets of persons appropriated to the business of
                    representation should totally harmonise. There would, no doubt, be a great
                    mixture of agreement and disagreement among them. But there would, if experience
                    is any guide, or if the general laws of human nature have any power, be
                    sufficient agreement to prevent their losing sight of the common interest; in
                    other words, for ensuring all that abuse of power which is useful to the parties
                    by whom it is exercised.</p>
                <p>The real effect of this motley representation, therefore, would only be to create
                    a motley aristocracy; and, of course, to ensure that kind of misgovernment which
                    it is the nature of aristocracy to produce, and to produce equally, whether it
                    is a uniform or a variegated aristocracy; whether an aristocracy all of
                    landowners; or an aristocracy in part landowners, in part merchants and
                    manufacturers, in part officers of the army and navy, and in part lawyers.</p>
                <p>We have now, therefore, examined the principles of the representative system, and
                    have found in it all that is necessary to constitute a security for good
                    Government We have seen in what manner it is possible to prevent in the
                    representatives the rise of an interest different from that of the parties who
                    choose them, namely, by giving them little time, not dependent upon the will of
                    those parties. We have likewise seen in what manner identity of interest may be
                    ensured between the electoral body and the rest of the community. We have,
                    therefore, discovered the means by which identity of interest may be ensured
                    between the representatives and the community at large. We have, by consequence,
                    obtained an organ of Government which possesses that quality, without which
                    there can be no good Government.</p>

                <p>IX.— <hi rend="italic">First Objection: That a perfect Representative
                    Sys-</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> t</hi><hi rend="italic">tern, if
                    established, would destroy the Monarchy and the</hi><hi rend="italic">House of
                    Lords.</hi></p>
                <p>The question remains, whether this organ is competent to the performance of the
                    whole of the business of Government? And it may be certainly answered, that it
                    is not. It may be competent to the making of laws, and it may watch over their
                    execution: but to the executive functions themselves, operations in detail, to
                    be performed by individuals, it is manifestly not competent. The executive
                    functions of Government consist of two parts, the administrative and the
                    judicial. The administrative, in this country, belong to the king; and it will
                    appear indubitable, that, if the best mode of disposing of the administrative
                    powers of government be to place them in the hands of one great functionary, not
                    elective, but hereditary; a king, such as ours, instead of being inconsistent
                    with the representative system, in its highest state of perfection, would be an
                    indispensable branch of a good Government; and, even if it did not previously
                    exist, would be established by a representative body whose interests were
                    identified, as above, with those of the nation.</p>
                <p>The same reasoning will apply exactly to our House of Lords. Suppose it true,
                    that, for the perfect performance of the business of legislation, and of
                    watching over the execution of the laws, a second deliberative assembly is
                    necessary; and that an assembly, such as the British House of Lords, composed of
                    the proprietors of the greatest landed estates, with dignities and privileges,
                    is the best adapted to the end: it follows, that a body of representatives,
                    whose interests were identified with those of the nation, would establish such
                    an assembly, if it did not previously exist: for the best of all possible
                    reasons; that they would have motives for, and none at all against it.</p>
                <p>Those parties, therefore, who reason against any measures necessary for
                    identifying the interests of the representative body with those of the nation,
                    under the plea that such a representative body would abolish the king and the
                    House of Lords, are wholly inconsistent with themselves. They maintain that a
                    king and a House of Lords, such as ours, are important and necessary branches of
                    a good Government. It is demonstratively certain that a representative body, the
                    interests of which were identified with those of the nation, would have no
                    motive to abolish them, if they were not causes of bad Government. Those
                    persons, therefore, who affirm that it would certainly abolish them, affirm
                    implicitly that they are causes of bad, and not necessary to good Government.
                    This oversight of theirs is truly surprising.</p>
                <p>The whole of this chain of deduction is dependent, as we stated at the beginning,
                    upon the principle that the acts of men will be conformable to their interests.
                    Upon this principle, we conceive that the chain is complete and irrefragable.
                    The principle, also, appears to stand upon a strong foundation. It is
                    indisputable that the acts of men follow their will; that their will follows
                    their desires; and that their desires are generated by their apprehensions of
                    good or evil; in other words, by their interests.</p>
                <p>X— <hi rend="italic">Second Objection</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">That the People are not capable of acting agreeably to their
                    Interest.</hi></p>
                <p>The apprehensions of the people respecting good and evil may be just, or they may
                    be erroneous. If just, their actions will be agreeable to their real interests.
                    If erroneous, they will not be agreeable to their real interests, but to a false
                    supposition of interest.</p>
                <p>We have seen that, unless the representative body are chosen by a portion of the
                    community, the interest of which cannot be made to differ from that of the
                    community, the interest of the community will infallibly be sacrificed to the
                    interest of the rulers.</p>
                <p>The whole of that party of reasoners who support aristocratical power, affirm,
                    that a portion of the community, the interest of whom cannot be made to differ
                    from that of the community, will not act according to their interest, but
                    contrary to their interest. All their pleas are grounded upon this assumption;
                    because, if a portion of the community, whose interest is the same with that of
                    the community, would act agreeably to their own interest, they would act
                    agreeably to the interest of the community, and the end of Government would be
                    obtained.</p>
                <p>If this assumption of theirs is true, the prospect of mankind is deplorable. To
                    the evils of misgovernment they are subject by inexorable destiny. If the powers
                    of Government are placed in the hands of persons whose interests are not
                    identified with those of the community, the interests of the community are
                    wholly sacrificed to those of the rulers. If so much as a checking power is held
                    by the community, or by any part of the community, where the interests are the
                    same as those of the community, the holders of that checking power will not,
                    according to the assumption in question, make use of it in a way agreeable, but
                    in a way contrary to their own interest. According to this theory, the choice is
                    placed between the evils which Will be produced by design, the design of those
                    who have the power of oppressing the rest of the community, and an interest in
                    doing it; and the evils which may be produced by mistake, the mistake of those
                    who, if they acted agreeably to their own interest, would act well.</p>
                <p>Supposing that this theory were true, it would still be a question between these
                    two sets of evils, whether the evils arising from the design of those who have
                    motives to employ the powers of Government for the purpose of reducing the
                    community to the state of abject slaves of their will, or the evils arising from
                    the misconduct of those who never produce evil but when they mistake their own
                    interest, are the greatest evils.</p>
                <p>Upon the most general and summary view of this question, it appears that the
                    proper answer cannot be doubtful. They who have a fixed invariable interest in
                    acting ill, will act ill invariably. They who act ill from mistake, will often
                    act well, sometimes even by accident, and in every case in which they are
                    enabled to understand their interest, by design.</p>
                <p>There is another, and a still more important ground of preference. The evils
                    which are the produce of interest and power united, the evils on the one side,
                    are altogether incurable: the effects are certain while that conjunction which
                    is the cause of them remains. The evils which arise from mistake are not
                    incurable; for if the parties who act contrary to their interest had a proper
                    knowledge of that interest, they would act well. What is necessary, then, is
                    knowledge. Knowledge, on the part of those whose interests are the same as those
                    of the community, would be an adequate remedy. But knowledge is a thing which is
                    capable of being increased; and the more it is increased, the more the evils on
                    this side of the case would be reduced.</p>
                <p>Supposing, then, the theory of will opposed to interest to be correct; the
                    practical conclusion would be, as there is something of a remedy to the evils
                    arising from this source, none whatever to the evils arising from the
                    conjunction of power and sinister interest, to adopt the side which has the
                    remedy, and to do whatever is necessary for obtaining the remedy in its greatest
                    possible strength, and for applying it with the greatest possible efficacy.</p>
                <p>It is no longer deniable that a high degree of knowledge is capable of being
                    conveyed to such a portion of the community as would have interests the same
                    with those of the community. This being the only resource for good Government<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193522196" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2196-0633"/>, those who say
                    that it is not yet attained stand in this dilemma; either they do not desire
                    good Government, which ' is the case with all those who derive advantage from
                    bad; or they will be seen employing their utmost exertions to increase the
                    quantity of knowledge in the body of the community.</p>
                <p>The practical conclusion, then, is actually the same, whether we embrace or
                    reject the assumption that the community are little capable of acting according
                    to their own interest. That assumption, however, deserves to be considered. And
                    it would need a more minute consideration than the space to which we are
                    confined will enable us to bestow upon it.</p>
                <p>One caution, first of all, we should take along with us; and it is this, that all
                    those persons who hold the powers of Government, without having an identity of
                    interests with the community, and all those persons who share in the profits
                    which are made by the abuse of those powers, and all those persons whom the
                    example and representations of the two first classes influence, will be sure to
                    represent the community, or a part having an identity of interest with the
                    community, as incapable in the highest degree of acting according to their own
                    interest; it being clear that they who have not an identity of interest with the
                    community, ought to hold the power of Government no longer, if those who have
                    that identity of interest could be expected to act in any tolerable conformity
                    with their interest. All representations from that quarter, therefore, of their
                    incapability so to act, are to be received with suspicion. They come from
                    interested parties; they come from parties who have the strongest possible
                    interest to deceive themselves, and to endeavour to deceive others.</p>
                <p>It is impossible that the interested endeavours of all those parties should not
                    propagate, and for a long time successfully uphold, such an opinion, to whatever
                    degree it might be found, upon accurate inquiry, to be without foundation.</p>
                <p>A parallel case may be given. It was the interest of the priesthood, when the
                    people of Europe were all of one religion, that the laity should take their
                    opinions exclusively from them; because, in that case, the laity might be
                    rendered subservient to the will of the clergy, to any possible extent; and as
                    all opinions were to be derived professedly from the Bible, they withdrew from
                    the laity the privilege of reading it. When the opinions which produced the
                    Reformation, and all the blessings which may be traced to it, began to ferment,
                    the privilege of the Bible was demanded. The demand was resisted by the clergy,
                    upon the very same assumption which we have now under contemplation. “Ιhe people
                    did not understand their own interest. They would be sure to make a bad use of
                    the Bible. They would derive from it not right opinions, but all sorts of wrong
                    opinions.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A most
                    instructive display of these and similar artifices for the preservation of
                    mischievous power, after the spirit of the times is felt to be hostile to it,
                    may be seen in Father Paul’s <hi rend="italic">History of the Council of
                    Trent.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that the assumption, in the religious case, was bome out by
                    still stronger appearance of evidence than it is in the political. The majority
                    of the people may be supposed less capable of deriving correct opinions from the
                    Bible, than of judging who is the best man to act as a representative.</p>
                <p>Experience has fully displayed the nature of the assumption in regard to
                    religion. The power bestowed upon the people, of judging for themselves, has
                    been productive of good effects, to a degree which has totally altered the
                    condition of human nature, and exalted man to what may be called a different
                    stage of existence.</p>
                <p>For what reason then is it we are called upon to believe, that, if a portion of
                    the community, having an identity of interests with the whole community, have
                    the power of choosing representatives, they will act wholly contrary to , their
                    interests, and make a bad choice?</p>
                <p>Experience, it will be said, establishes this conclusion. We see that the people
                    do not act according to their interests, but very often in opposition to
                    them.</p>
                <p>The question is between a portion of the community, which, if intrusted with
                    power, would have an interest in making a bad use of it, and a portion which,
                    though intrusted with power, would not have an interest in making a bad use of
                    it. The former are any small number whatsoever, who, by the circumstance of
                    being intrusted with power, are constituted an aristocracy.</p>
                <p>From the frequency, however great, with which those who compose the mass of the
                    community act in opposition to their interests, no conclusion can, in this case,
                    be drawn, without a comparison of the frequency with which those who are placed
                    in contrast with them act in opposition to theirs. Now it may with great
                    confidence be affirmed, that as great a proportion of those who compose the
                    aristocratical body of any country, as of those who compose the rest of the
                    community, are distinguished for a conduct unfavourable to their interests.
                    Prudence is a more general characteristic of the people who are without the
                    advantages of fortune, than of the people who have been thoroughly subject to
                    their corruptive operation. It may surely be said, that if the powers of
                    Government must be intrusted to persons incapable of good conduct, they were
                    better intrusted to incapables who have an interest in good Government, than to
                    incapables who have an interest in bad.</p>
                <p>It will be said that a conclusion ought not to be drawn from the unthinking
                    conduct of the great majority of an aristocratical body, against the capability
                    of such a body for acting wisely in the management of public affairs; because
                    the body will always contain a certain proportion of wise men, and the rest will
                    be governed by them. Nothing but this can be said with pertinency, And, under
                    certain modifications, this may be said with truth. The wise and good in any
                    class of men do, to all general purposes, govern the rest. The comparison,
                    however, must go on. Of that body whose interests are identified with those of
                    the community, it may also be said, that if one portion of them are unthinking,
                    there is another portion wise; and that, in matters of state, the less wise
                    would be governed by the more wise, not less certainly than in that body whose
                    interests, if they were intrusted with power, could not be identified with those
                    of the community.</p>
                <p>If we compare in each of these two contrasted bodies the two descriptions of
                    persons, we shall not find that the foolish part of the democratical body are
                    more foolish than that of the aristocratical, nor the wise part less wise.</p>
                <p>Though, according to the opinions which fashion has propagated, it may appear a
                    little paradoxical, we shall probably find the reverse.</p>
                <p>That there is not only as great a proportion of wise men in that part of the
                    community which is not the aristocracy, as in that which is, but that, under the
                    present state of education, and the diffusion of knowledge, there is a much
                    greater, we presume there are few persons who will be disposed to dispute. It is
                    to be observed, that the class which is universally described as both the most
                    wise and the most virtuous part of the community, the middle rank, are wholly
                    included in that part of the community which is not the aristocratical. It is
                    also not disputed, that in Great Britain the middle rank are numerous, and form
                    a large proportion of the whole body of the people. Another<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193522209" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2209-0634"/> proposition may be stated,
                    with a perfect confidence in the concurrence of all those men who have
                    attentively considered the formation of opinions in the great body of society,
                    or, indeed, the principles of human nature in general. It is, that the opinions
                    of that class of the people who are below the middle rank, are formed, and their
                    minds are directed, by that intelligent and virtuous rank who come the most
                    immediately in contact with them, who are in the constant habit of intimate
                    communication with them, to whom they fly for advice and assistance in all their
                    numerous difficulties, upon whom they feel an immediate and daily dependence, in
                    health and in sickness, in infancy and in old age; to whom their children look
                    up as models for their imitation, whose opinions they hear daily repeated, and
                    account it their honour to adopt. There can be no doubt that the middle rank,
                    which gives to science, to art, and to legislation itself, their most
                    distinguished ornaments, the chief source of all that has exalted and refined
                    human nature, is that portion of the community of which, if the basis of
                    representation were ever so far extended, the opinion would ultimately decide.
                    Of the people beneath them, a vast majority would be sure to be guided by their
                    advice and example.</p>
                <p>The incidents which have been urged as exceptions to this general rule, and even
                    as reasons for rejecting it, may be considered as contributing to its proof.
                    What signify the irregularities of a mob, more than half composed, in the
                    greater number of instances, of boys and women, and disturbing,, for a few hours
                    or days, a particular town? What signifies the occasional turbulence of a
                    manufacturing district, peculiarly unhappy from a very great deficiency of a
                    middle rank, as there the population almost wholly consists of rich
                    manufacturers and poor workmen; with whose minds no pains are taken by anybody;
                    with whose afflictions there is no virtuous family in the middle rank to
                    sympathize; whose children have no good example of such a family to see and to
                    admire; and who are placed in the highly unfavourable situation of fluctuating
                    between very high wages in one year, and very low wages in another? It is
                    altogether futile, with regard to the foundation of good government, to say that
                    this or the other portion of the people may at this or the other time depart
                    from the wisdom of the middle rank. It is enough that the great majority of the
                    people never cease to be guided by that rank; and we may, with some confidence,
                    challenge the adversaries of the people to produce a single instance to the
                    contrary in the history of the world.</p>
