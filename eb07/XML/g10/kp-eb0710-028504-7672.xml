                <p><label type="entry">GALIANI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Ferdinand</hi></label>, an
                    eminent Italian writer, was born at Chicti, in the Neapolitan province of
                    Abruzzo, on the 2d of December 1728. At eight years of age he was sent to his
                    uncle at Naples, who was then first chaplain to the king. Here he received his
                    elementary education, along with his brother Bernard, who was a few years older.
                    In 1740, the uncle being obliged to go to Rome upon a political mission, he gave
                    his two nephews in charge to the Celestine fathers, for the continuance of their
                    studies; and accordingly, in the course of two years, they were instructed in
                    philosophy, the mathematics, and other liberal sciences. The archbishop, on his
                    return to Naples, received them back into his palace, where they studied law,
                    and enjoyed the society and conversation of the most distinguished professors of
                    the university of Naples. Ferdinand, who possessed great talents and vivacity,
                    devoted himself with ardour to the study of history, antiquities, the belles
                    lettres, and philosophy, and more particularly to political economy. At the age
                    of sixteen he produced a <hi rend="italic">Memoir on the Coins of the period of
                    the Trojan War</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and this early production first
                    inspired him with the idea of his great work on money. He also translated
                    Locke’s treatise on <hi rend="italic">Money and Interest.</hi> At the age of
                    eighteen he undertook a work on the <hi rend="italic">Ancient History of the
                    Navigation of the Mediterranean</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in his great
                    work, we find that he there made use of part of the materials which he had
                    collected at this early age. <hi rend="italic">A Jeu</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >d’esprit,</hi> which had nearly been attended with serious consequences,
                    diverted him for some time from his graver studies. Having been charged by his
                    brother Bernard to deliver, in his absence, a discourse in an academy of which
                    he was a member, the president, looking only at the youth of Ferdinand, and
                    being ignorant of his talents, would not permit him to proceed. The latter
                    resolved to revenge himself in a manner that showed more spirit than prudence.
                    It was the custom in this academy, as in several others, that when any great
                    personage died at Naples, all the academicians published, in his praise, a
                    collection of pieces in prose and verse. The executioner at Naples having died,
                    Galiani seized the opportunity of turning the academy into ridicule. With the
                    assistance of a friend, he composed, in the course of a few days, a collection
                    of serious pieces on this event, which were ascribed to each of the members, and
                    in which their peculiar style and manner were so well imitated, that one of them
                    confessed he should have been himself deceived, if he had not been perfectly
                    certain that he had not written the piece to which his name was subscribed. This
                    malicious and witty little volume appeared in 1749, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Componimenti var; per</hi><hi rend="italic">la Morte</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">di DomenicoJannacone, Camefice della gran</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >corte</hi><hi rend="italic">della vicaria, raecolti</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi><hi rend="italic">dati in luce da Gian. Anton. Sergio Awocato
                    Napoletano.</hi> This Sergio was the president of the academy. The publication
                    was eminently successful, and excited a sensation which the authors had not
                    foreseen; and as they became afraid of being discovered by the publisher,
                    tl&gt;ey went directly to the minister Tanucci, confessed the fact, and got off
                    for the performance of some spiritual exercises.</p>
                <p>Galiani soon effaced the impression made by this piece of youthful folly, by the
                    publication of his <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Money,</hi> which had employed
                    the labour of several years. It appeared at Naples in 1750, when the author was
                    only twenty-one. It was first published anonymously, and the author did not make
                    himself known until the success of the work was decided. The Archbishop of
                    Tarentum took this occasion to patronize him, and procured for him several
                    benefices, which induced him to take orders. He afterwards travelled through the
                    whole of Italy, was presented at the various courts, and found himself every
                    where preceded by his reputation. He was well received by the pope and several
                    of the Italian princes; he was admitted a member of some of the most celebrated
                    academies; and he established a correspondence with many of the most eminent
                    literary characters. His next publication was a treatise entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Della perfetta</hi><hi rend="italic">Conservations</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">del Grano,</hi> written, with his usual elegance, for the purpose
                    of recommending an ingenious machine, invented by his friend Intieri, for drying
                    and preserving grain.</p>
                <p>The active mind of Galiani was now engaged in investigating several scientific
                    subjects, particularly connected with antiquities and natural history. He was
                    the first who undertook to form a collection of the volcanic productions of
                    Vesuvius; and he wrote a learned treatise upon this subject, which, however, was
                    not printed until about fifteen years afterwards. He presented the manuscript to
                    Pope Benedict XIV. along with the collection itself, which was arranged in seven
                    boxes, according to the order of the treatise. The collection was placed in the
                    Museum of the Institute of Bologna, where it still remains. In presenting this
                    collection to the pope, Galiani had written upon one of the boxes, <hi
                    rend="italic">Beatissime</hi><hi rend="italic">Pater,</hi><hi rend="italic">fac
                    ut lapides isti</hi><hi rend="italic">panes</hi><hi rend="italic">fiant.</hi>
                    His holiness, understanding the hint, gave him the prebend of Amalfi, worth 400
                    ducats a year.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193517685" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7685-0286"/>
                <p>In the lifetime of his uncle, whom he lost in 1753, he enjoyed a benefice of 500
                    ducats, which conferred upon him the episcopal dignity, and another living worth
                    600 ducats. His funeral oration, on the death of his patron, Benedict XIV., who
                    died in 1758, procured him a high character for eloquence, and was one of his
                    works which he himself most esteemed.</p>
                <p>Galiani was one of the members of the academy of Herculaneum, established by King
                    Charles III. for the purpose of illustrating the remains of ancient art
                    discovered among the ruins of that city; and he furnished several memoirs, which
                    were inserted in the first volume of that magnificent work, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Antiquities of Herculaneum.</hi> With the other academicians who
                    were engaged in this labour, Galiani enjoyed the royal bounty, in a pension of
                    250 ducats.</p>
                <p>In the month of January 1759 he was appointed secretary of state and of the royal
                    household, and, soon afterwards, secretary to the French embassy; and he arrived
                    at Paris in the month of June following. Here his reception was exceedingly
                    flattering, and his company was courted in all polite literary societies. The
                    ambassador was the Count Cantillano, marquis of Castromonte, a Spanish nobleman,
                    of much indolence and little talent. During the absence of the count on a six
                    months’ journey to Spain, Galiani remained <hi rend="italic">charge
                    d’affaires,</hi> was presented to the king of France, and enjoyed all the
                    advantages of his situation. He applied himself with great zeal and assiduity to
                    the acquisition of a correct French style of writing; and about this time he
                    commenced his learned and ingenious <hi rend="italic">Commentary on Horace,</hi>
                    of which the Abbé Arnaud inserted some extracts in the fifth, sixth, and seventh
                    volumes of his <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi><hi rend="italic">Littéraire</hi>
                    for 1765. About the commencement of that year Galiani had set out for Naples,
                    for the purpose of taking the waters of Ischia. Long after his period of leave
                    had expired, he was retained by the government, employed and consulted in
                    several matters of importance, and at length appointed a member of the Supreme
                    Council of Commerce. With this new title he returned to Paris; and about a year
                    afterwards he obtained permission to travel for a few months in England, having
                    been invited to that country by the Marquis of Caracciolo, who was then
                    ambassador from the court of Naples at London. He returned through Holland to
                    Paris, and soon afterwards wrote in French his celebrated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dialogues</hi><hi rend="italic">sur le</hi><hi rend="italic">Commerce</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Blés;</hi> the style of which is so easy and elegant, that one
                    would never suppose it to be the work of a foreigner. The manuscript was left in
                    the hands of Diderot, and was published in 1770, with the date of London, and
                    without the name of the author. The work excited great attention in France, and
                    the best writers were loud and unanimous in their praise of it. Vohaire wrote to
                    Diderot, who had sent him a copy, in the following terms: “The powers of Plato
                    and Molière seem to be combined in the composition of this work. I have as yet
                    only read about two thirds of it; and I expect the <hi rend="italic"
                    >denouement</hi> of the piece with great impatience.” The same author again
                    praises the work in his <hi rend="italic">Questions</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sur</hi><hi rend="italic">ĪBncyclopedie,</hi> m the article <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bled</hi><hi rend="italic">ou Blé.</hi></p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Galiani had returned to Naples, where, in addition to his office of
                    member of the Council of Commerce, he received that of secretary to the same
                    tribunal. These two situations brought him a revenue of 1600 ducats. In 1777 he
                    was made one of the ministers of the <hi rend="italic">junto</hi> of the royal
                    domains, who had the charge of every thing connected <hi rend="italic">with</hi>
                    the private patrimony of the king; an office which added 200 ducats to his
                    income. His P≡ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> * ’ ⅛ <hi rend="superscript">

                    complete, but which has never been published. There is a life of Horace
                    prefixed, much better and more complete than that which is inserted in the works
                    of Algarotti. , The project which he entertained of a dramatic academy induced
                    him to attempt the composition of a comic opera, in a new and singular style.
                    This was <hi rend="italic">The Imaginary Socrates,</hi> of which he gave the
                    plan to the poet Lorenzi, who put it into verse, and it was set to music by the
                    celebrated Paesiello. The piece was performed with the greatest success
                    throughout Italy, Germany, and even at St Petersburg. Galiani himself was
                    passionately fond of music. He sung agreeably, and played well on the
                    harpsichord. His library was select rather than numerous, and particularly rich
                    in good editions of the Greek and Latin classics. He had also a considerable and
                    very valuable cabinet of ancient coins and rare medals, engraved stones, cameos,
                    and a few statues.</p>
                <p>On the 8th of August 1779, a terrible eruption of Vesuvius spread the utmost
                    dismay throughout Naples. For some time the press teemed with new and frightful
                    descriptions of this phenomenon, and the ravages it occasioned; and the minds of
                    the inhabitants were every day filled with fresh terror. In order to efface
                    these disagreeable impressions, Galiani in a single night composed a piece on
                    this eruption, in which he imitated very happily the style of an author who was
                    well known in the city for his ridiculous weakness. This production was printed
                    next day under the following title: <hi rend="italic">Spaventosissima
                    descrizione dello spaventoso spavento,</hi><hi rend="italic">che</hi><hi

                    >poeta</hi><hi rend="italic">e Jilosofo ali impronto.</hi> It was a very
                    laughable piece on a very serious subject; and it had the effect of dispelling
                    the melancholy ideas which had got possession of the minds of the people.</p>
                <p>Galiani was very fond of the Neapolitan dialect, and took great pleasure in
                    speaking it. In the same year he published anonymously, as was his custom, a
                    work entitled <hi rend="italic">Del dialetto Napolitano,</hi> in which he gave,
                    for the first time, a grammar and history of this dialect, which he maintained
                    was the primitive language of Italy; and shortly afterwards he composed a lexico
                    of the words peculiar to the Neapolitan tongue, which was begun to be printed in
                    1780; but the work was suspended, and has not since been resumed.</p>
                <p>A work of a different kind soon afterwards engaged his attention. In the war
                    which broke out in 1778, between England on one side, and France and Spain on
                    the other, Naples and some other powers had remained neutral; but their rights,
                    as they conceived, were not sufficiently respected by the belligerent parties.
                    Numerous writings appeared throughout Europe on the rights and duties of
                    neutrals; and, among others, Galiani produced a treatise in Italian, <hi
                    rend="italic">On the Duties of Neutrals towards Belligerent Powers, and of the
                    latter towards the former.</hi> It was published at Naples in 1782, in 4to. In
                    the same year he was appointed first assessor to the general council of finance;
                    a situation which he accepted the more readily, as its duties were analogous to
                    his other studies; but he refused to touch the salary. A few months afterwards,
                    however, the king presented him with the abbacy of Scur-coli, which was worth
                    1200 ducats per annum, after deducting all charges and pensions. The office of
                    assessor of economy in the superintendence of the crown funds, to which he was
                    appointed in 1748, added to his public duties, and likewise increased his
                    income. Meanwhile his health, which was naturally weak, declined daily. On the
                    13th of May 1785 he had an attack of apoplexy; and in order to prevent a return,
                    he travelled the following year through Puglia. In 1787 he made a longer
                    journey, and went as far as Venice, where he was well received by all the men

                    he was also at Modena by Tiraboschi, and ' by Cesarotti at Padua. On his return
                    to Naples his health rapidly declined; and he died, quietly and resignedly, on
                    the 30th of October 1787, at the age of fifty-nine.</p>
                <p>Besides the works already mentioned, Galiani left behind him a variety of
                    interesting manuscripts, which came into the possession of D. Francesco
                    Azzariti, his heir, and many of which, it is said, well deserve publication.
                    Among them are, 1. The Commentary on Horace, with the Life; 2. The Lexico of
                    Words peculiar to the Neapolitan Dialect; 3. A Poetical Translation of the
                    Anti·Lucretius; 4. A Miscellaneous Collection of Poetical Pieces; 5. Several
                    volumes full of facetious Letters, Novels, and Anecdotes; 6. His Epistolary
                    Correspondence, which would form of itself a pretty voluminous collection. A
                    part of it was published at Paris in 1818, in two vols. 8vo. (See the article
