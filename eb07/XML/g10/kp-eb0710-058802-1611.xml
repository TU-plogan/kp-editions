                <p><label type="entry">GLOVER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Richard</hi></label>, was the
                    son of Richard Glover, a Hamburg merchant in London, and was born in St Martin’s
                    Lane in the year 1712. He very early evinced a strong propensity for poetry, and
                    whilst at school wrote, amongst other pieces, a poem to the memory of Sir Isaac
                    Newton, which is prefixed to the view of that incomparable author’s philosophy,
                    published by his intimate friend Dr Pemberton, 1728, in 4to. But though
                    possessed of talents which were calculated to obtain distinction in the literary
                    world, he was content to devote his attention to commerce, and at a proper
                    period commenced Hamburg merchant. He still, however, cultivated literature, and
                    associated with those who were eminent in science. One of his earliest friends
                    was Matthew Green, the author of some poems, which after his death were
                    collected and published by Mr Glover in 1737. In that year Mr Glover married
                    Miss Nunn, with whom he received a handsome fortune; and in the same month
                    published <hi rend="italic">Leonidas,</hi> a poem in quarto, which in two years
                    passed through three editions. This poem was inscribed to Lord Cobham, and upon
                    its first appearance was received by the world with great approbation, though it
                    has since been unaccountably neglected. Lord Lyttleton, in a popular publication
                    called <hi rend="italic">Common Sense,</hi> and in a poem addressed to the
                    author, praised it in the warmest terms; and in 1738 Dr Pemberton published
                    observations on poetry, especially epic, occasioned by the poem of Leonidas,
                    merely with a view to point out its beauties. In 1739 Mr Glover published <hi
                    rend="italic">London, or the Progress of Commerce,</hi> quarto; and a ballad
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Hosiers Ghost.</hi> Both these pieces seem to have
                    been written with a view to incite the public to resent the misconduct of the
                    Spaniards; and the latter had a very considerable effect. At this period
                    political dissensions raged with great violence, more especially in the
                    metropolis; and at different meetings of the livery on these occasions, Mr
                    Glover was always called to (he chair, and acquitted himself in a very able
                    manner, his conduct being patriotic and his speeches masterly. In the year 1744
                    the Duchess of Marlborough died, and by her will left to Mr Glover and Mr Mallet
                    L.500 each, to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193521624" xml:id="kp-eb0710-1624-0589"
                    />write the history of the Duke of Marlborough’s life. This bequest, however,
                    never took effect. It is supposed that Glover early renounced his share of it;
                    and Mallet, though he continued to talk of performing the task almost as long as
                    he lived, is now known never to have made the least progress in the work. About
                    this period Mr Glover withdrew a good deal from public notice, and lived in
                    retirement. He had been unsuccessful in business, and with a laudable delicacy
                    had preferred an obscure retreat to popular observation, until his affaire
                    should be placed on a better footing. He had been honoured with the attention of
                    Frederick prince of Wales, who once presented him with a complete set of the
                    classics, elegantly bound, and, on his absenting himself for some time on
                    account of the embarrassment in his circumstances, sent him, it is said, L.500.
                    The prince died in March 1751; and in the May following Mr Glover was once more
                    drawn from his retreat by the importunity of his friends, and stood as candidate
                    for the office of chamberlain of London. But it unfortunately happened that he
                    did not declare himself until most of the livery had engaged their votes, and
                    hence he lost his election. In 1753 Mr Glover produced at Drury Lane his tragedy
                    of <hi rend="italic">Boadicea,</hi> which was acted nine nights, in the month of
                    December. It had the advantage of the performance of Garrick, Mossop, Mrs
                    Cibber, and Mrs Pritchard. From the prologue it seems to have been patronised by
                    the author’s friends in the city; and Dr Pemberton wrote a pamphlet to recommend
                    it. In 1761 Mr Glover published <hi rend="italic">Medea,</hi> a tragedy written
                    on the Greek model; but it was not ιacted until 1767, when it appeared for the
                    first time on the stage at Drury Lane for Mrs Yates’ benefit. On the accession
                    of George III. he appears to have surmounted the difficulties of his situation.
                    In the parliament which was then called, he was chosen member for Weymouth, and
                    continued to sit as such until its dissolution. In 1770 a new edition of the
                    poem of <hi rend="italic">Leonidas</hi> being required, it was republished in
                    two volumes duodecimo, corrected throughout, and extended from nine books to
                    twelve. It had also several new characters added, and the old ones were placed
                    in new situations. The improvements made in it were very considerable; but
                    public curiosity was not at this period sufficiently alive to recompense the
                    pains bestowed on this once popular performance. The calamities arising from the
                    wound given to public credit in June 1772, by the failure of the bank of
                    Douglas, Heron, and Company, in Scotland, occasioned Mr Glover’s taking an
                    active part in settling these complicated concerns, and also in endeavouring to
                    relieve the distress then so universally fell. In February 1744 he called the
                    annuitants of that banking house together, at the King’s Arms Tavern, and laid
                    proposals before them for the security of their demands, with which they were
                    fully satisfied. He also undertook to manage the interests of the merchants and
                    traders of London concerned in the trade to Germany and Holland, and of the
                    dealers in foreign linens, in their application to parliament in May 1774. The
                    speeches which he made on both these occasions were published in a pamphlet. In
                    the succeeding year he was engaged in behalf of the West India merchants in
                    their application to parliament, and examined the witnesses and summed up the
                    evidence in the same masterly manner as he had done on former occasions. For the
                    assistance he afforded the merchants in this business, he was complimented by
                    them with a service of plate, of the value of L.300; and the speech which he
                    delivered in the house was also printed. This, we believe, was the last
                    opportunity he had of displaying in public his oratorical talents. Having now
                    arrived at a period of life which demanded a retreat from business, Mr Glover
                    withdrew to ease and independence, and spent the remainder of his days with
                    dignity and honour. It is probable that he still continued his attention to
                    poetry, as it appears that, besides an epic poem of considerable length, he left
                    some tragedies and comedies behind him in manuscript. After experiencing the
                    infirmities of age, he died on the 25th of November 1785, leaving behind him a
                    most estimable character as a man, a citizen, and a writer.</p>
