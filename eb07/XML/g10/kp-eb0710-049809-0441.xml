                <p><label type="entry">GIANNONE</label>, in Latin <hi rend="smallcaps">Jannonius,
                    Peter,</hi> a celebrated Nea1x&gt;litan writer and historian, was born at
                    Ischitella, a small town in the province of Capitanata. Having acquired the
                    elements of a liberal education under the paternal roof, he was sent by his
                    father, at the age of eighteen, to Naples, there to complete his studies, and
                    particularly to study jurisprudence. Being placed under the immediate tuition of
                    DominicoAulisio, who not only excelled in the qualifications necessary for
                    training young men to the bar, but was also profoundly conversant with Greek and
                    Roman literature, history, philosophy, and indeed all the learning of his time,
                    Giannone made so rapid progress in his studies, both in philosophy and
                    jurisprudence, and evinced so great penetration of mind, that he was admitted
                    into the society or club which met at the house of Gaetano Argento, one of the
                    most distinguished advocates of Naples, who combined the cultivation of letters
                    with the practice of his profession. This circumstance appears to have
                    materially influenced, if not in fact determined, the character of his
                    subsequent pursuits. He applied himself with great ardour to the study of
                    jurisprudence on philosophical principles, and soon gave proofs of his capacity
                    for investigating and illustrating the sources of that science by several
                    learned dissertations <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Originibus</hi><hi rend="italic">Juris.</hi> His inquiries, however, having
                    disclosed to him much respecting the origin and mutations of laws, and the
                    vicissitudes of nations, which had escaped the penetration of ordinary
                    jurisconsults, he conceived the design, with the approbation of Argento, of
                    writing a civil history of the kingdom of Naples, comprehending an account of
                    the origin and progress of its laws and government, and an exposition of the
                    causes which led to the gradual abolition of ancient customs and institutions.
                    But this work, interrupted from time to time by the affairs of the bar, was not
                    completed until after the lapse of twenty years, and only appeared in 1723,
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Istoria Civile del Regno di Napoli,</hi> in
                    four volumes 4to. Giannone took as his guide Angelo de Costanzo, whose history
                    of Naples, which was then accounted the best, he almost entirely transfused into
                    his work; but his distinguishing merit consists in the valuable expositions he
                    has given relative to the ecclesiastical and civil constitution, and to the laws
                    and customs of the kingdom. Although the style is neither correct nor elegant,
                    the philosophical spirit, the erudition, and the profound research, which this
                    history exhibits, secured it a high reputation. But the author perhaps affects
                    too much passion against the court of Rome, the proceedings of which, however
                    censurable in themselves, should have been treated by a writer like Giannone,
                    not with the impassioned bitterness of a controversialist, but with the
                    dignified and judicial calmness of a philosophical historian. The consequences
                    of this asperity were such as might have been expected. The freedom with which
                    he treated ecclesiastics generally, and the boldness with which he discussed
                    several topics relating to the origin of the papal power, raised a storm against
                    him, which neither the authority of the viceroy, Cardinal Althann, nor the
                    credit of the municipality of Naples, of which he had been elected advocate,
                    could allay, or even mitigate. “I know not, indeed,” said Argento, when speaking
                    to him on this subject, “whether I should congratulate you or condole with you;
                    for I very much fear lest the crown of laurel which now encircles your brows
                    should become a crown of thorns.” Having been several times insulted by the
                    populace, and at length excommunicated by the archiepiscopal court, Giannone,
                    seeing his work placed in the <hi rend="italic">index expurgatorius,</hi> left
                    Naples on the 29th of April 1723, and went to seek an asylum at Vienna. The
                    Emperor Charles VI. regarded him at first with an unfavourable eye; but the
                    protection of such men as Prince Eugene, the Chancellor Zinzendorf, the
                    celebrated Count de Bonneval, and the Chevalier Garelli, first physician to the
                    emperor, procured him a pension of a hundred florins on the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193520454" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0454-0499"/>secretaryship of Sicily.
                    Although relieved from his excommunication by Cardinal Pignatelli, archbishop of
                    Naples, he did not restrain himself from composing several little satires
                    against his sentence, and particularly against the prohibition of his book; but
                    by the advice of his friends he only circulated these in manuscript. It is in
                    his smaller works that his resentment against the court of Rome knew no bounds.
                    During his stay at Vienna, where he enjoyed the favour of the great and of men
                    of letters, he laboured at a work entitled <hi rend="italic">II Triregno, ossia
                    del regno del Cielo, della Terra, e del Papa,</hi> which occupied him nearly
                    twelve years, and to which he only put the last touches at Geneva. This work, in
                    which man is successively represented in the state of nature, under the law of
                    grace, and under the temporal dominion of the popes, comprehends ten epochs, the
                    first three of which extend to the ninth century; but the remainder has not been
                    completed. Don Carlos having ascended the throne of Naples and of Sicily in
                    1734, Giannone lost his pension and all his hopes. Being constrained to quit
                    Vienna, he retired to Venice, where he was received with every mark of
                    distinction, by persons of quality and men of letters, particularly by the
                    senator Angiolo Pisani, who gave him a lodging in one of his houses. He refused
                    the appointment of counsellor of the republic, and the chair of Roman law in the
                    university of Padua, ingenuously confessing that he was not in a condition to
                    explain the laws in the Latin language, according to the usage of the schools.
                    But the repose which he hoped to enjoy at Venice was not of long duration.
                    Denounced as unfavourable to the pretensions of the republic over the Adriatic,
                    he endeavoured to avert the storm by publishing a <hi rend="italic">Lettera
                    intomo al</hi><hi rend="italic">dominio</hi><hi rend="italic">del mare

                    >Federigo</hi><hi rend="italic">Barbarossa ,∙</hi> but as the state inquisitors
                    had taken umbrage at the prolonged visits paid by him to the ambassadors of
                    France and Spain, his removal was decided on, and, in the night of the 23d
                    September 1735, sbirri seized and conducted him in a small boat or barque to the
                    frontiers of the territory of Ferrara. The apprehension of still greater
                    misfortunes now induced him to change his name to that of Antonio Rinaldo, under
                    which he sojourned at Modena, Milan, and Turin, and arrived with his son at
                    Geneva, on the 5th of December. His reputation, which had preceded him in
                    different cities, procured him in the last-mentioned place the most satisfactory
                    reception on the part of Dr Turretin, the minister Vernet, and the bookseller
                    Bousquet, who furnished him with the means of living at his ease. In 1736 he was
                    preparing to print a volume of supplement to his history, when, having been
                    conducted by a perfidious friend to pass Easter in a catholic village belonging
                    to the king of Sardinia, he was arrested by order of that sovereign, and his
                    manuscripts seized and conveyed to Rome. He was himself conducted to the castle
                    of Miolan, and thence to the fort of Ceva, where, in hiscalmer moments, he
                    employed himself in translating various works into Italian, in writing on
                    politics, and in preparing memoirs of his life. The discussion which arose
                    between the courts of Rome and Turin on the nomination to consistorial benefices
                    in the states of the king of Sardinia, and which was terminated by the concordat
                    of 1738, furnished Giannone with an occasion of writing, in favour of the rights
                    of the sovereign, a memoir, which he sent to the king. His Sardinian majesty
                    appeared to receive it with pleasure; but, strange to add, he caused the author
                    to be more closely confined than before, and ordered him to be transferred to
                    the citadel of Turin, where he passed twelve consecutive years in trouble and
                    agitation. It was in this fortress that, giving ear to the persuasions of Father
                    Prever of the Oratory, Giannone retracted, on the 4th April 1738, the maxims
                    which had been condemned in his history. But this submission did not procure him
                    his liberty; for he died in prison on the 7th of March 1758, aged seventy-two
                    years. In 1760 his posthumous works were published at Lausanne, in one volume
                    4to, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Oj&gt;ere</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Postume</hi><hi rend="italic">in difesa della</hi><hi rend="italic">sua

                    rend="italic">lui professione</hi><hi rend="italic">di fede.</hi> The history of
                    Giannone was translated into French by Louis Bochat of Lausanne; and among the
                    re-impressions of the work maybe distinguished that which appeared with
                    illustrations by the Abbe Cestari. It has been highly commended by Gibbon in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Extraits</hi><hi rend="italic">de mon Journal</hi>
                    (Miscellaneous Works, vol. V. p. 413, 8vo ed.) “The candour, penetration, and
                    freedom of this excellent lawyer,” says he, “will ever ensure to this work the
                    esteem of all wise men. But,” he adds, “churchmen are not always of the number.”
                    In the number of the refutations which have appeared, it is only necessary to
                    mention the <hi rend="italic">Rifiessioni nurrali e teologiche</hi><hi
