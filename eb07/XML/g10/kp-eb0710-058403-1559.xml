                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">GLORY</label>, renown or celebrity. The love of renown, or
                    the desire of fame and reputation, appears to be one of the principal springs of
                    human action. Glory, therefore, is not to be contemned, as some of the ancient
                    philosophers affected to teach; but it imports us to regulate our pursuit of it
                    by the dictates of reason; and if the public approbation follow not, the search
                    must be abandoned. We ought to have our judgment well instructed as to what
                    actions are truly glorious, and to remember, that in every important enterprise,
                    as Seneca observes, <hi rend="italic">Recte facti fecisse merces</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">est,</hi><hi rend="italic">officii fructus ipsum officium
                    est,</hi> the reward of a thing well done is to have done it, the fruit of a
                    good office is the office itself. Those who by other methods contrive to place
                    their names in many mouths, show that they rather seek after a great reputation
                    than a good one, and their reward is oftener infamy than fame.</p>
                <p>Men generally, and indeed almost instinctively, affix glory to such actions only
                    as have been produced by an innate desire of public good; and this may be
                    measured by that degree of influence which the thing done has upon the common
                    happiness. If the actions of the hero conduct soonest to glory and with the
                    greatest splendour, and if the victorious general is so great after a signal
                    engagement, it is because the service he has performed is considered as a
                    service done for all; and because we think without reflecting, that he has saved
                    our habitations, our wealth, our children, and every thing that attaches us to
                    life. If the man of science, who in his study has discovered and calculated the
                    motions of the heavenly bodies, who in his alembics has detected some of the
                    secrets of nature, or who has exhibited to mankind a new art, rises with less
                    noise to fame, it is because the service which he renders is more widely
                    diffused, and is often of less service to the present than to succeeding
                    generations.</p>
                <p>The consequences of these two advantages are, therefore, as opposite as the
                    causes are different; and whilst the benefits secured by the warrior appear to
                    exert no more influence, and his glory is obscured, that of a celebrated writer
                    or inventor still increases, and becomes more and more enlarged. His works every
                    day recall his name to the remembrance of those who read them, and thus still
                    add to his celebrity and fame.</p>
                <p>This posthumous fame indeed has been decried by some writers, and, in particular,
                    the author of the <hi rend="italic">Religion of Nature delineated</hi> has
                    treated it as highly irrational and absurd. “In reality,” says he, “the man is
                    not known ever the more to posterity, because his name is transmitted to them;
                    he doth not live, because his name does. When it is said Julius Caesar subdued
                    Gaul, conquered Pompey, &amp;c., it is the same thing as to say, the conqueror
                    of Pompey was Julius Caesar; that is, Caesar and the conqueror of Pompey is the
                    same thing; Caesar is as much known by one designation as by the other. The
                    amount then is only this, that the conqueror of Pompey conquered Pompey; or
                    somebody conquered Pompey; or rather, since Pompey is as little known now as
                    Caesar, somebody conquered somebody. Such a poor business is this boasted
                    immortality, and such is the thing called glory among us! To discerning men this
                    fame is mere air, and what they despise, if not shun.”</p>
                <p>But surely it were to judge a little too curiously to view matters thus. For, as
                    is observed by the judicious author of Fitzosborne’s Letters, although fame with
                    posterity should be, in the strict analysis of it, no other than what is here
                    described, a mere uninteresting proposition, amounting to nothing more than that
                    somebody acted meritoriously; yet it would not necessarily follow, that true
                    philosophy should banish the desire of it from the human breast; since this
                    passion may be, as most certainly it is, wisely implanted in our species,
                    notwithstanding the corresponding object should in reality be very different
                    from what it appears in imagination. Do not many of our most refined and even
                    contemplative pleasures owe their existence to our mistakes? It is but extending
                    some of our senses to a higher degree of acuteness than we now possess them, to
                    make the fairest views of nature, or the noblest productions of art, appear
                    horrid and deformed. To see things as they truly are in themselves, would not
                    always, perhaps, be of advantage to us in the intellectual world, any more than
                    in the natural. But, after all, who shall certainly assure us that the pleasure
                    of virtuous fame dies with its possessor, and reaches not to another scene of
                    existence? There is nothing, it should seem, either absurd or unphilosophical
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193521572" xml:id="kp-eb0710-1572-0585"/>in supposing
                    it possible, at least, that the praises of the good and the judicious, the
                    sweetest music to an honest ear in this world, may be echoed back to the
                    mansions of the next; that the poet’s description of Fame may be literally true,
                    and that though she walks upon earth, she may yet lift her head into heaven.</p>
                <p>To be convinced of the great advantage of cherishing this high regard to
                    posterity, this noble desire of an after life in the breath of others, one need
                    only look back upon the history of the ancient Greeks and Romans. For what other
                    principle was it which produced that exalted strain of virtue in those days,
                    which may well serve, in so many respects, as a model to these? Was it not the
                    <hi rend="italic">consentiens</hi><hi rend="italic">laus bonorum,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">incorrupta</hi><hi rend="italic">vox bene</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >judicantium,</hi> as Cicero calls it, “the concurrent approbation of the good,
                    the uncorrupted applause of the wise,” that animated their most generous
                    pursuits?</p>
                <p>In short, can it be reasonable to extinguish a passion which nature has
                    universally lighted up in the human breast, and which we constantly find burning
                    with greatest strength and brightness in the noblest and best constituted
                    natures? Accordingly, revelation is so far from endeavouring to eradicate the
                    seed which nature has thus deeply implanted, that it rather seems, on the
                    contrary, to cherish and forward the growth thereof. To be “exalted with
                    honour,” and to be “had in everlasting remembrance,” are among the number of
                    those encouragements which the Jewish dispensation offered to the virtuous; and
                    the person from whom the sacred Author of the Christian system received his
                    birth, is herself represented as rejoicing that “all generations would call her
                    blessed.”</p>
