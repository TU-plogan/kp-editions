                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">GENOVESI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Anthony</hi></label>, an
                    eminent Italian writer, was born on the 1st of November 1712, at Castiglione,
                    near Salerno, in the kingdom of Naples. From his earliest years he showed an
                    uncommon capacity; but after receiving such education as his native village
                    could afford, his father obliged him to devote himself to the study of
                    scholastic theology, with a view to the ecclesiastical profession. In a short
                    time he distinguished himself as a proficient in dialectics; but having formed
                    an attachment to a young woman, he was on the point of sacrificing to her all
                    his professional prospects, when his father, who had obtained a knowledge of the
                    circumstance, removed him to another village, where he found a priest who
                    diverted his attention to different objects. Having been afterwards
                    excommunicated by the Archbishop of Conza, for acting a part in a comedy, he
                    returned to Castiglione, where, having found his mistress married, he re-assumed
                    the cassock, and took priest’s orders at Salerno in 1736. Here he soon
                    distinguished himself so much by his talents and knowledge, that the archbishop
                    of this town confided to him the chair of eloquence. At this period Genovesi was
                    a mere school theologian; but a friend of his, a young ecclesiastic, now made
                    him aware that there were sources of knowledge beyond the scholastic sphere,
                    more extensive, more interesting, and more real, than those to which he had
                    hitherto applied. Genovesi entered into this new intellectual world by the
                    perusal of some romances; from these he proceeded to the study of history; and,
                    stepping from one subject to another, he finally applied himself to the study of
                    modern philosophy, and read with attention the works of Leibnitz and Locke. In
                    the hope of acquiring still further information, he repaired to the capital; and
                    as he did not possess the necessary means of maintaining himself there, he
                    resolved to exercise the profession of advocate; but having become disgusted
                    with the details of practice, he soon sacrificed his hopes of fortune to the
                    pleasures of study. He improved his knowledge of the Greek, and of several of
                    the modern languages, attended all the most celebrated professors of the
                    university of Naples, and soon perceived the imperfections of the existing
                    system of public instruction.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the progress which philosophy had made in other countries, the
                    kingdom of Naples was, at that period, in a state almost retrograde, or at least
                    stationary. Genovesi felt this, and he resolved to accomplish certain reforms in
                    the system of education, with a view to the amelioration of the condition of his
                    countrymen. None ever succeeded better in this generous design. Although there
                    existed at Naples a university celebrated for the learning of several of its
                    professors, the pupils had long been accustomed to carry on their studies in
                    private schools. Genovesi having conceived the design of opening one of these
                    seminaries, he procured the appointment of extraordinary professor of
                    metaphysics in the university, in order that he might appear before the public
                    in a known character. He had formed peculiar methods of his own in all the
                    faculties which constitute the philosophical course; and his first essays
                    induced him to publish his <hi rend="italic">Elements of Metaphysics,</hi> of
                    which the first volume appeared in 1743, and afterwards, in 1745, his <hi
                    rend="italic">System of Logic.'</hi></p>
                <p>In these two works he made ample use of the doctrines of Bacon, Descartes,
                    Leibnitz, and Locke; and having substituted philosophical doubt for implicit
                    belief, the observation of nature for the speculations of the schools, and
                    reason for authority, this was sufficient to cause him to be denounced as an
                    infidel, or at least as an irreligious person, by those who still adhered to the
                    scholastic methods. He would probably have fallen a sacrifice to these
                    prejudices, had he not been supported by Galiani, archbishop of Tarentum, grand
                    almoner of the king, and grand master of the university; but notwithstanding
                    this protection, he experienced some trouble and difficulty in obtaining the
                    professorship of moral philosophy: and he was disappointed in an attempt to
                    procure the chair of theology.</p>
                <p>The unjust and obstinate hostility which he suffered on account of his
                    theological works diverted him, for some time, from this dangerous path of
                    inquiry, and brought him back to that of philosophy. He published a continuation
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Elements of Metaphysics,</hi> but, with every new
                    volume, he continued to experience the censures and opposition of the partisans
                    of the scholastic routine. Amongst these were the Cardinal Spinelli, archbishop
                    of Naples, and an Abbé Magli, whom Genovesi covered with ridicule, in his work
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Lettere a</hi><hi rend="italic">un</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Amico</hi><hi rend="italic">Provinciale</hi> In spite of these
                    continual jarrings, Genovesi obtained the approbation and esteem of Pope
                    Benedict XIV., of several cardinals, and of most of the learned men who at that
                    period flourished in Italy. Of this number was Intieri, a Florentine, who having
                    spent a long time at Naples, became much attached to that country. This man, as
                    distinguished for his philanthropical qualities as for the extent and solidity
                    of his acquirements, was still more estimable on account of the use which he
                    made of his fortune. It is to him that Italy is indebted for her first chair of
                    political economy; he founded it, at his own expense, with the sanction of
                    government, in the university of Naples, under three conditions, namely, that
                    the lectures should be given in Italian, that Genovesi should be the first
                    professor, and that, after his death, no ecclesiastic should succeed him.</p>
                <p>Genovesi opened his first course of lectures on the 5th of November 1754, with
                    great success. The novelty and the interest of the subject, the eloquent style
                    and agreeable manner of the professor, attracted a crowd of auditors, and made a
                    deep and lively impression. Nothing, indeed, was talked of but agriculture and
                    commerce. To gratify the taste of the public for these new inquiries, he
                    afterwards published his <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Commerce,</hi> and
                    Carey’s <hi rend="italic">Account of the Trade of England,</hi> translated into
                    Italian by his brother, and enriched with notes by himself. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Lectures on Commerce</hi> was indisputably the most interesting
                    work he had hitherto published. There are some errors, indeed, in his method,
                    and even in his doctrines; but the work contains many important truths relative
                    to every department of public administration, and a good application of analysis
                    to subjects which had not hitherto been sufficiently investigated. Finally, it
                    had the merit of being the first work which introduced into Italy, and
                    particularly into the kingdom of Naples, a taste for the study of political
                    economy.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193518959" xml:id="kp-eb0710-8959-0384"/>
                <p>The great success of these lectures, which were deli-livered in Italian, induced
                    Genovesi to draw up a complete code of philosophy in that language. It was at
                    this time the custom in Italy, and particularly at Naples, to teach every thing
                    in Latin; a practice which prevented knowledge from spreading among those
                    classes to whom that language was not familiar; and the Neapolitans, at that
                    period, wanted education perhaps more than any other people. He had published,
                    in Italian, his <hi rend="italic">Meditationi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Filosofiche,</hi> on religion and morals; and his <hi rend="italic">Lettere
                    Accademiche,</hi> on the utility of the arts and sciences; a treatise written in
                    opposition to the well-known work of Rousseau on that subject. Following out his
                    plan, he began to recast all his Latin works, to improve their form, and to give
                    them a more interesting character. The first which he published was his treatise
                    on <hi rend="italic">Logic;</hi> a work which went through several editions. He
                    afterwards published his <hi rend="italic">Metaphysics,</hi> divided into three
                    parts; the first containing an essay on cosmology, the second on theology, and
                    the third on anthropology. In 1767, he published part of a work on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Science of the Rights and Duties of Man</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but this work was never completed. In all his writings, and particularly
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Meditations</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Letters,</hi>
                    the style is somewhat affected; at the same time they present us with a good
                    exposition of the ideas and systems of the most celebrated philosophers.</p>
                <p>After the suppression of the order of the Jesuits, when it became a question with
                    the government whether they ought to be reinstated in their superintendence of
                    public instruction, Genovesi was consulted, and his advice was, to replace the
                    scholastic chairs by schools of mathematics, physics, and history; and he
                    proposed one chair for the illustration of Cicero’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Offices.</hi></p>
                <p>From the commencement of the year 1763, Genovesi had felt the symptoms of a
                    dangerous malady; but he continued to teach and to write to the last day of his
                    life; and before his death he had the satisfaction of witnessing the great
                    success of his labours. Since the days of Te-lesius and Campanella, no school
                    had attained more credit and celebrity at Naples than that of Genovesi. Pupils,
                    some of them men of the most illustrious rank, flocked to his lectures; and
                    those who heard him generally adopted his ideas and followed his maxims. He
                    handled the most abstruse subjects in the most agreeable manner, and in a style
                    almost poetical; a circumstance which gave him a great command over the
                    attention, as well as over the judgment, of his pupils. Indeed all that Italy
                    has since produced in philosophical and economical science may be said to have
                    originated in the school which he founded. He died of an attack of dropsy, on
                    the 22d of September 1769, aged about fifty-seven.</p>
