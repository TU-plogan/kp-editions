                    celebrated naturalist, surnamed the Pliny of Germany, and, for his time, a
                    prodigy of application, knowledge, and sagacity, was born at Zurich on the 26th
                    March 1516. He was the son of Vasa Gesner, furrier, and Barbara Frick, persons
                    who, besides being poor, had several other children, so that he would not have
                    been able tocontinuehis studies had it not been for the assistance of his
                    maternal uncle John Frick, a minister, who formed his taste for letters, and
                    gave him his first notions in botany, , <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi> ∙n <hi

                    of Zug, where the celebrated reformer Zwinghus also perished, young Gesner found
                    himself obliged to seek his fortune in a foreign country. He accordingly went to
                    Strasburg, where, by means of a salary, he for some time seconded the labours of
                    Capiton; then, having obtained some assistance from the canons of Zurich, he
                    repaired to Bourges, and there commenced the study of medicine. At the age of
                    eighteen, having occasion to visit Paris, he indulged without rule and without
                    restraint his passion for all kinds of study, being assisted in his poverty by
                    John Steiger, a young Bernese of patrician family, with whom he was connected by
                    the ties of friendship. From Paris he returned a second time to Strasburg,
                    whence, in 1536, he was recalled to Zurich to occupy in the college of that
                    place the petty employment of regent. But the magistrates having soon perceived
                    that he was formed for less obscure and more important labours, made him, in
                    1537, a new grant, to enable him to continue his medical studies at Bale; and it
                    was in this latter city that he began to labour for the public by superintending
                    an edition of the Greek Dictionary of Favorinus. The following year, the senate
                    of Berne having founded an academy at Lausanne, Gesner was appointed to that
                    institution, and taught Greek there for three years. He then passed a year at
                    .Montpellier, where he became intimately connected with the celebrated physician
                    Laurent Joubert, and the great naturalist Rondelet. At length, in 1541, he was
                    received as doctor in medicine at Bale, where he completed some extracts from
                    the Greek and Arabian authors on botany and medicine, which were published the
                    same year at Zurich and the succeeding one at Lyons. Soon afterwards, he
                    published a Catalogue of Plants in four languages, in which he gave proofs of
                    very extensive knowledge in botany, and indicated several vegetables which were
                    then new. Some journeys in the Alps of Switzerland and Savoy enabled him to
                    discover other plants which were also new, and led him, in 1542, to write a
                    little book on milk, accompanied by a letter on the beauty of the mountain
                    scenery. The same year he translated from the Greek a Treatise on Syllogisms,
                    and other philosophical works, which were followed in 1543 by the Maxims of
                    Stobaeus, and in 1544 by the Allegories of Heraclides of Pontus, the Discourse
                    of Dion Chyrsostom on Homer, and a purified edition of Martial. In 1545, he made
                    a journey to Venice and to Augsburg, where he formed an acquaintance with
                    several men of merit, and had an opportunity of consulting many rare works and
                    valuable manuscripts. It was then that he began to bring out his famous <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliothèque Universelle,</hi> the first great bibliographical
                    work which the moderns had produced. The titles of all the works then known in
                    Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin, whether extant or lost, and often a summary of
                    their contents, with a judgment of their merits, and some specimens of their
                    style, formed the substance of this collection. The first volume, published at
                    Zurich in 1545, is classed in the alphabetical order of the names of the
                    authors; the second, which is arranged in the order of the materials, and
                    divided into nineteen books, appeared at the same place in 1548, under the title
                    of <hi rend="italic">Pandects</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the twenty-first
                    book, devoted to theology, was published the following year; but the twentieth,
                    which was to treat of works on medicine, has not been printed, because the
                    author did not conceive it so complete as it ought to be, or as the subject
                    required. The Library of Gesner has been abridged by Lycosthenes, and completed
                    by Simler and by Fries, Zurich, 1583, in folio. During the same time, he
                    occupied himself with editions or translations of different small Greek
                    treatises; in particular, he published a corrected edition of Hermolaus Barbaro,
                    a critical Preface on the works of Galen, another on the History of Plants by
                    Tragus, a Treatise on the Mineral Waters of Switzerland and Germany, and a
                    Description of Mount Pilat near Lucerne. But, amidst these diversified labours,
                    he lost nc opportunity of collecting and arranging materials for a great work on
                    Natural History, of which be had conceived the plan from his earliest youth.
                    Numerous friends whom <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520363"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-0363-0492"/>his merit had procured him in almost all Europe,
                    sent him figures and notices of the productions of their various climates, and
                    sometimes the natural objects themselves, which he caused to be painted and
                    engraved. As often as he had leisure, he also travelled in Switzerland and in
                    Germany. He had long desired to visit the coasts of the North Sea, but the
                    religious war which broke out in 1551 constrained him to return home without
                    having accomplished the object of his wishes. Gesner has written on the three
                    kingdoms of nature, but his History of Animals is the most considerable of his
                    works on natural history, and that which will ensure him the most durable
                    reputation. It is divided into five books, which are commonly bound in three
                    volumes folio. The first book, printed originally at Zurich in 1551, treats of
                    viviparous quadrupeds; the second, printed in 1554, of oviparous quadrupeds; the
                    third, printed in 1555, of birds; the fourth, printed in 1556, of fishes and
                    other aquatic animals; and the fifth, a posthumous publication, which appeared
                    at Zurich in the year 1587, of serpents. There was to have been a sixth book on
                    insects, but it is doubtful whether Gesner had commenced preparing it, and
                    all-that remains consists of some inedited figures of butterflies. Besides these
                    first editions of the different parts of the History of Animals, there appeared
                    several others, some of which, considerably amplified, were printed during the
                    author’s lifetime, or after his death, in Latin, German, and French, and also
                    various abridgments under the titles of <hi rend="italic">Icones
                    Animalium,</hi><hi rend="italic">leones Avium,</hi><hi rend="italic">Nomenclator
                    Aquatilium.</hi> &amp;c. In this great work, the author arranges animals in the
                    alphabetical order of their Latin names, and gives details respecting each,
                    divided into eight heads, viz. its denominations in the different languages,
                    ancient and modern; its description, internal as well as external, and the
                    countries it inhabits; the duration of its life and of its growth, with the
                    epoch of its fecundation and birth, and the number produced at a birth; the
                    maladies to which it is subject; its peculiar habits and instincts; its utility;
                    the aliments on which it subsists; the remedies which it supplies; and, lastly,
                    the images which it furnishes to poetry and eloquence, as well as the epithets
                    which have been applied to it. In a word, every thing which the ancient authors,
                    or those of the middle age, have written relative to these details, is
                    introduced under one or other of the heads which we have enumerated; and Gesner
                    also adds, with as much critical sagacity as could be employed in an age when
                    the authority of the ancients was still greatly respected and nature very little
                    known, a vast number of new details derived from his own observations, or
                    communicated by his numerous correspondents. He states many exact facts, which
                    are still deserving of attention, particularly respecting the animals of
                    Switzerland; each species is represented by a figure in wood; and those which
                    the author had caused to be copied from nature are very exactly given; but he
                    was also obliged to borrow some of them from his predecessors, and these are not
                    always remarkable for the same degree of accuracy. The history of fishes,
                    however, is not given altogether on the same plan as that of the others; for
                    here Gesner copies, on each species, the articles of his two friends and
                    contemporaries, Belon and Rondelet, to which he has merely made some additions.
                    As the abridgments appeared after the large treatises, they contain several
                    remarks which are not to be found in the latter; and it is necessary to consult
                    both in order to obtain a complete idea of what was then known on the subject.
                    The History of Animals by Gesner may therefore be considered as the basis of all
                    modern zoology. Copied almost literally by Aldrovand, and abridged by Johnston,
                    it has served as the foundation of works much more recent; and more than one
                    celebrated author has borrowed from it, without acknowledgment, nearly all his
                    erudition; for it is deserving of remark, that the passages in the ancient
                    authors which escaped Geβner have scarcely at all been taken into consideration
                    by the moderns. By his accuracy, his clearness, his good faith, and even in some
                    instances the refinement of his views, Gesner merited this confidence; and
                    although he may not have established genera nor natural classification, yet, in
                    various places, he indicates with tolerable distinctness the true relations of
                    beings. Another important service rendered by Geβner to zoology consists in his
                    edition of a complete translation of the works of Aelian, which he published in
                    1556, immediately after his volume on fishes. His new notes on the text, which
                    had long occupied his attention, appeared for the first time in the edition
                    published by A. Gronovius, London, 1744, two vole, in folio, as those on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Historiée</hi><hi rend="italic">Diversoe</hi> did in the edition
                    of Leyden, 1731, in 4to. Although he has been less fortunate in the publication
                    of his labours on botany, he has perhaps rendered himself even more celebrated
                    in that science by the fecundity of the views which he has introduced into it;
                    for not only was he from his infancy addicted to the collection of plants, and
                    accustomed to rear them, but he soon learned to delineate them, and, in fact,
                    painted more than fifteen hundred, the figures of which he intended for a
                    general history of vegetables. This exercise led him to direct his attention to
                    the numerous details of the flower and the fruit; and he thus succeeded in
                    discovering the art of distinguishing and classing plants by the organs of
                    fructification, an art which has truly created botanical science. In the text be
                    expresses clearly the necessity of attending to characters of this kind in
                    botany. It is to be observed, however, that his <hi rend="italic">Enchiridion
                    Ħistoriae</hi><hi rend="italic">Plantarum,</hi> printed at Paris in 1541, is not
                    deserving of much attention; it is a youthful performance of Gesner, and is
                    merely a compilation. His real botanical works, after having passed in
                    manuscript into different libraries, were, about the middle of the last century,
                    acquired by Trew, a botanist of Nuremberg, and published by Schmiedel, physician
                    to the margrave of Anspach, Nuremberg, 1754 and 1770. They consist of
                    Commentaries on the fifth book of Valerius Cordus, Fragments of a History of
                    Plants, commenced according to the plan of Gesner, by Wolf, his pupil, and a
                    great number of figures which he had designed, with the relative notes and
                    descriptions. The little treatise of Gesner on the figures of fossils, stones,
                    and gems, Zurich, 1565, in8vo, attracted attention to the subject of
                    petrifactions and crystals; and we find from his letters, that he had made
                    experiments on several minerals, and was not ignorant of the electrical
                    qualities of certain precious stones. Lastly, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mithridates de</hi><hi rend="italic">differentiis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Linguarum,</hi> Gesner, not confining himself to the comparison of different
                    languages, threw out several very ingenious ideas respecting language generally,
                    which have since been more fully developed. His own acquisitions as a linguist
                    were in tact very considerable. He possessed a knowledge of the three learned
                    languages, had some tincture of Arabic, understood French, Italian, and Flemish,
                    and had laboured much to improve the German language. So many useful works
                    having secured to Gesner merited consideration, the magistrates of Zurich, in
                    the year 1555, created him public professor of natural history. The Emperor
                    Ferdinand I., who loved the sciences, and to whom Gesner had dedicated his
                    History of Fishes, invited him to Augsburg in 1559, and in 1564 granted him a
                    coat of arms emblematic of his pursuits, and at the same time sent him some
                    fragments of bezoar, a substance which was then regarded as exceedingly
                    precious. But he did not long enjoy these marks of esteem. A pestilential
                    malady, which had commenced at Bâle in the spring of 1564, and extended itself
                    to Zurich, where it re-appeared the following year with great fury, at length
                    smote Gesner. During these two years <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520376"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-0376-0493"/>he had bestowed great care on the persons who were
                    affected with this disease, and had even written a dissertation on the best
                    method of treating it; but a bubo having showed itself under his right armpit,
                    although it occasioned him but little pain, he considered himself as doomed to
                    fall a victim to the prevailing malady; and, accordingly, having caused himself
                    to be carried into his cabinet, that he might put his works in order, he died
                    there, while thus occupied, on the 13th of December 1565, aged only forty-nine
                    years and some months. He bequeathed his library and his manuscripts to Gaspar
                    Wolf, his pupil, whom he charged to publish all that could be extracted from his
                    papers calculated to advance any branch of the natural sciences. <hi

                    his early age he showed few signs of superior abilities; and his progress in the
                    rudiments of education was so slow, that his master gave him up as incapable of
                    any greater attainments than writing and the four elementary rules of
                    arithmetic. He was then placed under the care of a clergyman in the
                    neighbourhood, a relation of his father’s, who showed himself better acquainted
                    with the art of discovering the natural inclinations of his pupils. This
                    gentleman often carried young Gesner with him into the fields, where he made him
                    observe the beauties of nature; and finding that he took great pleasure in such
                    lessons, and seemed to listen to them with peculiar attention, he occasionally
                    repeated some of the most striking passages of the ancient authors, who have
                    written on these subjects in the most agreeable and pleasing manner. By this
                    ingenious artifice, the mind of young Geβner began to open, and its powers to
                    expand; and it is perhaps owing to this circumstance that he became so fond of
                    the language of Virgil and of Theocritus. When he arrived at a proper age to
                    think of following some pursuit or business, Gesner made choice of that of
                    bookseller, which was the profession of his father, and in some measure of his
                    family. Of five houses at Zurich engaged in the printing and bookselling
                    business, two were occupied by Gesners; one belonged to two brothers of that
                    name; and the other, that in which our poet had a share, was known by the
                    denomination of Orel, Gesner, and Company. It was known also by the extent of
                    its correspondence, and by the choice and elegance of the works which it gave to
                    the public.</p>
                <p>Though Gesner was a bookseller, he did not, however, damp his genius by
                    submitting to the drudgery of business. He indulged himself freely in pursuing
                    his favourite object, and his partners never envied him that time which he
                    devoted to meditation and study. In 1752, he made a tour through Germany, not so
                    much for the purpose of extending his commerce, as to see and become acquainted
                    with those authors who had done honour to their country. The following
                    circumstance, which occurred during this tour, deserves to be mentioned, as it
                    is strikingly characteristic of the timidity which often accompanies true
                    genius. When Gesner was at Berlin, he was admitted into a literary society, of
                    which Gleim and Lessing were members. Each of the authors who composed it used
                    to read in turn some pieces of their own composition, and Gesner felt desirous
                    of submitting to these able critics a small work, which was his first attempt;
                    but he was far from resembling those poets whom Horace and other satirists have
                    ridiculed, and who stun every one they meet by reciting their verses. As each of
                    the members had done reading, Gesner was observed to move his hand with a kind
                    of tremor towards his pocket, and to draw it back again without bringing out the
                    manuscript which he ought to have produced. Having net as yet published any
                    thing, none of the company could guess the cause of a motion which his modesty
                    prevented him from explain-; ing. The work which he had not the courage to
                    show</p>
                <p>• was his small poem entitled Night, which he published</p>
                <p>• on his return to Zurich in 1753. It was considered as an original, of which no
                    model is to be found among the mo- , dems; but in the opinion of the author, it
                    was only a &gt; piece of imaginary painting, or, to use an expression of ’ his
                    own, in one of his letters to Huber, who has translated i his works, “a
                    caricature composed in the moments of , folly or intoxication.” In this little
                    poem he has intro- 1 duced a short episode on the origin of the glow-worm,</p>
                <p>! containing a poetical explanation of this natural phos-! phorus, which has all
                    the beauty of Ovid’s Metamorphoses, without their prolixity. The success of this
                    essay emboldened the too timid muse of our young bookseller, and he published a
                    pastoral romance called Daphnis, in three cantos. The applause which was
                    deservedly bestowed upon this performance induced the author to publish, some
                    time after, his Idylls and other rural poems, in imitation of those of
                    Theocritus. Pastoral poetry, which at this time was little known in Germany
                    except by translations from foreign poets, began to find many partisans, and to
                    ’ be preferred to every other kind. Desirous, therefore, of tracing out a new
                    path for himself, our poet thought that he could not do a more acceptable
                    service to his countrymen than by painting the felicity and innocence of rural
                    life, and the tender emotions of love and gratitude. The only author worthy of
                    notice who had preceded Gesner in this career was Rost of Leipsic, whose
                    pastoral poems appeared for the first time in 1744. This writer polished the
                    language of the German shepherds; and he had address enough to unite spirit and
                    simplicity in a kind of writing which is insipid without the one, and which
                    becomes unnatural and disgusting if it want the other. He sometimes throws a
                    delicate veil over those images which are deficient in decency, but it is to be
                    regretted that it is of- ' ten much too light. Such was the antagonist against
                    whom</p>
                <p>Gesner had to contend. Our poet, however, pursued a different course. Instead of
                    placing, like Rost, his scenes in modern times, he goes back, with Theocritus,
                    to that ' happy age which we are fond of reviewing when our passions are calm,
                    and when, freed from those anxious cares which hurry us beyond ourselves, we
                    contemplate amidst tranquillity the beauty and fertility of nature. The
                    characters of Gesner’s Idylls, therefore, are taken from those societies which
                    exist no longer except in the remembrance, or rather the imagination. His
                    shepherds are fathers, children, and husbands, who blush not at these titles so
                    dear to nature, and to whom generosity, beneficence, and respect for the Deity,
                    are sentiments no less familiar than love. These Idylls were the principal and
                    favourite object of his pursuit, and that part of his works which acquired him
                    the greatest reputation, especially amongst his countrymen. His Death of Abel,
                    which is well known, was published for the first time in the year 1758. It is
                    written, like the rest of his pieces, in poetical prose, and was so much sought
                    after, that it went through no less than three editions in the space of a year,
                    without speaking of the spurious ones which appeared in Holland, at Berlin, and
                    in France. The French edition was followed by several others. One came out in
                    Italian; another in the Dutch language; another in the Danish; and, lastly, two
                    in English, one of them in prose and the other in verse. Amongst the pieces
                    which Gesner published after the Death of Abel was his First Navigator, a poem
                    in three cantos, which many people in Germany consider as his masterpiece. He
                    made an attempt also in the pastoral drama, but not with the same success as in
                    other kinds of rural poetf ’ y. He produced likewise, in the same style, Evander
                    and Al-cimne, in three act»; and Erastus, a small piece of one <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193520389" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0389-0494"/>act, which was represented
                    with some applause in several societies, both at Leipsic and Vienna.</p>
                <p>But though poetry was Gesner’s darling pursuit, and though he enriched the
                    literature of his country with works which will render his name immortal, he did
                    not confine himself to one manner of imitating nature; he in turns took up the
                    pencil and the pen, and his active genius equally directed both. In his infancy
                    he had received a few lessons in drawing, and he had afterwards pursued this
                    study, but without any intention of becoming an artist. At the age of thirty he
                    felt that violent desire which may be considered as the voice of genius; and
                    this was in some measure excited by the sight of a beautiful collection formed
                    by Heidegger, whose daughter he had married. To please his father-in-law, he
                    studied this treasure, composed principally of the best pieces of the Flemish
                    school; and to this new taste he had almost sacrificed every other. Gesner at
                    first ventured only to delineate some decorations for the frontispieces of
                    curious books printed in his office; but by degrees he acquired the courage to
                    make other attempts. In 1765, hepublished ten landscapes etched and engraved by
                    himself, and dedicated them to his friend Watlet. Gesner owed him this mark of
                    respect for the care which he had taken to ornament with beautiful vignettes
                    Huber’s translation of his Idylls. Twelve other pieces appeared in 1769; and
                    after these attempts, Gesner executed ornaments for many works which came from
                    his presses, amongst which were his own works, a German translation of Swift,
                    and several other productions.</p>
                <p>Were we to judge from Gesner’s enthusiasm for his favourite pursuits, and from
                    the time and attention which he bestowed upon them, we should be apt to conclude
                    that he had found but little leisure for discharging his duty as a citizen. The
                    contrary, however, was the case; for he passed almost the half of his life in
                    the first employment of the state. In 1765 he was called to the grand council,
                    and in 1767 to the lesser. In 1768 he was appointed bailiff of Elibach, in 1776
                    head of the four guards, and in 1781 superintendent of waters, which office was
                    in 1787 continued to him for six years. In all these stations Gesner discharged
                    his duty with the most scrupulous fidelity, and died of a paralytical disorder,
                    lamented by his countrymen and by those who had the pleasure of his
                    acquaintance, on the 2d of March 1788, at the age of fifty-six.</p>
