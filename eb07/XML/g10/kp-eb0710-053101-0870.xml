                <p><label type="entry">GLAMORGANSHIRE</label>, a county of South Wales, stretching,
                    in a circular line, along the northern shore of the Bristol Channel, from east
                    to west about forty-two miles, and extending to the mountains in some parts to
                    the distance of twenty-two or twenty-three miles. It is bounded on the north by
                    Caermarthen and Brecknock, on the east by Monmouthshire, and on the south and
                    west by the Bristol Channel. Its whole area is 822 miles, or 526,080 statute
                    acres, in which are included the watercourses, roads, and sites of buildings,
                    which occupy a large surface.</p>
                <p>The county may be divided into two districts of a very opposite character,
                    according to the nature of the soil, rather than into those ten hundreds by
                    which its parts are politically denominated. About one half the county, on the
                    sea-shore, is rich and fertile land, and produces excellent crops of wheat,
                    oats, beans, and barley. The soil is generally of moderate consistence, and of a
                    loamy nature, some parts being mixed with day, others with sand, and almost all
                    resting on a calcareous substratum. It is easily ploughed, very friable, and,
                    when laid down in grass, yields excellent herbage, by which many cattle are
                    fattened, and much good butter is made. The manure principally used is lime,
                    which is rendered very cheap from the vicinity of coals to the limestone
                    district.</p>
                <p>The inland part of the county rises gradually from hills to mountains, and in
                    that district the agriculture is in a very backward state. The soil between
                    these hills and mountains is composed generally of a black peat, but sometimes
                    of a brown gravelly earth. Lime applied to the former is beneficial for a few
                    years, but its good effect then ceases; and having but little cattle to make
                    manure, and that manure being neglected to be preserved with due <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193520883" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0883-0532"/>care, the agricultural
                    produce of the district is insufficient for the subsistence of the inhabitants.
                    On some of the mountain farms the land is sowed with corn as long as it will
                    yield any increase without fallow or manure, and when so far exhausted it is
                    left without cultivation for many years. Much of the unenclosed mountain tract
                    is devoted wholly to feeding sheep, and the occupiers of land around them having
                    rights of common without stint, so overstock them, that the animals seldom
                    attain their full growth; but when removed to better pasture, and fattened,
                    their mutton is excellent. The farms are mostly of very small value, varying in
                    rent from L.5toL.200 annually; the average of the whole is not L.50, though in
                    many instances the rent has been tripled, and even quadrupled, within the last
                    twenty years. The ploughing is generally executed by oxen, and their ploughs
                    being of clumsy construction, sometimes six or eight are used to perform the
                    work, and yet perform it ill; in some cases two, in others four, are harnessed
                    to plough with two horses .before them. The most commendable part of the rural
                    economy of the county is the construction of the houses, barns, and other
                    farming erections. These are solidly and substantially built, and being
                    uniformly white-washed on the outside, have a clean and neat appearance.</p>
                <p>The agriculture of this county, valuable as it is in the more southern part, is
                    the least productive source of its riches. The greater part of it abounds with
                    minerals, which, owing to the great extension of good roads, of navigable canals
                    and railways, within the last few years, have become a most important source of
                    wealth. The northern and middle parts of the county comprehend a portion of that
                    great mineral tract which begins at Pontypool in Monmouthshire, and terminates
                    at St Bride’s Bay in Pembrokeshire. The exterior stratum or boundary consists of
                    a bed of limestone, within which are contained all the strata of the other
                    minerals in the following position. On the north side of a line drawn from east
                    to west through the middle of the district, all the strata rise gradually to the
                    north, and on the south side of the same line they rise to the south till they
                    come to the surface, except at the east end, where they rise to the eastward. In
                    the centre of this tract, the iron and coal mines in the vicinity of
                    Myrthr-Tydvil are both the richest and most abundant. The whole of the coal is
                    at the depth of 440 feet beneath the surface of the ground, which is composed of
                    argillaceous strata, with occasional veins of hard rock. The coal is about
                    fifty-two feet deep, the thickness of the veins varying from twelve inches to
                    nine feet in thickness. The ironstone lies under the stone at a depth of about
                    108 feet, and is separated by argillaceous earth and stone into eighteen
                    different veins, each about four feet ten inches in thickness. When this ore is
                    smelted, it yields iron to the amount of three tenths of the weight of the
                    ore.</p>
                <p>Coal is found in vast quantities both in the north and south divisions of the
                    county, but of different natures. That in the south is of the bituminous kind,
                    or coaking coal, like the coals of Newcastle. That of the north (when large,
                    called stone-coal and small culm) is difficult to kindle, burns slowly, but
                    emits an intense heat with little or no smoke, and without being distended. This
                    latter is principally used by the maltsters and lime-burners.</p>
                <p>Although the abundance and excellence of the coal and iron have caused the
                    erection of blast-furnaces in many parts of the county, yet the largest and most
                    numerous are those near the recently-built town of Myrthr-Tydvil, which, within
                    a few years, has grown up from an obscure village to be the most populous
                    village in the whole principality of Wales, and contained, in 1811, 11,000, and
                    in 1831, 22,000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>There are seventeen blast-furnaces near this place, each of which can make from
                    100 to 180 tons of iror weekly. The most extensive of the works, that of
                    Cyfar-tha, belonging to Messrs Crawshay and Company, produce annually upwards of
                    20,000 tons of pig-iron, and somewhat more bar-iron. The fires of the furnaces
                    are blown by a steam-engine of fifty horse power, and an overshot wheel of fifty
                    feet in diameter, which requires twenty-five tons of water each minute to keep
                    it at work. The number of men employed at Messrs Crawshay’s work is from 1500 to
                    2000, making, with their families, more than three thousand persons, whose
                    yearly wages amount to more than L.140,000.</p>
                <p>The next considerable manufactory is that commonly called tin plates. The
                    cheapness of iron and coal causes the tin of Cornwall to be sent here, and
                    spread over those iron plates, which are afterwards dispersed all over the
                    world.</p>
                <p>In like manner, the copper ore from Cornwall, from North Wales, and from Ireland,
                    is attracted to Glamorganshire by the cheapness of coal; and it is smelted in
                    works upon a most extensive scale, in the vicinity of Aberavon, Neath, and
                    Swansea, whence it is forwarded by water-carriage to the places where it
                    receives its final appropriations to the several purposes for which it is
                    wanted. There are some extensive manufactories of earthen ware, which are
                    increasing in their operations; and small concerns adapted for making soap,
                    salt, and woollen cloths.</p>
                <p>The most considerable exported production from this county is coals from the
                    ports of Swansea and Neath. At the former of these ports, the facility of
                    loading vessels is so great, that ships of three hundred tons burden enter with
                    one tide, are loaded and enabled to sail sometimes the next, but usually the
                    next tide but one. The quantity annually exported amounts to about 450,000 tons,
                    and more might be shipped, but for some superior privileges in the city of
                    Bristol, which favour the coal-mines of Monmouthshire and Gloucestershire.</p>
                <p>The rivers of Glamorganshire are, ls&lt;, The Taf or Tave, over which is the
                    celebrated bridge of one arch, supposed to be the largest in the world, being
                    one hundred and forty feet in the span, planned and executed by an untaught
                    country mason, a native of the county; 2d, the Elay, a stream of short course,
                    near Llantrissent; 3d, the Ogmore, crossing the county, and entering the sea
                    near Bridgend; 4fΛ, the Nedd or Neath, passing from Brecknockshire, through most
                    romantic valleys, by Neath, to the sea at Britton Ferry; and, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ι&gt;th,</hi> the Tawy, which discharges itself into Swansea Bay.</p>
                <p>As these rivers are scarcely navigable, and the two which are so, but for a short
                    distance, canals have been constructed for the conveyance of the heavy
                    productions of the county, and have produced a wonderful effect both on its
                    wealth and population. These are the Cardiff Canal, which affords water-carriage
                    from Myrthr-Tydvil to Pe-narth Bay; the Neath Canal, which traverses the county
                    from south to north; and the Swansea Canal, which runs to the north till it
                    reaches Brecknockshire. The number of railroads communicating between the
                    iron-works and coal-mines and the canals are too numerous to admit of being
                    enumerated, and have proved very beneficial undertakings both to the
                    constructors and to the public.</p>
                <p>The peasantry of this county generally use the Welsh language, and either cannot
                    or will not speak English. In the towns, however, the latter is very commonly
                    spoken, and in the churches the service is occasionally conducted in it. There
                    is, however, a portion of the county, to the south of the mountains round Oxwich
                    Bay, where the Welsh language is quite unknown, whilst, on the opposite side of
                    the same mountains, the inhabitants are unacquainted with English.</p>
                <p>Glamorganshire returns to the House of Commons two members for the county, and
                    one for the newly created·</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520896" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0896-0533"/>
                <p>borough of Myrthr-Tydvil, and also one for the old united boroughs of Cardiff,
                    Cowbridge, and Llantrissent. The population returns of the four decennial
                    censuses give the inhabitants in 1801, 71,525; in 1811, 85,067; in 1821,
                    101,737; and in 1831, 126,200.</p>
                <p>The county town is Cardiff, and it-is the chief place for shipping the iron of
                    Myrthr-Tydvil. Its pier is now accessible for ships of two hundred tons, but
                    some improvements are in progress which will enlarge the harbour, and adapt it
                    for the reception of vessels of a greater draught of water than can now reach
                    it. The chief towns, and their population, are as follow :—Myrthr-Tydvil,
                    22,083; Swansea, 13,256; Cardiff, 6187; Neath, 4034; Llansamlet, 3187; and
                    Llantrissent, 2789. Landaff, though a city and the seat of a bishop, has only
                    1299 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>As the picturesque beauty of many parts of the county is very great, it has ever
                    been the favourite resort of many families of respectability. That it was so in
                    ancient times, the number of ruins of ancient castles clearly evince; and few
                    parts of the island, excepting the immediate vicinity of the metropolis, have so
                    many gentlemen’s seats within them. The principal of these are, Gnoll Castle,
                    the seat of the Mackworths, now Mr Grant; Cardiff Castle, Marquis of Bute;
                    Dunraven, Thomas Wyndham, Esq.; Penlline Castle, Lord Vernon; Margram, Mr
                    Talbot; Classmont, Sir John Morris; Southall, John Lucas, Esq.; Gellyhir, Sir
                    Gabriel Powell; Penllergaer, John Llewelyn, Esq.; Penrice Castle, R. Μ. Talbot,
                    Esq.; Woodlands, General Ward; and Penderi, Thomas Morgan, Esq.; with many
                    others.</p>
