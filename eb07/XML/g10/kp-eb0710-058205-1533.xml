                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">GLAZING</label>, the encrusting of earthen ware with a
                    vitreous substance, the basis of which is lead.</p>
                <p>The workers of common earthen ware, however, are not at the trouble of thus
                    previously making a pure glass of lead. Their usual composition for glazing ware
                    is formed, of white sand forty pounds, of red lead twenty pounds, of pearl ashes
                    twenty pounds, and of common salt twelve pounds. The sand is powdered by
                    grinding, and then the other ingredients are added and ground together; after
                    which they are calcined for some time with a moderate heat, and when the mixture
                    is cold it is reduced to powder, and when wanted for use tempered with water.
                    The proportion of these ingredients may be occasionally varied. The ware, after
                    being turned on the wheel and dried in the open air, is covered over with the
                    above composition by means of a brush; and when set in the furnace the violent
                    heat soon reduces it to a perfect glass, covering the whole internal and
                    external surface of the vessel.</p>
                <p>We may observe in general, however, that lead ought to be excluded from the
                    composition of glazings, and other fluxes substituted in its stead. A
                    transparent glazing may be prepared without lead, by calcining forty pounds of
                    white sand, twenty-five pounds of pearl ashes, and fifteen pounds of common
                    salt, and proceeding as before; and a more perfect transparent glazing may be
                    made of sand forty pounds, of wood ashes perfectly burned fifty pounds, of pearl
                    ashes ten pounds, and of common salt twelve pounds. The receipts annexed are
                    taken for the most part from Kunckel, who says that they are the true glazings
                    used at Delft, and in other Dutch manufactories.</p>
                <p>Black is made of red lead eight parts, iron filings three parts, copper ashes
                    three parts, and zaffer two measures. This when melted makes a brown black; and
                    if it be wanted blacker, more zaffer must be added to it.</p>
                <p>Blue is thus prepared; take lead ashes or red lead one pound, clear sand or
                    powdered flints two pounds, common salt two pounds, white calcined tartar one
                    pound, Venice or other glass half a pound, zaffer half a pound; mix them well
                    together and melt them several times, quenching them always in cold water. If it
                    be desired to have it fine and good, put the mixture into a glass furnace for a
                    day or two.</p>
                <p>Another blue glazing may be formed of one pound of tartar, a quarter of a pound
                    of red lead, half an ounce of zaffer, and a quarter of a pound of powdered
                    flints, which must be fused and managed as in the last receipt. Or, take two
                    pounds of calcined lead and tin, add five pounds of common salt, five pounds of
                    powdered flints, and of zafſer, tartar, and Venetian glass, each one pound;
                    calcine and fuse the mixture as before. Or, again, take of red lead one part, of
                    sand three parts, and of zaffer one part. For a violet-blue glazing, take four
                    ounces of tartar, two ounces of red lead, five ounces of powdered flints, and
                    half a drachm of manganese.</p>
                <p>Brown is made of red lead and flints, of each fourteen parts, and of manganese
                    two parts, fused; or of red lead twelve parts, and manganese one part, fused. A
                    brown glazing, to be laid on a white ground, mav be made of manganese two parts,
                    and of red lead and white glass one part of each, twice fused. Flesh-coloured is
                    made of twelve parts of lead ashes, and one of white glass. To prepare the
                    gold-coloured, take of litharge three parts, of sand or calcined flint one part;
                    pound and mix these well together, then run them into a yellow glass with a
                    strong fire. Pound <pb break="no" facs="nls:193521546"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-1546-0583"/>this glass, and grind it into a subtile powder,
                    which moisten with a well-saturated solution of silver; form it into a paste,
                    then put it into a crucible, and cover it with a lid. Apply at first a gentle
                    degree of fire; then increase, and continue it until a green glass has been
                    obtained. Pound this glass again, and grind it to a fine powder; moisten the
                    powder,with some beer, so that by means of a hair pencil you may apply it upon
                    the vessels or any piece of earthen ware. The vessels which are painted or
                    covered over with this glazing must first be well heated, then put under a
                    muffle; and as soon as the glass runs, they must be smoked, by holding them over
                    burning vegetables, and then taken out. Heinsius of St Petersburg, who sent this
                    receipt to the Royal Society, uses the words <hi rend="italic">afflare debes
                    fumum,</hi> which is rendered “smoke them,” in the transactions. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.</hi> No. 465, sect. 6.)</p>
                <p>Kunckel gives several preparations for a gold-coloured yellow glazing. This may
                    be produced by fusing a mixture of three parts of red lead, two parts of
                    antimony, and one part of saffron of Mars; by again melting the powdered mass,
                    and repeating the operation four times; or by fusing four or five times a
                    composition of red lead and antimony of each an ounce, and of scales of iron
                    half an ounce; or by calcining and fusing together eight parts of red lead, six
                    parts of flints, one part of yellow ochre, one part of antimony, and one part of
                    white glass. A transparent gold-coloured glazing may be obtained by twice fusing
                    red lead and white flints, of each twelve parts, and of filings of iron one
                    part.</p>
                <p>Green may be prepared from eight parts of litharge or red lead, eight parts of
                    Venice glass, and four parts of brass dust or filings of copper; or from ten
                    parts of litharge, twelve of flint or pebble, and one of <hi rend="italic"
                    >as</hi><hi rend="italic">ustum</hi> or copper ashes. A fine green glazing may
                    also be produced by fusing one part of the Bohemian granate, one part of filings
                    of copper, one part of red lead, and one part of Venetian glass; or by fusing
                    one part of white glass, and the same quantity of red lead, and of filings of
                    copper, powdering the mass, and adding one part of Bohemian granate to two parts
                    of this powder. A fine green may likewise be obtained by mixing and grinding
                    together any of the yellow glazings with equal quantities of the blue glazings;
                    and all the shades and teints of green will be obtained by varying the
                    proportion of the one to the other, and by the choice of the kind of yellow and
                    blue.</p>
                <p>Sea-green is made of five pounds of lead ashes, one pound of tin ashes, three
                    pounds of flint, three quarters of a pound of salt, half a pound of tartar, and
                    half a pound of copper dust. Iron colour is prepared from fifteen parts of lead
                    ashes or red lead, fifteen of white sand or flints, and five of calcined copper.
                    This mixture must be calcined and fused. Liver colour is prepared from twelve
                    parts of litharge, eight of salt, six of pebble or flint, and one of manganese.
                    Purple brown consists of lead ashes fifteen parts, clean sand or powdered flints
                    eighteen parts, manganese one part, and white glass fifteen measures, to which
                    some add one measure of zaffer. Red is made of antimony three pounds, litharge
                    or red lead three, and rust of iron one, which are ground to a fine powder; or
                    take two pounds of antimony, three of red lead, and one of calcined saffron of
                    Mars, and proceed as before.</p>
                <p>The white glazing for common ware is made of forty pounds of clear sand,
                    seventy-five pounds of litharge or lead ashes, twenty-six of potashes, and ten
                    pounds of salt; and these are thrice melted into a cake, quenching it each time
                    in clear cold water. Jθr it may be made of fifty pounds of clean sand, seventy
                    of lead ashes, thirty of wood ashes, and twelve of salt. For a fine white, take
                    two pounds of lead and one of tin; calcine them to ashes; of this take two
                    parts, calcined flint, white sand, or broken white glass, one part, and salt one
                    part; mix them well together and melt them into a cake for use. The trouble of
                    calcining the tin and lead may be prevented by procuring them in a proper state.
                    A very fine white glazing may be obtained by calcining two parts of lead and one
                    part of tin; and taking one part of this mass, and of flints and common salt one
                    part each, and fusing the mixture. A white glazing may also be prepared by
                    mixing a hundred pounds of mastico, sixty pounds of red lead, twenty pounds of
                    calcined tin or putty, and ten pounds of common salt, and calcining and
                    powdering the mixture several times.</p>
                <p>Yellow is prepared of red lead three pounds, calcined antimony and tin two pounds
                    of each; or, according to some, of equal quantities of the three ingredients.
                    These must be melted into a cake, then ground to a fine powder, and this
                    operation must be repeated several times; or it may be made of fifteen parts of
                    lead ore, three parts of litharge of silver, and fifteen parts of sand. A fine
                    yellow glazing may be procured by mixing five parte of red lead, two parte of
                    powdered brick, one part of sand, one part of the white glazings, and two parts
                    of antimony, calcining the mixture and then fusing it. Or take four parts of
                    white glass, one part of antimony, three parts of red lead, and one part of iron
                    scales, and fuse the mixture; or fuse sixteen parts of flints, one part of iron
                    filings, and twenty-four parte of litharge. A light-yellow glazing may be
                    produced with ten parte of red lead, three parte of antimony and three of glass,
                    and two parte of calcined tin. A citronyellow is made of six parts of red lead,
                    seven parte of fine red brick dust, and two parts of antimony. This mixture must
                    be calcined day and night for the space of four days, in the ash-hole of a
                    glass-house furnace, and at last urged to fusion.</p>
                <p>The Romans had a method of glazing their earthen vessels, which in many respects
                    appears to have been superior to ours. The common brown glazing easily scales
                    off, cracks, and in a short time becomes disagreeable to the eye; besides, it is
                    very easily destroyed by acids, nor can vessels glazed in this manner be even
                    employed to hold water, without part of it oozing through their pores. Lead is
                    also very destructive to the human body; and if acids are unwarily put into
                    vessels glazed with lead, the liquors will receive a dangerous impregnation from
                    the metal. The Roman glazing, which is still to be seen upon urns excavated in
                    several places, appears to have been made of some kind of varnish; and Pliny
                    gives us a hint that it was made of bitumen. He tells us that it never lost its
                    beauty, and that at length it became customary to glaze over statues in this
                    manner. As this varnish sunk deep into the substance of the ware, it was not
                    subject to those cracks and flaws which disfigure our vessels; and as it was not
                    liable to be corroded by acids, it was not subject to any of the accidents which
                    may ensue from the use of vessels glazed with lead.</p>
