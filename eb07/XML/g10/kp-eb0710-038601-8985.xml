                    a physician eminent for his chemical and botanical knowledge, was born at Paris
                    on the 13th of February 1672, where his father kept an apothecary’s shop, and
                    had been several times in the magistracy. He received a liberal education; and,
                    whilst prosecuting the study of medicine, he had conferences at his father’s
                    house with Cassini, Duveracy, Homberg, and other men of distinguished eminence.
                    At Montpellier he attended the lectures of the ablest professors of physic, and
                    afterwards visited the south of France, carefully viewing every object deserving
                    of his attention. He accompanied Count de Tallard to England in 1698, where he
                    became acquainted with the leading men of science, and was admitted a member of
                    the Royal Society. He next went into Holland, and in 1700 he accompanied the
                    Abbé de Louvois in a tour to Italy. On his return, he became a licentiate in
                    1702, and, in two years after, he was created doctor of medicine. One of his
                    theses was <hi rend="italic">A vermibus hominum ortus interitus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">î</hi> which was translated into French under this title, Si <hi
                    rend="italic">ſHomme a commence par</hi><hi rend="italic">être</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vers î iot</hi> the sake of some ladies of high rank, by whom it
                    was deemed interesting.</p>
                <p>Geoffroy did not hastily commence the practice of medicine, continuing the
                    prosecution of his studies in retirement for some years. He appeared nowise
                    anxious to push himself forward, although his knowledge made him often be
                    consulted by several gentlemen of the faculty; and he felt so concerned for the
                    recovery of his patients, that it imparted to him an air of melancholy, which at
                    first alarmed them, till they became acquainted with the cause. In 1709, he was
                    appointed by the king professor of physic to the Royal College, vacant by the
                    death of the celebrated Tournefort, and began with lectures on Materia Medica;
                    but in 1712, Fagon resigned to him the chemical chair, and on both subjects
                    Geoffroy lectured with unwearied assiduity. He was twice chosen as dean by the
                    faculty of Paris, and from the year 1699 he filled a place in the Royal Academy
                    of Sciences. Anxious to discharge his various functions with credit, his health
                    at last sunk under fatigue, and he died upon the 5th of January 1731. He is
                    known to the chemical world by his table of affinities, which is far superior to
                    any that had appeared before his time. His greatest work was his <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Materia</hi><hi rend="italic">Medica,</hi> which
                    was published in an unfinished state, after his death, Paris, 1741, in 3 vols.
                    8vo. This learned and laborious author enriched the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoires</hi> of the Academy of Sciences with different articles, the
                    princitial of which were, 1. Table des Différents Rapports observes en Chimie
                    entre différents Substances, and Eclaircissements sur cette Table, 1718 and
                    1720; 2. Observations sur le Vitriol et sur le Fer, 1713; 3. Sur les
                    Dissolutions et sur les Fermentations que l’on peut appeler froides, parce
                    quelles sont accompagnées du refroidissement des Liqueurs dans lesquelles elles
                    se passent, 1700; 4. Examen des eaux de Vichy et de Bourbon l’Archambault, 1702;
                    5. Détail de la manière dont se fait l’Alun de roche en Italie et en Angleterre,
                    1702.</p>
