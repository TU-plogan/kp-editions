                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    Sempronius</hi></label>, the son of Tiberius. Gracchus, who had been censor,
                    twice consul, and had triumphed twice. His mother was the celebrated Cornelia,
                    daughter of Scipio Africanus the Elder, and she was left by the death of her
                    husband with the charge of no fewer than twelve children. She lost all except
                    three; one daughter, married to Scipio the Younger, and two sons, Caius and
                    Tiberius. Tiberius was born about 163 B. c. and was murdered 133 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> He began early to exhibit proofs of great talents,
                    and his mother appears to have cultivated his mind by every means in her power.
                    He was distinguished from his brother Caius by his mildness of manner and the
                    dignity of his deportment. The language of Tiberius was chaste and polished;
                    that of Caius exhibited more of pretension and splendour. The two brothers,
                    however, were equally attentive to their duty as magistrates, and in their
                    self-government in respect to pleasure they were perfectly alike. Tiberius
                    served his first campaign under Scipio the Younger in Africa <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(b.</hi> c. 146), and made himself much beloved by the army. He
                    was some time afterwards <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi> 137) appointed
                    quaestor, and attended the consul C. Mancinus in the Numan-tian war. This consul
                    was one of the most unfortunate generals the Romans ever had, and conducted
                    matters so ill that he and his whole army were obliged to submit to conditions
                    of peace imposed by the Numantians. That people refused to treat with any one
                    except Tiberius Gracchus, and he was employed to draw up the articles of peace.
                    The peace, however, was disavowed at Rome, and Mancinus was delivered up to the
                    Numantians naked and in chains. Tiberius was spared, chiefly through the
                    interest and influence of Scipio, his brother-in-law. It was now that Tiberius
                    entered on the stormy path of politics, and the measure which he first advocated
                    was of a magnitude suited to the part he intended to act in the affairs of his
                    country. It was to restrain the avarice of the rich, and to compel them to give
                    up the possession of the public lands, of which they had unjustly become
                    masters. Caius Laelius, the friend of Scipio, had attempted to correct this
                    disorder; but, frightened by the opposition of men in power, he gave up the
                    undertaking. No sooner, however, had Tiberius been elected tribune of the
                    people, than he determined to make an attempt to restore their share of the
                    public lands to the poor. No law could have been of a milder nature than that
                    which he proposed to introduce; for, instead of punishing those who had
                    infringed the rights of the community, they were to receive a sum of money for
                    foregoing their groundless claims. Nothing, however, could induce the rich to
                    listen for a moment to the proposal; and, like all reformers of abuses, he was
                    accused of attempting to throw the country into disorder, and to subvert the
                    constitution of the state. Incensed at this, Tiberius no longer kept on terms
                    with his opponents, but proposed another law of a severer character, which
                    commanded all toquitthe lands which they held contrary to law. This law was
                    confirmed by the people, and three commissioners were appointed to survey the
                    public domain. Tiberius, his brother Caius, and his father-in-law Appius
                    Claudius, received orders to make the survey. If he had contented himself with
                    the passing of this measure, we should have regarded him as a patriot rather
                    than a demagogue; but his position had now become so critical, and his enemies
                    so numerous, that he was urged forward in his career by a regard to his own
                    personal safety rather than by a reference to the good of the republic. In
                    retiring to a private station he would have been exposed to the vengeance of his
                    enemies, and he could not expect to be re-elected tribune, unless by some new
                    proof of his devotion to the popular cause. He therefore proposed laws for
                    shortening the time of military service, and for granting an appeal from the
                    judges to the people. As the bench of judges consisted entirely of senators, he
                    proposed that an equal number of knights and senators should be admitted. On the
                    day when these laws were to be put to the vote, his opponents resolved to create
                    a disturbance, during which they would have an opportunity of putting him to
                    death. Tiberius became acquainted with it during the meeting of the assembly,
                    and as there was great clamour, he had no other way of communicating the
                    information than by touching his head with his hand, to signify the danger he
                    was in. Some one ran to the senate and informed them that Tiberius had demanded
                    a diadem of the people. This excited a great commotion in the senate, and Scipio
                    Nasica rushed out with numerous attendants, and having put the people to flight,
                    killed Tiberius in the Forum. (Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">Life of Tiberius
                    Gracchus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Liv. <hi rend="italic">Epit.</hi> 58.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gracchus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Caius</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sempronius,</hi> was nine years younger than bis elder brother Tiberius, having
                    been born in the year <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 154. He had as yet taken
                    no part in public affairs when his brother was murdered, but he soon showed that
                    he did not intend to lead a life of idleness. He cultivated his powers of
                    eloquence, and the senate began to have apprehensions of his succeeding to the
                    power of his brother. They were not therefore sorry when he was appointed
                    quaestor to the consul Aurelius Orestes, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 126, in
                    Sardinia, as it took him away from Rome. He became so great a favourite with the
                    inhabitants of Sardinia, that though they had obtained from the senate an
                    exemption from the burden of clothing his men, he had so much influence with
                    them, that he prevailed on them to send a voluntary supply. On hie return to
                    Rome, whither he repaired contrary to orders, he offered himself a candidate for
                    the tribuneship, and was elected <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 123, against
                    the wishes of the nobility. He now brought forward a number of laws to increase
                    the authority of the people, of a nature similar to those which his brother had
                    advocated. He proposed to divide the public lands among the poor, to clothe the
                    soldiers at the public expense, without diminution of their pay, and to give to
                    the Italian allies the right of voting at elections; but his most important
                    measure was, that he took the judicial authority from the patricians, and
                    conferred it on the equestrian order. He took great interest also in the
                    constructing of public roads through Italy, and building granaries. He kept up
                    his influence amongst the people by sending colonies of the poorer citizens to
                    Tarentum and Capua; but the senate, fearing that his power would soon no longer
                    be capable of being controlled, tried to draw the people from him by gratifying
                    them in every thing. Caius however was appointed tribune a second time <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(b c.</hi> 122), without even declaring himself a candidate,
                    and proceeded to Africa to plant a colony at Carthage. During his absence one of
                    his colleagues, Drusus, succeeded in gaining the favour of the people; and this
                    induced Caius to hasten home. The following year the consul Opimius determined
                    to repeal many of the laws which had been passed by Caius; and as the party of
                    the latter mustered in great force, and that of the consul was equally resolute,
                    an engagement took place, in which the friends of Caius were defeated, and he
                    himself killed, to the great grief of the Roman people, whose interests he had
                    laboured to promote. (Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">Life of</hi><hi rend="italic"
