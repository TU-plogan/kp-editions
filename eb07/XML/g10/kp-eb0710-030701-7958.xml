                <p><label type="entry">GAMA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Vasco de</hi></label>, born at
                    Synis, a sea-port in Portugal, was admiral of the fleet which first doubled the
                    Cape of Good Hope in 1497, and arrived on the coast of India. The historians who
                    have transmitted to us his discoveries, have contented themselves with informing
                    us of the facts connected with his first voyage, and the establishment of the
                    Portuguese in India, but they have left us in ignorance of the details of his
                    private life. This is the more to be regretted, as Gama is one of those men who,
                    by important discoveries, have contributed to the prosperity of their country
                    and the increase of human knowledge. The progress of the art of navigation, and
                    the desire of exploring our globe, excited by the prospect of gain, had about
                    this time taken possession of the minds of men; and the success of the
                    expedition of Christopher Columbus had given a fresh stimulus to this spirit of
                    adventure. This extraordinary man had taught navigators the means of conducting
                    themselves with safety across the ocean; and his example had encouraged them to
                    brave all dangers. The Portuguese who, under the guidance of Prince Henry, had
                    been the first to turn their views in this direction, observed with jealousy
                    that the fruits of their researches were about to enrich the Spaniards, and they
                    sought to indemnify themselves by pursuing, with more activity than ever, their
                    discoveries on the side of Africa, in the hope of passing to the south of that
                    continent, and penetrating into India, or into the kingdom of Abyssinia, of
                    which they had acquired some notion by the relations which they maintained with
                    the Moors. As they believed that the inhabitants of this last kingdom were
                    Christians, they gave to the sovereign thereof the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prester John,</hi> by which people had hitherto designated a powerful prince
                    whom they believed to be Christian, without, however, knowing where his
                    dominions were to be found. It aj&gt;pears, indeed, from what has been said on
                    the subject, that this name has been applied to the great Khan of Tartary, and
                    to the Grand Lama of Thibet, as well as to the king of Abyssinia. The existence
                    of this Christian king was confirmed by Peter of Covilham, who, in 1487, had set
                    out with Alphonse de Pai va, in order to reach India by the Red Sea. The latter,
                    however, proceeded to Abyssinia, where he remained some time, but he died soon
                    after his return to Cairo. Having visited Goa, Cananor, Calicut, and acquired
                    some knowledge of the coast of Sofala, situated in the canal of Mozambique,
                    Covilham, on returning to Cairo, found the narrative of Paiva’s voyage, which he
                    transmitted to Portugal, together with an account of what he had himself done.
                    He descended the Red Sea a second time, touched at Ormus, and lastly penetrated
                    into Abyssinia, where he was detained during twenty years. His first voyage had
                    been conceived on a very wise plan; and the information which he procured put
                    him in a condition to enter the Indian Seas, with the certainty of deriving
                    great advantages from such an enterprise, if it should only be found practicable
                    to pass to the south of the continent of Africa. In fact, some knowledge had
                    already been obtained of great cities in India, abounding in wealth derived from
                    commerce; and it was also known that, on the eastern coast of Africa, at a great
                    distance from the places where the Indian Sea might be entered, were commercial
                    nations, amongst whom it would be possible to refit and procure pilots for
                    proceeding further. Bartolomeo Diaz, having sailed from Lisbon in 1486,
                    proceeded in search of the southern extremity of Africa, and had the good
                    fortune to discover it. The storms which he had encountered, however, induced
                    him to denominate the promontory by which the African continent is terminated,
                    the Cape of Tempests; but this name was changed by the king of Portugal into
                    that of the Cape of Good Hope, with the intention of obviating the unfavourable
                    impression likely to be produced by a sinister name. Diaz returned to Lisbon in
                    December 1487. There seemed now to be no obstacle calculated to prevent
                    navigators entering the Indian Sea; but daring enterprises remain long in
                    suspense, until men are found capable of carrying them into execution. It was
                    not until five years after the discovery of the New World by Columbus, and ten
                    years after that of the Cape of Good Hope by Diaz, that Emanuel king of Portugal
                    resolved to send a fleet into India, and chose as its commander a gentleman of
                    his own household, named Vasco de Gama, already known by his prudence, firmness,
                    and ability in navigation.</p>
                <p>The expedition destined for this great enterprise consisted of three vessels,
                    having on board as crews a hundred and sixty men. Vasco de Gama sailed from the
                    Tagus on the 8th of July 1497. He first shaped his course toward*</p>

                <p>the Cape de Verd Islands, which he doubled, and making ' his way to the
                    southward, anchored in the bay of St Helena, situated on the western coast of
                    Africa, at a little distance to the north of the Cape of Good Hope. On the 16th
                    of November he quitted this bay, and in two days after arrived at the extremity
                    of Africa; but in attempting to make his way to the eastward, his little
                    squadron had to contend with the south-eastern monsoon, which blows almost
                    continually during that season of the year, and generally with great
                    impetuosity. His crews, discouraged by the boisterous weather, attempted to
                    force him to return; but he managed to allay their mutinous despondence, and by
                    his firmness succeeded in overcoming all obstacles. He made to the eastward
                    along the southern coast of Africa, stood in to the bay of St Blaise, and, on
                    the 17th of December, arrived at the rock of Cruz, where Diaz had terminated his
                    discoveries. It is at this point where the eastern coast of Africa begins to
                    trend towards the north, and here the Portuguese for the first time entered the
                    Indian Sea. Vasco de Gama, whose intention it was to go in quest of the
                    countries which had been visited by Covilham, kept in sight of land; he
                    proceeded northward, and several times sent his people to visit places where he
                    observed inhabitants. He also went ashore himself as often as the population
                    appeared considerable; but not finding any people who could give him
                    information, he continued his voyage, passed the Cape of Currents, situated
                    nearly under the tropics, and advanced beyond the coast of Sofala, including the
                    city of that name, where Covilham was believed to have touched, but without
                    discovering any establishment which could induce him to stop. At length, in one
                    of the first days of March 1498, he anchored before the city of Mozambique, then
                    inhabited by Moors or Mahommedan Arabs, who lived under the authority of a
                    prince of their religion, and carried on a considerable trade with the Red Sea
                    and the Indies. The hope of traflicking with the new-comers procured the
                    Portuguese a favourable reception; but as soon as it became known that they were
                    Christians, snares were laid for them, with the intention of massacring them.
                    Obliged to withdraw from the perfidy of these fanatics, Gama set out from
                    Mozambique, and sailed northward, along the coast for Quiloa, conducted by a
                    pilot of Mozambique, whom he had carried along with him; but having approached
                    the land to the north of that city, the currents prevented him from returning
                    southward, and accordingly he veered away towards Monbaze, still following the
                    line of the coast. This city, which was better built than Mozambique, and
                    carried on a more extensive commerce, was also inhabited by Ma-ħommedan Moors,
                    who evinced the same hostility towards the Portuguese as those of Mozambique had
                    done. Gama therefore withdrew without obtaining any thing, and advancing
                    eighteen leagues further, reached Melinda, which is only three degrees south of
                    the equator. Here he was more fortunate. Although this city was also peopled
                    with Mussulmans, commerce appeared to have softened their manners; the prince of
                    the country gave the strangers a most favourable reception, and went on board
                    the Portuguese squadron, where he was received with the greatest honours. At
                    this place Gama obtained a pilot, one of the most skdful navigators of the
                    country, called Malemo-Cana, an Indian of Guzerat, to conduct him to Calicut;
                    and having left Melinda, he, in twenty-three days, reached the ⅛&gt; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> un</hi> 'λ <hi rend="superscript"> cast anchor</hi> before
                    Calicut on the 20th of May 1498. Here Gama, as his custom was, sent ashore
                    several of the convicts he carried along with him, accompanied by a Moor who
                    happened to be on board his fleet, and who fortunately discovered a countryman
                    of his own who was then m attendance at the court of Calicut. They were
                    favourably received by the prince or zamorin, who granted the Portuguese
                    permission to enter the port, and consented to receive Gama with the same
                    honours which he rendered to the ambassadors of the greatest monarchs. But this
                    good understanding was soon interrupted. The Mahommedan Moers and Arabs,
                    inflamed with a tierce and bigoted hatred of all Christians, represented the
                    strangers to the zamorin as pirates, who came to disturb the tranquillity of his
                    dominions, with the intention of pillaging them. Distrust and suspicion were
                    thus excited in the mind of the prince; and at length a plot was formed to burn
                    the Portuguese ships and massacre their crews. Apprised of this design by
                    Malemo-Cana, the pilot who had conducted him to Calicut, Gama, who had gone
                    ashore, sent intelligence to his brother Paul de Gama, to be on his guard, and
                    at the same time to keep a considerable offing; and having, by a rare mixture of
                    firmness and address, managed to withdraw his people in safety, he immediately
                    set sail, and having repaired his vessels at the Angedive Isles, situated on the
                    coast to the north of Calicut, he proceeded on his return to Europe. In passing
                    Melinda, he took on board an ambassador of the prince of that country, the only
                    friend whom the Portuguese had yet acquired in India; and coasting along the
                    African continent in the opposite direction to that which he had followed in the
                    voyage outwards, he doubled the Cape of Good Hope in the month of March 1499,
                    and arriv«i at Lisbon in the September following, after an absence of more than
                    two years. The king, Emanuel, received Gama with the greatest magnificence,
                    celebrated his return with festivities, gave him the title of Dom, and created
                    him admiral of the Indies.</p>
                <p>A second Portuguese fleet was immediately fitted out, and sent to India under the
                    command of Alvarez Cabral, who succeeded in establishing a factory at Calicut;
                    but in his absence the Portuguese were massacred at the instigation of the
                    Moors. Cabral, however, managed to obtain the friendship of the κing of Cochin,
                    with whom he contracted an alliance; but the reports mafle by him on his return
                    convinced Emanuel that he would never succeed in establishing the Portuguese
                    power in India except by open force. A more considerable armament was
                    accordingly fitted out, consisting of twenty vessels, which were divided into
                    three squadrons, the most numerous of which, consisting of ten ships, sailed
                    under the conduct of Gama, whilst the two others, of five each, under the orders
                    of Vincent de Sodre and Stephen de Gama, left Portugal separately, with
                    instructions to effect a junction in India. In this expedition Gama spread the
                    terror of the Portuguese name along the whole eastern coast of Africa; formed
                    establishments at Mozambique and Sofala; punished the zamorin and people of
                    Calicut for their meditated treachery during the former voyage; renewed the
                    treaty which Cabral had concluded with the king of Cochin; and, in conjunction
                    with Albuquerque, founded the port and factory of Cochin, the first of the
                    Portuguese settlements in India, and the cradle of their power in the east. They
                    began by violence, and nothing but the heroic and enterprising spirit with which
                    they were animated could have enabled them to perform the prodigies of valour by
                    which they signalised their proceedings, and triumphed over every effort made
                    for their expulsion. Gama left the squadron of Vincent de Sodre on the coast of
                    Malabar, and returned to Lisbon, where he arrived on the 20th December 1503,
                    with thirteen ships. His title of Admiral of the Indies was now confirmed, and
                    the king added to it that of Conde de Videgueyra.</p>
                <p>Vasco de Gama, covered with glory, now remained in absolute repose during the
                    long period of twenty years. At length the court of Portugal having, in 1524,
                    come to the resolution of appointing a viceroy of India, Vasco de Gama was the
                    first person invested with that dignity. But he died soon after his arrival at
                    Cochin, where his body was deposited until 1558, at which period it was
                    transported to Portugal, where John III. caused the greatest honours to be <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193517984" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7984-0309"/> paid to it. Gama
                    was a man of the middle height, extreme· ly corpulent, and with a red and
                    inflamed visage, which, under the excitement of passion, assumed an expression
                    of downright ferocity. In too many instances, particularly during hie second
                    voyage, he allowed himself to be betrayed into an excess of cruelty as impolitic
                    as it was unrelenting; but it is nevertheless just to add, that this may in part
                    at least be attributed to the harsh and severe manners of the times in which he
                    lived. The history of his discovery of India has been transmitted to us by
                    Barros, in his Decades, printed at Lisbon in 1628, and also by Hernan Lopez de
                    Castanheda, in an extended account of the conquests of the Portuguese in the
                    East Indies. In the Collection of Ramusio, in the works of Faria y Sousa, and in
                    the history of Lafitau, the reader will also find detailed narratives of this
                    memorable event in the Portuguese annals. All the world knows that C’amaens made
                    it the subject of his Lusiad. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
