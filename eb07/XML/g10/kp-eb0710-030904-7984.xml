                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">GAME LAWS</label>. The term <hi rend="italic">game,</hi> in a
                    large sense, seems to comprehend all animals obtained by fowling and hunting,
                    animals <hi rend="italic">feroe naturoe,</hi> as contradistinguished to tame
                    animals, such as horses, cows, sheep, and the like, which do not fly the
                    dominion of man, but generally keep within the same pastures and closes; but in
                    its stricter acceptation it applies only to those wild animals which the <hi
                    rend="italic">game laws</hi> and other arbitrary constitutions have
                    distinguished by that appellation.</p>
                <p>The view taken on this subject by Judge Blackstone is this: By the law of nature,
                    says he, every man, from the prince to the peasant, has an equal right of
                    pursuing and taking to his own use all such creatures as <hi rend="italic">are
                    Jera: natur&lt;e,</hi> and therefore the property of nobody, but liable to be
                    seized by the first occupant; and so it was held by the imperial law even so
                    late as the time of Justinian. But this right, like others of the same kind, may
                    be restrained by positive laws, and we find has been so restrained by the
                    municipal laws of many nations. Yet however defensible these provisions may in
                    general be, on the footing of reason, or justice, or civil policy, we roust
                    notwithstanding acknowledge, that in their present shape they owe their
                    immediate origin to slavery, having been introduced into Europe along with the
                    féodal system. On the Norman conquest, the right of pursuing and taking such
                    animals as were accounted <hi rend="italic">game</hi> was held to belong to the
                    king, or to such only as were authorized by him. And this, the learned
                    commentator says, as well upon the principles of the féodal law, that the king
                    is the ultimate proprietor of all the lands in the kingdom, as upon another
                    maxim of the common law, that these animals are <hi rend="italic">bona</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vocantia,</hi> and, having no other owner, belong to the king by
                    his prerogative. Wherefore, he concludes, all persons, of what property or
                    distinction so-</p>
                <p>ever, who kill game without the king’s grant, are guilty of encroaching on the
                    royal prerogative; and those persons who do so without having what is called a
                    qualification, are guilty not only of the original offence, but also of the
                    aggravations created by the statutes for preserving the game; which aggravations
                    are so severely punished, and those punishments so implacably inflicted, that
                    the offence against the king is seldom thought of, provided the miserable
                    delinquent can make his peace with the lord of the manor.</p>
                <p>The doctrine thus promulgated, novel and startling as it was, maintained itself
                    long on the mere name and reputation of the author. It is now, however, admitted
                    to be incorrect. The law of Canute, noticed by Blackstone, “quilibet homo dignus
                    venatione sua, in sylva et in agris sibi propriis et in dominio suo,” was
                    confirmed by many succeeding kings; and there is no instance, civil or criminal,
                    in which a person has been sued or prosecuted on behalf of the king for taking
                    game, unless he took it out of some privileged place. On the contrary, there is
                    a current of dicta and decisions showing that owners of land have uniformly been
                    considered as having a local property in game, and a right to take it whilst
                    upon their own land.</p>
                <p>However, the legislative provisions are in restraint of the common law right; and
                    these provisions were till lately many and various, and not a little obscure and
                    intricate. But in October 1831 an important act was passed to amend the laws of
                    England relative to game, namely, 1 and 2 Gul. IV. c. 32, which repealed about
                    thirty previous statutes on the subject, and, excepting as to game certificates,
                    may be looked upon as containing nearly the whole law in relation to game.</p>
                <p>This statute of William begins by enacting that the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >game</hi> shall, for all the purposes of the act, be deemed to include hares,
                    pheasants, partridges, grouse, heath or moor game, black game, and bustards. It
                    then sets out the <hi rend="italic">days</hi> and <hi rend="italic">times</hi>
                    during which game shall not be killed, declaring that if any person shall kill
                    or take any game, or use any dog, gun, net, or other engine or instrument for
                    the purpose of killing or taking any game on a <hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Christmas day,</hi> he shall, on conviction, forfeit and pay,
                    for every such offence, such sum of money, not exceeding L-5, as to the justices
                    shall seem meet, together with the costs of conviction; and prohibiting, under a
                    penalty, the killing or taking any <hi rend="italic">partridge</hi> between 1st
                    February and 1st September; <hi rend="italic">pheasant</hi> between 1st February
                    and 1st October; <hi rend="italic">black game</hi> (except in the county of
                    Somerset or Devon, or in the new Forest of Southampton) between 10th December
                    and 20th August, or in the above excepted places between 10th December and 1st
                    September; <hi rend="italic">grouse</hi> or red game between 10th December and
                    12th August, or any <hi rend="italic">bustard</hi> between 1st March and 1st
                    September; and it further declares, that if any person, with intent to destroy
                    or injure any game, shall at any time put any poison or poisonous ingredient on
                    any ground, whether open or enclosed, where game usually resort, or in any
                    highway, every such person shall, on conviction, forfeit and pay such sum of
                    money, not exceeding L.10, as to the justices shall seem meet, together with the
                    costs of conviction; and further, that if any person <hi rend="italic"
                    >licensed</hi> to deal in game shall buy or sell, or knowingly have in his
                    house, shop, stall, possession, or control, any bird of game after the
                    expiration of ten days (one inclusive and the other exclusive) from the
                    respective days in each year on which it shall become unlawful to kill or take
                    such birds of game respectively as aforesaid, or if any person not being
                    licensed to deal in game, shall buy or sell any bird of game after the
                    expiration of ten days from the respective days in each year on which it shall
                    become unlawful to kill or take such birds of game respectively as aforesaid, or
                    shall knowingly have in his house, possession, or control any bird of game
                    (except<pb break="no" facs="nls:193517997" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7997-0310"/> birds
                    of game kept in a mew or breeding plaċe) after the expiration of forty days (one
                    inclusive and the other exclusive) from the respective days in each year on
                    which it shall become unlawful to kill or take such birds of game respectively
                    as aforesaid, every such person shall, on conviction, forfeit and pay, for every
                    head of game so bought or sold, or found in his house, shop, possession, or
                    control, such sum of money, not exceeding L.l, as to the justices shall seem
                    meet, together with the costs of conviction. The act then provides that the
                    same, except as therein mentioned, shall not affect or alter the laws respecting
                    <hi rend="italic">game certificates</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and declares
                    that all regulations and provisions contained in any act relative to game
                    certificates, as far as they relate to gamekeepers of manors, and to the amount
                    of duty for game certificates to be charged upon or in respect of gamekeepers of
                    manors in the cases specified in such act, shall apply to all gamekeepers of
                    lands appointed under this act; and it furtherdeclares, that every person who
                    shall have obtained an annual game certificate shall be authorized to kill and
                    take game, but subject to the law of trespass, and provided always that no game
                    certificate on which a less duty than L.3.13s. 6d. is chargeable under the acts
                    relating to game certificates shall authorize any gamekeeper to kill or take any
                    game, or to use any dog, gun, net, or other engine or instrument, for the
                    purpose of killing or taking game, except within the limits included in his
                    appointment as gamekeeper; but that in any case where such gamekeeper shall kill
                    or take any game, or use any dog, gun, net, or other engine or instrument, for
                    the purpose of killing or taking game, beyond such limits, he may be proceeded
                    against as if he had no game certificate whatsoever. Then follow certain clauses
                    which determine the rights of landlords in relation to the game. The act
                    declares, that in all cases where any person shall occupy any land under any
                    lease or agreement made previously to the passing of the act, the lessor or
                    landlord shall have the right of entering upon such land, or of authorizing any
                    other person or persons who shall have obtained an annual game certificate to
                    enter upon such land, for the purpose of killing or taking the game thereon; and
                    no person occupying any land, under any lease or agreement, either for life or
                    for years, made previously to the passing of this act, shall have the tight to
                    kill or take the game on such land, except where the right of killing the game
                    has been expressly allowed to such person by the lease or agreement, or except
                    where, upon the original granting or removal of the same, a fine shall have been
                    taken, or except where, in the case of a term for years, the lease or agreement
                    shall have been made for a term exceeding twenty-one years; provided always that
                    nothing contained in the act shall authorize any person seised or possessed of
                    land to kill or take the game, or to permit any other to do so, where, by any
                    deed, grant, lease, or any written or parole demise or contract, a right of
                    entry on such land for the purpose of killing or taking the game has been or
                    shall be reserved or retrieved by, or given or allowed to, the granter or other
                    person whatsoever; nor shall the act affect any reservation or agreement already
                    made in relation to game, nor in any manner prejudice the rights of manor,
                    forest, chase, or warren, nor any of his majesty’s forest rights, nor the rights
                    of any grantee of the crown; nor shall the act be deemed to give to any owner of
                    cattlegates, or rights of common, upon or over any wastes or commons, any
                    interest or privilege which he had not before, nor authorize him to pursue or
                    kill the game found on such wastes or commons, nor defeat or diminish the rights
                    and privileges of any lord, or of any steward of the crown, of any manor,
                    lordship, or royalty, in or over such wastes or commons; but that the lord or
                    steward of the crown, of any manor, &amp;c. shall have the right to pursue and
                    kill the game upon the wastes or commons therein, and to authorize any other
                    person who shall have obtained an annual game certificate to enter upon such
                    wastes or commons for the purpose of pursuing and killing game thereon. And it
                    is further enacted, that where the lessor or landlord shall have reserved to
                    himself the right of killing the game upon any land, it shall be lawful for him
                    to authorize any other person who shall have obtained an annual game
                    certificate, to enter upon such land for the purpose of pursuing and killing
                    game thereon; and also, that where the right of killing game is by the act given
                    to any lessor or landlord, in exclusion of the right of the occupier of the
                    land, or where such exclusive right has been or shall be specially reserved by
                    or granted to, or does or shall belong to, the lessor, landlord, or any person
                    whatsoever, other than the occupier of such land, then and in every such case
                    the occupier, if he shall pursue, kill, or take any game upon the land, or give
                    permission to any other person so to do, without the authority of the lessor,
                    landlord, or other person having the right of killing the game, shall on
                    conviction forfeit and pay for such pursuit, such a sum of money, not exceeding
                    L.2, and for every head of game so killed or taken, such a sum of money, not
                    exceeding L.l, as the justices shall be pleased to award, together with the
                    costs of conviction. Then follow certain provisions allowing lords of manors and
                    stewards of the crown-manors to appoint one or more gamekeepers to preserve or
                    kill the game, and with power to seize dogs, guns, nets, and other engines and
                    instruments used within the limits by uncer-tiĥcated persons, and also allowing
                    lords of manors and stewards of crown-manors to grant deputations to persons as
                    gamekeepers; and, after particular regulations respecting appointments of
                    gamekeepers in Wales, the act declares that no appointment or deputation of a
                    gamekeeper shall be valid, unless registered with the clerk of the peace.</p>
                <p>These provisions are followed by a series of important clauses in regard to the
                    <hi rend="italic">possession, purchase, and sale</hi> of game. The act declares,
                    that every person who shall have obtained an annual game certificate, shall have
                    power to sell game to any person <hi rend="italic">licensed</hi> to deal in
                    game, provided always that no game certificate on which a less duty than L.3.
                    13s. 6d. is chargeable, shall authorize any gamekeeper to sell game, except on
                    the account and with the written authority of the master whose gamekeeper he is;
                    and the act appoints special sessions of the peace, to be holden in the month of
                    July yearly, for the purpose of granting licenses to persons therein pointed out
                    to deal in game; and every person so licensed shall annually, and during the
                    continuance of his license, and before he shall be empowered to deal in game
                    under his license, take out a certificate, with a duty of L.2, to be paid to the
                    collector of assessed taxes for the district, under a penalty of L.20. And
                    further, the act declares, that if any person licensed to deal in game shall,
                    during the period of license, be convicted of any offence whatever against the
                    act, his license shall thereupon become null and void. Other clauses which
                    follow create penalties for <hi rend="italic">killing or taking game,</hi> or
                    using any dog, gun, or other engine, for the purpose of searching for or killing
                    or taking game without a game certificate; for <hi rend="italic">destroying or
                    taking the eggs</hi> of any bird of game, or of any swan, wild duck, teal, or
                    widgeon, without having right to kill the game, or permission from the person
                    having such right; for <hi rend="italic">selling or offering to sale</hi> any
                    game, without a game certificate or license, or to unlicensed persons, excepting
                    always innkeepers or tavern-keepers, who, without license to deal in game, may
                    sell game for consumption in their own houses, such game having been procured
                    from some person licensed to deal in game; for <hi rend="italic">buying
                    game</hi> without a license from unlicensed persons; lastly, on licensed dealers
                    for buying game from uncertificated or unlicensed persons, or for <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193518010" xml:id="kp-eb0710-8010-0311"/>not having up a sign-board,
                    and on unlicensed persons assuming or pretending to be licensed; and the whole
                    is closed by a proviso as to the purchase and sale of game by the <hi
                    rend="italic">servants</hi> of licensed dealers. Then follows the 30th section,
                    with this preamble: “And whereas, after the commencement of this act, game will
                    become an article which may be legally bought and sold, and it is therefore just
                    and reasonable to. provide some more summary means than now by law exist for
                    protecting the same from trespassers ;” whereupon various regulations are made
                    respecting <hi rend="italic">trespass</hi> in search or pursuit of game. These,
                    however, we shall hereafter specify, because they are substantially the same
                    with those contained in an act since passed for Scotland, to which kingdom the
                    unrepealed act 9 Geo. IV. c. 69, also extends.</p>
                <p>In this country there was originally, as in England, no restraint on the taking
                    of game within one’s own land. It is particularly noticed, that in the time of
                    King Alexander it was not defended nor forbidden to any man to hunt nor to chase
                    the hare and fox, and other wild beasts, without forests and warrens,
                    wheresoever they were found ÍM. T. C. c. 52); and as late as the time of King
                    James II. an act was passed (1474, c. 60), declaring that it should not be
                    lawful to hunt or destroy game “in <hi rend="italic">vtheris</hi> closes or
                    parkes,” without the owner’s leave. In the following century the idea of game as
                    the subject of gentlemen’s pastime appears; and the act 1551, c. 9, was passed,
                    to restrain certain modes of detroying birds then commonly practised,
                    “quhairthrow the noblemen of the realme can get na pastime of halking and
                    hunting, like as hes beene had in times bypast." In the beginning of the
                    seventeenth century the principle of the first English qualification act (13
                    Rich. II. c. 13), the title of which is, “None shall hunt but they who have a
                    sufficient living,” was adopted by the Scottish legislature in the act 1600, c.
                    23; and upon that principle, no doubt, soon followed the statute 1621, c. 31,
                    which enacts “that no man hunt or hawk at any time hereafter, who hath not a
                    plough of land in heritage, under the pain of L.100 Scots, half to the king and
                    half to the prosecutor.” This is the substantive <hi rend="italic">Game
                    Qualification Act</hi> of Scotland; and under it the courts have held, that a
                    qualified person may communicate the right of shooting to any individual over
                    the lands of the former; and that a qualified landlord may hunt on his ground in
                    the hands of tenants, paying damage; but that neither a servitude of pasturage
                    nor a lease of land carry a right to kill game, nor yet a lease of game, as
                    against singular successors; nor can a qualified person hunt on the property of
                    another without the owner’s leave.</p>
                <p>To the qualification required by the act 1621 has been added, by subsequent
                    statutes, that of <hi rend="italic">a game certificate,</hi> as in England. To
                    make the privilege valuable, various penalties have also been enacted against
                    <hi rend="italic">poachers</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and lately the act of 9
                    Geo. IV. c. 69, was passed, applicable to both England and Scotland, to prevent
                    persons <hi rend="italic">going armed by night</hi> for the destruction of game
                    and rabbits. To all these is now to be added the act above alluded to, namely, 2
                    and 3 Gul. IV. c. 68, which, though limited to Scotland, is, as already
                    mentioned, nearly a transcript of the 30th and following sections of the late
                    English game act. It enacts and declares, that if any person shall commit any
                    trespass, by entering or being in the daytime upon any land without leave of the
                    proprietor, in search or pursuit of game, or of deer, roe, woodcocks, snipes,
                    quails, landrails, wild ducks, or conies, such person shall forfeit and pay a
                    penalty not exceeding L.2, which is enlarged in the case of the trespass being
                    by a person having his face blackened, coloured, or disfigured, for the purpose
                    of disguise, or by persons to the number of five or more together; and it
                    further declares, that such trespassers may be required to quit the land, and
                    give their names and abodes, and, on their refusal so to do, may be arrested.
                    But it is provided, that the act shall not extend against persons hunting or
                    coursing with hounds or greyhounds, and being in fresh pursuit of any deer,
                    hare, or fox already started upon any other land on which such persons were
                    entitled to hunt or course. The act also declares, that game may be taken from
                    trespassers not delivering the same up when lawfully demanded; and it provides a
                    summary means for ensuring the conviction and punishment of offenders; declaring
                    also, that all penalties created by the statute shall go to the poor of the
                    parish. (u. u. u.)</p>
