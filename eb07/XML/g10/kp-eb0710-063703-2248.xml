                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">GRAHAM, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label>, Marquis of
                    Montrose, a man celebrated by one party as a hero comparable to the greatest of
                    antiquity, and branded by another as a renegade and a traitor. His name, his
                    exploits, and his character belong properly to history (see the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Britain)</hi>; but he deserves notice here as one who occupied
                    his intervals of leisure, few and far between, with the elegant and peaceful
                    pursuits of literature. Such of his poems as have been preserved, though they
                    possess but little merit in themselves, are remarkable as the effusions of a
                    mind in which the most heroic and chivalrous daring seems to have been
                    attempered by a degree of refinement beyond his age, and a capacity for pursuits
                    less dazzling, but far more innocent <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522261"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-2261-0638"/>and useful, than those which have shed an
                    equivocal lustre on his name. His desertion of the covenanters may perhaps be
                    excused, but cannot be defended; amidst the conflicts of exasperated parties and
                    the excitement of civil commotion, it is not easy to steer a consistent and
                    blameless course; but the laws of honour and morality are nevertheless
                    unchangeable. Having joined the royal cause, how ever, he devoted himself to
                    promote its success; and if his caution had been equal to his genius, or if he
                    had been provided with the necessary supplies, he would in all probability have
                    reduced the kingdom of Scotland to the necessity of acknowledging the royal
                    authority. But, from want of means, his conquests were lost almost as soon as
                    gained; victory produced him no solid advantage; and the first reverse he
                    experienced proved his ruin. His second attempt, after the death of Charles I,
                    was accordingly hopeless from the commencement; he was completely defeated by
                    the army sent against him; and, being betrayed into the hands of the enemy by
                    the laird of Assynt, his intimate friend, he was carried to Edinburgh, and
                    executed with every circumstance of indignity, on the 21st of May 1650. His
                    exploits made him a hero, and to this his enemies added the distinction of
                    martyrdom. Considered as a commander, Montrose was merely a bold and active
                    partisan; a sort of guerilla chief, whose services would have been invaluable to
                    the party he had espoused, if there had been in the field a regular force with
                    which he could have connected his operations, but who, acting independently,
                    contributed merely to aggravate the evils of the contest, without in the
                    slightest degree affecting its result.</p>

                    XIV., and was master of the wardrobe and secretary of state under James II. But

                    watch-maker, the most ingenious and accurate artist of his time, was born in
                    1675. After his apprenticeship, Mr Tompion received him into his family on
                    account of his merit and treated him with a kind of parental affection as long
                    as he lived. Besides his universally acknowledged skill in his profession, he
                    was a complete mechanic and astronomer; the great mural arch in the observatory
                    at Greenwich was made for Dr Halley, under his immediate inspection, and divided
                    by his own hand; and from this incomparable original, the best foreign
                    instruments of the kind were copied by English artists. The sector by which Dr
                    Bradley first discovered two new motions in the fixed stars was of his invention
                    and construction; and when the French academicians were sent to measure a degree
                    of the meridian in Lapland, with the view of determining the figure of the
                    earth, Mr Graham was considered the fittest person in Europe to supply them with
                    instmments. He was for many years a member of the Royal Society, to which he
                    communicated several ingenious and important discoveries. He died in 1751.</p>
