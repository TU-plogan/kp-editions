                <p><label type="entry">GLACIERS</label>, a name given to extensive fields of ice
                    amongst the Alps. Mr Coxe observes of these mountains in general, that they are
                    composed of many parallel chains, the highest of which occupy the centre, and
                    the others gradually diminish in proportion as they recede from thence. The
                    central chain appears covered with pointed rocks, all parts of which, that are
                    not absolutely perpendicular, lie hid under perpetual snow and ice even in
                    summer. On each side of this ridge are fertile and cultivated valleys,
                    interspersed with numerous villages, and watered by numerous streams. The
                    elevated peaks of the central chain are covered with snow; but their
                    declivities, excepting those which are extremely steep, have all a covering of
                    ice as well as snow; the intermediate parts being filled with vast fields of
                    ice, terminating in the cultivated valleys above mentioned. The same phenomena,
                    though on a smaller scale, occur in those chains which are at a distance from
                    the principal one. In those which are most remote, no ice, and scarcely any
                    snow, is observed, unless upon some of the most elevated summits; and the
                    mountains diminishing in height and ruggedness, appear covered with verdure,
                    until at last they terminate in small hills and plains.</p>
                <p>Thus the glaciers may be divided into two sorts; one occupying the deep valleys
                    situated in the bosom of the Alps, and distinguished by the name of ice valleys;
                    the other being those which clothe the declivities and sides of the mountains.
                    These two kinds of glaciers are distinguished by Mr Coxe into the upper and
                    lower glaciers.</p>
                <p>The lower glaciers are by far the most considerable, some of them extending
                    several leagues in length. They do not communicate with each other, as has been
                    generally supposed, few of them being parallel to the central chain; but,
                    stretching mostly in a transverse direction, they are bordered at the higher
                    extremity by inaccessible rocks, and at the lower extend into the cultivated
                    valleys. The thickness of the ice varies in different parts. In the Glacier des
                    Bois, which extends more than fifteen miles in length, and upwards of three in
                    breadth, Saussure found it generally from eighty to a hundred feet; but he was
                    credibly informed, that in some places it was not less than six hundred feet,
                    and even more. These vast masses oť ice usually rest on an inclined plane;
                    where, being pushed forward by their own weight, and but weakly supported by the
                    rugged rocks beneath them, they arc intersect-eđ<pb break="no"

                    crevices, and have an appearance of walls, pyramids, and the like, according to
                    the position of the eye in viewing them. In those parts, however, where they lie
                    upon even ground, or have only a gentle inclination, the surface of the ice is
                    nearly uniform, the crevices being few and narrow, and the glacier being crossed
                    by travellers on foot without any difficulty. The surface of the ice is rough
                    and granulated, so that people may walk upon it, excepting at such places as
                    have a steep descent. It is opaque, full of small bubbles about the size of a
                    pea, very porous, and greatly resembles a mixture of snow and water congealed. A
                    vast quantity of stones and earth falls down from the mountains upon the
                    glaciers, and is by them thrown off on each side according to the descent of the
                    ice. The place upon which∙these rest is harder and more elevated than the rest
                    of the ice, and is very difficult to walk upon; the earth is likewise laid upon
                    them in such regular heaps, that it appears to have been done by art. This
                    collection of earths and stones is termed by the natives the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The upper glaciers may be subdivided into those which cover the summits, and
                    those which extend along the sides of the Alps. Those upon the very summits,
                    however, though they have the appearance of ice, are not so in reality, but
                    consist entirely of snow hardened by the extreme cold. Saussure found that which
                    covered the top of Mont Blanc to be penetrable, though with difficulty, by a
                    stick; but below this hard crust was a soft snow without coherence. The sides
                    are covered with a mixture of ice and snow, produced by the power of the summer
                    sun in dissolving the snow, which afterwards congeals into hard ice.</p>
                <p>Several conjectures have been hazarded concerning the formation of these
                    extraordinary bodies of ice. Coxe agrees with Gruner in opinion, that they are
                    produced by the continual dissolution of the snow in summer, and its congelation
                    by the succeeding frosts. Hence, on the summits of the mountains, where the sun
                    has very little power, the glacier is soft, and contains no ice; but as we
                    descend the mountains the consistence becomes firmer, because there is a
                    considerable mixture of snow water, the congelation of which augments the
                    hardness; and in the valleys, the glacier is hardest of all, because the portion
                    of water is there much superior to that of the snow. Hence it seems plain that
                    the glaciers derive their origin from the melting of the snow on the upper parts
                    of the mountains, and the congelation of the water as it advances; and to this
                    cause Saussure adds the quantity of snow which often rolls down into the
                    valleys, and congeals along with the water just mentioned.</p>
