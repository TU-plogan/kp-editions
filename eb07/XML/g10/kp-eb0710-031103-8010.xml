                <p><label type="entry">GAMING</label>, the art of playing or practising any game,
                    particularly those of hazard, as cards, dice, tables, and so forth.</p>
                <p>Gaming was particularly remarked by Tacitus as distinguishing the ancient
                    Germans. “They addict themselves," says he, in his treatise <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Moribus</hi><hi rend="italic">Germ.</hi> c. 24, “to
                    dice, as a serious employment, with such an extravagant desire to win or lose,
                    that when everything else fails they will stake even their liberty and their
                    very persons. The loser goes into a voluntary servitude: though younger and
                    stronger than his antagonist, he suffers himself to be bound and sold; and this
                    perseverance in so bad a cause they call the point of honour.” This passion we
                    seem to have inherited; and by the ancient common law of the land it was not
                    forbidden. Its pernicious consequences, however, are manifest; and both the
                    legislature and the courts have interfered to restrain it.</p>
                <p>In England there are three principal statutes on the subject, and a multitude of
                    minor ones, the particular descriptions and prohibitions of the law being ever
                    behind the inventions of sharpers and interested men. The first statute, 33 Hen.
                    VIII. c. 9, was directed against the inferior classes, and prohibits to all but
                    gentlemen the games of tennis, tables, cards, dice, bowls, and other unlawful
                    diversions therein specified, unless in the time of Christmas, under pecuniary
                    pains and imprisonment. But this was legislation at once unequal, cruel, and
                    impolitic, and indeed, according to modern experience at least, it is gaming in
                    high life which particularly requires to be restrained. Accordingly, by 16 Car.
                    II. c. 7, it was enacted that if any person shall play at any of the games
                    mentioned in the second section, namely, cards, dice-tables, tennis, bowls,
                    skittles, shovel-board, or cock-fighting, horse-races, dogmatches, foot-races,
                    or other pastimes or games whatsoever, or shall bet on the side or hands of such
                    as play thereat, and shall lose any sum or sums of money or other thing
                    exceeding L.100, at any time or meeting upon ticket, credit, or otherwise, and
                    shall not pay down the same at the time of the loss, the value shall not be
                    recovered; but all contracts for the same, judgments, statutes, recognisances,
                    mortgages, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> and all other acts, deeds, and
                    securities for the same, shall be void, and the winner shall forfeit treble the
                    value, in addition to the sum of L.100, half thereof to the king and half to the
                    informer. At length came the gaming act (9 Anne, c. 14), which declares that all
                    bonds and other securities given for money won at play, or money lent at the
                    time to play withal, shall be utterly void; that all mortgagee and incumbrances
                    of lands made upon the same consideration shall be and revert to the use of <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193518023" xml:id="kp-eb0710-8023-0312"/> the heir of the
                    mortgager; that if any person at any time or sitting loses L.10 at play, he may
                    sue the winner, and recover it back by action of debt at law; and in case the
                    loser does not, any other person may sue the winner for treble the sum so lost;
                    and the plaintiff may by bill of equity examine the defendant himself on oath.
                    Moreover, if any person, by cheating at play, shall win any money or valuable
                    thing, or shall at any time or sitting win more than L.10, he may be indicted
                    thereon, and shall forfeit five times the value to any person who will sue for
                    it, and shall be deemed infamous, and suffer such corporal punishment as in the
                    case of wilful perjury. And this statute of 9 Anne is further enforced, and some
                    deficiencies supplied, by 18 Geo. II. c. 34.</p>
                <p>By the first of the above-named acts also (33 Hen. Vnl. c. 9), to which may now
                    be added 58 Geo. III. c. 70, and</p>
                <p>3 Geo. IV. c. 114, the keeping a <hi rend="italic">gaming-house</hi> was declared
                    a nuisance, which indeed it is held to be, and an indictable offence at common
                    law; and the courts largely construing the word, have held a cockpit a
                    gaming-house within the meaning of the statute (3 Keb. 510, 2 Burr. 1233). By 9
                    and 10 Will. III. c. 17, all <hi rend="italic">lotteries</hi> were declared
                    public nuisances; and all state-lotteries which had in the interval been allowed
                    were to be discontinued after</p>
                <p>4 Geo. IV. c. 60. As to private lotteries, they were prohibited by various
                    statutes of the reign of George II. under heavy pecuniary penalties. In the same
                    reign, to prevent or restrain <hi rend="italic">horse-racing,</hi> another kind
                    of gaming, it was enacted by 13 Geo. II. c. 19, that no plate or match under LAO
                    value shall be run, under a penalty of L.200 to be paid by the owner of each
                    horse running, and L.100 by such as advertise the plate, except at Newmarket and
                    Black Hambleton, where a race may be run for a less sum than LAO: but though
                    such horse-races are lawful, yet they are construed <hi rend="italic">games</hi>
                    within 9 Anne c. 14, and consequently wagers above L.10 are illegal. By 7 Geo.
                    II. wagers relating to the present or future price of stocks are declared
                    illegal and void; and it has been held that a wager between two electors upon
                    the success of their respective parliamentary candidates is illegal, because it
                    tends to corrupt the freedom of election (1 T. R. 56). The law of <hi
                    rend="italic">wagers</hi> is well and succinctly traced by Mr Christian in his
                    note to 4 Blackstone, 173. Wagers, in general, says he, were by the common law
                    lawful contracts; and all wagers may still be recovered in a court of justice
                    which are not made upon unlawful games, or which are not such as are likely to
                    disturb the public peace, or to encourage immorality, or such as will probably
                    affect the interests, characters, and feelings of persons not parties to the
                    wager, or such as are contrary to sound policy or the general interests of the
                    community. And the recent editor of Blackstone subjoins to this note a case
                    lately decided, to show the comprehensive ground on which one of these
                    doctrines, that of public policy, rests. The case was this. In 1802 the
                    defendant, in consideration of 100 guineas, agreed to pay the plaintiff one
                    guinea a day during the life of Bonaparte. The defendant paid the money for some
                    years, and then stopped. The action was brought to recover the arrears. The jury
                    having found for the defendant, on a motion for a new trial it was contended in
                    support of the verdict that the wager was illegal, inasmuch as it had a tendency
                    to create an interest in the plaintiff in the life of a foreign enemy, and which
                    in the case of an invasion might induce him to act contrary to his allegiance.
                    The court being of opinion that the justice of the case had been satisfied,
                    refused to disturb the verdict; and Lord Ellenborough, chief-justice, expressed
                    a strong opinion against the legality of the wager, as well on the ground before
                    mentioned, as also on the ground that the party suffering under such a contract
                    might be induced to compass and encourage the horrid practice of assassination,
                    in order to get rid of a life so burdensome to him ( 16 East. 150). So likewise,
                    where a person had given L.100 on condition of receiving LA00 if peace were not
                    concluded with France within a certain time, and he afterwards brought his
                    action to recover the L.300, it was held that the wager was void, as being
                    inconsistent with general policy; but he was allowed to recover the L.100 which
                    he had paid, under a count for so much money received by the defendant to his
                    use. Indeed we may remark frequent expressions of regret by the most eminent
                    judges of England, that the law of wagers in that country is not the same with
                    that of Scotland; and some, amongst whom was Justice Butler (3 T. R. 697), have
                    thought it was not too late yet to retrace their steps, and to adopt the
                    practice of the Scotch couru. So in Easter term 1825, Chief-Justice Abbot
                    refused to allow a cause to proceed in which a person sought to recover L.100
                    which had been deposited as a stake on a dog-fight, observing that all such
                    wagers were illegal. In like manner, the chief-justice discharged the jury from
                    giving any verdict in an action to recover a deposit on a wrestling match
                    (Kennedy, K. B. October 29, 1828).</p>
                <p>The view taken in Scotland is, that courts of justice were instituted to redress
                    wrong in the serious transactions of life; and that wagers and gaming debts do
                    not partake of the character of serious business, but mere pastime and
                    amusement. The judges therefore look upon such contracts as <hi rend="italic"
                    >sponsiones ludicra,</hi> and will not allow action for the recovery of sums
                    lost or won by wagering or betting in any form; and this is now settled law, and
                    sanctioned by the judgment of the House of Lords in the case of Bruce <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Ross, 14th February 1788. Where, however, a civil injury
                    arises, though it be out of gaming, the party will be heard. So, in the case of
                    Paterson, 1830 (8 Sh. and D. 573), a party brought an action setting forth that
                    he had fairly won money at cards from the defender, who paid it, but afterwards
                    demanded restitution, alleging the pursuer was a cheat at play; and that the
                    pursuer thereupon repaid the money on condition that the defender should
                    preserve silence on the subject, which he failed to do; and the defender offered
                    to prove the pursuer a cheat. The court found the action relevant, and remitted
                    it to the jury court, where it was tried as a question of defamation.</p>
                <p>Scotland is also distinguished from England by the paucity of its legislative
                    provisions on gaming. By 1621, c. 14, it was enacted that none play at cards or
                    dice in any common house, town, hostelrie, or cook’s house, and that it should
                    not be lawful to play in any other private man’s house but where the master of
                    the family playeth himself; and if it should happen any man to win a sum
                    exceeding 100 merks within the space of twenty-four hours, or to gain at wagers
                    upon horse-races any sum above 100 merks, the surplus should go to the poor of
                    the parish. This act is not altogether in desuetude, as might be thought from an
                    old case, but it is available only to the poor, and not to the winner (Straiton,
                    19th July 1688; Maxwell, 14th July 1774). To the above act of 1621 are to be
                    added the acts 9 Anne anti 18 Geo. II. above noticed, which are received in
                    Scotland, but have not always the same construction given them as in England.
                    Thus, as remarked by Mr Brodie (Stair, b. i. tit. 10, sect. 8, note), it has
                    been held in Nelson <hi rend="italic">υ.</hi> Bruce, Mor. 9507, and Stewart <hi
                    rend="italic">V.</hi> Hyslop, Mor. 9510, contrary to the settled construction in
                    England, that the nullity was not effectual against an onerous indorsee not
                    aware of the bill being granted for a game debt. Mr Brodie gives it as his
                    opinion that the two Scottish decisions are on principle, abstractedly from the
                    words of the statute, most consonant to substantial justice; but the English
                    construction appears quite indisputable. (u. u. u.) <pb break="no"

                    smallcaps"> Gamiug.</hi> Hazard, or chance, is a matter of mathematical
                    consideration, because it admits of more and less. Gamesters either set out upon
                    an equality of chance, or are supposed to do so. This equality may be altered in
                    the course of the game, by the greater good fortune or address of one of the
                    gamesters, by which he comes to have a better chance, so that his share in the
                    stakes is proportionably better than at first. This more and less runs through
                    all the ratios between equality and infinite différence, or from an infinitely
                    small difference till it come to be an infinitely great one, by which the game
                    is determined. The whole game, therefore, with regard to the issue of it, is a
                    chance of the proportion which the two shares bear to each other.</p>
                <p>The probability of an event is greater or less, according to the number of
                    chances by which it may happen, compared with the number of all the chances by
                    which it may either happen or fail. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
