                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">GILL, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, D. D., a
                    Protestant dissenting minister of the Baptist denomination, was the son of
                    Edward and Elizabeth Gill, and was born at Kettering in Northamptonshire, on the
                    23d November 1697. At a very early period of life his father, who was a deacon
                    of the Baptist church at Kettering, discovered in him an uncommon capacity for
                    learning; and his ability for literary pursuits afterwards appeared by the rapid
                    progress he had made <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520766"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-0766-0523"/>to whatever became the object of his study. He was
                    sent in a grammar-school in the neighbourhood, where he soon surpassed those
                    boys who were much his seniors in age and also as pupils. He continued till he
                    arrived at his eleventh year at this school, where he read most of the Latin
                    classics, and likewise made considerable proficiency in the Greek language.</p>
                <p>He left the grammar-school, however, early in life. This was occasioned by the
                    imperious conduct of his master, who insisted that the children of dissenting
                    parents should, with other scholars who belonged to the establishment, attend
                    him to church on week days during the performance of divine service. The
                    dissenters considered this requisition as a stretch of power to which his
                    engagements with them gave him no claim; and as it was virtually making
                    conformity a test by which his pupils were to expect the benefits of tuition,
                    they resented his conduct, and the children of those parents who were in
                    affluent circumstances were removed to seminaries where the same advantages
                    might be obtained without being subject to the impositions of clerical bigotry.
                    But as the parents of Mr Gill had it not in their power to confer upon him the
                    same privilege, the same steps could not be taken to facilitate his advancement
                    in learning. In order to pave the way, however, for the completion of his
                    studies, efforts were made by several ministers, of different denominations, to
                    get him upon one or other of the funds in London. For this purpose specimens of
                    his progress in the different branches of literature were transmitted to the
                    metropolis; but in answer to these applications it was objected that he was too
                    young, and that should he continue, as it might be expected he would, to make
                    such rapid advances in his studies, he would pass through the common course
                    before he would be capable of taking care of himself, or of being employed in
                    any public service. But these formidable objections were of no weight with our
                    young scholar, whose love of learning was unconquerable. Insuperable
                    difficulties, it is true, obstructed the way in which literary eminence is
                    usually acquired; but these difficulties could neither repress his ardent desire
                    of knowledge, nor damp the zeal and application with which he had devoted
                    himself to his studies. For though his time was daily allotted to the business
                    of his father, yet he had so far improved the hours of leisure as to be able,
                    before he arrived at his nineteenth year, to read all the Greek and Latin
                    authors that fell in his way. He studied logic, rhetoric, moral and natural
                    philosophy; and learned the Hebrew language so as to read it with ease, without
                    any other assistance than Buxtorf’s grammar and lexico.</p>
                <p>Neither the pursuit of learning, however, nor the other necessary avocations
                    incumbent on Mr Gill, could eradicate those religious impressions which he had
                    received in early life. On the 1st of November 1716, he made a public profession
                    of his faith before the Baptist church at Kettering, and was baptized the same
                    day by Mr Thomas Wallis. Of this church Mr Gill had not been long a member
                    before he was called to the work of the ministry; soon after which, he removed
                    to Higham-Ferrers, with a view to pursue his studies under the direction of Mr
                    Davis; but his stay at the latter place was interrupted by an invitation from
                    London in 1719, t <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> preach to the Baptist church in
                    Horβlydown, over which he was the same year, being the twenty-second of his age,
                    ordained pastor; and this office he held upwards of fifty-one years.</p>
                <p>Mr Gill had not been long in London, before rabbinical learning, of which he had
                    before acquired considerable knowledge, became an object of pursuit. To
                    faciliate his progress through the intricacies of this labyrinth, he contracted
                    an acquaintance with one of the most learned of the Jewish rabbin. He read the
                    Targums, the Talmud, the Rabbot, their ancient commentaries, the book Zohar, and
                    whatever else of this kind he was able to procure. Of the oriental languages he
                    made himself a complete master; in short, there was no branch of knowledge that
                    could either enlarge or enrich biblical learning, which, however difficult, was
                    not attempted and attained by him; and it may be truly asserted, that in this
                    line he had but few equals, and that the annals of literature do not exhibit
                    many by whom he was excelled.</p>
                <p>In 1748, Mr GiD published a commentary on the New Testament, in three volumes
                    folio. The immense reading and learning discoverable in this arduous work
                    attracted the attention of the Marischal College and University of Aberdeen, and
                    procured for him the degree of Doctor in Divinity. He died at Camberwell, on the
                    14th of October 1771, in the seventy-fourth year of his age.</p>
                <p>His works are, A Commentary on the Old and New Testament, in nine volumes folio;
                    A Body of Divinity, in three volumes quarto; The Cause of God and Truth, four
                    volumes octavo; A Treatise concerning the Prophecies of the Old Testament
                    respecting the Messiah; A Dissertation on the antiquity of the Hebrew Language,
                    Letters, Vowel Points, and Accents; and Sermons on the Canticles, folio; besides
                    a great number of sermons and controversial pieces.</p>
