                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">GRANARY</label>, a building to lay up or store corn in,
                    especially that which is designed to be kept for a considerable time.</p>
                <p>Sir Henry Wotton recommends that a granary should be made to look towards the
                    north, because that quarter is the coolest and most temperate. Mr Worlidge
                    observes, that the best granaries are built of brick, with quarters of timber
                    wrought in the inside, to which the boards, with which the inside of the granary
                    must be lined, must be nailed so close to the bricks that there may not be any
                    room left for vermin to shelter themselves. There may be many storeys one above
                    another, but these should be near the one to the other, because the shallower
                    the corn lies, it is the better, and the more easily turned.</p>
                <p>The two great cautions to be observed in the erecting of granaries are, to make
                    them sufficiently strong, and to expose them to the most drying winds. In many
                    parts of England, particularly in Kent, corn is ordered in this manner. To
                    separate it from dust and other impurities after it is thrashed, it is tossed
                    with shovels from one end to the other of a long and large room; the lighter
                    substances fall down in the middle of the room, and the corn only is carried
                    from side to side or from end to end of it. After this the corn is screened, and
                    being then brought into the granaries, it is spread about half a foot thick, and
                    turned from time to time about twice in a week; the screening of it is also
                    repeated once a week. This sort of management is continued about two months,
                    after which it is laid a foot thick for two months more; and during this time it
                    is turned once a week, or twice if the season be damp, and now and then screened
                    again. After about five or six months, it is raised to two feet thickness in the
                    heaps, and then turned ouce or twice in a month, and screened now and then.
                    After a year, it is laid two and a half or three feet deep, and turned once in
                    three weeks or a month, and screened proportionally. When it has lain two years
                    or more, it is turned once in two months, and screened once a quarter; and how
                    long soever it be kept, the oftener the turning and screening are repeated, the
                    better the grain will be found to be preserved. It is proper to leave an area of
                    a yard wide on every side of the heap of corn, and other empty spaces, into
                    which the corn may be turned and tossed as often as required. In Kent two square
                    holes are made at each end of the floor, and a round one in the middle, by means
                    of which the corn is thrown out of the upper into the lower rooms, and so up
                    again, that it may be the better turned and aired. Their screens are made with
                    two partitions, to separate the dust from the corn, which falls into a bag; and
                    when sufficiently full this is thrown away, whilst the pure and good corn
                    remains behind. Corn has by these means been kept in our granaries thirty years;
                    and it is observed, that the longer it is kept the more flour it yields in
                    proportion to the corn, and the purer and whiter the bread is, the superfluous
                    humidity only evaporating in the keeping. At Zurich in Switzerland, corn has
                    been kept eighty years, or longer, by methods of a similar description.</p>
                <p>The public granaries at Dantzick are seven, eight, or nine storeys in height,
                    having a funnel in the midst of each floor, to let down the corn from one to
                    another. They are built so securely, that though every way surrounded with
                    water, the corn contracts no damp, and the vessels have the convenience of
                    coming up to the walls to be loaded. The Russians preserve their corn in
                    subterranean granaries of the figure of a sugar-loaf, wide below and narrow at
                    the top, the sides being well plastered, and the top covered with stones. They
                    are careful to have the corn well dried before it be laid into these
                    storehouses, and often dry it by means of ovens, the summer dry weather being
                    too short to effect this sufficiently. Dantzick is the grand storehouse or
                    repository of the fruitful kingdom of Ppland. The wheat, barley, and rye, of a
                    great part of the country, are there laid up in parcels of twenty, thirty, or
                    sixty lasts in a chamber, according to the size of the room; and this is turned
                    every day or two, to keep it sweet and fit for shipping.</p>
                <p>According to the rules of Vitruvius, a granary should always be at the top of a
                    house, and have its openings only to the north or east, that the corn may not,
                    be exposed to the damp winds from the south and west, which are very destructive
                    to it; but the contrary winds are very necessary and wholesome, serving to cool
                    it and absorb all external humidity. There must also be openings in the roof, to
                    be set open in dry weather, partly to let in fresh air, and partly to let out
                    the warm effluvia which are often emitted by the corn. The covering of the roofs
                    should always be of tiles, because in the worst seasons, when the other openings
                    cannot be safe, there will always be a considerable inlet for fresh air, and an
                    issue for the vapours by their joinings, which are never close. If there happen
                    to be any windows to the south, great care must be taken to shut them in moist
                    weather, and in the time of the hot southern winds. There must not be a cellar
                    or any other damp place under a granary, nor should it ever be built over
                    stables; for in either of these cases the corn will certainly suffer by the
                    vapours, and be rendered damp in one, and ill tasted in the other.</p>
                <p>Μ. Duhamel and Dr Hailes recommend various contrivances for ventilating or
                    blowing fresh air through corn laid up in granaries or ships, in order to
                    preserve it sweet and dry, and to prevent its being devoured by weevils or other
                    insects. This may be done by nailing wooden bars or laths on the floor of the
                    granary, about an inch distant from each other, when they are covered with
                    hair-cloth <pb break="no" facs="nls:193523158" xml:id="kp-eb0710-3158-0707"
                    />only, or at the distance of two or three inches, when coarse wire-work, or
                    basket-work of osiers, is laid under the haircloth, or when an iron plate full
                    of holes is laid upon them. These laths may be laid across other laths, nailed
                    at the distance of fifteen inches, and two or more inches deep, that there may
                    be a free passage for the air under them. The under laths must come about six
                    inches short of the wall of the granary at one end, on which a board is to be
                    set edgewise, sloping against the wall; for, by this disposition, a large
                    air-pipe is formed, which having an open communication with all the interstices
                    between and under the bars, will admit the passage of air below forcibly through
                    a hole at the extremity, and consequently carry off the moist exhalations of the
                    corn. The ventilators for supplying fresh air may be fixed against the wall, on
                    the inside or outside of the granary, or under the floor, or in the ceiling; but
                    wherever they are fixed, the handle of the lever that works them must be out of
                    the granary, otherwise the person who works them would be in danger of
                    suffocation when the corn is fumigated with burning brimstone, as is sometimes
                    done for destroying weevils. Small moveable ventilators will answer the purpose
                    for ventilating corn in large bins in granaries, and may easily be moved from
                    one bin to another. If the granary or corn ship be very long, the main air-pipe
                    may pass lengthwise along the middle of it, and convey air on both sides under
                    the corn. In large granaries, double ventilators laid upon each other may be
                    fixed at the middle and near the top of the granary, that they may be worked by
                    a windmill fixed on the roof of the building, or by a water-mill. The air is
                    conveyed from the ventilators through a large trunk or trunks, reaching down
                    through the several doors to the bottom of the granary, with branching trunks to
                    each floor, by means of which it may be made to pass into a large trunk along
                    the adjoining cross walls; and from these trunks several lesser trunks, about
                    four inches wide, branch off, at the distance of three or four feet from one
                    another, and reach through the whole length of the granary, their farther ends
                    being closed. Scams of one tenth or one twelfth of an inch should also be left
                    open at the four joinings of the boards, where they are nailed together, that
                    the air may pass through them into the corn. In some of these lesser trunks
                    there may be sliding shutters, to stop the passage of the air through those
                    trunks which are not covered with iron, or to ventilate one part of the granary
                    more briskly than others, as there may be occasion. There should also be wooden
                    shutters, hung on hinges at their upper part, so as to shut close of themselves;
                    and these should be fixed to openings in the walls of the granary on their
                    outside; by which means they will readily open to give a free passage for the
                    ventilating air, which ascends through the corn, but will instantly shut when
                    the ventilation ceases, and thereby prevent any dampness of the external air
                    from entering. The ventilation should be made only in the middle of dry days,
                    unless the corn, when first put in, be cold and damp.</p>
                <p>In lesser granaries, where the ventilators must be worked by the hand, if these
                    granaries stand on straddles, so as to have their lowest floor at some distance
                    from the ground, the ventilators may be fixed under the lowest floor, between
                    the straddles, so as to be worked by men standing on the ground without or
                    within the granary. A very commodious and cheap ventilator may be made for small
                    granaries, by constructing a ventilator of the door of the granary, which may be
                    easily effected by making a circular screen, of the size of a quarter of a
                    circle, behind the door; but in order to this, the door should open, not
                    inwards, but outwards, so that when it falls back, it may be worked to and fro
                    in the screen, which must be exactly adapted to it in aD parts of the circular
                    side of the screen, as well as at the top and bottom. But there must be a stop
                    at about eight or ten inches distance from the wall, to prevent the door falling
                    farther back, and that there may be room for a valve in the screen to supply it
                    with air, which will be driven in by the door, through a hole made in the wall
                    near the floor, into the main air-trunk, in which also there should be another
                    valve over the hole in the wall, to prevent the return of the air.</p>
