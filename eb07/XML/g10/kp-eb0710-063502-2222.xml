                <p>The proofs of the moral obligation of this ceremony, drawn from passages in the
                    New Testament, are so well known that it is needless to insist on them. But

                    may not be uninteresting.</p>
                <p>1. Athenaeus tells us, in his Deipnosophist (lib. ii.), that in the famous
                    regulation made by Amphictyon, king of Athens, respecting the use of wine, both
                    in sacrifices and at home, he required that the name of Jupiter the Sus-tainer
                    should be decently and reverently pronounced. The same writer (lib. iv. p. 149)
                    quotes Hermeias, an author extant in his time, who mentions a people in Egypt,
                    inhabitants of the city of Naucratis, whose custom it was on certain occasions,
                    after they had placed themselves in the usual posture of eating at table, to
                    rise again and kneel, upon which the priest or precentor of the solemnity began
                    to chant a grace, according to a stated form amongst them; and when that was
                    over, they joined in the meal in a solemn sacrificial manner. Heliodorus has a
                    passage to the same purpose in his <hi rend="italic">Aethiopica,</hi> where it
                    is stated that it was the custom of the Egyptian philosophers to pour out
                    libations and utter ejaculations before they sat down to meals. Porphyry (in his
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Abstinentia,</hi> lib. iv.
                    p. 408) gives a high character of the Samnean gymnosophists in Egypt for the
                    strictness of their lives; and, as one circumstance in their favour, he
                    observes, that at the sounding of a bell before their meals, which consisted
                    only of rice, bread, fruits, and herbs, they went to prayers; that when these
                    were ended, and not before, the bell again sounded, and they sat down to eat.
                    This religious usage or rite was also common amongst the ancient Greeks, and, if
                    Clement of Alexandria rightly informs us, it was derived from yet older times.
                    He mentions that this people, when they met together to refresh themselves with
                    the juice of the grape, sung a piece of music, in imitation of the Hebrew
                    psalms, which they called a scho)ion. Livy (lib. xxxix.) likewise speaks of it
                    as a settled custom amongst the old Romans, that they offered sacrifice and
                    prayer to the gods at their meals and compotations. But one of the fullest
                    testimonies to our purpose is given by Quintilian <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Declam.</hi> SOI): <hi rend="italic">Adisti mensam,</hi> says he, <hi
                    rend="italic">ad quam cum venire</hi><hi rend="italic">capimus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Deos</hi><hi rend="italic">invocamus.</hi></p>
                <p>Trigautius, in his elegant and instructive narrative of the expedition of the
                    Jesuit missionaries into China (book i. p. 69), gives this account of the people
                    of that country in the particular now under consideration. “Before they place
                    themselves for partaking of an entertainment, the person who makes it sets a
                    vessel, either of gold, or silver, or marble, or some such valuable material, in
                    a charger full of wine, which he holds with both his hands, and then makes <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> low bow to the person of chief quality or character at the
                    table. Then from the hall or dining-room he goes into the porch or entry, where
                    he again makes a very low bow, and turning his face to the south, pours out this
                    wine upon the ground as a thankful oblation to the Lord of heaven. After this,
                    repeating his reverential obeisance, he returns into the hall.” The Turks also
                    pray for a blessing on their meat; and many more instances might be produced of
                    infidels who constantly observe the same custom in some way or other.</p>
                <p>2. The fact, therefore, with respect to the heathen world being thus evident, we
                    proceed to notice the sentiments and conduct of the Jews in this particular.
                    Their historian Josephus, giving a detail of the rites and customs of the
                    Essenes, who were confessedly the strictest and most pious professors of the
                    Jewish religion, has this remarkable passage: “The priest,” says he, “prays for
                    a blessing before they presume to take any nourishment; and it is looked upon as
                    a great sin to take or taste before.” Then follows the thanksgiving after meat.
                    “When the meal,” he proceeds, “is over, the priest prays again; and the company
                    with him bless and praise God as their preserver, and the giver of their life
                    and nourishment.”</p>
                <p>But Philo, in his book <hi rend="italic">De Vita</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Contemplativa,</hi> gives an account of a body of men and women stricter than
                    even the Essenes. He distinguishes them by no particular name, though his
                    relation is minute and circumstantial; namely, that on certain special
                    occasions, before “they took their meals, they placed themselves in a proper
                    decent order, when, lifting up their hands and eyes to heaven, they prayed to
                    God that he would be pleased to be propitious to them in the use of those his
                    good creatures.”</p>
                <p>It appears, from the Hebrew ritual, that the Jews had their hymns and psalms of
                    thanksgiving, not only after eating their passover, but on a variety of other
                    occasions, at and after meals, and even between their several courses and
                    dishes; as when the best of their wine was brought upon the table, or their
                    aromatic confections, or the fruits of the garden, or the like. Upon the day of
                    the passover was sung the 114th psalm, “When Israel went out of Egypt.”</p>
                <p>Aristaeus has also a passage on the same subject. “Moses,” says he, “commands
                    that when the Jews are going to eat or drink, the company should immediately
                    join in sacrifice or prayer.” It is doubtful where Rabbi Eleazar found this
                    sentence, and its genuineness has been controverted. But supposing it not to be
                    found <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">scriptis,</hi> it is sufficient
                    to know that the Jews constantly practised this custom, upon the foundation of
                    an ancient tradition and general usage. That the prophet Daniel gave thanks
                    before meat is evident from the Apocryphal book concerning Bel and the Dragon,
                    where (verses 38, 39) we find that “Daniel said, Thou hast remembered me, 0 God,
                    neither hast thou forsaken them who seek thee and love thee; so Daniel arose,
                    and did eat.” Of this text Prudentia takes notice in Cathemirin (hymn iv.):</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hi» sumpti» Danicli» excitavit</hi><hi rend="italic">In</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">catum faciem, ciboque forti»,</hi><hi rend="italic">Amen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">reddidit, allelujah dixit.</hi></p>
                <p>It may be observed by the way, that the poet is a little mistaken in making the
                    prophet give thanks after meat; for, according to the text, he did so
                    before.</p>
