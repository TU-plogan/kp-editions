                <p><label type="entry">GIBBON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Edward</hi></label>, the
                    celebrated author of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, and generally
                    considered as forming, with Hume and Robertson, the triumvirate of great English
                    historians, was descended of an ancient but not very distinguished family of the
                    same name in the county of Kent. His grandfather, a merchant and citizen of
                    London, was, under the Tory administration of the last four years of Queen Anne
                    (1710-1714), appointed one of the commissioners of customs, and sat at the same
                    board with Matthew Prior; but the mercantile man seems to have been better
                    qualified for his station than the poet, at least in the opinion of Lord
                    Bolingbroke, who was heard to declare that he had never conversed with a person
                    who understood more clearly than Mr Gibbon the commerce and finances of England.
                    In the year 1716, he was elected one of the directors of the South Sea Company;
                    and, before his acceptance of this fatal office, he had acquired an independent
                    fortune of sixty thousand pounds. But this fortune was overwhelmed in the
                    shipwreck of the year 1720, when the company failed, and the accumulations of
                    thirty years were swallowed up in a single day. Of the use or abuse of the South
                    Sea scheme this is not the place to say any thing; and the question as to the
                    guilt or innocence of Mr Gibbon may also be passed over without remark or
                    discussion. In the first proceedings against the South Sea directors, however,
                    he was one of the few who were taken into custody; and, in the final sentence,
                    the measure of his fine was determined by the total estimate of his means, which
                    he delivered upon oath to the House of Commons. But a sum of ten thousand pounds
                    was afterwards allowed him for his maintenance; and on this foundation, with the
                    skill and credit of which parliament' had not been able to deprive him, he
                    erected the edifice of a new fortune, the greater part of which he prudently
                    secured in the purchase of landed property. He died in his house at Putney, in
                    December 1736, and, by his last will, enriched his two daughters, Catharine and
                    Hester, at the expense of his only son, Edward, the father of the historian, who
                    had married without his consent. This son, who was born in 1707, received the
                    benefit of a liberal education. At Westminster, and afterwards at Emmanuel
                    College, Cambridge, he passed through a regular course of academical discipline.
                    He then proceeded on his travels, but without taking a degree; and, on his
                    return to England, he was chosen member of parliament for the borough of
                    Petersfield in 1734, and again for that of Southampton in 1741. In parliament he
                    joined the party which, after a long and fierce contest, finally succeeded in
                    driving Sir Robert Walpole from power; and his son has not concealed that, in
                    the pursuit of an unpopular minister, he gratified a private revenge against the
                    supposed oppressor of his family in the South Sea persecution. This retaliation,
                    however, was entirely misdirected; for Mr Coxe has clearly proved that, so far
                    from stimulating or exasperating the fury of that time, Walpole endeavoured to
                    stem the torrent of parliamentary vengeance, and to turn the sentiments of the
                    house into the safe channel of moderation.</p>
                <p>Edward Gibbon, the future historian of the Roman empire in its decline and fall,
                    was born at Putney, in Surrey, on the 27th April, old style, in the year 1737.
                    His mother, Judith Porten,was the youngest daughter of James Porten, a merchant
                    of London; and he was the eldest of five brothers and a sister, all of whom died
                    in infancy. During his early years his constitution was so feeble, and his life
                    so precarious, that, in the baptism of his brothers, his father successively
                    repeated the Christian name of Edward; and to preserve and rear so frail a
                    being, the most tender assiduity was scarcely sufficient. From this anxious and
                    painful duty his mother’s attention was diverted by frequent pregnancy, an
                    exclusive passion for her husband, and the dissipation of the world; but the
                    maternal office was supplied by his maiden aunt, Mrs Catharine Porten, who
                    nursed him with the greatest tenderness, and, during the intervals of
                    convalescence, procured him such instruction as his years and infirm health
                    admitted. After some previous instruction at home, or in a day-school at Putney,
                    he was, at the age of seven, placed under the care of Mr John Kirkby (author of
                    <hi rend="italic">Aιιtomathes,</hi> a philosophical romance), who, for about
                    eighteen months, acted as his domestic tutor. In his ninth year (January 1746),
                    during a lucid interval of comparative health, he was sent to a school at
                    Kingston-upon-Thames, which was then kept by Dr Wσoddeson and his assistants;
                    but his studies were still frequently interrupted by sickness; and though, by
                    the common methods of discipline, he purchased some knowledge of Latin syntax,
                    he does not speak with much satisfaction of his proficiency, and, after a real
                    or nominal residence of nearly two years, he was finally recalled by his
                    mother’s death in 1747. After this event, he spent about two years in the rustic
                    solitude of Buriton, to which his father had retired; and there, principally
                    under the eye of his affectionate aunt, he acquired that invincible love of
                    reading which, he declares, he would not exchange for the treasures of India. In
                    1749, he was sent to Westminster school, then conducted by Dr John Nicol, where,
                    within the space of two more years, he reached the third form; but his
                    application was so frequently interrupted by sickness, or rendered useless by
                    debility, that, by medical advice, he was removed to Bath, whence, after an
                    ineffectual trial of the virtues of its mineral waters, he was transported to
                    Winchester, to the house of a physician. From the latter place he returned
                    unimproved in health to Bath, and at length moved with his father to Buriton and
                    Putney, where he so far recovered, that a short and unsuccessful trial was made
                    to renew his attendance at Westminster school. But his infirmities could not be
                    reconciled with the hours and discipline of a public seminary; and as he was not
                    provided with a domestic tutor, who might have watched the favourable moments,
                    and imperceptibly advanced him in learning, he was obliged to be content with
                    such occasional teachers as the different places of his residence could
                    supply.</p>
                <p>As he approached his sixteenth year, however, his sufferings entirely ceased.
                    Nature, to use his own words, displayed in his favour her mysterious energies;
                    his constitution became fortified and fixed; and his disorder, instead of
                    gaining strength with his years, and reducing him for <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193520506" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0506-0503"/>life to the condition of an
                    illiterate cripple, most wonderfully vanished. Encouraged by his unexpected
                    recovery, his father placed him at Esher, in Surrey, in the house of the
                    Reverend Philip Francis, the translator of Horace, who, it was expected, would
                    at least inspire him with a taste for the Latin poets. But this hope was
                    altogether frustrated. Mr Francis preferred the pleasures of London to the
                    instruction of his pupils; and, amidst the perplexity which this discovery
                    occasioned, young Gibbon was, without further preparation, hurried by his father
                    to Oxford, where, on the 3d of April 1752, he was matriculated as a gentleman
                    commoner of Magdalen College.</p>
                <p>“I arrived at Oxford,” says Gibbon, “with a stock of erudition that might have
                    puzzled a doctor, and a degree of ignorance of which a school-boy might have
                    been ashamed.” During the preceding three years, although sickness prevented him
                    from following a regular course of instruction, his fondness for b∞ks had
                    increased, and he was permitted to indulge without restraint his love of
                    desultory reading. But his indiscriminate appetite subsided by degrees into the
                    historical line, and he perused with avidity such books of history as accident
                    threw in his way, gratifying a curiosity of which he could not trace the source,
                    and supplying wants of which he felt the craving without being able to account
                    for his predilections. The assiduous perusal of the Universal History, as the
                    octavo volumes successively appeared, and of a treatise by Hearne, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ductor</hi><hi rend="italic">Historicus,</hi> introduced him to as
                    many of the Greek and Roman historians as were accessible to an English reader.
                    He also devoured Littlebury’s Herodotus, Spelman’s Xenophon, Gordon’s Tacitus,
                    and “a ragged Procopius” which happened to fall in his way; whilst “many crude
                    lumps” of Speed, Rapin, Mezeray, Davila, Machiavel, Fra Paolo, Bower, and
                    others, were swallowed, if not digested by him; and in the descriptions of India
                    and China, Mexicoand Peru, he found an inexhaustible source of gratification.
                    The continuation of Echard’s Roman History gave him some insight into the reigns
                    of the successors of Constantine; and in Howel’s History of the World he found
                    the Byzantine period exhibited on a larger scale. Mahommed and his Saracens soon
                    fixed his attention; and Simon Ockley, an original in every sense, having opened
                    his eyes to the true character of both, he was led from one book to another,
                    until he had ranged round the whole circle of oriental history. The same
                    insatiable ardour urged him to guess at the French of D’Herbelot, and to
                    endeavour to construe the barbarous Latin of Pococke’s Abulfaragius. The maps of
                    Cellarius and Wells imprinted on his memory the details of ancient geography;
                    from Stranchius he imbibed the elements of chronology; the Tables of Helvicus
                    and Anderson, together with the Annals of Usher and Prideaux, distinguished the
                    connection of events; the systems of Scaliger and Petavius, of Marsham and
                    Newton, which he could seldom study in the originals, formed the subject of
                    frequent meditation; and his sleep was sometimes disturbed by vain attempts to
                    reconcile the Septuagint with the Hebrew computation.</p>
                <p>In this strange and eccentric course of desultory reading, young Gibbon, whilst
                    ranging at pleasure through such books as fell in his way, seems to have been
                    unconsciously and instinctively led to that great branch of literature in which
                    he was destined subsequently to attain the highest eminence. But the habits thus
                    formed, whatever influence they may have exerted on his future life, were by no
                    means favourable to the success of his academical pursuits. He was, by his own
                    admission, exceedingly deficient in classical learning; and, in fact, he appears
                    to have been sent to Oxford without either the preparation or the mental
                    training necessary to enable him to reap the advantages of academical
                    instruction. This may probably account for the harshness with which he speaks of
                    the system pursued in the English universities, though it will neither explain
                    nor obviate critical censures, many of which subsequent reform and improvement
                    show to have been but too well founded. He appears to have spent at Magdalen
                    College fourteen months, which he describes as the most idle and unprofitable in
                    his life; but why, even with his habits of irregular application, they were so
                    idle and unprofitable, he has nowhere informed us. Of the indifference of one of
                    his tutors, and the almost total neglect of the other, he appears, indeed, to
                    have had good cause of complaint; but as he admits that he was disposed to
                    gaiety and late hours, the pupil must in justice share the blame with his
                    masters, and cease to complain that he was not taught what he perhaps affected
                    to despise. His objections to the system pursued, however, and his strictures on
                    the silence of the Oxford professors, which is imperfectly supplied by the
                    tutors of the several colleges, and by which the youth are deprived of public
                    instruction, with all the advantages resulting from this species of institution,
                    remain in full force, and are altogether unaffected by the personal
                    circumstances to which we have just alluded.</p>
                <p>When Gibbon first left Magdalen College, during the long recess between the
                    Trinity and Michaelmas terms, his taste for reading, as he informs us, began
                    whimsically enough to revive, and, “unprovided with original learning, unformed
                    in the habits of thinking, and unskilled in the arts of composition, he resolved
                    to write a book.” The title of this first essay, The Age of Sesostris, was
                    perhaps suggested by Voltaire’s Age of Louis XIV.; and, what is deserving of
                    remark, its object was not to narrate the exploits of the conqueror of Asia, but
                    to investigate the probable date of his life and reign. On his return to Oxford,
                    however, he abandoned this project, and the sheets he had written were
                    afterwards committed to the flames. By the negligence of his second tutor he was
                    now left entirely to himself, and, from want of experience, advice, and
                    occupation, he was betrayed into culpable improprieties of conduct, ill-chosen
                    company, late hours, and inconsiderate expense. In his peculiar frame of mind,
                    indeed, there appears to have been originally interwoven no inconsiderable share
                    of juvenile arrogance and presumption. Whilst his debts were growing, his
                    studies neglected, and his frequent absences from his college visible and
                    scandalous, the blind activity of idleness urged him into the perilous mazes of
                    controversy, and, at the age of sixteen, he contrived to bewilder himself amidst
                    the errors of the church of Rome.</p>
                <p>The bold criticism of Middleton’s Free Inquiry appears to have given the first
                    shock to his Protestantism; and whilst he hovered as it were on the very verge
                    of infidelity, the perusal of Bossuet’s Exposition of the Catholic Doctrine, and
                    his History of the Protestant Variations, seem to have recalled him from the
                    region of doubt, and led him to seek repose in the bosom of an infallible
                    church. These works, says he, “achieved my conversion, and I surely fell by a
                    noble hand.” In this fall, however, Parsons the Jesuit appears to have had a
                    considerable share; for, in another part of his Memoirs, he imputes his
                    conversion principally to that vigorous writer, who, in his opinion, had urged
                    all the best arguments in favour of the Roman Catholic religion. But be this as
                    it may, he had no sooner settled his new religion than he resolved to profess
                    himself a Catholic; and, accordingly, on the 8th of June 1753, he solemnly
                    abjured the errors of heresy before a Catholic priest in London, and immediately
                    announced the event to his father in an elaborate controversial epistle,
                    approved by his .spiritual director. His father, though neither a bigot nor a
                    philosopher, was astonished at his apostacy from the religion of his country;
                    and having, in the first <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520519"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-0519-0504"/>sally of passion, divulged a secret which prudence
                    might have suppressed, thus shut the gates of Magdalen College against the
                    return of his son. At an advanced age, when he had learned to treat all
                    religions with equal indifference, Gibbon, reviewing this event of his life,
                    speaks of it with an indulgent tenderness, which will perhaps be acknowledged as
                    more natural than just; he avows himself proud of an honest sacrifice of
                    interest to conscience; and he declares that he can never blush if his tender
                    mind was entangled in the sophistry which had seduced the manly understandings
                    of Chillingworth and Bayle. The resemblance, however, is closer in the
                    transition which they afterwards made from superstition to scepticism; from that
                    state of mind which believes against reason, to its opposite extreme, which
                    attacks the foundations of reason itself, and seeks to inculcate a belief that
                    there is no belief. “To my present feelings,” says Gibbon, “it seems incredible
                    that I should ever believe that I believed in transubstantiation.”</p>
                <p>Finding it necessary to form a new plan of education, and also to devise a method
                    which, if possible, might effect the cure of his spiritual malady, his father,
                    after much consideration, determined to fix him, during some years, at Lausanne,
                    in Switzerland; and there he was accordingly established, with a very moderate
                    allowance, under the care of Μ. Pavilliard, a Calvinist minister of that place.
                    In as far as regards the instructor and guide thus selected, a more fortunate
                    choice could scarcely have been made. From the testimony of his pupil, and the
                    still more conclusive evidence of his own correspondence with the elder Mr
                    Gibbon, Μ. Pavilliard appears to have been a man of singular good sense, temper,
                    and knowledge of the human mind; and in the method of instruction which he
                    adopted for the double purpose of advancing the intellectual improvement and
                    correcting the religious aberration of his pupil, he evinced a refinement and
                    delicacy of judgment which it is much more easy to admire than to imitate, At
                    first, however, Μ. Pavilliard had a twofold obstacle to contend with; he could
                    not speak English, and as Mr Gibbon did not understand French, some time
                    necessarily elapsed before he could even attempt to carry into effect the
                    instructions he had received. But when, by mutual industry, this difficulty had
                    been in part removed, Μ. Pavilliard lost no time in endeavouring, by considerate
                    and judicious kindness, to secure the attachment of his pupil; and having
                    accomplished this object, he then directed his studies according to a regular
                    plan, and placed within his own reach such means of information as seemed best
                    calculated to remove the errors into which he had fallen. “My obligations to the
                    lessons of Μ. Pavilliard,” says the historian in his Memoirs, “gratitude will
                    not suffer me to forget; he was endowed with a clear head and a warm heart; his
                    innate benevolence had assuaged the spirit of his church; he was rational
                    because he was moderate; in the course of his studies he had acquired a just,
                    though superficial knowledge of most branches of literature; and he laboured
                    with assiduous patience to know the character, gain the affection, and open the
                    mind of his English pupil. As soon as we began to understand each other, he
                    gently led me, from a blind and undistinguishing love of reading, into the path
                    of instruction. I consented with pleasure that a portion of the morning hours
                    should be consecrated to a plan of modem history and geography, and to the
                    critical perusal of the French and Latin classics; and at each step I felt
                    myself invigorated by the habits of application and method. His prudence
                    repressed and dissembled some youthful sallies; and as soon as I was confirmed
                    in habits of industry and temperance, he gave the reins into my own hands." On
                    the more delicate subject of religion, Μ. Pavilliard followed the same winning
                    and judicious method, with equal success; and at length, on Christmas day 1754,
                    Mr Gibbon, after a full conviction, received the sacrament in the church of
                    Lausanne. “It was here," says he, “that I suspended my religious inquiries,
                    acquiescing with implicit belief in the tenets and mysteries which are adopted
                    by the general consent of Catholics and Protestants.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As Mr Gibbon was himself alone instrumental
                    in his conversion to popery, so he seems inclined to take to himself a large
                    share of the merit of his reconversion to protestantism. “Mr Pavilliard,” says
                    he, “was not unmindful that his first task, his most important duty, was to
                    reclaim me from the errors of popery. The intermixture of sects has rendered the
                    Swiss clergy acute and learned on the topics of controversy ļ and I have some of
                    his letters in which he celebrates the dexterity of his attack, and my gradual
                    concessions, after a firm and weU managed defence. I was willing, and I am now
                    willing, to allow him a handsome share of the honoβr of my conversion; yet I
                    must observe that it was principally effected by my private reflections; and I
                    still remember my solitary transport at the discovery of a philosophical
                    argument against transubstantiation.” with reference to the claim here put
                    forward by Mr Gibbon, Lord Sheffield observes: “Μ. Pavilliard has described to
                    me the astonishment with which he gazed on Mr Gibbon standing before him; a thin
                    little figure, with a large bead, disputing and urging, with the greatest
                    ability, all the best arguments that bad ever been used in ftvourot popery.”
                    Bossuet and Parsons had supplied him with hrs arms.</p></note></p>
                <p>At Lausanne Gibbon laid the foundation of all his future improvement; and
                    although it is no doubt true, as he has himself observed, that every man who
                    rises above the common level has received two educations, one from his teachers
                    and another from himself, yet it is at least equally so that the success of the
                    second is in a great measure dependent on the proper direction given to the
                    first Under his judicious tutor he was reclaimed from his excursive and
                    desultory habits of reading, and initiated in a regular and methodical course of
                    study, without in the least abating his thirst of general knowledge, or
                    hindering him from gratifying his curiosity, after the hours appropriated to the
                    pursuits in which he had been led to engage. His reading had now a fixed object,
                    the attainment of which made him sensible of the value of his acquisitions, and
                    reconciled him to that system of regular application by which all his powers
                    were invigorated. By acquiring a knowledge of the Greek, Latin, and French
                    languages, new stores of learning were opened, and new models of taste presented
                    to him. Poetry, history, philosophy, criticism, and antiquities, in their turn
                    occupied his attention; and the honest zeal of the tutor was admirably seconded
                    by an unwearied industry and insatiable avidity of knowledge on the part of the
                    pupil, which bespoke a mind capable of extraordinary attainments, and deserving
                    of the highest honours in literature. For the pursuit of science, however, he
                    evinced neither the same aptitude nor the same inclination. His father had been
                    desirous, and even pressing, that he should devote some time to the study of the
                    mathematics; nor did he refuse to comply with a wish so reasonable. But, after
                    attending during two winters the prelections of a teacher, who explained the
                    elements of algebra and geometry as far as the conic sections of the Marquis de
                    1'Hôpital, he relinquished for ever the pursuit of the mathematics, in which he
                    appears to have made but little proficiency, and consoled himself with the
                    reflection, in which few will probably be inclined to coincide, that he desisted
                    “before his mind had become hardened by the habit of rigid demonstration, so
                    destructive of the finer feelings of moral evidence, which must determine the
                    actions and opinions of our lives.” It is not very wonderful, perhaps, that a
                    mind naturally disposed to doubt should shrink from certain and demonstrable
                    truth, which excludes the play of sceptical ingenuity; or that the rigour of
                    exact science should revolt one <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520532"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-0532-0505"/>who had so long been accustomed to expatiate in
                    the more attractive regions of taste and literature; but, on the other hand, it
                    does seem a little surprising that Gibbon, like Johnson, should have thought
                    himself entitled to undervalue a science which he had failed to acquire, and
                    that his memory did not suggest to him many eminent examples in disproof of his
                    assertion that the mind becomes hardened by the habit of rigid demonstration. It
                    is always easy, however, to find a plausible excuse for neglecting that which we
                    want either the power or the inclination to pursue.</p>
                <p>Whilst at Lausanne, Gibbon to his classical attainments added the study of
                    Grotius and Puffendorff, of Locke and Montesquieu; and he also mentions the
                    Provincial Letters of Pascal, the Life of Julian by La Bleterie, and the Civil
                    History of Naples by Giannone, as having remotely contributed to form the
                    historian of the Homan empire. From the Provincitd Letters he tells us that he
                    learned to manage the weapon of grave and temperate irony, even on subjects of
                    ecclesiastical solemnity; a weapon, we may remark, which, however useful to a
                    polemic, is unlawful in the hand of an historian, and which, when resorted to by
                    the latter, justly subjects him to the suspicion of having exhausted both his
                    courage and his argument. Truth as well as error may be discredited by a sneer,
                    which it is proverbially impossible to refute; sarcasm may provoke ridicule and
                    excite contempt, but it can never conduce to the purposes of that sound
                    practical philosophy which seeks its examples in history. It is more to the
                    honour of our indefatigable student that, about this time, he established a
                    correspondence with several distinguished literary characters, to whom he looked
                    for instruction and direction; with Crevier, the successor of llollin, and the
                    editor of Livy; with Breitenger of Zurich, the editor of a Septuagint Bible;
                    with Professor Matthew Gesner of Göttingen, and Μ. Allamand, minister at Bex
                    ;—and that by the acuteness of his remarks, the extent of his knowledge, and his
                    zeal in the cause of literature, he attracted their particular attention, and
                    proved himself not unworthy of their confidence.</p>
                <p>He had also the satisfaction of seeing Voltaire, who, after forfeiting by his own
                    misconduct the friendship of the king of Prussia, had retired, at the age of
                    sixty, with a plentiful fortune, to this free and beautiful country, and resided
                    two winters at Monrepos, a countryhouse close to a suburb of Lausanne. “The most
                    extraordinary man of the age” received the young Englishman with civility, but
                    without any peculiar notice or distinction. <hi rend="italic">Virgilium
                    nidi</hi><hi rend="italic">tantum,</hi> says Gibbon. But the incense with which
                    the autocrat of literature was then approached, and the boyish enthusiasm of the
                    unfledged author, which made him look upon admission to the private theatricals
                    of Monrepos as the highest distinction, could scarcely be without influence on
                    the formation of his character and opinions. According to his own expression, he
                    then rated Voltaire above his real magnitude; but he was probably unconscious
                    that both his tone of mind and his manner of expression, in which he was ever
                    endeavouring to point his stately and inflexible English with the light and
                    graceful irony of the Frenchman, were perpetually betraying his early adoration
                    of the patriarch; whilst, on the other hand, Voltaire little suspected that, in
                    the awkward and oddly-formed English boy (whose memory had retained, and whose
                    indiscretion made public, one of his fugitive poems not yet intended for the
                    vulgar ear), he was silently forming, not a disciple, but a fellow-labourer,
                    whose fame would at length cast his own historical reputation into the shade.
                    The immediate effect of Mr Gibbon’s attendance at the private theatre of
                    Monrepos was an increased predilection for the French stage, and a corresponding
                    decline in his veneration for Shakspeare. A taste formed to delight in the
                    smooth-shaven, artificial lawn of a French play, can never retain any relish for
                    the wild, irregular, masculine beauties of our great dramatist, heaped together
                    as they are with all the profusion, magnificence, and simplicity of nature
                    herself.</p>
                <p>Gibbon was now familiar in some, and acquainted in many families of Lausanne, and
                    his evenings were generally devoted to conversation and cards, either in private
                    parties, or in what are called assemblies; in short, he enjoyed his full share
                    of the amusements of society. During this alternation of study and pleasure, he
                    became enamoured of Mademoiselle Susan Curchod, daughter of the minister of
                    Crassy, in the mountains which separate the Pays de Vaud from the county of
                    Burgundy; a young lady whose personal attractions were, he assures us,
                    embellished by the virtues and talents of the mind. His addresses were favoured
                    by Mademoiselle Curchod and her parents, and both at Crassy and at Lausanne he
                    indulged his dream of felicity; but his father, on being consulted, expressed
                    the utmost repugnance to “this strange alliance,” and his son, thinking more of
                    his prospects than of his passion, yielded, as he says, to his fate. “I sighed
                    as a lover,” he adds; “I obeyed as a son.” His wound, which could scarcely have
                    been deep, was insensibly healed by time, absence, and the habits of a new life;
                    and his cure was accelerated by learning that the lady herself was not
                    inconsolable for the loss of so prudent a lover. But the minister of Crassy soon
                    afterwards died, and as his stipend died with him, his daughter retired to
                    Geneva, where, by teaching young ladies, she earned a hard subsistence for her
                    mother and herself. In her lowest distress, however, she maintained a spotless
                    reputation, and having attracted the notice of a rich banker of Paris, a citizen
                    of Geneva, she became the wife of Μ. Neckar, afterwards prime minister of
                    France. .</p>
                <p>In 1758, Mr Gibbon took leave of Lausanne, and returned to England, after an
                    absence of nearly five years. His father received him as a man and a friend, and
                    appeared to rejoice in the success of the plan of education which had effected
                    the reconversion and improvement of his son. One disagreeable circumstance,
                    however, awaited the young student on his return to his native country and
                    paternal home. In the room of her who had given him birth he found a stepmother,
                    whom he regarded as an intruder, and to whom he was introduced with the most
                    unfavourable prejudice. But this initial dislike, by no means unnatural on his
                    part, was soon overcome by the amiable manners and obliging conduct of the new
                    Mrs Gibbon, who gave him a polite welcome, and did all in her power to study and
                    gratify his wishes. At home he was allowed to consult his own taste in the
                    choice of place, company, and amusements; and his excursions were bounded only
                    by the limits of the island and the measure of his income. He assiduously
                    frequented the theatre at a very propitious era of the stage, and indulged
                    somewhat freely in the pleasures of a town life; but the better ha- ' bits which
                    he had formed at Lausanne, prevailing over these occasional excesses, induced
                    him to seek more elegant and rational society, though, in the first instance,
                    not with the success which might have been expected. He had now reached his
                    twenty-first year without having made choice of a profession, or engaged in any
                    regular employment. His stepmother recommended the study of the law, and some
                    faint efforts were made to procure for him the situation of secretary to a
                    foreign embassy; but the former scheme he declined, and the latter did not
                    succeed.</p>
                <p>Of the first two years which he spent in England, he passed about nine months in
                    London, and the remainder in the country. But as his father’s taste had always
                    preferred the highest and the lowest company, for which, it seems, he was
                    equally qualified, he was by this time forgotten by the great with whom he had
                    associated; and, as he had no fixed residence in London, his son failed <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193520545" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0545-0506"/> to gain admission
                    into those circles of society in which he ardently desired to move. He acquired
                    an intimacy, however, in the house of David Mallet, and by his means was
                    introduced to Lady Harvey’s parties; nor was he at all displeased by her
                    preference and affectation of the manners, language, and literature of France.
                    But his progress in the English world was in general left to his own efforts,
                    and those efforts, he says, were languid and slow. The want of society, however,
                    does not appear to have given him much uneasiness; he depended chiefly on
                    himself for his happiness; and, unlike many of his countrymen, he knew not the
                    tediousness of an idle life, or the misery of having hours which he could not
                    occupy. At Buriton he enjoyed many opportunities of adding to his stock of
                    learning; books became more and more the source of all his pleasures; and the
                    leisure he could borrow from his systematic plan of study was employed in
                    perusing the works of the best English authors since the revolution. His father
                    had endeavoured in vain to inspire him with a taste for agriculture, and to
                    induce him to acquire a knowledge of rural affairs; but his own more rational
                    object was to restore the purity of his diction which had been corrupted by the
                    long and constant use of a foreign idiom. By the advice of Mallet he was
                    directed to the writings of Swift and Addison, which he has on the whole
                    judiciously discriminated. ∙ “Wit and simplicity,” says he, “are their common
                    attributes; but the style of Swift is supported by manly original vigour; that
                    of Addison is adorned by the female graces of elegance and mildness.” But the
                    first productions of Robertson and Hume, the histories of Scotland and of the
                    Stuarts, engaged his attention still more deeply. The perfect composition, the
                    nervous language, and the well-turned periods of the one, inflamed him with the
                    ambitious hope that he might one day tread in his footsteps; whilst the calm
                    philosophy and the careless inimitable beauties of the other often forced him to
                    close the volume with a mixed sensation of delight and despair. Charmed,
                    however, as he was with Swift and Addison, with Robertson and Hume, and well as
                    he knew how to appreciate the peculiar excellencies of their respective styles,
                    he lost sight of every model when he became a writer of history, and formed a
                    style of his own, which, though in its essential spirit it is at least in part
                    French, is justly entitled to be considered as original.</p>
                <p>In 1761, Gibbon, yielding to the authority of a parent, published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Essai sur [Etude de la Littérature,</hi> which appeared in a small
                    volume duodecimo. As his object, at this time, was to get an appointment as
                    secretary of legation to some English ambassador or plenipotentiary, his father
                    believed that the proof of some literary talents might introduce him to public
                    notice, and second the recommendation of his friends; and, with these views, the
                    essay in question was published. Part of this production had been written at
                    Lausanne, and the remainder completed in London, where the whole was revised by
                    Dr Maty, author of the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Britannique,</hi> who approved the design, and applauded the execution. The
                    object of the essay was to prove, in opposition to D’Alembert and other writers
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie,</hi> that all the faculties of the mind
                    may be exercised and displayed in the study of ancient literature, and that the
                    new philosophy for which the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédistes</hi> contended
                    was not more adverse to the cultivation of taste than inconsistent with the
                    principles of enlightened reason. But he introduces a variety of topics not
                    immediately bearing on his design, and shows that, in the belles-lettres and in
                    criticism, he had expatiated through a range much more ample than could have
                    been expected from his years. The work, indeed, is remarkable, both for the
                    ideas which it contains, and for the purity with which it is written in French,
                    a language then more familiar to Gibbon than his own. This book, however, made
                    less sensation in England than in France, where it was most favourably received,
                    and, by anticipation, ensured the autþor, particularlyamongst men of letters,
                    the most distinguished reception. In England it was received with cold
                    indifference, little read, and speedily forgotten; but had the knowledge of the
                    French language been then as common in the literary world as it is now, so
                    extraordinary a production from the pen of a young man would have met with a
                    different reception, and raised high expectations of future eminence. For the
                    neglect of his countrymen, however, the author was in some measure indemnified
                    by the copious extracts, the warm commendations, and the flattering predictions,
                    of the journals of France and Holland, countries where the work was estimated at
                    its real value. In his Memoirs he discusses its merits and defects with singular
                    impartiality; but, in fixing the respective measures of praise and blame, the
                    former predominates, and with justice.</p>
                <p>The uncongenial profession of a militia captain, which was embraced by Gibbon
                    about the time when this essay appeared, neither diverted his mind from his
                    historical pursuits, nor relaxed his unwearied industry. It is true, that for
                    two years and a half he endured a “wandering life of military servitude" in the
                    south battalion of the Hampshire militia; but though the roll of the drum
                    disturbed him in the midst of an inquiry into ancient weights, measures, and
                    coins, even these days of more than usual bodily activity and mental distraction
                    were turned to account. In his marchings and countermarchings from Winchester to
                    Blandford, and from Blandford to Southampton, he studied the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoires Militaires</hi> of Μ. Guischardt ;—the discipline and movementsofa
                    modern battalion gave him a clearer notion of the phalanx and the legion ;—and,
                    amidst his peaceful evolutions, the captain of the Hampshire grenadiers laid in
                    that store of military knowledge which afterwards enabled him successfully to
                    elucidate the campaigns of Julian, of Belisarius, and of Narses. At the peace of
                    1763 his regiment was disbanded, and he resumed his studies, the regularity of
                    which had suffered unavoidable interruption during the period of his service in
                    the militia. In forming a new plan, he hesitated for a time between the
                    mathematics and the Greek language, both of which he had neglected since his
                    return from Lausanne; but having at length given the preference to Greek, he
                    applied himself to Homer, and pursued his reading with unflinching vigour.
                    Whatever he read or studied, however, appears to have had reference, directly or
                    indirectly, to historical composition. From the early age of fifteen, when he
                    projected writing the Age of Sesostris, this seems to have been the grand aim of
                    all his studies; and, in fact, he aspired to the character of an historian long
                    before he was able to fix upon a subject. Nor was the time unfavourable to his
                    ambition, or calculated to abate his ardour. On the contrary, a generous
                    emulation was excited by witnessing the triumphs of Robertson and Hume; and it
                    is not improbable that, whilst he secretly aspired to complete the triumvirate
                    of British historians, he thought that a subject only was wanting to enable him
                    to realise the object of his ambition.</p>
                <p>During his life of military servitude, as he calls it, he had resolved on several
                    subjects for historical composition, which, from their diversity and
                    dissimilarity, prove that he had then no particular purpose to serve, no
                    preconceived theory to support, no actual prejudice or belief to overthrow.
                    Amongst these he has enumerated, 1. the expedition of Charles VIII. of France
                    into Italy; 2. the crusade of Richard <hi rend="italic">Coeur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Lion</hi>; 3. the barons’ wars against John and Henry III.; 4.
                    the history of Edward the Black Prince; 5. the lives, with comparisons, of Henry
                    V. and the Emperor Titus; 6. the life of Sir Philip Sidney; and, lastly, that of
                    “Scotland’s Montrose ;” all of which he sue-cessively<pb break="no"

                    fixed on Sir Walter Raleigh as his hero; but, after dwelling with fondness on
                    his eventful story, varied by the characters of the soldier and sailor, the
                    courtier and historian, he abandoned his design. “What new lights,” he asks,
                    “could I reflect on a subject which has exercised the accurate industry of
                    Birch, the lively and curious acuteness of Walpole, the critical spirit of Hurd,
                    the vigorous sense of Robertson, and the impartial philosophy of Hume ?” The
                    History of the Liberty of the Swiss, and the History of the Republic of Florence
                    under the House of Medicis, were each in turn meditated and discarded.</p>
                <p>But whilst his brain was teeming with projects, which came like shadows and so
                    departed, all his designs were suspended by a visit to the Continent, which,
                    according to the law of custom, if not of reason, his father thought necessary
                    to complete his education. Having obtained from Lady Harvey, Horace Walpole,
                    Mallet, and the Duke of Nivernois,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In acknowledging the politeness of the Duke of Nivemois,
                    Gibbon notices a circumstance which serves in some degree to unfold his own
                    character, and also to exhibit that superiority of pretension, from which, in
                    fact, he never departed. “The Duke,” says he, “received me civilly, but, perhaps
                    through Maty’s <hi rend="italic">fault,</hi> treated me more as a man of letters
                    than as a man of fashion.” Congreve and Gray were &lt;veak enough to be offended
                    on account of a similar mistake; but that Gibbon, whose sole ambition was to
                    rise to literary eminence, should have for a moment preferred the equivocal
                    character of a man of fashion to that of a man of letters, is as unaccountable
                    as it is surprising that, at an advanced period of life, he should have
                    deliberately recorded such an incident If he had been only a man of fashion, the

                    Paris on the 28th of January 1763, only thirty-six days after the disbanding of
                    the militia. Two years were loosely defined as the term of his absence; and he
                    was left at liberty to spend his time in such places and in such a manner as
                    might be most agreeable to his own taste and judgment. In France the fame of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Essai sur</hi><hi rend="italic">l’ Etude</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    considered as an Englishman of fortune who merely wrote for his amusement. When
                    Gibbon reached Paris, Montesquieu and Fontenelle were no more; Voltaire had
                    retired to his estate near Geneva; Rousseau had been driven from his hermitage
                    of Montmorency; and he neglected to seek the acquaintance of Buffon. But he
                    mixed in familiar society with D'Alembert, Diderot, the Count de Caylus, the
                    Abbé de la Bléterie, Barthélemy, Raynal, Arnaud, Condamine, Puclos,
                    Bougainville, Caperonnier, De Guignes, Suard, and others; and four days in the
                    week he had a place without invitation at the hospitable tables of Mesdames

                    ><p>Gibbon was also introduced to Madame du Deffand, on whom he appears to have
                    made, upon the whole, a favourable impression. But his elaborate efforts to
                    be&gt;agreeable, and to assume the perfect tone of French society and manners,
                    did not escape that clever and fastidious woman, whom voltaire so justly called

                    fourteen weeks at Paris, enjoying the society and amusements of that capital,
                    he, in the month of May 1763, revisited his old friends at Lausanne, where he
                    remained nearly a year. During this sojourn on the banks of the Leman Lake, he
                    formed an acquaintance, destined to ripen into lasting friendship, with Mr
                    Holroyd, afterwards Lord Sheffield, who at a subsequent period became as it were
                    the guardian of his posthumous fame, and whom he characterises as “a friend
                    whose activity in the ardour of youth was always prompted by a benevolent heart
                    and‘a strong understanding.” In 1764 he set out for Italy, after having
                    carefully studied the geography and ancient history of the seat of the Roman
                    empire, with the view of rendering his visit profitable and satisfactory to his
                    own mind. His description of his journey is clear and precise; and as he
                    possessed a temper not very susceptible of enthusiasm, he scorns to affect
                    raptures which he did not feel. But the sight of Rome appeared to have conquered
                    his apathy, and as he approached and entered the eternal city, his mind was
                    agitated with emotions which he declares it impossible either to forget or
                    express. Here the conception of the work which was destined to fix and
                    perpetuate his fame first rose in his mind. “It was at Rome,” says he, “on the
                    15th of October 1764, as I sat musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol, while the
                    bare-footed fryars were singing vespers in the Temple of Jupiter [now the church
                    of Zocolants or Franciscan friars] that the idea of writing the decline and fall
                    of the city first started to my mind.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In a memoir of the life of Gibbon, prefixed to Guizot’s
                    French edition of the Decline and Fall, and written by Μ. Suard, the translator
                    of Kobertson, to whom the historian was intimately known, we meet with the
                    following observations on the passage above quoted: “Perhaps it will not be
                    difficult to trace, in the impressions from which the conception of the work
                    arose, one of the causes of that war which Gibbon seems to have declared against
                    christianity; the design of which neither appears conformable to his character,
                    little disposed to party-spirit, nor consistent with that moderation of thought
                    and sentiment which led him in all things, particular as well as general, to
                    view the advantages as well as the injurious consequences. But, struck with a
                    first impression. Gibbon, in writing the history of the fall of the empire, saw
                    in christianity only an institution which had placed vespers, barefooted friars,
                    and processions, in the room of the magnificent ceremonies of the worship of
                    Jupiter and the triumphs of the Capitol” This explanation, however, seems to us
                    entirely fallacious. In many of his habits Gibbon was at least half a Frenchman;
                    but he was not the creature of such impressions as that which Μ. Suard has here
                    attributed to him. He drew his aversion to Christianity from a deeper source.
                    Paganism was the old established religion; Christianity, viewed in its origin
                    and early history, was a daring innovation. The one was sanctioned by time and
                    confirmed by habit; the other had nothing but its truth to recommend it. In this
                    light Gibbon viewed the two religions, as he has himself unequivocally declared
                    in one of his letters; his principles naturally led him to recognise the
                    prescriptive rights of paganism, which he regarded as the established system;
                    and they also indisposed him towards Christianity, which sought to effect and
                    ultimately accomplished its subversion. The conservative character of bis
                    political creed attached him to the former; but he bated the latter both as a
                    politician and as an unbeliever. This seems to be the whole mystery.</p></note>
                    But this appears to have been merely the effect of the emotion produced by local
                    associations; for the original plan was confined to the decay of the city rather
                    than of the empire. Rome and Italy having satiated his curiosity, he returned to
                    England, and arrived at his father’s residence in the month of Jun# 1765.</p>
                <p>The five years and a half which intervened between his return from his travels
                    and the death of his father in 1770, seem to have formed the portion of his life
                    which he passed with the least enjoyment, and remembered with the least
                    satisfaction. By the resignation of his father, and the death of Sir Thomas
                    Worsley, he was successively promoted to the rank of major and
                    lieutenant-colonel commandant of his regiment of militia; but he was each year
                    more disgusted with “the inn, the wine, the company, and the tiresome repetition
                    of annual attendance and daily exercise.” He had other and more rational grounds

                    on account of his situation. He belonged to no profession which he could
                    cultivate; he had adopted no plan, by which, like some of his acquaintance, he
                    might rise to consequence. Without aim or pursuit, he lamented that he had not
                    engaged in the study of the law, embarked in trade, tempted the chances of civil
                    office or India adventure, or at least courted “the fat slumbers of the church.”
                    But a mind like his was not formed to remain inactive, and the dissatisfaction
                    which he now experienced in considering his actual position, probably arose from
                    an impatience to acquire fame, and the elongation of the only prospect which had
                    presented itself to his view. He still contemplated, at an awful distance, a
                    history of the decline and fall of Rome; but, as an immediate object of pursuit,
                    he resumed the study of the revolutions of Switzerland, which he had formerly
                    abandoned, and, after much reading, executed, in French, the first book of a
                    history of Swiss liberty. This specimen of his work was read, in the winter of
                    1767, to a literary society of foreigners in London; and as the author was
                    unknown, he listened without observation, though with painful sensations, to the
                    free strictures and unfavourable sentence of his judges; but their condemnation,
                    he assures us, was ratified by his cooler thoughts. The attempt, however, was
                    generously commended by Mr Hume, to whom the manuscript had been submitted, and
                    who endeavoured only to dissuade the author from composing in French, and thus,
                    as Horace says of the Romans who wrote in Greek, carrying faggots into the wood.
                    The design was, however, abandoned, in deference to the opinion of the foreign
                    critics, and the manuscript subsequently passed into the hands of Lord
                    Sheffield.</p>
                <p>After this failure, Gibbon, in 1767, united with Μ. Deyverdun, a native of
                    Lausanne, then in England, and a person of taste and critical discernment, to
                    whom he was much attached, in publishing a literary journal, under the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">Mémoires Littéraires de la Grande Bretagne,</hi> in imitation
                    of Dr Maty’s <hi rend="italic">Journal Britannique,</hi> which was esteemed and
                    regretted. But the attempt met with little encouragement, and only two volumes
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> appeared. Gibbon acknowledges having
                    reviewed, in the first volume, Lord Lyttleton ’ β <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Henry II.,</hi> a work of sense and learning, but not illuminated by a single
                    ray of genius. The materials of a third volume were nearly completed, when
                    Deyverdun having accepted the situation of travelling companion to Sir Richard
                    Worsley, to which his coadjutor had recommended him, this appointment put an end
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires Littéraires.</hi></p>
                <p>Gibbon’s next performance was of a bolder description, being nothing less than an
                    attack on Warburton, who, in a singular chapter of the Divine Legation of Moses
                    Demonstrated, had maintained that the descent of Aeneas and the Sybil to the
                    infernal regions was not a false, but a mimic scene, representing the initiation
                    of Aeneas, in the character of a lawgiver, into the Eleusinian mysteries. This
                    hypothesis, which the bishop had endeavoured to support by an elaborate but
                    strained interpretation, Gibbon assailed and completely overthrew in his
                    Critical Observations on the Sixth Book of the Aeneid, published in 1770. In
                    this production he proved that the ancient lawgivers did not invent the
                    mysteries, and that Aeneas was never invested with the office of lawgiver ;—that
                    there is not any argument or circumstance which melts a fable into allegory, or
                    removes the scene from the Lake Avernus to the Temple of Ceres ;—that such a
                    wild supposition is equally injurious to the poet and the man ;—that if Virgil
                    was not initiated, he could not, and if he were, he would not, reveal the
                    secrets of the initiation ;—and that the anathema of Horace (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Vetabo qui Cereris</hi><hi rend="italic">sacrum vulgarit, &amp;c.)</hi> at once
                    attests his own ignorance, and the innocence of his friend. All this, which
                    seems quite conclusive against Warburton’s allegorical interpretation, might,
                    however, have been argued in temperate and respectful language; but the clear,
                    elegant, and decisive criticism of Gibbon, which early received the approbation
                    of Heyne, and has since been generally acknowledged to be unanswerable, was
                    deformed by an acrimony of style which might be excused, but could scarcely be
                    justified, by the pride and presumption with which the bishop pronounced his
                    infallible decrees, and the merciless severity with which he lashed his
                    antagonists in his polemical writings.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Hayley, a poet and a scholar, not only pronounces a
                    favourable judgment on the critical observations, but even condescends to
                    justify an acrimony of style, which the author himself afterwards regretted as
                    unmanly and indefensible. Heyne, more learned, and at the same time more candid,
                    gently blamed the contemptuous treatment of a man who, with all his faults, was
                    entitled to the esteem of every scholar. <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi

                    the warburtonian tracts, Dr Parr, considers the allegorical interpretation “as

                    which could not derive authority from the greatest name, but to which the
                    greatest name might with propriety have been affixed.”</p></note> A calmer tone
                    would have been better suited to the subject; and the argument gained nothing in
                    force by the circumstance, that the author aimed his strokes against the person
                    and the hypothesis of Bishop Warburton. At the same time “the dictator and
                    tyrant of the world of literature” maintained a discreet silence; he had
                    previously shrunk from the encounter (which he had himself provoked) with Dr
                    Lowth; ana Gibbon appears to have been, in like manner, considered as an
                    antagonist with whom it might be hazardous openly to do battle.</p>
                <p>In the fifteen years which elapsed between the publication of his <hi

                    la Littérature,</hi> and that of the first volume of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,</hi> this criticism on Warburton, and
                    some articles in the journal above mentioned, were the only productions of his
                    pen which Gibbon gave to the world. But after the death of his father in 1770,
                    an event which left him the entire disposal of his time and choice of his
                    pursuits, he applied himself seriously to the composition of the first volume of
                    his history. For several years he had revolved the subject in his mind, and read
                    a great deal with a view to the undertaking, including the classics as low as
                    Tacitus, Pliny the younger, and Juvenal; the Augustan history, and the original
                    records both Greek and Latin, from Dion Cassius to Ammianus Marcellinus; the
                    Annals and Antiquities of Muratori, which he compared with Sigonius and Maffei,
                    Baronius and Pagi; the Theodosian Code, with the commentary of James Godefroy;
                    besides all that related to the propagation of the gospel and the triumph of the
                    church, the narratives and apologies of the Christians themselves, and the
                    Jewish and heathen testimonies, as these have been collected and illustrated by
                    Lardner. Observing the maxim, <hi rend="italic">Multum legere potius quam
                    multa,</hi> he reviewed again and again the French and English, as well as the
                    Latin and Italian classics; his Greek studies, though less assiduous, maintained
                    and extended his knowledge of that incomparable language; and a third perusal of
                    Blackstone’s <hi rend="italic">Commentaries,</hi> with a copious and critical
                    abstract, formed an introduction to the knowledge of English jurisprudence. At
                    the commencement of his undertaking all was dark and doubtful—even the title of
                    the work, the true era of the decline and fall of the empire, the limits of the
                    introduction, the division of the chapters, and the order of the narrative; and,
                    amidst the uncertainty in which he found himself involved, he was often tempted
                    to cast away the labour of seven years. But, happily, in spite of every
                    discouragement, he <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520584"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-0584-0509"/>persevered in his task, which his return as member
                    of parliament for the borough of Leskeard, in 1775, did not seriously interrupt;
                    and, on the 17th of February 1776, he gave to the world the first volume of that
                    work which has placed its author in the foremost rank of modern historians. Its
                    success was almost unprecedented. The first impression was exhausted in a few
                    days; a second and even a third edition were scarcely adequate to the demand;
                    the book was on every table, almost on every toilette; and, to use his own
                    words, the historian was crowned by the taste or fashion of the day. But, if the
                    voice of public favour be music to the ear of an author, Gibbon must have
                    derived more substantial satisfaction from the approbation of such judges as
                    Robertson and Hume. “The candour of Dr Robertson,” says he, “embraced his
                    disciple. A letter from Mr Hume overpaid the labour of ten years.” The latter,
                    however, with his usual sagacity, anticipated the objections which he foresaw
                    would be urged against the fifteenth and sixteenth chapters. “When 1 heard of
                    your undertaking, which was some time ago,” says he, “I own I was a little
                    curious to see how you would extricate yourself from the subject of your two
                    last chapters. I think you have observed a very prudent temperament; but it was
                    impossible to treat the subject so as not to give grounds of suspicion against
                    you, and you may expect that a clamour will arise. This, if any thing, will
                    retard your success with the public; for, in every other respect, your work is
                    calculated to be popular. But, among many other marks of decline, the prevalence
                    of superstition in England prognosticates the fall of philosophy and decay of
                    taste; and though nobody be more capable than you to revive them, you will
                    probably find a struggle in your first advances.”</p>
                <p>Gibbon’s own reflections on this subject appear to us to be either hypocritical
                    or ironical. He affects not to have believed that the majority of English
                    readers were so fondly attached even to the name and shadow of Christianity; and
                    he professes that if he had foreseen that the pious, the timid, and the prudent,
                    would feel, or affect to feel, with such exquisite sensibility, he might perhaps
                    have softened the two invidious chapters, which were calculated, he admits, to
                    create many enemies, and to conciliate few friends. But as the shaft was shot
                    and tha alarm sounded, he consoled himself with the reflection, that if the
                    voice of the priests was clamorous and bitter, their hands were disarmed from
                    the power of persecution. The sincerity of this apology is more than doubtful;
                    nor is it possible to believe that Gibbon completely misjudged the state of the
                    public feeling on the subject of Christianity, which Hume appears, from the
                    above extract, to have so accurately appreciated. But, however this may be, the
                    effect of Gibbon’s hostility towards Christianity, upon the character of his
                    history, has, for the first time, been fairly and justly estimated by the French
                    critics. What they complain of is not so much his insidious description of the
                    human means by which it was propagated, as his false estimate of its influence
                    upon the social and even political condition of mankind. In this country, the
                    matter has chiefly been considered in a polemical spirit; abroad, it has been
                    viewed in a light at once more enlarged, more philosophical, and, we may add,
                    more wisely Christian. Here, amidst the indignation of the better part of the
                    community at the publication of the first volume of the Decline and Fall, our
                    more distinguished theological writers stood aloof, and the onset was made by a
                    few rash and feeble volunteers, who, ill armed and worse disciplined, rushed
                    against the thick bosses of the historian’s buckler. With a single discharge of
                    his formidable artillery of learning and sarcasm, Gibbon laid prostrate the
                    whole disorderly squadron; and Davis, Chelsum, Travis, and the rest, sunk back
                    into their original insignificance. When the first of these ventured to attack,
                    not the faith, but the fidelity of the historian, the latter published his
                    Vindication, which, <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi> expressive of less anger
                    than contempt, amused for a moment the busy and idle metropolis,” and
                    annihilated Davis.</p>
                <p>Their plan of attack, indeed, was as misjudging as their mode of conducting it
                    was unskilful. With a little learning scraped together for the occasion, they
                    ventured to impeach the accuracy and to condemn the false quotations of a
                    scholar, whose mind was thoroughly saturated with every kind of knowledge which
                    could bear upon his subject; and they could only make up in vituperation and
                    intemperance for their manifest deficiency in all the qualifications requisite
                    in defenders of Christianity. Watson, bishop of Llandaff, was the only one of
                    the number who had the good taste to maintain towards his adversary the
                    dignified courtesy which belonged to his literary character; and the judgment to
                    confine his Apology to one point, namely, the inadequacy of Gibbon’s secondary
                    causes to account for the diffusion of Christianity. But it may even be
                    questioned whether Watson himself has not unconsciously been seduced, by the
                    consummate skill of his antagonist, to advance beyond the position which is
                    really impregnable, and to carry on the contest upon ground far less
                    advantageous. The art of Gibbon consists in confounding the origin and apostolic
                    propagation of the new religion with its later progress. No argument for the
                    divine authority of Christianity has been urged with greater force, or developed
                    with higher eloquence, than that which is deduced from its primary development
                    and rapid extension throughout the greater part of the Roman empire. But this
                    argument, unanswerable when confined within just limits, becomes feeble, or
                    disputable, or evanescent, as we recede from the time and place where the new
                    religion was born and first manifested to the world. By Gibbon, however, the
                    main question, namely, the divine origin of Christianity, was dexterously eluded
                    or speciously conceded. His plan enabled him to commence his account, in most
                    parts, below the apostolic times; and it was only by the strength of the dark
                    colouring which he worked, with infinite art and skill, out of the failings and
                    follies of the succeeding ages, that a shadow of doubt or suspicion was thrown
                    back upon the primitive period of Christianity. “The theologian,” says he, “may
                    indidge the pleasing task of describing religion as she descended from heaven,
                    arrayed in her native purity; a more melancholy duty is imposed on the
                    historian: he must discover the inevitable mixture of error and corruption which
                    she contracted in a long residence upon earth among a weak and degenerate race
                    of beings.” This passage betrays the whole secret of his art. Divest it of the
                    latent sarcasm which pervades the whole disquisition, and it might commence a
                    Christian history, written in the genuine spirit of Christian candour. But as
                    the historian, with seeming respect, yet dexterously confounding the true limits
                    of the question, contrives to insinuate that the supposed origin of our religion
                    is a mere Utopian dream of the theologian, and to suggest rather than affirm
                    that the days of Christian purity were a kind of poetic golden age; so the
                    theologian, by adventuring too far into the domain of the historian, may find
                    himself obliged to contest points where he has little chance of victory, to deny
                    facts established by unimpeachable evidence, and to retire, if not with the
                    shame of defeat, at least with doubtful and imperfect success.<note

                    antagonists was a sufficient humiliation.” If the strength of his adversaries

                    philosophical discoveries, and to remember that the merit of his predecessor

                    of the blood through the lungs. Of all his antagonists. Dr watson is the only
                    one of whom Gibbon speaks with respect, and, indeed, almost the only one who
                    deserved it. “Let me frankly own,” says he, in concluding an account of his
                    chief opponents, “that I was startled at the first discharge of ecclesiastical
                    ordnance; but as soon as I found that this empty noise was mischievous only in
                    the intention, my fear was converted into indignation; and every feeling of
                    indignation or curiosity has long since subsided into pure and placid
                    indifference.”</p></note></p>

                <p>Nearly two years elapsed between the publication of the first and the
                    commencement of-the second volume of the history. During this interval Gibbon
                    studied a course of anatomy, demonstrated by Dr Hunter; dived deeply into what
                    he calls the mud of the Arian controversy; studied the transactions of the age
                    of Constantine; and spent some months of pleasure at Paris. The prosecution of
                    his task was also checked by employment of a different description, for which
                    his talents were considered as peculiarly adapted. At the request of Lord
                    Chancellor Thurlow, and Lord Weymouth, then secretary of state, he was induced
                    to prepare an answer to a manifesto which the French court had issued against
                    Great Britain, preparatory to a declaration of war. This Mr Gibbon accomplished
                    with great ability, and vindicated the justice of the British arms, in a <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoire Justificatif,</hi> composed in French, which, having been
                    first approved of by the cabinet ministers, was then delivered as a state paper
                    to the courts of Europe. For this service he was appointed one of the lords
                    commissioners of trade and plantations; a place, the duties of which were by no
                    means arduous, whilst it enlarged his private income by a clear addition of
                    between L.700 and L.800 a year. His acceptance of this appointment provoked some
                    of the leaders of opposition, and he was accused of deserting a party in which
                    he declares he had never enlisted. On this subject, however, there is an awkward
                    reminiscence preserved in the handwriting of Mr Fox. That statesman, in an
                    autograph note on his copy of Gibbon’s history, says, that, at the time of the
                    declaration of war against Spain, in the year 1779, the author of this work
                    declared publicly, at Brookes’, that there would be no hope for England, except
                    by cutting off six heads in the cabinet council, and exposing them, as an
                    example, in open parliament; yet, before fifteen days had elapsed, he accepted a
                    place under the same administration. The inconsistency which this statement
                    involves, Lord Sheffield has attempted to palliate, if not to obviate, by
                    observing, that, though his friend may have carelessly used strong expressions
                    respecting some or perhaps all parties, yet he never meant that such expressions
                    should be taken literally. But the world were not obliged to understand that, on
                    political subjects, Mr Gibbon spoke in parables.</p>
                <p>At the general election in 1780 he lost his seat for Leskeard, which had suddenly
                    been converted into an opposition borough; and in the interval of his senatorial
                    life which followed, he published the second and third volumes of his history.
                    They appeared in April 1781, and excited as much attention as, though far less
                    controversy than, his first volume. They were written with equal elegance but
                    more caution, and exhibited proots of juster and more profound thinking. His
                    affection for his work did not permit him to estimate truly the reception with
                    which these volumes were honoured; and, in his Memoirs, he speaks of a coldness,
                    and even prejudice, which appear to have been altogether imaginary. It is
                    certain, indeed, that their merit was fully appreciated, both at home and
                    abroad; but two volumes are not so speedily sold as one, and the promise of a
                    continuation, whilst it gratified his admirers, necessarily suspended that final
                    judgment upon which the fame of the work was ultimately to depend.</p>
                <p>Soon after the meeting of the new parliament, he was chosen, upon a vacancy, to
                    represent the borough of Lymington in Hampshire. But the administration to which
                    he had attached himself was now on the decline; the minister who refused to bend
                    was broken by the tempest which had arisen against the supporters of the
                    American war, and with his fall the board of trade was abolished, by which means
                    our author was stripped of a convenient salary, which he had enjoyed about three
                    years. Amidst the conflict of parties which followed the dissolution of Lord
                    North’s administration, Gibbon, from a principle of gratitude, adhered to the
                    coalition, and his vote was counted in the day of battle (it was all he could
                    supply), but he was forgotten in the division of the spoil. The board of trade
                    could not be restored; a seat at the board of customs or excise was promised on
                    the first vacancy, but the chance was distant and doubtful; the tumult of
                    London, and the attendance on parliament, were grown irksome to him; and,
                    without some additional income, he could not prudently maintain the style of
                    expense to which he had for some time been accustomed. In these circumstances,
                    and having always cherished a secret wish that the school of his youth might
                    become the retreat of his declining age, he once more turned his thoughts to his
                    beloved Lausanne. But before proceeding with the remainder of the narrative, we
                    shall stop for a moment to review the historian’s political career.</p>
                <p>Gibbon entered the House of Commons in 1764, and he witnessed a great epoch in
                    the history of the British parliament. Never had a more brilliant constellation
                    of talent and genius risen in the political horizon; never had higher interests
                    commanded attention and inspired eloquence. The insurrection of the colonies,
                    the violent and arbitrary laws which had oppressed and driven them to <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193520610" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0610-0511"/> despair, the war
                    with America, the misfortunes and reverses of that ill-fated contest, the
                    dismemberment which threatened the empire, together with the justice, policy,
                    and necessity of concluding a peace; such were the subjects then debated in
                    parliament, with an ardour, ability, and eloquence, not surpassed, perhaps never
                    equalled, in any other period of our history. But amidst all the excitement and
                    animation of such a scene, Gibbon remained mute, and threw his silent vote into
                    the scale of power in support of the pretensions of the crown against the
                    opinion of the great body of the nation, and the just claims of the Americans.
                    He thought, or professed to think, the cause of the government, in this
                    instance, the cause of England, and declared himself more and more convinced
                    that the administration had the right as well as the power on their side. With a
                    temperament constitutionally cold, and principles essentially conservative, he
                    had none of the generous sympathies inspired by an ardent love of liberty; in
                    the resistance of the Americans he saw nothing but a rising against authority,
                    to be put down by force of arms; and, though possessing a mind accustomed to
                    develope political results, and to estimate the remote consequences of changes
                    in the social relations of mankind, he showed himself as insensible as the
                    humblest of Lord North’s adherents to the real character of the struggle in
                    which Britain was then engaged, and seems as little to have anticipated the
                    advantages which would accrue to mankind from the generous rivalry of two great
                    nations sprung from a common stock, or to have foreseen that the separation of
                    the colonies from the mother country was, sooner or later, inevitable, and that,
                    even if then averted, it might take place during some political crisis pregnant
                    with still greater danger to the power of Britain. His sagacity, in short, was
                    speculative, not practical; and his want of political courage commensurate with
                    a certain blind, undistinguishing dread of change, which forms the most
                    prominent characteristic of the sect of politicians to which, from congeniality
                    of sentiment, he had attached himself. For Lord North individually he seems to
                    have cherished the most sincere personal regard; and, though history will
                    scarcely ratify Gibbon’s estimate of his character, yet the fine tribute paid to
                    the fallen minister in the preface to the fourth (quarto) volume of the Decline
                    and Fall does honour to the historian’s memory.</p>
                <p>With regard to Gibbon’s parliamentary silence, it is highly probable that it
                    proceeded from the cause which he has himself explained. “After a fleeting
                    illusive hope," says he, “prudence condemned me to acquiesce in the humble
                    station of a mute. I was not armed by nature and education with the intrepid
                    energy of mind and voice,</p>
                <p>Vincentem strepitus, et natum rebus agendis.</p>
                <p>Timidity was fortified by pride; and even the success of my pen discouraged the
                    trial of my voice.” Another cause besides physical inability, and the
                    embarrassment of a high literary reputation, seems also to have concurred in
                    repressing his ambition of oratorical fame. “Upon the whole,” he writes to Mr
                    Holroyd, “though I still believe I shall try, I doubt whether nature, not that
                    in some instances I am ungrateful, has given me the talents of an orator, and I
                    feel that I came into parliament much too late to exert them.” At the period to
                    which this refers, Gibbon was eight and thirty; but at every brilliant epoch of
                    British oratory, the leading speakers have almost invariably commenced their
                    career long before the age of forty; and where there are exceptions to this
                    rule, these will generally be found amongst those who have been bred to the
                    kindred profession of the bar. Besides, in the confirmed habit of close,
                    accurate, and laboured composition, there is something which disqualifies for
                    free, prompt, and effective public speaking, in which readiness and fluency are
                    far more indispensable requisites than precision and correctness.<note

                    leading orators of that period, displaying in the midst of tlashy and histrionic
                    declamation so much of vigorous and powerful eloquence, had been <hi

                <p>Having resolved to withdraw from public life, and fixed upon Lausanne as the
                    place of his retreat, Gibbon entered into an arrangement with his old friend Μ.
                    Deyverdun, who was now settled there; and having disposed of all his effects,
                    excepting his library, he bade adieu to England in September 1783, and arrived
                    at Lausanne nearly twenty years after his second departure. His reception was
                    cordial, and the comparative advantages of his situation fully answered his
                    expectations. His personal freedom, which had been somewhat impaired by the
                    House of Commons and the board of trade, was now restored, and he was delivered
                    from the chain of duty and dependence, as well as from the hopes and fears of
                    political adventure. His English economy, which had been that of a solitary
                    bachelor, who might afford occasional dinners, was exchanged for a more social
                    mode of life, in which he enjoyed at every meal, at every hour, the pleasant
                    conversation of the friend of his youth, whilst his table was daily provided for
                    the reception of one or two extraordinary guests. In London he was lost in the
                    crowd; at Lausanne he ranked with the first families, and his style of prudent
                    expense enabled him to maintain a fair balance of reciprocal civilities. Instead
                    of a small house between a street and a stable-yard, he now occupied a spacious
                    and convenient mansion, with a garden of four acres laid out by the taste of Μ.
                    Deyverdun, a rich scenery of meadows and vineyards descending to the Leman Lake,
                    and the distant prospect beyond the lake crowned by the stupendous mountains of
                    Savoy. In this catalogue of advantages, however, which we have abridged from the
                    Memoirs, there is a perceptible intermixture of caprice and weakness; for surely
                    a man of Gibbon’s intellectual resources might easily have discovered situations
                    in England adapted to every purpose of economy and retirement, yet calculated to
                    afford at intervals the enjoyment of good society. But, not to mention that
                    Gibbon in his habits was at least half a foreigner, it appears that, either from
                    pride or modesty, he was averse to the society of his literary contemporaries,
                    in which he does not seem to have been qualified to shine, and preferred, in his
                    hours of relaxation, that style of company in which the conversation flows in an
                    easy natural channel, and where the object is mutually to please, not to talk
                    for effect. In society he sought to repose and recreate his mind, after the
                    fatigue of research and the labour of composition, not to stimulate and excite
                    it by what is called brilliant conversation; and, as enjoyment was his object,
                    he naturally disliked and avoided company where the aim was rather display than
                    social amusement.</p>
                <p>Gibbon remained about a year at Lausanne before he resumed the composition of
                    history; but having done so, he proceeded steadily with his laborious task,
                    which he at length completed on the 27th of June 1787. The fourth volume was
                    terminated by an abstract of the controversies respecting the Incarnation; in
                    the fifth and sixth volumes the revolutions of the empire and the world are most
                    rapid, various, “nd instructive, and the Greek and <pb break="no"

                    by the hostile narratives of the barbarians of the East and West. The conclusion
                    of his great, and, we may add, immortal work, the historian has commemorated in
                    language strongly expressive of the emotions with which his mind was filled in
                    contemplating the completion of that edifice which he had at length reared to
                    perpetuate his fame. “I have presumed,” says he, “to mark the moment of
                    conception; I shall now commemorate the hour of my final deliverance. It was on
                    the day, or rather the night, of the 27th of June 1787, between the hours of
                    eleven and twelve, that I wrote the last page, in a summer-house in my garden.
                    After laying down my pen, I took several turns in a <hi rend="italic"
                    >berceau,</hi> or covered walk of acacias, which commands a prospect of the
                    country, the lake, and the mountains. The air was temperate, the sky was serene,
                    the silver orb of the moon was reflected from the waters, and all nature was
                    silent. I will not dissemble the first emotions of joy on recovery of my
                    freedom, and, perhaps, the establishment of my fame. But my, pride was soon
                    humbled, and a sober melancholy was spread over my mind, by the idea that I had
                    taken an everlasting leave of an old and agreeable companion, and that
                    whatsoever might be the future date of my history, the life of the historian
                    must be short and precarious.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>“I will add two facts,” says he, “which have seldom occurred
                    in the composition of six, or at least five quartos. 1. My first rough
                    manuscript, without any intermediate copy, has been sent to the press. 2. Not a
                    sheet has been seen by any human eyes, excepting those of the author and
                    printer; the faults and the merits are exclusively my own.” This must be taken
                    with a slight deduction, inasmuch as it appears from a previous part of his
                    Memoirs, that he three times composed the first chapter of the first volume, and
                    twice the second and third, before he was satisfied with them; and also, that
                    although “he was soon disgusted with the modest practice of reading the
                    manuscript to his friends,” this had nevertheless been, to a certain extent,
                    done by him.</p></note></p>
                <p>With the manuscript of the three last volumes he set out from Lausanne, after a
                    quiet residence of four years, and at the end of a fortnight arrived at the
                    house of his friend Lord Sheffield, where he remained during his stay in
                    England. The arrangements with the bookseller and printer were soon settled; but
                    after the whole had passed through the press, the day of publication was delayed
                    that it might coincide with the fifty-first anniversary of his birthday (8th May
                    1788), when the double festival was celebrated by a literary dinner at the house
                    of the publisher, Mr Cadeli, where the historian “seemed to blush,” whilst they
                    read some complimentary stanzas written by Mr Hayley for the occasion. The sale
                    of these volumes was rapid, and the work being generally read, was of course
                    variously judged. The style was exposed to much academical criticism; a
                    religious clamour was revived upon nearly the same grounds as before; and the
                    reproach of indecency was loudly echoed by the more rigid censors of morals.
                    This last charge he professes he could never understand, and assigns several
                    reasons why it appeared to him unaccountable. First, an equal freedom in the
                    former part, especially in the first volume, had passed without notice, or at
                    least without censure: secondly, he considered himself as justified in painting
                    the manners of the times, and regarded the vices of Theodora as forming an
                    essential feature in the reign and character of Justinian: thirdly, he adds,
                    that his English text is chaste, and that all the licentious passages in the
                    notes are left in the obscurity of a learned language. But in offering such a
                    vindication, or rather such an apology, the historian seems to have forgotten
                    that it is no excuse of an offence against morals or decorum that, for a time,
                    it may have escaped observation or censure; that sensuality may be censured
                    without being lasciviously described; that it is not philosophically just to
                    exhibit individual vices, in strong relief, as forming a general picture of the
                    manners of a particular country; and that licentious passages are but thinly
                    veiled by being “left in the obscurity" of languages which are taught at every
                    school. In the opinion of a distinguished French critic, Μ. Villemain, Gibbon
                    was dead to all lofty and generous emotions. This, however, is not doing justice
                    to the historian. On most subjects, his mind was alive to the noblest
                    sentiments, and calmly yet firmly arrayed on the side of humanity, justice, and
                    the best interests of mankind; on two, the virtue of women and the magnanimity
                    of Christians, he was incurably prejudiced. Porson, his bitterest and most
                    malignant critic, admits that in his history, “his reflections are just and
                    profound: he pleads eloquently for the rights of mankind and the duty of
                    toleration; nor does his humanity ever slumber unless when women are ravished
                    and Christians persecuted.”</p>
                <p>In the preface to his fourth volume, Gibbon, whilst he gloried in the name of
                    Englishman, announced his approaching return to the banks of the Leman Lake; nor
                    did his year’s residence in England, on this occasion, induce him to alter his
                    resolution, or even to entertain a wish of settling in his native country. A few
                    weeks after the publication of his history, he accordingly set out for
                    Switzerland, and, on the 30th of July 1788, arrived at Lausanne, where, after a
                    full repast on Homer and Aristophanes, he involved himself in the philosophic
                    maze of the writings of Plato. But the cheering prospect of happiness which had
                    again wooed him to his favourite retreat was soon obscured by the illness and
                    death of his friend Deyverdun; whilst the great political movement which had now
                    begun to agitate France extended itself to Switzerland, and, throwing men’s
                    minds into a ferment of hope and fear, of anticipated improvement and foreboding
                    apprehension, served to interrupt the tranquillity which had long reigned in
                    that peaceful country. A swarm of emigrants of both sexes, attracted by
                    similarity of manners and languages, as well as by the vicinity, flocked to
                    Lausanne, and bringing with them a spirit of political discussion inflamed by
                    passion and by prejudice, provoked hostility to their opinions, even whilst
                    their misfortunes called forth sympathy. The language of disappointment on the
                    one hand begot that of Resumption on the other; domestic harmony was embittered
                    by an infusion of party spirit; the ladies and gentlemen in Switzerland, as
                    elsewhere, became suddenly transformed into politicians; and whilst the
                    partisans of the old absolute monarchy denounced the advocates of constitutional
                    freedom as rebels against their king and traitors to their country, the zealous
                    missionaries of the new political faith scattered the seeds of discontent in
                    those cities and villages, which, for more than two centuries and a half, no
                    commotion had agitated. Of the manner in which the historian at this period
                    employed his time we have little account. He appears to have amused himself by
                    writing the Memoirs of his Life, which it was reserved for his friend Lord
                    Sheffield to give to the world; and also to have projected a series of
                    biographical portraits of eminent Englishmen from the time of Henry VIII., a
                    design in the execution of which little or no progress seems to have been made.
                    His habits of industry had by this time become impaired, and his studies,
                    instead of being prosecuted as formerly with reference to a great object, were
                    now so far restricted as merely to constitute the amusement of his morning
                    hours.</p>
                <p>He remained in Switzerland as long as he considered it prudent to do so, and only
                    quitted that country when the execution of Louis XVI. and the declaration of war
                    which almost immediately followed on the part of Great Britain, rendered it no
                    longer a safe asylum for an Englishman who, it was well known, entertained
                    strong anti-revolutionary <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520636"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-0636-0513"/>opinions. Mr Gibbon left Lausanne in May 1793,
                    arrived in June at Lord Sheffield’s house in Downing Street, and soon afterwards
                    settled, for the summer, with that nobleman at Sheffield Place. In October he
                    went to Bath to pay a visit of kindness to his father’s widow, and then
                    proceeded to Althorp, the seat of Earl Spencer, from which he returned to
                    London. His health was visibly declining, and he now for the first time
                    disclosed, by a letter to his friend Lord Sheffield, the immediate cause, which
                    he had hitherto concealed from every human being, except a confidential servant.
                    This complaint was originally a hernia, which had at length produced hydrocele,
                    and required immediate surgical treatment. Tapping afforded temporary relief;
                    but as the original complaint was of about thirty years standing, it had
                    completely undermined his constitution, which could not for any length of time
                    support the discharge; and he died, on the 16th of January 1794, preserving his
                    senses and composure to the last. Absurd reports as to the manner of his death
                    were circulated at the time, and implicitly believed by many credulous persons.
                    But all these stories have been refuted by the authoritative relation of his
                    friend and biographer, who has stated the real circumstances attending his
                    demise with equal clearness and simplicity. Mr Gibbon did not at any time show
                    the least sign of alarm or apprehension of death; and, in fact, it does not
                    appear that he ever thought himself in danger, or conceived his departure from
                    this earthly scene to be so near at hand.</p>
                <p>The personal character of Mr Gibbon, which was upon the whole highly estimable,
                    may be correctly appreciated from the Memoirs which he left behind him. In these
                    his sentiments are disclosed without the reserve which he employed in his more
                    laboured compositions, and bis mental failings are detailed with an ingenuous
                    candour which commands our respect and confidence. He frankly confesses the
                    vanity of the author and the pride of the gentleman; the vanity of one of the
                    most successful authors of modem times, and the pride of a gentleman of amiable
                    manners and high accomplishments. It must, however, be admitted that his anxiety
                    for fame sometimes obscured the lustre of his social qualities, separated him
                    too widely from his literary contemporaries, and occasionally led him to speak
                    of his opponents with a contemptuous arrogance at variance with the general tone
                    of his bland and moderate character. His conversation, though not enlivened by
                    wit, nor adorned with those lighter graces in which the French so greatly excel
                    all other nations, is yet said to have been rich in various information,
                    communicated in a calm and agreeable, though somewhat peculiar manner; but in
                    company he seldom brought forward his vast treasures of knowledge, and was more
                    ambitious to be thought a man of the world than a mere, scholar or author. “As
                    to his manners in society,” says Μ. Suard, who knew him well, “without doubt the
                    agreeableness <hi rend="italic">(amabilité)</hi> of Gibbon was neither that
                    yielding and retiring complaisance, nor that modesty which is forgetful of self;
                    but his vanity <hi rend="italic">(amour-propre)</hi> never showed itself in an
                    offensive manner. Anxious to succeed and to please, he wished to command
                    attention, and obtained it without difficulty by a conversation animated,
                    sprightly, and full of matter. All that was dictatorial <hi rend="italic"
                    >(tranchant)</hi> in his tone betrayed not so much that desire of domineering
                    over others, which is always offensive, as confidence in himself; and that
                    confidence was justified both by his powers and by his success. Notwithstanding
                    this, his conversation never carried one away <hi rend="italic">(ri
                    entrainait</hi><hi rend="italic">jamais)</hi>; its fault was a kind of
                    arrangement which never permitted him to say any thing unless well.” In this
                    elaborate and artificial structure of his conversation, we are irresistibly
                    reminded of the characteristic qualities and defects of his style, in which,
                    according to Porson, the thread of his verbosity is sometimes finer than the
                    staple of his argument, and where, in endeavouring to avoid vulgar terms, he
                    occasionally dignifies trifles, and clothes common thoughts in a dress which
                    would be rich enough for the noblest ideas.</p>
                <p>But although Gibbon has disclosed much of his character in his Memoirs, there are
                    some points left unexplained, concerning which it would be very desirable to be
                    better informed. He has told us much of the progress of opinions in his mind; of
                    his conversion to popery, which, considering at what age it occurred, he has
                    treated with disproportionate gravity; and of his reconversion to protestantism,
                    which he has related with more brevity and obscurity. But at the latter of these
                    points he stops short; we leave him a good Protestant in the hands of Μ.
                    Pavilliard, and, after a considerable interval, we find him transformed into an
                    implacable enemy of Christianity, without the pretence of a quarrel, or any
                    previous declaration of hostilities. By what process was this singular
                    transition effected? by what train of reading or interchange of sentiments did
                    he contract this causeless inveteracy? Porson has charged him with often making,
                    where he cannot find, an occasion to insult our religion, “which,” says that
                    incomparable Hellenist, “he hates so cordially that he might seem to revenge
                    some personal injury.” The accusation is no doubt a little too sweeping; yet
                    whence arose the undeniable antipathy on which it is grounded? On this subject
                    we are left entirely to conjecture; but, without venturing to affirm any thing,
                    it may not unreasonably be attributed to his intimacy with the French writers,
                    particularly Helvetius, and to his correspondence with Hume, to whom he looked
                    up with the reverence of a disciple; connections which probably led him to think
                    that the farther he departed from the Christian faith, the nearer he approached
                    to the perfection of the philosophical character.</p>
                <p>As an historian, the universal acknowledgment of the literary world has placed
                    him in the highest rank; and if his taste had equalled his knowledge, if in his
                    narrative the grace of simplicity had concealed the artifice of elaboration, he
                    would, even in that rank, have stood without a rival. But in all the diversified
                    charms of interesting and pathetic relation he is as much inferior to Robertson,
                    as he excels that writer in extent and variety of knowledge, in deep and
                    penetrating sagacity, in comprehensive concentration, and, above all, in the
                    unrivalled mastery which he exercised over his vast stores of learning ;—and if,
                    in these respects, he is likewise superior to Hume, which can scarcely be
                    disputed, he at the same time falls far short of what he has himself
                    characterised as the careless inimitable beauties of that elegant and
                    philosophical historian. Yet, with every deduction that can reasonably be made,
                    enough will remain to support the high reputation of his great work, and to
                    entitle its author to the respect and admiration of every succeeding age. If his
                    laborious system of compilation, the depth and accuracy of his research, partook
                    of the patient plodding erudition of the north, both the merits and defects of
                    his manner of composition were essentially French; and it is not difficult to
                    discern the influence of Voltaire and his school on the philosophical views no
                    less than the sarcastic periods of the historian. Yet it is not in France alone,
                    but likewise among the profound inquiring scholars of Germany, that Gibbon
                    maintains his ground. His chapter containing a condensed abstract of the Roman
                    law was translated by Hugo, in order that it might serve as a text-book for his
                    own prelections on that system of jurisprudence; and the recent editors of the
                    later historians of Rome, particularly of Ammianus Marcellinus, and of the
                    Byzantine Collection, defer to his interpretations, sometimes of the text,
                    always of the meaning of their authors; whilst, even where their own researches
                    heve thrown further light on <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520649"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-0649-0514"/>the periods comprehended in hia work, their
                    language is uniformly that of acknowledgment of his general accuracy, and of
                    respect for his elevated genius. In a word, Gibbon anticipated that happy union,
                    which we can scarcely hope to see more perfectly consummated, of the
                    indefatigable erudition of the Germans, with the lucid arrangement of the
                    French, and their lively manner of developing their views and relating facts;
                    condensing and perfecting the whole with the masculine boldness and solidity of
                    English judgment. In Gibbon indeed there were wanting a more free and natural
                    style, a purer moral taste, and a philosophy superior to the narrow prejudices
                    of a sect; but, with these exceptions, there is every thing to be admired in him
                    as an historian. An erudition vast, solid, and varied; a criticism equally exact
                    and ingenious; an interest of narration, if not always equal, at least
                    sufficiently sustained to prevent languor; views sometimes profound, often
                    comprehensive, almost always just; reflections original, striking, and piquant;
                    and the art of connecting the facts of the history with enlarged ideas, of which
                    the writer himself did not perhaps perceive all the consequences, but which
                    excite reflection in the mind of the reader; such are the obvious merits of
                    Gibbon as an historian, such the qualities which ensure the permanence of his
                    fame. His defects, though much less apparent, and in some measure concealed from
                    common observation by the extreme artifice of his composition, may nevertheless
                    be brought out with equal distinctness. The first and the greatest of these is
                    that want of elevation of sentiment, which is the more apt to impose on our
                    reason, that the historian never thinks himself so reasonable as when he regards
                    virtue and vice with equal indifference. The imagination of Gibbon was active,
                    and his temperament cold; he was easily induced to admire that which astonished;
                    he invariably misjudged sentiments and emotions which he had never experienced.
                    After labouring to depreciate the heroic courage of the Christian martyrs, he
                    takes pleasure in celebrating the ferocious exploits of Timur and his Tartars;
                    material grandeur, so to speak, strikes him more forcibly than moral greatness;
                    the transports of sublime virtue affect not his soul, whilst the outbreakings of
                    barbarous force seduce his imagination and mislead his judgment. Having no fixed
                    principles in morals, politics, and public economy, or in regard to the
                    constitution of society and the history of civilization, he betrays an
                    uncertainty in his opinions which is sometimes embarrassing; his work does not
                    tend towards one great end; its march is not steady and uniform; in a word, it
                    is the production of an enlightened man, endowed with that philosophical spirit
                    which examines, decomposes, and describes with ability all the details of the
                    events of history, rather than the work of a great philosopher, who, from an
                    immense accumulation of facts, deduces those high conceptions and those truths
                    of a superior order which apply to all histories and to all ages.<note

                    in a strong light, Mr Gibbon’s want of fixed opinions; and the just horror which
                    it inspired had the effect of leading him into a new exaggeration. He then
                    maintained that he had only attacked C'hristianity because the Christians
                    destroyed Polytheism, which was the ancient religion of the empire. “The
                    primitive church of which I have spoken a little familiarly,” said he, in a
                    letter to Lord Sheffield, “was an innovation; and I was attached to the ancient
                    establishment of paganism.” If this was not an after-thought, it would afford a
                    key to much that has been considered douhtful, or difficult of explanation, in
                    the history of the historian’s opinions. In his Memoirs we meet with the
                    following passage: “I beg leave to subscribe my assent to Mr Burke’s creed on
                    the Revolution of France. I admire his eloquence, I approve his politics, I
                    adore his chivalry, and I can almost excuse his reverence for church
                    establishments. I have sometimes thought of writing a dialogue of the dead, in
                    which Lucian, Erasmus, and voltaire should mutually acknowledge <hi
                    rend="italic">the danger of exposing an old superstition to the contempt of the
                    blind and fanatic multitude.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>Gibbon spoke and wrote French with correctness and elegance; but the style of his
                    English compositions, particularly of his history, has been alternately admired
                    and censured. Porson, who was by no means inclined to spare him, has tha candour
                    to admit that his style is emphatic and expressive, and that his sentences are
                    harmonious. But this seems to us inadequate eulogy. For, however overloaded, and
                    at times measured almost to monotony, the style of Gibbon deserves the higher
                    praise of animation, which keeps the attention continually awake,— of
                    descriptive richness, which brings both manners and local scenery in living
                    freshness before the imagination,— and of energy, which deeply impresses his
                    more sententious truths upon the memory. “Gibbon may be overlaboured, but he is
                    rarely diffuse, and never dull; he may overstrain the attention, but he never
                    permits us to sleep; he may want simplicity, but he never wants force.”
                    Conciseness, vivacity, and often brilliancy, are his most striking
                    characteristics; and if he has neither the careless, easy transparency of Hume,
                    nor the sustained majesty of Robertson, he is more animated than the one, and
                    more picturesque than the other.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The following beautiful and discriminating observations on
                    the taste and style of Gibbon are extracted from a review of his posthumous
                    works, by Sir James Mackintosh, which originally appeared in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Monthly Review</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> “The reader will not
                    learn without wonder that Swift and Addison were among the earliest models on
                    which our celebrated historian .laboured to form his taste and his style If the
                    composition of these writers continued to be the object of his imitation, the
                    history of literature does not exhibit so striking an example of a man of such
                    great talents so completely disappointed in his purpose. It may be observed
                    that, even in the very act of characterising Swift and Addison, he has deviated
                    not a little from that beautiful simplicity which is the peculiar distinction of
                    these pure and classical writers. Nor can we think that Mr Gibbon, however he
                    may have in some measure emulated the historical merit,, has exactly trodden in
                    the literary footsteps of Dr Robertson. Inferior, probably, to Mr Gibbon, in the
                    vigour of his powers; unequal to him, perhaps, in comprehension of intellect,
                    and variety of knowledge; the Scottish historian has far surpassed him in
                    simplicity and perspicuity of narration; in picturesque and pathetic
                    description; in the sober use of figurative language; and in the delicate
                    perception of that scarcely discernible boundary which separates ornament from
                    exuberance, and elegance from affectation. He adorns more chastely in addressing
                    the imagination; he narrates more clearly for the understanding; and he
                    describes more affectingly for the heart. " The <hi rend="italic">defects</hi>
                    of Dr Robertson arise from a less vigorous intellect; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >faults</hi> of Mr Gibbon from a less pure taste. If Mr Gibbon be the greater
                    man, Dr Robertson is the better writer.” (See <hi rend="italic">Notice of the
