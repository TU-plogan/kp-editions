                <p><label type="entry">GEDDES, <hi rend="smallcaps">Alexander</hi></label>, a
                    learned Scotch Catholic divine and eminent biblical critic, was born in the
                    parish of Ruthven in Banffshire, in the year 1737. His parents were respectable,
                    although not opulent. His father was a farmer, who deemed no trouble too great
                    in order to procure for bis children as liberal an education as possible. Both
                    father and mother were of the Catholic persuasion, and the only book of
                    consequence which the former had in his library was an English translation of
                    the Bible, in which young Geddes was instructed with such care and attention
                    that he was able to give an account of the history of it before he had reached
                    the eleventh year of his age. The first instructions he received, after those of
                    his parents, were communicated by a school-mistress in the vicinity, by whom he
                    was so much distinguished that it became the first mental gratification which,
                    in his own opinion, he ever felt. He was next placed under the tuition of a
                    young man from the city of Aberdeen, who had been engaged by a proprietor for
                    the education of his own children; and afterwards went to a place called Scalan,
                    in the Highlands, where those were to be trained up who designed to devote
                    themselves to the Catholic priesthood, and to finish their education at some
                    foreign university. Here it was, in this obscure retreat, that Geddes laid the
                    foundation of that intimate acquaintance with the learned languages by which he
                    was so eminently distinguished in the subsequent part of his life. He went to
                    the Scotch university at Faris in the year 1758, and soon afterwards began the
                    study of rhetoric in the college of</p>
                <p>Navarre. By the strength of his genius, and his indefatigable attention, he soon
                    reached the head of this class, although he had to contend with two veterans;
                    and became the favourite of Vicaire, the professor, whose friendship lasted till
                    the close of his life.</p>
                <p>Instead of entering into the philosophical class at the usual time, Geddes
                    studied that subject at home, in order to facilitate his theological studies, on
                    which he entered under M Μ. Buré and de Sauvent, at the college of Navarre;
                    whilst Lavocat at the Sorbonne was his Hebrew preceptor. His progress in the
                    oriental languages was so great that Professor Lavocat urged him strongly to
                    continue at Paris; but his friends prevailed with him to return to his native
                    country in 1764. His first charge as a priest was in a Catholic chapel in the
                    county of Angus, from which he removed to Traquair in 1765, and became chaplain
                    to the earl of that name, where he remained for about three years. This
                    situation was most agreeable to his literary pursuits, as he had unlimited
                    access to an extensive library, which greatly assisted him in the prosecution of
                    his favourite studies. He left the earl’s house in the year 1768, and returned
                    to Paris, where he devoted his time during the following winter to the perusal
                    of books and manuscripts in the king’s libraries, making large extracts from
                    scarce copies, particularly such as were in the Hebrew tongue.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1769 he returned to his native country, and became pastor of a
                    congregation at Auchinhalrig, in Banffshire, where he was for some time involved
                    in pecuniary difficulties, out of which he was extricated by the liberality of
                    the Duke of Norfolk. These were occasioned by the debts he incurred in building
                    a new chapel for his flock, and in making the parsonage house one of the neatest
                    and most convenient in Scotland. With the view of bettering his circumstances he
                    commenced farmer; but as he had to borrow money to stock his farm, and as the
                    crops failed for three successive seasons, he was under the necessity of
                    abandoning this scheme in a much poorer condition than when he first projected
                    it. His unwearied exertions, however, joined to the assistance of friends, again
                    relieved him, and he was enabled to discharge in an honourable manner every
                    claim against him of a pecuniary nature.</p>
                <p>In the year 1779 he resigned his pastoral charge at Auchinhalrig, which was a
                    heavy blow to the members of his congregation, as the zeal and diligence with
                    which he discharged the duties of his ministerial function had endeared him to
                    all. He was also justly esteemed for his attention to the instruction of youth.
                    Next year the university of Aberdeen conferred on him the degree of doctor of
                    laws, a literary honour which had never been bestowed by that body on any Roman
                    Catholic since the Reformation. He afterwards went to London that he might
                    prosecute his favourite studies with greater facility, and give the world his
                    English translation of the Old and New Testament, to which he had turned his
                    attention for a number of years. He officiated for some months after his arrival
                    at the imperial ambassador’s chapel in Duke Street, until the term of Easter
                    1782, when it was suppressed by order of the Emperor Joseph II., after which Dr
                    Geddes seems to have declined entirely the exercise of his clerical
                    functions.</p>
                <p>No sooner had the design of Dr Geddes, relative to a new translation of the
                    Bible, been made public, than he met with formidable opposition from his
                    Catholic brethren; an event which the doctor seems with good reason to have
                    anticipated. His own words on this occasion were, “I expect not excessive
                    profits from excessive exertion. I trust I shall never want meat, and clothes,
                    and fire; to a philosophical and contented mind, what more is necessary ?” He
                    was many years employed in preparing this <pb break="no" facs="nls:193518855"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-8855-0376"/>important work for the press before he had any
                    prospect of adequate success. In addressing the English Catholics on the subject
                    of his translation, he says, “At any rate, I do what I think it my duty to do,
                    and do it fairly and openly. In the following pages ye will find neither
                    palliation nor disguise. I pour out my sentiments with the same sincerity as if
                    I were before the tribunal of Him who is to judge the living and the dead.
                    Mistake I may, but prevaricate I never will.” He discovered this noble spirit in
                    every action of his life, and in all his transactions and intercourse with
                    mankind, although he did not conciliate the regard of those who could have
                    bestowed upon him the most effectual assistance.</p>
                <p>After spending much of his life in biblical studies, he met with a long and cruel
                    interruption. “I had but little hope of ever living in a situation to resume
                    them,” says he, “when Providence threw me into the arms of such a patron as
                    Origen himself might have been proud to boast of; a patron who, for these ten
                    years past, has, with a dignity peculiar to himself, afforded me every
                    convenience that my heart could desire towards the carrying on and completing of
                    my arduous work.” It is needless to inform the public, that the patron to whom
                    the learned doctor here alludes was Lord Petre. For this munificence, continued
                    throughout the whole of his life, and even beyond it by his will, Christians of
                    every denomination will feel sentiments of gratitude, if they are qualified to
                    form a true estimate of the advantages of free and impartial inquiry. His
                    prospectus of a new translation of the Bible in 4to was published in 1786, and a
                    letter to the Bishop of London on the same subject appeared in 1787. His
                    proposals were printed in 1788.</p>
                <p>In the year 1792 the first volume of this translation was published, dedicated to
                    his patron Lord Petre, containing the first six books of the Old Testament. Soon
                    after this volume made its appearance, three apostolic vicars, calling
                    themselves the Bishops of Rama, Acanthos, and Centuriae, issued a pastoral
                    letter, addressed to their respective flocks over which they presided, warning
                    them against the reception of Dr Geddes’ translation. In his reply to the Bishop
                    of Centuriae we find these words: “Perhaps, my lord, you wish to have another
                    occasion of exercising your episcopal authority, and of playing with censures as
                    children do with a new ball. I wish your lordship much joy of the bauble; but
                    however, my lord, beware of playing too often with it. Read St Chrysostom on
                    ecclesiastical censures, and learn from him a little more moderation. Permit an
                    old priest to tell you that it is a very great ornament in a young bishop. As to
                    myself, my lord, I am not afraid of your threats, and shall laugh at your
                    censures as long as I am conscious that I deserve them not. You cannot hinder me
                    from praying at home; and at home I will pray, in defiance of your censure, as
                    often as I please. The Chief Bishop of our souls is always accessible; and
                    through him I can, at all times, have free access to the Father, who will not
                    reject me, but for voluntary unrepented crimes. In the panoply of conscious
                    innocence, the whole thunder of the Vatican would in vain be levelled at my
                    head.”</p>
                <p>The second volume of his translation, owing to a variety of interruptions, did
                    not make its appearance till the year 1797, to which was prefixed a dedication
                    to her royal highness the Duchess of Gloucester, as an early, spontaneous, and
                    liberal encourager of the work. In this volume the doctor gives up, and boldly
                    combats, the absolute inspiration of Scripture, believing that the Hebrew, like
                    all other historians, wrote from such human documents as they could find, and
                    were of consequence liable to similar mistakes. This latitude of thinking
                    naturally led the doctor to give up as fabulous, and wholly unworthy of the
                    divine benevolence, every command, precept, and injunction, which appeared
                    unworthy even of human authority. He denied, of consequence, that the command
                    given to destroy the Canaanites could have had God for its author.</p>
                <p>Dr Geddes was a man of extensive literature, uncommon liberality of thinking, and
                    the friend of all mankind; a man of integrity, honour, and benevolence; in the
                    strictest sense of the word a genuine Catholic, one whose love of truth was so
                    invincible, that neither hopes nor fears could induce him to conceal it.</p>
                <p>As a controversial writer, Dr Geddes was eminently distinguished by his letter to
                    Dr Priestley, in defence of the divinity of Jesus Christ; and by one to a member
                    of parliament, on the expediency of a general repeal of the penal statutes which
                    have a respect to religious opinions. In the spring of the year 1800 he
                    published an Apology for the Roman Catholics of Great Britain, in which he
                    zealously defended his peculiar tenets; but displayed a commendable moderation
                    when he mentioned the injuries to which he himself and brethren were subjected
                    by the continuance of persecuting laws; and when he argued in behalf of
                    abolishing all legal disabilities, he discovered the soundest logical
                    understanding.</p>
                <p>The principal works of Dr Geddes are, 1. Select Satires of Horace, London, 1779,
                    4to; 2. Prospectus of a new Translation of the Bible, ibid. 1786, 4to; 3. Letter
                    to the Bishop of London, containing doubts, queries, &amp;c., relative to a
                    vernacular translation of the Holy Scriptures, ibid. 1787, 4to; 4. Letter to Dr
                    Priestley, in which the author attempts to prove by one prescriptive argument
                    that the divinity of Jesus Christ was a primitive tenet of Christianity, ibid.
                    1787, 8vo; 5. Epistola Macaronica ad fratrem de iis quae gesta sunt in nupero

                    Church’s Triumph, an heroi-comic poem, 1797, 8vo; 12. Translation of the Bible,

                    contributions to periodical publications. He had corrected and prepared his
                    translation for the press up to the hundred and eighteenth psalm, when he was
                    seized with an excruciating distemper, which put a period to his life on the
                    26th of February 1802.</p>
