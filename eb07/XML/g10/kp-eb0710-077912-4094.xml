                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    >Gronov, John Frederick,</hi> a learned scholar and critic, was born at Hamburg
                    on the 10th of September 1611. His father, who was councillor to the Duke of
                    Holstein, having been appointed syndic or town-clerk of Bremen, carried his son
                    to that city, where he went through his early studies with great distinction. He
                    then visited the universities of Leipsic and Iena, and proceeded to Altdorf,
                    where he studied law under the learned professors who had conferred celebrity on
                    that school. After the death of his father he returned to Bremen, and having
                    settled his affairs, he, in 1634, repaired to Groningen to enjoy the benefit of
                    the society and instructions of Antony Mathieu, a great jurisconsult, and the
                    friend of his family. Here, however, he remained only a short time. For, being
                    desirous to extend his knowledge by travel, he visited the principal cities of
                    Holland, in order to converse with the learned and explore the libraries;
                    passed, with the same design, into England in 1639; and the year following
                    proceeded to France. He stopped several months at Paris; received the degree of
                    doctor of law at Angers; and then travelled into Italy, whence he returned,
                    through Switzerland and Germany, to Deventer, where he was offered the chair of
                    literature and history. In 1658, he succeeded Daniel Heinsius, the celebrated
                    professor of belles-lettres in the university of Leyden, and died in that city
                    on the 28th of December 1671. Gronovius was a man of equal learning and modesty,
                    and, as he was naturally disinclined to controversy, he avoided those literary
                    disputes by which so many then sought to obtain distinction. For a correct list
                    of his numerous works, we refer to the <hi rend="italic">Bibliolh. ErudU.

                    preceding, and one of the most laborious philologers of the seventeenth century,
                    was born at Deventer on the 20th of October 1645. At an early age he had read
                    all the masterpieces of antiquity, and appreciated their beauties; but this
                    precocious discernment was not so much the result of natural genius as of
                    obstinate perseverance. Having resolved to travel through part of Europe to
                    acquire knowledge, and visit the old friends of his father, he came over to
                    England, where he remained several months, during which he occupied himself in
                    collating the manuscripts in the libraries of Oxford and Cambridge. He then
                    returned to Leyden, and there published, in the year 1670, an edition of
                    Polybius, with notes, amongst which he inserted those that Casaubon had on his
                    death-bed bequeathed to him. This first editorial effort did him much honour,
                    and well merited the offer, which was in consequence made him, of a chair in the
                    academy of Deventer. But entertaining the intention of continuing his travels,
                    he declined the proffered situation, and almost immediately set out for Paris,
                    where he met with a most distinguished reception. The death of his father
                    obliged him to return a second time to Leyden; but as soon as he had arranged
                    his affairs, he again set out, along with Μ. Paats, ambassador of the
                    states-general, to Spain; and having seen all that is curious or interesting in
                    that country, he embarked for Italy. The Grand Duke of Tuscany retained him in
                    his states by appointing him professor in the university of Pisa; and Gronovius
                    profited by the facility he had of visiting Florence, to form a connection with
                    Magliabecchi, who placed at his disposal all the treasures of the Medicean
                    library. At the end of two years he prevailed on the grand duke to accept his
                    resignation; visited Venice and Padua; and traversed Germany on his way to
                    Deventer, where it was his intention to settle. But scarcely had he arrived in
                    that city when the curators of the university of Leyden tendered him a chair,
                    and pressed their offer so urgently that he was induced to accept. His opening
                    discourse increased the high idea which had been formed of his knowledge; and
                    the curators, to testify their desire of retaining him, immediately raised his
                    salary to four hundred florins. Gronovius was very sensible of this mark of
                    esteem, and constantly refused the propositions which were made to draw him to
                    Kiel, to Padua, and to other universities of Germany and Italy. If he inherited
                    the erudition of his father, he had neither his gentleness nor his moderation.
                    Never was there a man fonder of disputation, or more unjust towards the
                    adversaries whom, for the most part, he raised up against himself by his
                    asperity and haughtiness. It would be tedious, if not disgusting, to enter into
                    details respecting the quarrels he had to maintain with Fabretti on the sense of
                    some passages in Livy; with Feller and Perizonius as to the manner of Judas’s
                    death; with Vossius on Pomponius Mela; with Bentley and John Leclerc on the
                    corrections of Menander; with Küster on Suidas, &amp;c. The scurrility he
                    indulged in these discussions, which did not always terminate to his advantage,
                    and his exorbitant vanity, caused him to be compared to Scioppius, and procured
                    for him the unenviable distinction of a place in die work of Mencken on the
                    Empiricism of the Learned. But though the temper of Gronovius was thus violent,
                    his heart was sound, and he loved his children with so much tenderness that the
                    grief occasioned by the loss of his daughter accelerated his own death, which
                    took place at Leyden on the 21st of October 1716, in the seventy-first year of
                    his age. In the Memoirs of Niceron will be found a notice of his life, followed
                    by a catalogue of his works, forty-six in number. The most celebrated, as well
                    as the most important, of these, is the <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Antiquitatum</hi><hi rend="italic">Grcecarum,</hi> Leyden, 1697
                    and the following years, in 13 vols. folio. For this invaluable collection he
                    adopted the plan traced out by Graevius in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thesaurus</hi><hi rend="italic">Antiquitatum Romanarum,</hi> Utrecht, 1694, in
                    12 vols. folio. Both works ought to be united; and, to form a complete
                    collection of antiquities, there should be added, 1. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Novus</hi><hi rend="italic">Thesaurus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Antiquitatum</hi><hi rend="italic">Romanarum,</hi> by Sallengre, Hague, 1716,
                    in 3 vols. folio; 2. <hi rend="italic">Utriusque Thesauri Nova</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Supplementa,</hi> by Polleni, Venice, 1737, in 5 vols. folio; 3.

                    Amsterdam, 1707, in 4 vols. folio; 4. <hi rend="italic">Lexico</hi><hi

                    vols. folio. Gronovius published new editions of several authors already
                    commented on by his father, such as Seneca the tragic poet, Aulus Gellius,
                    Phaedrus, and others; and he also edited Macrobius, Polybius, Tacitus, Pomponius
                    Mela, Cicero, Ammianus MarceDinus, Quintus Curtius, Suetonius, Arrian, Minutius
                    Felix, Herodotus, Cebes, and some ancient geographers; the poem of Manetho on
                    the stars; the <hi rend="italic">Dactylotheca</hi> of Gorlaeus; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lexico</hi> of Harpocration, &amp;c. the greater part of which,
                    enriched with corrections and notes, form part of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Variorum</hi> collection, though, in general, not held in much estimation. The
                    other productions of Gronovius consist of Theses, Discourses, and Diatribes, of
                    which a list will be found in the Memoirs of Niceron, and also in the <hi
