                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">GILPIN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Bernard</hi></label>, rector of
                    Houghton, distinguished by his extraordinary piety and hospitality, was
                    descended from an ancient and honourable family in Westmoreland, and born in
                    1517. As he was bred in the Catholic religion, so he for some time defended it
                    against the reformers, and at Oxford held a disputation with Hooper, afterwards
                    bishop of Worcester, and a martyr for the Protestant faith; but he was staggered
                    in another disputation with Peter Martyr, and began seriously to examine the
                    contested points by the best authorities. Accordingly, being presented to the
                    vicarage of Norton, in the diocese of Durham, he soon resigned it, and went
                    abroad to consult eminent professors on both sides; and after three years
                    absence returned, a little before the death of Queen Mary, satisfied with the
                    general doctrines of the Reformation. He was kindly received by his uncle Dr
                    Tonstall, bishop of Durham, who soon afterwards gave him the archdeaconry of
                    Durham, to which the rectory of Ellington was annexed. When repairing to his
                    parish, though the persecution was then at its height, he boldly preached
                    against the vices, errors, and corruptions of the times, especially among the
                    clergy, on which a charge, consisting of thirteen articles, was drawn up against
                    him, and presented in form to the bishop. But Dr Tonstall found a method of
                    dismissing the cause in such a manner as to protect his nephew without
                    endangering himself, and soon afterwards presented him to the rich living of
                    Houghton-le-Spring. He was a second time accused to the bishop, and again
                    protected; when his enemies, enraged at this second defeat, laid their complaint
                    before Dr Bonner, bishop of London, who immediately gave orders to apprehend
                    him. Upon this Mr Gilpin prepared for martyrdom; and having ordered his
                    house-steward to provide him a long garment, that he might make a decent
                    appearance at the stake, he set out for London. Luckily, however, he broke his
                    leg on the journey, which protracted his arrival until the news of the queen’s
                    death freed him from all further apprehension. Being immediately set at liberty,
                    he returned to Houghton, where he was received by his parishioners with the most
                    sincere joy.</p>
                <p>Upon the deprivation of the Roman Catholic bishops, he was offered the see of
                    Carlisle, which he declined; and confining his attention to his rectory, he
                    discharged all the duties of his function in the most exemplary manner. To the
                    greatest humanity and courtesy, he added an unwearied application to the
                    instruction of those under his care. He was not satisfied with the advice he
                    gave in public, but used to instruct in private, and brought his parishioners to
                    come to him with their doubts and difficulties. He had a most engaging manner
                    towards those whom he thought well disposed; nay, his very reproof was so
                    conducted that it seldom gave offence; the becoming gentleness with which it was
                    urged made it always appear as the effect of friendship. Thus, with unceasing
                    assiduity, he employed himself in admonishing the vicious and engaging the
                    well-intentioned; and by these means he in a few years effected a greater change
                    in his neighbourhood than could well have been imagined.</p>
                <p>But his hopes were not so much in the existing generation as in the succeeding
                    one. It was an easier task, he found, to prevent vice than to correct it; to
                    form the young to virtue, than to amend the bad habits of the old. He employed
                    much of his time, therefore, in endeavouring to improve the minds of the younger
                    part of his parish, suffering none to grow up in ignorance of their duty, but
                    pressing it as the wisest part to unite religion with labour, and, amidst the
                    cares of this life, to have a constant eye upon the next. He attended to every
                    thing which might be of service to his parishioners. He was assiduous in
                    preventing lawsuits among them. His hall is said to have been often thronged
                    with people, who came to him about their differences. He was not indeed much
                    acquainted with law, but he could decide equitably, and that satisfied them; nor
                    could his sovereign’s commission have given him greater weight or authority than
                    his own character secured him.</p>
                <p>His hospitable manner of living was the admiration of the whole country. He spent
                    in his family every fortnight forty bushels of com, twenty bushels of malt, and
                    a whole ox; besides a proportional quantity of other kinds of provision.
                    Strangers and travellers found a cheerful reception. All were welcome who came;
                    and even their beasts had so much care taken of them, that it was humorously
                    said, if a horse were turned loose in any part of the country, it would
                    immediately make its way to the rector of Houghton.</p>
                <p>Every Sunday, from Michaelmas till Easter, was a sort of public day with him.
                    During this season he expected to see all his parishioners and their families.
                    For their reception, he had three tables well covered; the first being intended
                    for gentlemen, the second for husbandmen and farmers, and the third for
                    day-labourers. This piece of hospitality he never omitted, even when losses, or
                    a scarcity of provision, made its continuance rather difficult to him. He
                    thought it his duty, and that was a decisive motive. Even when he was absent
                    from home, no alteration was made in his expenses; the poor were fed as usual,
                    and his neighbours entertained.</p>
                <p>But notwithstanding all his painful industry, and the large scope he had for it
                    in so extensive a parish, Mr Gilpin thought the sphere of his benevolence too
                    confined. It grieved him extremely to see everywhere, in the parishes around
                    him, so great a degree of ignorance and superstition, occasioned by the shameful
                    neglect of the pastoral cure among the clergy of those parts. The bad
                    consequences resulting from this induced him to supply, as far as he could, what
                    was wanting in others. For this purpose, he used every year regularly to visit
                    the most neglected parishes in Northumberland, Yorkshire, Cheshire,
                    Westmoreland, and Cumberland; and that his own parish might not in the mean time
                    suffer, he was at the expense of a constant assistant. In each place he staid
                    two or three days; and his method was, to call the people about him, and lay
                    before them, in as plain a way as possible, the danger of leading wicked or even
                    careless lives; explaining to them the nature of true religion, instructing them
                    in the duties they owed to God, their neighbour, and themselves, and showing
                    them how greatly a moral and religious conduct would contribute to their present
                    as well as future happiness.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520792" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0792-0525"/>
                <p>Mr Gilpin’s generous and hospitable manner of living has been already noticed.
                    The value of his rectory was about L.400 a year; an income, indeed, at that time
                    very considerable, but yet in appearance very disproportionate to the generous
                    things he performed with it; indeed he could not have done these, unless his
                    frugality had been equal to his generosity. His friends, therefore, could not
                    but wonder to find him, amidst his many great and continual expenses, entertain
                    the design of building and endowing a grammar-school; a design, however, which
                    his exact economy soon enabled him to accomplish, though the expense of it
                    amounted to upwards of L.500. His school was no sooner opened than it began to
                    flourish; and so great a number of young people flocked to it, that in a little
                    time the town was not able to accommodate them. He put himself, therefore, to
                    the inconvenience of fitting up, for that purpose, a part of his own house,
                    where he seldom had fewer than twenty or thirty children. Some of these were the
                    sons of persons of distinction, whom he boarded at easy rates; but the greater
                    part were poor children, whom he educated, clothed, and maintained at his own
                    charge. He was at the expense likewise of boarding in the town many other poor
                    children. He used to bring several every year from the different parts where he
                    preached, particularly from Readsdale and Tinedale; places which he was at great
                    pains in civilizing, and in rooting out that barbarism which every year
                    prevailed less and less amongst them.</p>
                <p>As to his school, he not only placed in it able masters, whom he procured from
                    Oxford, but he himself likewise constantly inspected it; and, that encouragement
                    might quicken the application of his boys, he always took particular notice of
                    the most promising. He would call them ∕us <hi rend="italic">own ιcholars,</hi>
                    and would send for them often to his apartment, and there instruct them himself.
                    One method used by him to fill his school was a little singular. Whenever he met
                    a poor boy upon the road, he would make trial of his capacity by a few
                    questions, and if he found it such as pleased him, he would provide for his
                    education. And besides those whom he sent from his own school to the
                    universities, and there wholly maintained, he likewise gave to others, who were
                    in circumstances to do something for themselves, what further assistance they
                    required. By these means he induced many parents to allow their children a
                    liberal education, who would not otherwise have done so. Nor did Mr Gilpin think
                    it sufficient to afford the means only of an academical education to these young
                    people; he endeavoured also to render it as beneficial to them as he could. He
                    still considered himself as their proper guardian; and he seemed to think
                    himself bound to the public for their being made useful members of society, as
                    far as it lay in his power to make them so. With this view he carried on a
                    punctual correspondence with their tutors; and made the youths themselves
                    frequently write to him, and give him an account of their studies. So solicitous
                    indeed was he about them, knowing the many temptations to which their age and
                    situation naturally exposed them, that once every other year he generally made a
                    journey to the universities to inspect their behaviour. Nor was this uncommon
                    care unrewarded; for many of his scholars became ornaments to the church, and
                    men of exemplary piety.</p>
                <p>Whenever he heard of any in distress, whether of his own parish or of any other,
                    he was sure to relieve them. In his walks abroad, he would frequently bring home
                    with him poor people, and send them away clothed as well as fed. He took great
                    pains to inform himself of the circumstances of his neighbours, that the modesty
                    of the sufferer might not prevent his being relieved. But the money best laid
                    out was, in his opinion, that which encouraged industry. It was one of his
                    greatest pleasures to make up the losses of his laborious neighbours, and
                    prevent their sinking under them. If a poor man had lost a beast, he would send
                    him another in its room; or if any farmer had had a bad year, he would make him
                    an abatement in his tythes. Thus, as far as he was able, he took the misfortunes
                    of his parish upon himself; and, like a true shepherd, he exposed himself for
                    his flock. But of all kinds of industrious poor, he was most forward to assist
                    those who had large families; persons in this situation never failed to
                    experience his bounty when they wanted to settle their children in the
                    world.</p>
                <p>This benevolent and excellent divine, who merited and obtained the glorious
                    titles of Father of the Poor, and the Apostle of the North, died in 1583, in the
                    sixty-sixth year of his age.</p>
