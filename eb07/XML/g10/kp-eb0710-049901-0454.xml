                <p><label type="entry">GIANT</label>, a person of extraordinary bulk and stature.
                    The romances of all ages have furnished us with so many extravagant accounts of
                    giants of incredible bulk and strengtiι, that the existence of such people is
                    now generally disbelieved. It is commonly thought that the stature of man has
                    been the same in all ages; and some have even pretended to demonstrate
                    mathematically the impossibility of the existence of giants. Of these our
                    countryman Maclaurin has been the most explicit. “In general,” says he, “it will
                    easily appear, that the efforts tending to destroy the cohesion of beams arising
                    from their own gravity only, increase in the quadruplicate ratio of their
                    lengths; but that the opposite efforts, tending to preserve their cohesion,
                    increase only in the triplicate proportion of the same lengths. From this it
                    follows, that the greater beams must be in greater danger of breaking than the
                    lesser similar ones; and that though a lesser beam may be firm and secure, yet a
                    greater similar one may be made so long, that it will necessarily break by its
                    own weight. Hence Galileo justly concludes, that what appears very firm and
                    succeeds very well in models, may be very weak and infirm, or even tall to
                    pieces by its own weight, when it comes to be executed in large dimensions
                    according to the model. From the same principle he argues, that there are
                    necessary limits in the operations of nature and art, which they cannot surpass
                    in magnitude. Were trees of a very enormous size, their branches would fall by
                    their own weight. Large animals have not strength in proportion to their size;
                    and if there were any land animals much larger than those we know, they could
                    hardly move, and would be perpetually subject to the most dangerous accidents.
                    As to the animals of the sea, indeed, the case is different; for the gravity of
                    the water in a great measure sustains those animals, and in fact these are known
                    sometimes to be vastly larger than the greatest land animals. Nor does it avail
                    against this doctrine to tell us, that bones have sometimes been found which
                    were supposed to have belonged to giants of immense size, such as the skeletons
                    mentioned by Strabo and Pliny, the former of which was sixty cubits high, and
                    the latter forty-six; for naturalists have concluded on just grounds, that in
                    some cases these bones had belonged to elephants; and that the larger ones were
                    bones of whales, which had been brought to the places where they were found by
                    the revolutions of nature that have happened in past times; though it must be
                    owned that there appears no reason why there may not have been men who have
                    exceeded by some feet in height the tallest we have seen.”</p>
                <p>It will be easily seen, that arguments of this kind can never be held as
                    conclusive, because, along with an increase of stature in any animal, we must
                    always suppose a propertional<pb break="no" facs="nls:193520467"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-0467-0500"/> increase in the cohesion of the parts of its
                    body. Large works sometimes fail when constructed on the plan of models, because
                    the cohesion of the materials of which the model is made, and of the large work,
                    are the same; but a difference in this respect will produce a very remarkable
                    difference in the result. Thus, suppose a model is made of fir-wood, the model
                    may be strong and firm enough; but a large work made also of fir, when executed
                    according to the plan of the model, may be so weak that it will fall to pieces
                    by its own weight. If, however, we make use of iron for the large work instead
                    of fir, the whole will be sufficiently strong, even though made exactly ac∞rding
                    to the plan of the model. The same thing may be said regarding large and small
                    animals. If we could find an animal whose bones exceeded in hardness and
                    strength the bones of other animals as much as iron exceeds fir, such an animal
                    might be of a monstrous size, and yet be exceedingly strong. In like manner, if
                    we suppose the flesh and bones of a giant to be greatly superior in strength and
                    hardness to the flesh and bones of other men, the great size of his body will be
                    no objection at all to his strength. The whole of the matter therefore
                    concerning the existence of giants must rest upon the credibility of the
                    accounts we have received from those who pretend to have seen them, and not on
                    any arguments drawn α <hi rend="italic">priori.</hi> In a memoir read before the
                    Academy of Sciences at Rouen, Μ. Lecat gives the following account of giants who
                    are said to have existed in different ages.</p>
                <p>“Profane historians have given seven feet of height to Hercules, their first
                    hero; and in our days we have seen men eight feet high. The giant who was shown
                    in Rouen in 1735 measured eight feet some inches. The Emperor Maximin was of
                    that size; Shénkins and Platerus, physicians of the last century, saw several
                    persons of that stature; and Goropius saw a girl who was ten feet high. The body
                    of Orestes, according to the Greeks, was eleven feet and a half; the giant
                    Galbara, brought from Arabia to Rome under Claudius Caesar, was near ten feet;
                    and the bones of Secondilla and Pusio, keepers of the gardens of Sallust, were
                    but six inches shorter. Funnam, a Scotsman, who lived in the time of Eugene II.
                    king of Scotland, measured eleven feet and a half; and Jacob Lemaire, in his
                    voyage to the Straits of Magellan, reports, that on the 17th of December 1615,
                    they found at Port Desire several graves covered with stones; and having the
                    curiosity to remove the stones, they discovered human skeletons of ten and
                    eleven feet in length. The Chevalier Scory, in his voyage to the Peak of
                    Teneriffe, says, that they found in one of the sepulchral caverns of that
                    mountain the head of a Gaucho which had eighty teeth, and that the body was not
                    less than fifteen feet in length-The giant Ferragus, slain by Orlando, nephew of
                    Charlemagne, was eighteen feet in height. Rioland, a celebrated anatomist, who
                    wrote in 1614, says, that, some years before, there was to be seen in the
                    suburbs of St Germain the tomb of the giant Isoret, who was twenty feet in
                    height. In Rouen, in 1509, whilst digging in the ditches near the Dominicans,
                    they found a stone tomb containing a skeleton whose skull held a bushel of corn,
                    and whose shin-bone reached up to the girdle of the tallest man there, being
                    about four feet in length, and consequently the body must have been seventeen or
                    eighteen feet in height. Upon the tomb was a plate of copper, on which was
                    engraved, ‘ In this tomb lies the noble and puissant lord the Chevalier Rico de
                    Vallemont, and his bones.’ Platerus, a famous physician, declares that he saw at
                    Lucerne the true human bones of a subject which must have been at least nineteen
                    feet high. Valence in Dauphine boasts of possessing the bones of the giant
                    Bucart, tyrant of the Vivarais, who was slain with an arrow by the Count de
                    Cabillon, his vassal. The Dominicans had a part of the shinbone, with the
                    articulation of the knee, and his figure painted in fresco, with an inscription,
                    showing that this giant was twenty-two feet and a half in height, and that his
                    bones were found in 1705, near the banks of the Morderi, a little river at the
                    foot of the mountain of Crussol, upon which, according to tradition, the giant
                    had his residence.</p>
                <p>“On the 11th January 1613, some masons digging near the ruins of a castle in
                    Dauphine, in a field which, by tradition, had long been called the <hi
                    rend="italic">giant’s field,</hi> at the depth of eighteen feet discovered a
                    brick tomb thirty feet long, twelve feet wide, and eight feet high; on which was
                    a gray stone, with the words <hi rend="italic">Theviobochus Rex</hi> cut
                    thereon. When the tomb was opened, they found a human skeleton entire,
                    twenty-five and a half feet long, ten feet wide across the shoulders, and five
                    feet deep from the breast-bone to the back. The teeth were each about the size
                    of an ox’s foot, and the shin-bone measured four feet. Near Mazarino, in Sicily,
                    in 1516, was found the skeleton of a giant thirty feet high; his head was the
                    size of a hogshead, and each of his teeth weighed five ounces. Near Palermo, in
                    the valley of Mazara, in Sicily, a skeleton of a giant thirty feet long was
                    found, in the year 1548; and another of thirty-three feet high, in 1550. Many
                    curious persons have preserved several of these gigantic bones.</p>
                <p>“The Athenians found near their city two famous skeletons, one of thirty-four and
                    the other of thirty-six feet in height. At Totu, in Bohemia, there was found in
                    758 a skeleton, the head of which could scarcely be encompassed by the arms of
                    two men together; whilst the legs, which they still keep in the castle of that
                    city, were twenty-six feet long. The skull of the giant found in Macedonia in
                    September 1691 contained two hundred and ten pounds of corn. The celebrated Sir
                    Hans Sloane, who treated this matter very learnedly, does not doubt these facts,
                    but thinks the bones were those of elephants, whales, or other enormous animals.
                    Elephants’ bones may be shown as those of giants; but they can never impose upon
                    anatomists. Whales, which, by their immense bulk, are more proper to be
                    substituted for the largest giants, have neither arms nor legs; and the head of
                    that animal has not the least resemblance to that of a man. If it be true,
                    therefore, that a great number of the gigantic bones which we have mentioned
                    have been seen by anatomists, and by them have been reputed real human bones,
                    the existence of giants is proved."</p>
                <p>With regard to the credibility of all or any of these accounts, it is difficult
                    to determine any thing. If, in any castle of Bohemia, the bones of a man’s leg
                    twenty-six feet in length are preserved, we should have indeed a decisive proof
                    of the existence of a giant, in comparison of whom most others would be but
                    pigmies. Nor could these bones be supposed to belong to an elephant; for an
                    elephant itself would be but a dwarf in comparison of such an enormous
                    monster.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Giant’s</hi><hi rend="italic">Causeway,</hi> a vast
                    collection of basaltic pillars in the county of Antrim, on the northern coast of
                    Ireland. The principal or grand causeway consists of a most regular arrangement
                    of many hundred thousand columns of a black kind of rock, very hard, almost all
                    of them of a pentagonal figure, but so closely and compactly situated on their
                    sides, though perfectly distinct from top to bottom, that scarcely any thing can
                    be introduced between them. The columns are of an unequal height and breadth;
                    some of the highest, visible above the surface of the strand, and at the foot of
                    the impending angular precipice, may be about twenty feet; and they do not
                    exceed this height, at least none of the principal arrangement. How deep they
                    are fixed in the strand was never yet discovered. This grand arrangement extends
                    nearly two hundred yards, visible at low water, but how far beyond is uncertain;
                    from <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520480" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0480-0501"/>its
                    declining appearance, however, at low water, it is probable it does not extend
                    under water to a distance any thing equal to what is seen above. The breadth of
                    the principal causeway, which runs out in one continued range of columns, is in
                    general from twenty to thirty feet; at one place or two it may for a few yards
                    be nearly forty. In this account are not included the broken and scattered
                    pieces of the same kind of construction which are detached from the sides of the
                    grand causeway, as they do not appear to have ever been contiguous to the
                    principal arrangement, though they have frequently been taken into the width;
                    and this has been the cause of the wild and dissimilar representations of this
                    causeway, which different accounts have exhibited. The highest part of the
                    causeway is the narrowest, at the very foot of the impending cliff from which
                    the whole projects, where, for four or five yards, it is not above ten or
                    fifteen feet wide. The columns of this narrow part incline from a perpendicular
                    a little to the westward, and form a slope on their tops, by the very unequal
                    height of the columns on the two. sides, by which an ascent is made at the foot
                    of the cliff, from the head of one column to the next above, <hi rend="italic"
                    >gradatim,</hi> to the top of the great causeway, which, at the distance of half
                    a dozen yards from the cliff, obtains a perpendicular position, and, lowering in
                    its general height, widens to about twenty or between twenty and thirty feet,
                    and for a hundred yards nearly is always above water. The tops of the columns
                    for this length being nearly of an equal height, they form a grand and singular
                    parade, that may be easily walked on, but rather inclining to the water’s edge.
                    From high-water mark, as it is perpetually washed by the beating surges on every
                    return of the tide, the platform lowers considerably, and becomes more and more
                    uneven, so as not to be walked on but with the greatest care. At the distance of
                    about a hundred and fifty yards from the cliff it turns a little to the eastward
                    for twenty or thirty yards, and then sinks into the sea. The figure of these
                    columns is almost without exception pentagonal, or composed of five sides; there
                    are but very few of any other figure introduced; some, indeed, there are of
                    three, four, and six sides, but the generality of them are fivesided; and the
                    spectator must look very nicely to find any of a different construction. Yet,
                    what is very extraordinary, and particularly curious, there are not two columns
                    in ten thousand to be found, which either have their sides equal among
                    themselves, or whose figures are alike. Nor is the composition of these columns
                    or pillars less deserving the attention of the curious spectator. They are not
                    of one solid stone in an upright position, but composed of several short
                    lengths, curiously joined, not with flat surfaces, but articulated into each
                    other like ball and socket, or like the joints in the vertebrae of some of the
                    larger kinds of fish, the one <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> end at the joint
                    having a cavity, into which the convex end of the opposite is exactly fitted.
                    This is not visible except by disjoining two of the lengths. The depth of the
                    concavity or convexity is generally about three or four inches. And, what is
                    still more remarkable of the joint, the convexity and the corresponding
                    concavity is not conform to the external angular figure of the column, but
                    exactly round, and as large as the size or diameter of the column will admit;
                    and consequently, as the angles of these columns are in general extremely
                    unequal, the circular edges of the joint are seldom coincident with more than
                    two or three sides of the pentagon, and from the edge of the circular part of
                    the joint to the exterior sides and angles they are quite plain. It is still
                    further remarkable, that the articulations or those joints are frequently
                    inverted; in some the concavity is upwards, and in others the reverse. This
                    occasions the variety and mixture of concavities and convexities on the tops of
                    the columns, which is observable throughout the platform of this causeway, yet
                    without any discoverable design or regularity with respect to the number of
                    either. The length also of these particular stones, from joint to joint, is
                    various; in general, they are from eighteen to twenty-four inches in length;
                    and, for the most part, longer towards the bottom of the columns than nearer the
                    top, and the articulation of the joints something deeper. The size or diameter
                    of the columns is likewise as different as their length and figure; but in
                    general they are from fifteen to twenty inches in diameter. There are really no
                    traces of uniformity or design discoverable throughout the whole combination,
                    excepting in the form of the joint, which is invariably by an articulation of
                    the convex into the concave of the piece next above or below it; nor are there
                    any traces of a finishing in any part, either in height, length, or breadth, of
                    this curious causeway. If there is here and there a smooth top to any of the
                    columns above water, there are others just by, of equal height, which are more
                    or less convex or concave, and show them to have been joined to pieces that have
                    been washed, or by other means taken off. And undoubtedly those parts which are
                    always above water have, from time to time, been made as even as might be;
                    whilst the remaining surfaces of the joints must naturally have been worn
                    smoother by the constant friction of weather and walking, than where the sea, at
                    every tide, is beating upon the causeway, and continually removing some of the
                    upper stones, and exposing fresh joints. Further, as these columns preserve
                    their diameters from top to bottom, in all the exterior ones which have two or
                    three sides exposed to view, the same thing may with reason be inferred of the
                    interior columns, whose tops only are visible. Yet, what is equally curious and
                    extraordinary in this phenomenon, it appears that, notwithstanding the universal
                    dissimilitude of the columns, both as to their figure and diameter, and though
                    perfectly distinct from top to bottom, the whole arrangement is so closely
                    combined at all points that hardly a knife can be introduced between them,
                    either on the sides or angles.</p>
                <p>The cliffs at a great distance from the causeway, especially in the bay to the
                    eastward, exhibit in many places the same kind of columns, figured and jointed
                    in all respects like those of the grand causeway. Some of them are seen near to
                    the top of the cliff, which in general, in those bays to the east and west of
                    the causeway, is about three hundred feet in height; others again are observed
                    about midway, and at different elevations from the strand. A very considerable
                    exposure of them is seen in the very bottom of the bay to the eastward, about a
                    hundred roods from the causeway, where the earth has evidently fallen away from
                    them upon the strand, and exhibits a most curious arrangement of many of these
                    pentagonal columns in a perpendicular position, supporting in appearance a cliff
                    of different strata of earth, clay, rock, &amp;c. to the height of about a
                    hundred and thirty feet or more above. Some of these columns are between thirty
                    and forty feet high, from the top of the sloping bank below them; and, being
                    longest in the middle of the arrangement, and shortening on either hand, they
                    have obtained the appellation of <hi rend="italic">organs,</hi> from a rude
                    likeness in this particular to the exterior or frontal tubes of that instrument;
                    and as there are few broken pieces on the strand near it, it is probable that
                    the outside range of columns which now appears is really the original exterior
                    line, to the seaward, of this collection. But how far they extend internally
                    into the bowels of the incumbent cliff is unknown. The very substance, indeed,
                    of that part of the cliff which projects to a point, between the two bays on the
                    east and west of the causeway, seems composed of this kind of materials; for,
                    besides the many pieces which are seen on the sides of the cliff that circulate
                    to the bottom of the bays, particularly the eastern side, there is, at the very
                    point <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520493" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0493-0502"/>of the
                    cliff, and just above the narrowest and highest part of the causeway, a long
                    collection of them seen, whose heads or tops, just appearing without the sloping
                    bank, plainly show them to be in an oblique position, and about half way between
                    the perpendicular and horizontal lines. The heads of these, likewise, are of
                    mixed Surfaces, convex and concave, and the columns evidently appear to have
                    been removed from their original upright to their presènt inclining or oblique
                    position, by the sinking or falling of the cliff.</p>
