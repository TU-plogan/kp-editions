                <p><label type="entry">JAPAN</label>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> extensive and powerful empire of Japan consists of
                    several large islands on the eastern coast of Asia, which extend in a direction
                    north-east and east-northeast, from the 30th to the 41st degrees of north
                    latitude, and from the 129th to the 143d of east longitude. The largest of these
                    islands is called Niphon, which name is also sometimes applied to the whole
                    empire. It is about 700 miles in length, though not more than eighty in breadth,
                    and runs lengthwise from east to west in a winding form. It is separated by a
                    narrow channel full of rocks and islands, several of them uninhabited, from
                    Sikokf, next to it in size, and which is ninety miles long and fifty broad. The
                    third island, Kiusiu, of a square figure, and divided into four provinces, lies
                    between the other two, and is 200 miles long by 140 broad. These islands are
                    surrounded with numerous others, generally small, rocky, and barren; some of
                    them, however, large, rich, and fruitful, and governed by petty princes. There
                    are several other islands which are subject to the authority of Japan, though
                    they form no integral part of the empire. Among these is the large island of
                    Jesso, which has been colonized by the Japanese, and is the most northerly
                    island they have beyond their own empire. The coasts are rocky and mountainous,
                    and they are washed by a tempestuous sea, which, by reason of its shallowness,
                    admits none but small vessels, and even these not without imminent danger, the
                    depth of most of its gulfs and harbours being not yet known, and others that
                    have been sounded being too shallow for ships of any bulk. Several dangerous
                    whirlpools also occur amongst the rocks and shallows, by which vessels are
                    frequently drawn in and dashed to pieces. It is remarked by Kaempfer, in his
                    ample and accurate account of Japan, that nature seems purposely to have
                    designed these islands to be a sort of little world, separate and independent of
                    the rest, by making them difficult of access, and by endowing them plentifully
                    with all that is necessary both for luxury and comfort, and thus enabling them
                    to subsist without any commerce with other nations. The Japanese policy, of
                    rigidly forbidding all intercourse with strangers, which, in other
                    circumstances, might have been difficult, if not impracticable, has been greatly
                    facilitated by these natural advantages of the country.</p>
                <p>These islands are in general rugged and irregular in their surface, intersected
                    by ranges of lofty mountains, which are frequently steep and broken into
                    precipices. Some of the mountains rise to a great elevation, as the mountain of
                    Fusi, in the southern part of Niphon, which is considered to be the most
                    elevated, and is covered with perpetual snow. In the northern part of the same
                    island are also extensive and lofty mountains. The narrow valleys between these
                    mountains are generally fertile and well cultivated; but the greater part of the
                    country is rocky and barren, and it is only by the indefatigable care and
                    industry of the natives that it has been rendered productive, and that it yields
                    an abundant supply of food. The great staple of agriculture is rice, of which
                    there are several varieties: the best sort is perfectly white like snow, very
                    nutritive, and when boiled is used at meals instead of bread. A certain sort of
                    bean, of which they make a mealy pap, and use in the dressing of victuals as
                    butter is used in Europe, is held in much esteem. Barley, which they call great
                    corn, is cultivated, though not in great quantities: they use it in the feeding
                    of cattle and horses, whilst others dress their victuals with the flour, or make
                    cakes of it. One sort of barley, which grows in Japan with purple-coloured ears,
                    gives a very pleasing aspect to the fields. Wheat, which is called small corn,
                    is extremely cheap, and is baked into a particular sort of cakes, though it is
                    but little used. Peas, beans, and Indian corn, are cultivated; and almost all
                    the varieties of nutritious grains and pulse. Turnips grow plentifully in the
                    country, and to a large size. Horse-radish, carrots, gourds, melons, cucumbers,
                    parsnips, fennel, and some sorts of lettuce, grow wild; and parsley and other
                    vegetables, which are cultivated by the Dutch, thrive well. There are numerous
                    other plants, which grow in the fields, the woods, and forests, and in marshy
                    grounds, of which the leaves, roots, or the fiowers and fruits, afford
                    sustenance for the common people, and even luxuries for the great.</p>
                <p>The Japanese excel in agriculture. Being cut off from all intercourse with other
                    nations, they rely on their own resources; and this, with the extreme
                    populousness of the country, gives a stimulus to cultivation, as well as to
                    every other branch of industry. Not only are the fields and flat country laid
                    out in the cultivation of rice, being seldom converted into pasture, but
                    likewise the hills and mountains <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944445"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4445-0511"/>afford corn, rice, peas, pulse, and numerous other
                    edible plants. Every inch of ground is improved to the utmost; and it is
                    mentioned by Kaempfer, that he 'beheld, in his journeys to and from court, hills
                    and mountains, many of them inaccessible to cattle, which would lie wholly
                    neglected in other countries, cultivated to their tops. The law on this subject
                    is strict and severe, enforcing on all the cultivation of the ground as a sacred
                    duty, and punishing the neglect of it by the forfeiture of the land. The flat
                    grounds are ploughed with oxen, the steep and high ones by men; and, where they
                    have the command of water, the rice-grounds are intersected by canals. The rent
                    of the landlord is reckoned at six tenths of the gross produce; and, with the
                    view of accurately estimating the amount, surveyors are appointed, who, before
                    the harvest, compute the probable returns with surprising accuracy, with a view
                    to a just division of the produce.</p>
                <p>From the laborious culture to which they are subjected, the Japanese islands
                    abound in a great variety of useful and beautiful trees and plants. Amongst the
                    most curious and finest trees is the varnish tree. It affords a milky juice,
                    with which the inhabitants varnish, or, as we call it, japan, all their dishes
                    and plates of wood, from the emperor to the meanest peasant; for, even at court,
                    services of lackered ware are preferred to those of gold and silver. The
                    mulberry tree grows in most parts of Japan, especially in the northern
                    provinces, where many cities and villages depend almost wholly on the silk
                    manufactures, though the silk which they weave is not the finest, nor equal to
                    the Chinese silk. The tea shrub is one of the most useful plants growing in
                    Japan; it is planted round the borders of rice and corn fields, and in barren
                    places unfit for the culture of other things. All ranks drink of an infusion
                    from this shrub; and it is the custom of the country to present it when friends
                    come to visit, both when they come and when they depart. The common people use
                    the coarser leaves, the young and tender leaves being used by the higher
                    classes. The laurel tree is common in Japan. That which bears red berries
                    resembles the cinnamon tree in shape, and in the figure and substance of its
                    leaves; but the bark wants the peculiar sweetness of the true cinnamon tree, an
                    imperfection which Kaempfer ascribes to the quality of the soil. The camphor
                    tree is found in Japan; and the <hi rend="italic">sansio,</hi> the leaves of
                    which are eaten on account of their pleasant aromatic taste. Firs and cypress
                    trees are common in the woods. They are planted in barren and sandy places which
                    will produce nothing else, or along the roads, which makes travelling very
                    pleasant. The wood is used in the construction of houses, ships, and household
                    articles, and the branches for fuel. There arc other hard woods, such as the
                    oak, which is different from the European oak, and of which there are two
                    varieties; and the iron tree, of which houses arc generally built; and others
                    that have a fine grain, and are used for cabinets, chests of drawers, &amp;c.
                    The baraban is common, and is of great use here, as also in India. Fruits in
                    great variety and abundance are found in Japan; figs of different sorts,
                    oranges, lemons, citrons, grapes, chestnuts, walnuts, nuts of different kinds,
                    peaches, apricos, plums, brambleberries, strawberries, raspberries, &amp;c.
                    Cherry trees, aprico trees, and plum trees, are valued for the sake of their
                    flowers, which, under proper culture, become large and luxuriant, and when they
                    are in full blossom form a fine ornament around their temples, in their gardens,
                    and in their walks, the trees being thickly covered with flowers, as with
                    snow.</p>
                <p>Japan is distinguished above all other countries for the great variety of
                    beautiful plants and flowers which adorn its fields, hills, woods, and forests,
                    and which, when they are transplanted into gardens, and improved by assiduity
                    and culture, attain to a surprising degree of perfection. They mostly resemble
                    either the rose or the lily. There is a large shrub, called tsubacki, which
                    grows in woods and hedges, of which there are many beautiful varieties, and for
                    which there are about 900 names in the Japanese language. Of the shrub called
                    satsuki, with lily flowers, which is to be met with in the gardens, there are a
                    hundred varieties. Sakanandsio, another shrub with lily flowers, of which there
                    arc only three varieties, is much larger than the former. There are numberless
                    other flowers, some forming the chief ornament of houses and gardens, others of
                    desert and uncultivated places. But of all these flowers, it is observed by
                    Kaempfer,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Vol. i. chap.
                    ix. p. 119.</p></note> that as they exceed those in other countries in the show
                    and exquisite beauty of their colours, they are greatly inferior to them in
                    scent and fragrance. The same is also true of the fruits in Japan, which are far
                    from equalling the pleasant aromatic taste of those which grow in China and
                    other eastern countries.</p>
                <p>The country is plentifully supplied with fresh water from the many fountains,
                    lakes, and rivers which are scattered throughout the empire. There is no space
                    in the country for the formation of great or navigable streams; but some of the
                    rivers are so large and rapid, from the mountainous and rocky channels through
                    which they make their way, and from the profuse showers of rain which frequently
                    fall in the upper region.·’, that they are not to be passed without danger,
                    arising from the impetuosity of their currents.</p>
                <p>The climate of Japan, though it is upon the whole salubrious, is subject to
                    frequent changes. The country lies without the range of the monsoons and the
                    periodical rains; and accordingly it rains frequently throughout the whole year,
                    but with the greatest profusion in the months of June and July, which are for
                    this reason called the water-months. During the winter the ground is covered
                    with snow, and there are often sharp frosts, whilst in the summer it is
                    intolerably hot. At Nagasaki the thermometer ranges from 98° to 35°. Thunder and
                    lightning are very frequent. Earthquakes are common, and happen so frequently
                    that the inhabitants are familiarizod to those dreadful phenomena when they are
                    not uncommonly violent. Sometimes, however, the earth is shaken with so violent
                    a commotion, which lasts so long, that whole cities are thereby destroyed, and
                    many thousands of the inhabitants buried in the ruins. A great earthquake
                    happened in the year 1586, when the earth yawned, and swallowed up one half of
                    Nagafama, a small town containing 1000 houses; and the sea, violently breaking
                    over its usual boundary, overflowed the rich and populous town called also
                    Nagafama, and drowned all the inhabitants, besides destroying other smaller
                    towns. Another occurred in 1703, by which, and by a great fire which happened at
                    the same time, the whole city of Jedo was destroyed and laid in ashes, and about
                    200,000 inhabitants perished in the ruins. Some parts of these islands are
                    entirely free from these concussions. Volcanoes are found in different parts of
                    Japan, indicating the presence of those combustible materials which are
                    imprisoned in the bowels of the earth, and which, suddenly bursting forth, and
                    forcing an outlet, occasion earthquakes. Not far from Firando, where the Dutch
                    had their factories before they removed to Nagasaki, lies a small rocky island,
                    which has been burning and trembling for many centuries. Many mountains emit a
                    perpetual flame. From the famous mountain of Fusi, which, Kaempfer observes, is
                    only surpassed in height by the Peak of Teneriffe, but “in shade and beauty hath
                    not its equal,” and which is covered with everlasting snow, a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192944458" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4458-0512"/>black stench and smoke is
                    observed to .s⅛ue, the remains of its half-extinguished volcano, which formerly
                    burned with a brighter flame. In many places the soil is burning hot, and is
                    besides so loose and spongy, that it makes a cracking and hollow noise under the
                    foot. Hot and sulphureous springs abound in the vicinity of these burning
                    mountains, and are prescribed as specifics in many complaints.</p>
                <p>Japan abounds in mineral wealth; in all the metals, besides various useful
                    minerals. Gold is found in several provinces of the empire, and is smelted from
                    its own ore. It is gathered from the sands of several of the rivers, and is also
                    found combined with copper. The richest mine, which also yields the finest gold,
                    is situated in one of the northern provinces in the great island of Niphon; and
                    here also is a very rich gold sand, which the prince of the district causes to
                    be washed for his own benefit. Next to these the gold mines of Surunga are
                    esteemed the richest; and here gold is found in all the copper that is dug up.
                    There are other mines, affording ore which is productive, and would repay the
                    labour of working; but some of them are filled with water, and the uninstructed
                    natives know of no process for drawing it off. Silver is found in different
                    parts, particularly at Kattami, in one of the northern provinces; but it is not
                    so abundant as gold. The metal which is most important to the trade of Japan,
                    and is also most abundant, is copper. There are very rich copper mines in
                    different provinces of the empire; in Surunga, Atsingo, and Kijno-kuni. The
                    copper found in the mines of the latter place is the finest, most malleable, and
                    fittest for work, of any in the world; and in some cases, as already mentioned,
                    it contains a considerable quantity of gold, in the refining of which the
                    Japanese have greatly improved. All the copper is brought to Saccai, one of the
                    five imperial towns, where it is refined and cast into small cylinders. These
                    are packed up in square boxes, and sold at a high price to the Dutch, copper
                    being one of the staple articles of export from Japan. There is besides a
                    coarser sort of copper, which can be bought at a lower price than the other,
                    being much inferior in quality and appearance. Brass is very scarce in Japan,
                    and brings a much higher price than copper. A small quantity of tin is found,
                    but so exceedingly white and fine that it is almost equal to silver. This metal,
                    however, is little used in the country. Iron is found in very large quantities
                    on the confines of three provinces. It is refined on the spot, and is cast into
                    cylinders two spans in length. It is fully as dear as copper; and household
                    articles, hooks, and cramp-irons in buildings or in ships, which in other
                    countries are made of iron, are in Japan made of copper or brass. In dressing
                    their victuals they use a particular sort of kettles or pans, made of a
                    composition of iron. The art of making this composition has been lost, so that
                    the old articles of this sort bring a high price.</p>
                <p>Of mineral substances, sulphur is found in great abundance. It is dug up in a
                    neighbouring island, which, from the great plenty it affords of this substance,
                    is called Sulphur Island. This island was formerly considered as inaccessible,
                    by reason of the thick smoke which was observed continually to arise from it.
                    But this fear having been overcome, its produce now yields a revenue to the
                    prince of Satzuma, of about twenty chests of silver per annum. Coal abounds in
                    the northern and several other provinces. Salt is made of sea-water; and it does
                    not appear that they have any mineral salt. Agates of several sorts, some of
                    them extremely fine, of a bluish colour not unlike sapphires, as also cornelians
                    and jaspers, are brought from the northern extremities of the great province of
                    Osju, opposite to the country of Jedo. Naphtha is found in one of the rivers,
                    and is taken up where the water has little or no run, by the natives, who burn
                    it in lamps instead of oil. Some ambergris is obtained upon the coasts of
                    Satzuma, and of the Riuku islands. It is found chiefly in the intestines of a
                    whale which is caught frequently on the Japanese coasts or floating on the
                    surface of the sea, being torn up from the bottom by the violence of the waves.
                    Pearls are found throughout almost the whole circuit of the island, in oysters
                    and several other kinds of shell-fish; and every one is at liberty to fish for
                    them. The largest and finest pearls are found in a small sort of oyster, called
                    akoja, which is not unlike the Persian pearl shell, about a hand broad,
                    exceedingly thin and brittle, and shining on the outside, but within of a
                    whitish colour, and glittering like mother-of-pearl. All sorts of submarine
                    plants, shrubs, corals, stones, mushrooms, sea-fans, corallines, fuci, algae,
                    and the like, as also shells of all kinds, are found plentifully in the Japanese
                    seas, and nowise inferior in beauty to those found about Amboyna and the Spice
                    Islands. These are, however, very little valued by the inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Japan does not abound in animals, either wild or tame. This may be accounted for
                    from the extent of cultivation, which leaves little room, and no great cover,
                    for the wild animals; and the tame animals, not being used as food by the
                    inhabitants, are not multiplied beyond the necessary uses for which they are
                    designed. The horse serves for purposes of state, for riding, for carriage, and
                    for ploughing. The breed is small; but some of them are not inferior in shape,
                    swiftness, and dexterity to the Persian breed. A certain breed of little horses
                    is very much esteemed. Oxen and cows are only used in ploughing and carriage.
                    The people care nothing for milk or butter, which are not used as articles of
                    food. They make use of a sort of large buffaloes, of an extraordinary size, with
                    hunches on their backs like camels, for carriage and transport of goods. Of
                    asses, mules, camels, and elephants, they know nothing. Sheep and goats were
                    formerly kept at Firando by the Dutch and Portuguese, and might be bred in the
                    country to great advantage if the natives were permitted to eat their flesh, or
                    knew how to manage or manufacture their wool. They have few swine, and these few
                    are brought from China, and bred for the use of the Chinese, who make an annual
                    resort to these islands, and amongst whom they are in great demand. It is
                    mentioned by Kaempfer, that whilst he was in Japan, dogs had multiplied in an
                    extraordinary degree, owing to the partiality of the reigning emperor for that
                    animal, in consequence of his being born in the sign of the dog. Greyhounds and
                    spaniels are not known. The wild animals are deer, bears, wild boars, hares,
                    foxes (which the natives hold in abhorrence, supposing them to be animated by
                    demons), monkeys, wild dogs, a small animal called itutz, of a reddish colour,
                    another called tin, both living in houses, and lodging themselves under the
                    roofs, and so tame that they may be ranked amongst the domestic animals. The
                    whole country swarms with rats and mice; the former animal is frequently tamed,
                    and taught to perform several tricks for the amusement of the inhabitants.</p>
                <p>All the varieties of the feathered race are met with in these islands. The falcon
                    species are found in great numbers in the northern provinces, and are kept more
                    for state than sport. Ravens, cranes, herons, wild geese, ducks, pheasants,
                    wood-cocks, wild pigeons, storks, snipes, sparrows, swallows, larks,
                    nightingales, &amp;c. are common. The crane is protected by the particular order
                    of the emperor, and can only be shot by his express commands, and for his own
                    especial use. There is a singular species of duck, which is distinguished by the
                    most surprising beauty of plumage. The pheasants are also of uncommon beauty.
                    Neither the common European crow nor the parrot is to be met with in Japan.
                    Snakes are seen, some of them of an enormous size; and insects are numerous and
                    troublesome, especially the white ant, which is known for its de-structive<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192944471" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4471-0513"/> qualities; also
                    scorpions and other noxious reptiles.</p>
                <p>The Japanese have invented, or borrowed from their neighbours the Chinese, a
                    great many fictitious animals, which are either allegorical or connected with
                    their mythology. The kirin is a winged quadruped of incredible swiftness, with
                    two horns standing before the breast; its good nature and holiness are such that
                    it takes care, even in walking, not to trample on any the least plant, nor to
                    injure the most inconsiderable worm or insect. Besides this animal there are
                    other chimerical creatures of the quadruped kind, to which the Japanese ascribe
                    various imaginary qualities. Of these the dragon is the most remarkable, and the
                    chronicles and histories of their gods and heroes abound in fabulous stories of
                    this animal, which is also employed in the armorial bearings of the emperor. Foo
                    is a beautiful large bird of paradise, somewhat resembling the phoenix of the
                    ancients. It dwells in the higher regions of the air, and never descends, as the
                    Japanese believe, to honour the earth with its blessed presence, except at the
                    birth of an emperor, or at that of some such distinguished personage.</p>
                <p>All our knowledge of the Japanese government and • laws is derived from Kaempfer
                    and Thunberg, who accompanied the Dutch in their annual commercial visit to
                    these islands, the one in the year 1690, and the other in 1775. The account of
                    Kaempfer is exceedingly full and accurate, and its accuracy is attested by Dr
                    Ainslie, one of the British commissioners, who, in 1810, when the island of Java
                    was in possession of the British, had been sent by Sir S. Raffles to accompany
                    the Dutch ships on their annual visit to Japan. They were, however, strangers,
                    ignorant of the language, and hence were but imperfectly qualified to describe
                    with accuracy the political institutions of this state. Throughout all Asia pure
                    despotism is the prevailing form of government, and to this Japan forms no
                    exception; but, according to the accounts of Kaempfer and Thunbcrg, it is
                    subjected to the double rule of a spiritual and a political sovereign, the
                    respective limits of whose jurisdiction and duties do not appear to be very
                    distinctly marked. Kubo is the name of the secular, and Dairi of the
                    ecclesiastical emperor. To the latter are paid almost divine honours; but the
                    real power of the state appears to be vested in his political competitor. The
                    power of the sovereign is supreme; it is restrained by no positive law, though,
                    as in all despotic countries, it may be tacitly modified by custom and
                    immemorial usage. The emperor, according to Kaempfer, inherits, along with the
                    crown, an absolute and unlimited power over all his subjects, from the meanest
                    peasant to princes of the highest rank. As in all the eastern countries, where
                    the art of government is in its infancy, the country is divided into large
                    tracts of land, which are again subdivided into sixty-eight considerable
                    provinces, and these again into 604 smaller districts or counties. The provinces
                    are ruled by governors or princes appointed by the emperor. These governors are
                    amenable, for the exercise of their delegated authority, to the supreme head of
                    the empire, who may dismiss or banish them, and even inflict on them capital
                    punishment. They are entitled to the revenues of their provinces, with which
                    they maintain their rank and state, besides a military force for the maintenance
                    of order, and out of which they also keep the roads in repair, and carry on all
                    other necessary improvements. They are also bound to repair once in the year to
                    the court, with all due splendour, and a great retinue, and to bring with them
                    considerable presents, and, according to the jealous maxims of despotic
                    countries, to leave their families constantly at the court as hostages for their
                    allegiance. The residence of these princes is mostly in the large and maritime
                    towns, or those situated on rivers; which are surrounded by walls and ditches,
                    the prince’s castle standing most frequently at the extremity of the town,
                    defended by strong gates and high towers.</p>
                <p>The ecclesiastical was at first the only ruler that governed the kingdom. But his
                    generals, to whom he was obliged to confide the command of his armies, gradually
                    usurped the real power, leaving to the high priest only the empty splendour of
                    the throne. Syn Mu, the founder of the monarchy, flourished 660 years before the
                    Christian era. He improved both the government and the laws of the country. The
                    emperors of his race were usually denominated Dairi; and a hundred and nineteen
                    Dairis have ascended the throne in succession from that period down to the year
                    1775, when Thunberg resided in Japan. For more than 250 years the authority of
                    the Dairi, the old and lawful potentate of the country, has been confined
                    chiefly to ecclesiastical matters, though he is still held in the same
                    veneration as ever. His person is considered as too sacred to be exposed to the
                    air and the rays of the sun, and still less to the view of any human creature,
                    and he is consequently confined within doors; and when he goes out of his
                    palace, he is generally carried on men’s shoulders, that he may not come in
                    contact with the earth. His person is accounted so sacred, that his hair, nails,
                    and beard, are never suffered to be cleansed or cut by daylight, an opportunity
                    being taken to perform these operations when he ⅛ asleep. He never eats twice
                    from the same plate, nor uses any vessel a second time. They are invariably
                    broken to pieces, lest they should fall into unhallowed hands. The right of
                    bestowing titles of honour is to this day vested in the person of the
                    ecclesiastical emperor, and is a source of revenue. Even Kubo, the name of the
                    political emperor, is honoured by the titles which he receives from this
                    sovereign pontiff of Japan. Those who have spiritual titles are distinguished,
                    both at court and in the churches, by a particular dress, conformable to their
                    rank and dignity. So august and holy is Dairi considered, that Kubo, though
                    possessing the real power, is bound, either in person or by his ambassador, to
                    pay him an annual visit, and to bring presents in acknowledgment of his title to
                    rule in the state. At the court of Dairi literature is cultivated. It is the
                    only university in the country where students are maintained and instructed.
                    Poetry, history, and mathematics are here cultivated; and music is a favourite
                    study, especially with the fair sex. Here it is that all almanacs are compiled.
                    The secular emperor derives his revenues from a tax on the produce of the land.
                    These have been estimated, though on no very certain data, to amount to a sum
                    equal to L.28,000,000. But this is probably a gross exaggeration. The military
                    force is estimated at about 100,000 foot and 20,000 horse, whilst the different
                    governors of provinces maintain each a large force within his respective
                    territory. There seems little occasion for so large an establishment of troops,
                    as Japan, being separated from all other countries by a stormy sea, is in no
                    danger of attack from ambitious neighbours. The descendants of Genghis Khan, who
                    conquered China, also invaded Japan with a great army; but they were completely
                    repulsed by the valour of the inhabitants. Since this period the Japanese have
                    been engaged in war with the Coreans, but with little effect. The domestic peace
                    of the country has, however, been occasionally interrupted by the rebellion of
                    the provincial governors, or by a disputed succession.</p>
                <p>The law s, as among all the half-civilized states of Asia, are implacable and
                    severe. Death is the appointed punishment for almost every crime, sometimes by
                    decapitation in prison, and, for higher offences, by impaling on the cross.
                    Fines they consider as unequal and unjust, because they are less severe on the
                    rich than on the poor; and from this absurd notion they confound in one common
                    punishment all the different shades of crime. Where a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192944484" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4484-0514"/>murder is committed in a town
                    or in the open street, not only the criminal, but his relations and dependents,
                    and even neighbours or spectators, according as they have been more or less
                    cognisant of the crime, or have not interfered to prevent it, are rendered
                    amenable to justice. The master of a house is in like manner held responsible
                    for his domestics, and parents for their children; and this cruel and bloody
                    spirit pervades the whole system of their criminal justice. If one man draws his
                    sword on another, it is a capital offence; and smuggling of all kinds is
                    invariably punished with death, buyers and sellers being involved in the same
                    penalty. Some offences are punished by perpetual banishment and confiscation of
                    goods. Every criminal has a fair trial before the proper tribunal, and by a
                    careful examination of witnesses. The prisons are gloomy and horrid abodes; they
                    contain an apartment for trial by torture, another for private executions, a
                    kitchen, a dining-room, and a bath. The towns are subjected to a very strict
                    police, in which the same rigour prevails as in the administration of justice;
                    and the consequence is, that, through the influence of terror, the most exact
                    order prevails, each petty delinquent still incurring the penalty of death. Four
                    officers are appointed in every town, of which number one presides every year. A
                    commissioner is besides appointed for every street, who keeps an account of
                    deaths, births, and marriages, and makes his report to the head officer. He has
                    the power of casting offenders into prison, and of even putting them in irons;
                    and he employes spies, who bring them accurate intelligence of all that takes
                    place.</p>
                <p>There are two leading religious sects in Japan, namely, the Sintos and the
                    Budsdos; though there are numerous other sectaries who hold the most opposite
                    tenets, and yet live together in the greatest harmony. The religion of the
                    Sintos is the more ancient of the two, and seems to be a system of polytheism,
                    which, along with one Supreme Being, acknowledges a crowd of inferior deities,
                    and often of deified heroes, who are supposed to exercise dominion over the
                    earth, the water, the air, and over particular districts, and to have the power
                    of making men either happy or miserable. They believe in a state of future
                    rewards and punishments. The souls of the virtuous, according to their creed,
                    dwell immediately under heaven; whilst those of the wicked are doomed to wander
                    on the earth for a certain period, in expiation of their sins. The chief points
                    of the Sinto religion are inward purity of heart, abstinence from whatever makes
                    a man impure, and a diligent observance of solemn holidays, and of pilgrimages
                    to holy places at certain seasons of the year. They abstain from animal food,
                    and from the uncleanness of a dead body, and are loath to shed blood. Their
                    system of divinity, according to Kaempfer, is such a tissue of monstrous and
                    absurd fables, that their priests are ashamed of it, even in the presence of
                    their own adherents. Their notions of the creation of the world resemble the
                    wild extravagances of the Hindus. Kaempfer heard a sermon by one of their
                    priests, which he describes as a confused composition of ridiculous stories and
                    fables about their gods and spirits. The devils, they imagine, reside in the
                    bodies of foxes; and this animal is accordingly held in general abhorrence by
                    them. They have churches, in which they attend for worship on stated holidays.
                    In these temples they have no visible idols, nor any image to represent the
                    Supreme Being. But in the centre is generally placed a large polished mirror of
                    cast metal, the purpose of which is to impress on those who worship, that as the
                    mirror reflects a faithful image of their person, so the secret faults and
                    impurities of the heart lie open to the all-searching eyes of the immortal gods.
                    They never approach those temples unless they are perfectly clean; and
                    accordingly they wash themselves with water, and, putting on their best apparel,
                    they bow respectfully to the ground, preferring their prayers, and presenting
                    their offerings. Kubo, the emperor, belongs to this sect, and is bound to pay a
                    visit every year, either in person or by his ambassador, to one of their
                    temples, and to make presents of great value, which is accounted the essence of
                    piety by the priests of Japan, as by all other priests in every age and country.
                    The doctrine of Budsdo, identical with Buddha, whose votaries are spread over
                    the East, was brought from Continental India into China, and thence introduced
                    into Corea and Japan, and, being mixed with the existing doctrines and practices
                    of Sinto, gave rise to the most monstrous superstitions. The Japanese follow
                    Buddha’s doctrine of the immortality of the souls of men and of beasts, of a
                    future state of rewards and punishments, and of the transmigration of the souls
                    of men into animals. The churches of all the different sects are adorned with
                    alleys of cypress trees, and handsome gates; and most of them have a separate
                    chamber for their idol, where he is exhibited sitting on an altar surrounded
                    with incense, flowers, and other decorations. The churches are open every day,
                    but there are festival days throughout the empire, which are more especially
                    appropriated to religious worship by both Sintos and Budsdos. These are the
                    first and last days of every month, the new moon, and the first day of the year,
                    which last is spent in eating and drinking, visiting the temples, and making
                    merry. There is, besides these priests, a holy order of men called Jammabos, or
                    Monks of the Mountain, devoted to religious exercises and holy contemplation;
                    and an order of blind monks, who are dispersed all over the empire. Religious
                    vows are frequently made by devotees; and in this, as in many other points, the
                    Japanese superstition resembles that of Hindustan and other eastern countries.
                    It is related of one of these persons by Thunberg, that having made a vow never
                    to make use of shoes, he actually accompanied the Dutch embassy to the imperial
                    court, walking on his bare feet, though it was the depth of winter. Kaempfer
                    also mentions, that sometimes persons are met with in the streets running about
                    quite naked, according to vows which they have made to visit in that state
                    certain temples, provided they obtain by the mercy of the gods deliverance from
                    some fatal distemper they themselves or their relatives have been subject to, or
                    from other great misfortunes with which they are threatened. Multitudes of
                    religious beggars, with their heads shaved, also crowd the streets; and to this
                    tribe belong a singular religious order of young girls, who., if they be
                    handsome and agreeable, easily obtain the privilege of begging in the habit of
                    nuns. They watch particularly people of fashion, and accost them by singing a
                    rural song; and if they prove liberal, they will accompany them for hours. Their
                    voice, gestures, and apparent behaviour, are neither too bold nor daring; but
                    free, comely, and seemingly modest. Kaempfer, however, intimates his idea of
                    their true character, under whatever specious appearances it may be disguised.
                    Nunneries have been established in the country upwards of a thousand years.
                    Besides these idolatrous devotees, there is a sect of philosophers, who deride
                    the popular worship, and merely inculcate the duty of leading a holy and
                    virtuous life, and the belief of one great first cause, the divine author of all
                    things.</p>
                <p>The Dairi is the spiritual head of the Sinto religion; and since the retrenchment
                    of his power the secular emperor has granted for the maintenance of his state
                    and dignity the whole revenue arising from the city of Miaco and the adjacent
                    districts. He has likewise an allowance from the imperial treasury <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, besides immense sums which he derives from his
                    privilege of conferring titles of honour. But these allowances are not nearly so
                    great as when the Dairi possessed the secular as well as theeccle∙</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944497" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4497-0515"/>
                <p>siastical power, and they fall short of the necessary expenses of his court.
                    Hence many of his retainers are compelled to work at menial employments to
                    procure a livelihood; and Kaempfer describes his court as being only remarkable
                    for its splendid poverty.</p>
                <p>The public revenue is derived, as far as we can gather from the necessarily
                    imperfect accounts of those who have visited Japan, from a land-tax, and a tax
                    on houses. The land is rated according to its produce, consisting for the most
                    part of rice. The arable land is divided into three classes, according to its
                    fertility; and the public tax amounts to more than one half, or even to two
                    thirds of the produce. The land belongs to the crown, whose rights or claims
                    none dare dispute; and unless the farmer cultivate it with care and attention,
                    it is taken from him. In the towns each proprietor of a house is assessed in
                    proportion to the breadth of his house towards the street, besides presents
                    which are exacted from him by the civil officers, and taxes for the support of
                    the temples and idols. The land-tax is collected by the receivergeneral.</p>
                <p>The national character of the Japanese, as described by Kaempfer, Thunberg, and
                    others, has been corroborated by Dr Ainslie, who, by order of Sir Stamford
                    Raffles, accompanied the Dutch in their annual visit to these islands in 1812.
                    He describes them as a nervous, vigorous people, assimilated by their bodily and
                    mental powers much nearer to Europeans than to Asiatics. The traits of a
                    vigorous intellect are displayed in the greater progress they have made in the
                    sciences and in the arts, which are carried to a much higher degree of
                    perfection among them than among the Chinese, with whom they are frequently
                    confounded, but to whom they consider it as a great disgrace to be compared; and
                    the only occasion in which Dr Ainslie saw a Japanese surprised into a passion,
                    and, relinquishing his habitual politeness, lay his hand on his sword, was on an
                    unguarded comparison being made between the two nations. Thunberg represents the
                    Japanese as frugal, ingenious, sober, just, and friendly; yet distrustful,
                    superstitious, proud, and implacable in their resentments; never forgiving an
                    injury, but carefully concealing their hatred, and patiently waiting the
                    favourable moment for striking their victim to the heart. This deep-rooted
                    malignity is a common feature in the character of all barbarous nations; and
                    hence the feuds that we hear of among them are handed down from generation to
                    generation. This spirit of revenge arises from pride, and that lofty sense of
                    honour by which the Japanese are distinguished. Thunberg, in depicting the
                    character of this singular people, appears to ascribe to them qualities which
                    are scarcely consistent with their state of improvement. He speaks of a love of
                    liberty, not that liberty, he adds, which degenerates into licentiousness, as
                    being the passion of the Japanese, who nevertheless enjoy no freedom, but are
                    subjected to cruel laws and to the caprice of a tyrant, at whose mercy they hold
                    both their lives and properties. The love of freedom can scarcely exist in a
                    community so degraded; it can only flourish amongst a refined people, guarded by
                    equal laws against the violence of power. Ceremonious manners, another feature
                    of a comparatively rude and ignorant people, are much cultivated by the
                    Japanese. In courtesy and submission to their superiors, few can be compared to
                    them. Inferiors are accustomed to bow to the class above them, lowly and
                    reverently; a consequence, probably, of severe laws, and of the habitual bondage
                    in which the lower classes are held by their superiors. But the intercourse
                    between equals in rank is also encumbered with a variety of troublesome cere
                    monies; a sure mark that true refinement has made little progress, seeing that,
                    as mankind gradually improve, they insensibly relinquish these impediments to
                    social intercourse, as inconvenient and absurd. The Japanese are extremely
                    curious and inquisitive concerning the manners and habits of strangers; they are
                    continually asking the Dutch for information, and wearying them with questions.
                    It is related by Thunberg, that during the audience they had of the emperor,
                    they were surveyed from head to foot by privy councillors and others, the higher
                    officers of the state. Their hats, swords, clothes, buttons, lace, watches, and
                    other articles of dress, were duly examined; and they were requested to write in
                    the presence of the courtiers, that they might see the European characters and
                    mode of writing. They are of friendly dispositions, of frugal and industrious
                    habits, and honest in their dealings. Highway robberies are unknown, and thefts
                    are seldom heard of, which perhaps may be partly ascribed to the severity and
                    unrelenting vengeance of their laws. Dr Ainslie agrees with former writers in
                    his representation of the Japanese as exhibiting an apparent coldness, like the
                    stillness of the Spanish character, <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> ' eager of
                    novelty, and warm in their attachments, open to strangers, and, bating the
                    restrictions of their political institutions, a people who seemed inclined to
                    throw themselves into the hands of any nation of superior intelligence. They
                    have at the same time a great contempt and disregard of everything below their
                    own standard of morals and habits, as instanced in the case of the Chinese.”
                    Nor, according to Dr Ainslie, is that uniformity observable amongst them which
                    prevails amongst the Chinese, where the heavy hand of the government may be said
                    to have broken down all individuality, and left one Chinese the counterpart of
                    another. Unlike the Chinese, also, and unlike all other eastern nations, women
                    are not immured at home; they go abroad like the ladies in Europe, and mix
                    freely in society. Whilst Dr Ainslie resided at Nagasaki with the Dutch,
                    frequent invitations and entertainments were given; and at one of these
                    entertainments a Japanese lady from the court of Jedois represented to have done
                    the honours of the table with “an elegance and address that would have graced a
                    Parisian.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    by the Dutch, for their own interested purposes. That their illiberality in
                    religious matters, and their hatred and intolerance of Christianity, have been
                    greatly exaggerated, is fully proved by the mission of Dr Ainslie. The story
                    told of the annual ceremony of trampling on the crucifix as a test of their
                    abhorrence of the Christian faith, was derided as a fable when it was mentioned
                    to the priesthood. The Japanese were formerly adventurous navigators; they
                    served as mercenaries throughout all Polynesia, and traded with all nations.
                    They undertook voyages in their own vessels to Corea, China, Java, Formosa, and
                    other places. They have since adopted an entirely different policy,
                    andhaverigidlyforbiddenall intercourse with other nations; and being in this
                    manner confined within the limits of their own territory, their voyages are all
                    along the coast, in trading vessels of different sizes, and in fishing smacks.
                    The art of navigation has accordingly declined; and though they are provided
                    with a mariner’s compass, they seldom venture to lose sight of land. The natives
                    are prohibited, on pain of death, from leaving their country, or from
                    encouraging the visits of foreigners. The reasons of state which have induced
                    the government to act upon these illiberal maxims are not well understood.
                    Certain it is that the people do not participate in this jealousy of foreigners;
                    they would willingly trade with them, and on all occasions evince the most frank
                    and social<pb break="no" facs="nls:192944510" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4510-0516"/>
                    dispositions. There is every reason to believe that this aversion of the
                    Japanese government to all intercourse with strangers has been aggravated by the
                    interested misrepresentations of the Dutch, anxious to monopolize the lucrative
                    trade of Japan, and to banish all competition, by instilling into the rulers of
                    the country a jealousy and a dread of all other Europeans. The ill treatment
                    experienced by the mission from Russia in 1814, under Count Kreusenstern, is
                    ascribed to the exclusive influence of the Dutch factory, who continued to “rain
                    upon them,” says Dr Ainslie, “through the medium of an interested and avaricious
                    factor, who dreaded competition, every possible ignominy which can be supposed
                    to have flowed from the despotism of Japan.” They were lodged in a warehouse,
                    which was pointed out to Dr Ainslie, who observes, that as “the rats were let
                    out, the count and his suite were let in, where they remained for six long
                    months, with scarce room to turn, the mark of obloquy to the Japanese, and the
                    laughing-stock to the European factory.” So deep an impression did the degrading
                    treatment of the Russian embassy, and their meanness in submitting to it, make
                    on the Japanese, that the chief officer asked the English commissioner if he
                    would condescend to play the part of the Russian count; and, answering his own
                    question, said, “No, I trust not.” The insolence of the semi-barbarous nations
                    of the East, such as the Japanese and the Chinese, which naturally leads them to
                    trample on their European visitors, is best opposed by a spirited conduct, which
                    inspires respect. Mean submissions, far from conciliating, only provoke fresh
                    aggressions; as has been often proved in the intercourse of the Europeans with
                    both Japan and China.</p>
                <p>The Japanese are a proud, a brave, and a warlike people. Their arms consist of
                    bows and arrows, scimitars, and guns. Their bows are very large, and their
                    arrows long; and in discharging them the troops always drop down on one knee.
                    Guns are not their usual weapons; and Thunberg mentions, that during all the
                    time he was in Japan he never saw one discharged. They have cannon, but these
                    are only fired every seven years; and so inexpert are the gunners, that they
                    provide themselves with a long pole, and stand with averted eyes when they are
                    firing off the gun. The scimitar, which is constantly worn by every one but the
                    peasants, is their trusty weapon; it is a yard in length, of an incomparably
                    good temper, and far surpassing the Spanish blades, which are so much renowned
                    in Europe. With this weapon a Japanese will cleave his adversary asunder at a
                    blow. In sciences and the useful arts the Japanese are far behind the Europeans.
                    They study astronomy, but are unable, without the aid of the Chinese and Dutch
                    almanacs, to compute a perfect calendar. They have made little or no progress in
                    natural philosophy and chemistry, and even the scanty knowledge which they have
                    acquired is borrowed from Europe. They appear to have studied botany and zoology
                    with more success; and they have extensive works on these sciences, in which all
                    the indigenous plants and animals are described, and exhibited in well-coloured
                    plates. They have studied surveying, and possess maps of their own country, and
                    of its towns, which are sufficiently accurate in topography, but without the
                    divisions of longitude or latitude. When Dr Ainslie was at Nagasaki, a large
                    detachment of officers of rank had just arrived, with a numerous and splendid
                    retinue, who had been four years engaged in making a practical survey of every
                    part of the empire and its dependent isles. “The survey,” says Dr Ainslic,
                    “appeared to be conducted on a scientific plan, to be most minute and accurate

                <p>Nor are their literary acquirements inconsiderable. They study the history of
                    their own country, and their annals are said to be more authentic than those of
                    most other eastern nations. They have also translated several European works,
                    and appear to be familiar with the account which Kaempfer gives of Japan, as
                    they observed to the English commissioner, Dr Ainslie, that he was the very
                    apostle of their faith, from whose works they knew even their own country. They
                    have a college for interpreters, who study foreign languages; and it is an
                    extraordinary fact, that, notwithstanding the determination of the empire not to
                    enter into foreign commerce, an edict of the emperor has been issued, enjoining
                    on the college of interpreters the study of the English language; and it has
                    accordingly been cultivated with success by the younger members of the college,
                    who are extremely anxious in their inquiries after English books. Amongst other
                    works in the English, they showed to Golownin, Benyowsky’s Conspiracy and Escape
                    from Kamtschatka; an Account of the Expedition of the Russians and English to
                    Holland in 1799; and a Geographical Description of the Russian Empire. The art
                    of printing has long been known amongst the Japanese. They have also some
                    knowledge of engraving; but in the art of drawing they are greatly inferior to
                    Europeans. Poetry is employed by them chiefly to perpetuate the memory of their
                    gods and heroes; and though music is held in high estimation amongst them, they
                    have neither brought their musical instruments to any degree of perfection, nor
                    do they understand musical science or harmony.</p>
                <p>Although the Japanese in general are grave in their demeanour and manners, yet
                    they frequently indulge in sports, festivities, and theatrical amusements. They
                    have stated religious festivals, sometimes in honour of a particular god, which
                    they celebrate not merely with devotional exercises, such as sermons and
                    prayers, but with games, processions, public dances, and dramatic
                    representations. These last are of the lowest description, consisting of
                    exhibitions calculated rather to terrify than to entertain the audience.
                    Artificial contortions of the body, and uncouth and extravagant dresses, seem to
                    make up the whole amusement on these occasions. The story is generally some
                    heroic exploit, or some adventure of their idols and heroes, composed in verse,
                    and accompanied with music; diversified with low juggling tricks, which appear
                    to be well adapted to the capacity of the audience. There are no decorations or
                    machinery, nor any thing in these exhibitions which can put them on a level with
                    the theatrical amusements of Europe. Weddings and funerals are celebrated with
                    great pomp and many ceremonies, though the ceremony by which the married pair
                    are united is short and simple. The bridegroom and bride advance together to an
                    altar erected for the purpose, each holding a torch; and whilst the priest
                    recites a form of prayer, the bride lights her torch from a burning lamp, and
                    holds it to the bridegroom, who lights his torch from hers; upon which the
                    guests congratulate the new married couple. Their manners are far from being
                    pure. Many of the women live for a time with Europeans and others, receiving the
                    wages of prostitution; and afterwards, in the full knowledge of their character,
                    they are well married. The Japanese either bury their dead in the earth, or burn
                    the body to ashes. The latter method is not so common as formerly, but is still
                    practised by persons of distinction.</p>
                <p>Public schools are established, in which children are instructed<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192944523" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4523-0517"/> in reading and writing, and
                    are educated without chastisement or blows.</p>
                <p>In many arts and manufactures they have made great progress, and some they have
                    brought to such perfection as even to surpass those of Europe. They excel in the
                    manufacture of copper, iron, and steel, of which the temper of their swords
                    affords the best proof; and their silk and cotton manufactures are greatly
                    superior to those of the other eastern countries. Their lackering of wood,
                    especially the ancient workmanship in this line, and which derives its name from
                    their country, surpasses every attempt at imitation by any other nation. Their
                    lackered ware consists of the finest sort of firs and cedars, which they cover
                    with the very best varnish, prepared from the <hi rend="italic">Thus
                    vernix,</hi> a tree that grows abundantly in many parts of the country. This
                    varnish, which oozes out from the tree on its being wounded, is of so
                    transparent a nature that every vein of the wood may be distinctly seen through
                    it. In general a dark ground is spread under it, which causes it to reflect like
                    a looking-glass; or it is mixed with some darker substance, and sometimes with
                    gold leaf ground very fine, and is embellished with gold and silver flowers, and
                    figures laid on upon the varnish. All articles made of wood, drawers, chests,
                    boxes, scimitars, fans, tea-cups, and soup-dishes, the posts of their doors and
                    windows, and most articles of household furniture, are covered with this
                    varnish. They are acquainted with the art of making glass, coloured as well as
                    uncoloured; they also grind glass for telescopes, for which purpose they
                    purchase mirror-glass of the Dutch. Paper of all sorts is manufactured
                    abundantly in the country, both for writing and printing, as well as for
                    tapestry; and all coarser qualities for the packing of goods. It is prepared
                    from the bark of a species of mulberry tree, which, by an ingenious process, is
                    reduced to the consistence of a fine pulp, from which the sheets of paper are
                    obtained. Japanese porcelain or china ware is manufactured out of a whitish fat
                    clay, which is found there in great plenty. This clay requires a great deal of
                    kneading, washing, and cleaning, before it acquires that degree of transparency
                    which is the perfection of china ware; and the manufacture is altogether so
                    laborious and troublesome, as to have given rise to the saying, “that human
                    bones are an ingredient of China ware.”</p>
                <p>The temperature of the Japanese islands is in general salubrious. The most common
                    diseases are colic, occasioned by the immoderate use of rice beer, which
                    occasions violent pains, and often leaves behind it swellings in different parts
                    of the body, and is especially productive of the hydrocele; red and watery eyes,
                    occasioned amongst the poorer classes by the smoke in their confined apartments;
                    and indurated glands, which frequently turn to cancers, dysenteries, small pox,
                    measles, rheumatism, gout, pleurisy, water in the head, and certain eruptions on
                    the skin. The physicians have no great knowledge of medicine, and their remedies
                    consist generally of decoctions, diuretic or sudorific. Some profess only
                    medicine, others the cure of internal disorders; and others, again, practise
                    surgery, though they have no knowledge of anatomy. There is a class of persons
                    for puncturing with needles, or for burning with a powder made from the dried
                    leaves of a particular tree called <hi rend="italic">moxa,</hi> which, being
                    laid on the body, is set on fire, and burns the skin, leaving a sc⅛r behind it.
                    Those who perform the operation of puncturing with needles may be heard in the
                    evening patrolling the streets, and making a tender of their services with great
                    noise and vociferation. The burning with <hi rend="italic">moxa</hi> and
                    puncturing with needles are supposed to be efficacious both for the prevention
                    and cure of diseases; and they are resorted to by all classes, by rich and poor,
                    old and young, especially m cases of pleurisy', gout, rheumatism, and
                    toothach.</p>
                <p>The Japanese, in selecting their food, range over the whole of the animal and
                    vegetable kingdoms, using not only what is wholesome and nutritive, but some
                    articles also which are poisonous, though, by their mode of preparation, they
                    contrive to render these not only harmless, but useful. Their meat is always cut
                    into small pieces, thoroughly boiled and stewed, and mixed with agreeable
                    sauces. They sit at meals on soft floor mats, with a small square table before
                    each guest; and the meat is served up in the neatest vessels, either of
                    porcelain or japanned wood, furnished with a lid. The servant who attends kneels
                    down as he places the dishes on the table and takes them away after dinner. They
                    drink the soup out of the cup in which it is served; and they eat the solid
                    parts of the meat with two lackered pegs, which they hold so dexterously between
                    the fingers of the right hand, that they can with the greatest nicety take up
                    the smallest grain of rice, these pegs serving them as both fork and spoon. The
                    company, before beginning to eat, salute each other with a low bow; and the
                    ladies, says Thunberg, eat separately from the men, though this scarcely' agrees
                    with Dr Ainslie’s account of the lady whom he commends for doing the honours of
                    the table at an entertainment where he was present, with all the grace of a
                    Parisian. Tea and rice beer are the only liquors used by the Japanese. Wines or
                    distilled liquors are never seen amongst them; and they can hardly be persuaded
                    to taste them, even when they are offered by the Dutch. Their only inebriating
                    drink is sacki, which, being warmed in a common tea-kettle, is poured out into
                    flat tea-cups made of lackered wood, and is in this manner drunk quite warm. Tea
                    is drunk at all times of the day.</p>
                <p>The dwelling-houses of the Japanese, whether public or private, are by no means
                    to be compared to those in Europe, either for size or magnificence, being
                    commonly low, generally consisting of one story, and built of wood, owing to the
                    danger of earthquakes. Their apartments are small, but uncommonly neat and
                    clean, and for the most part carefully and curiously furnished; the windows,
                    doors, posts, and passages, are finely painted and varnished; and the ceilings
                    neatly covered with gilt or silver-coloured paper, and embellished with flowers.
                    They have few partition walls to divide the rooms from one another; but instead
                    of these they use folding screens made of coloured or gilt paper, laid into
                    wooden frames, which they can put on or remove at pleasure; and by this means
                    they enlarge their rooms or make them narrower as best suits their fancyor
                    convenience. These houses are built of cedar wood, of which there is great
                    abundance in the country. The castles of the Japanese nobility are built either
                    on great rivers or upon hills and rising grounds, and occupy a large space,
                    consisting of three different fortresses or enclosures, which either cover or
                    defend, or, if possible, encompass one another. Every enclosure is surrounded by
                    a deep ditch, kept clean, and a thick strong wall built of stone or earth, with
                    strong gates. The towns are mostly populous and well built; and the streets run
                    straight forward, crossing at right angles. They have no fortifications. The two
                    chief gates are shut every night. The villages along the highways are but thinly
                    inhabited. The houses of the country people and husbandmen are small and poor,
                    consisting of four low walls, covered with a thatched or shingled roof. “They
                    have,” says Kaempfer, “many children and great poverty, and yet, with some small
                    provision of rice, plants, and roots, they live content and happy.” The temples
                    dedicated to Buddha, or to other foreign idols, are far superior to all other
                    buildings, for their great height, curious roots, and numberless other beautiful
                    ornaments. They are built of the best cedars and firs, and adorned with carved
                    images of their idols. A fine altar stands in the middle of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192944536" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4536-0518"/>temple, with one or more gilt
                    idols on it, and a beautiful candlestick with sweet-scented candles burning
                    before it. The best situations in the country are chosen for these temples;
                    those which afford a fine view of the adjacent country, or are in the vicinity
                    of a spring, a rivulet of clear water, or a wood with pleasant walks.</p>
                <p>There are excellent roads throughout Japan, so broad and large, that two
                    companies, however numerous, can pass each other with ease. The country is
                    divided into seven large provinces, every one of which is bounded by a highway;
                    and all the smaller provinces into which the country has been subdivided are in
                    like manner bounded by highways, which all lead into the greater, as a common
                    centre, and unite at Jedo, the capital of the kingdom and the residence of the
                    emperor. These highways are divided into measured miles, so that a traveller, in
                    whatever part of the empire he may be, can ascertain at a glance his exact
                    distance from the imperial residence. Bridges aro laid over all the large rivers
                    after they emerge into the plains; but they have no means of crossing the
                    mountainous streams, which roll with too rapid a current to admit the building
                    of arches, except by fording them. They have not the art of throwing across a
                    bridge from bank to bank, or of even constructing rope bridges, which is the
                    ‘common resource in such cases in all mountainous countries, in the South
                    American Andes, and amongst the Himalaya Mountains. The number of travellers on
                    the roads, according to Kaempfer, is scarcely credible, owing chiefly, as he
                    supposes, to the populousness of the country, and to the frequent journeys
                    undertaken by the natives. The princes and lords, who are bound to go once a
                    year to pay their court to the emperor, commonly travel with great pomp and
                    magnificence, and with a train which fills up the road for some days,
                    consisting, for the first order of princes, of twenty thousand men; of ten
                    thousand for one of the second order; and thus diminishing according to the
                    quality or revenues of the nobles. This retinue is made up of numerous troops of
                    forerunners, harbingers, clerks, cooks, and other inferior officers, whose duty
                    it is to provide lodgings and victuals for the approaching train. The prince’s
                    heavy baggage follows, suitably attended, and carried in small trunks packed on
                    horses, each bearing a banner with the coat of arms and name of the possessor.
                    Then follow the chief officers and noblemen attending the prince, with pikes,
                    scimitars, bows and arrows, umbrellas, palanquins, led horses, and other marks
                    of grandeur. The prince himself is carried in a palanquin by six or eight men
                    clad in rich liveries, sixteen pages, who are persons of the first rank, and
                    richly clad, walking before, and others by his side; whilst the rear of the
                    procession is brought up by numerous domestics, grooms, footmen, pike-bearers,
                    all in liveries, and by numbers of led horses. The whole train are clad in black
                    silk; and they march in order, in profound silence, without any noise except
                    what is occasioned by the trampling of horses and men. On the other hand, the
                    etiquette is, that the pike-bearers, and the carriers of the palanquin, have
                    their clothes tucked up above the waist; and thus their naked bodies are exposed
                    to view, with only a small piece of cloth for the sake of decency. What appears
                    still more odd and whimsical to a European is, that the pages, pikebearers,
                    umbrella and hat-bearers, chest-bearers, and footmen, affect a strange mimic
                    march or dance when they pass through any remarkable town or borough, or by the
                    train of another prince or lord. Every step they make they draw one foot up
                    behind them as high as their back, and stretch out the arm on the opposite side
                    as far as they can, “putting themselves in such a posture,” says Kaempfer, “as
                    if they had a mind to swim through the air.” The roads are besides crowded with
                    numerous travellers, with pilgrims going on their annual visit to some holy
                    temple, and with multitudes of beggars, in which character, indeed, many of the
                    pilgrims travel. There are on all the roads idols of stone erected in honour of
                    their gods, and other monstrous images and idols which occur on the highways in
                    several places, at the turning in of sideways, near bridges, convents, temples,
                    and other buildings. Coarse figures of these idols are also printed on entire or
                    half sheets of paper, and pasted upon the gates of cities and villages, on
                    wooden posts near bridges, and in other places on the highway most exposed to
                    the traveller’s view. But strangers arc not expected to pay these idols any sort
                    of homage. The Japanese are, contrary to the representations given of them,
                    tolerant and liberal in matters of religion. The mission which was sent to Japan
                    by Sir Stamford Raffles, and which Dr Ainslie accompanied, experienced this
                    liberality in a manner that they by no means expected from the representations
                    previously made to them. The English commissioner visited the great temple on
                    the hills of Nagasaki, and was received with marked regard by the venerable
                    patriarch, who entertained him sumptuously. On showing him round the courts of
                    the temple, one of the English officers present, as mentioned by Dr Ainslie,
                    heedlessly exclaimed in surprise, “Jesus Christus.” The patriarch turning half
                    round with a placid smile, bowed significantly, as if intimating that he was
                    perfectly aware of the difference of their respective creeds; and they parted
                    mutual friends, with a hearty shake of the hands.</p>
                <p>For the accommodation of travellers, there is in all the chief villages and
                    hamlets a post-house belonging to the lord of the place, where are procured
                    horses, porters, footmen, or whatever else may be wanting for their journey, at
                    settled prices. Travellers of all ranks and qualities resort to these
                    post-houses, which lie at about one and a half to four miles distance from each
                    other. They appear to have no carriages, but either travel on foot or on
                    horseback, or along the coast by sea. At these post-houses messengers are
                    walking day and night, in order to carry the letters, edicts, and proclamations
                    of the emperor and the princes of the empire, which they convey from one
                    post-house to another with all speed. Two messengers are always employed on
                    these occasions, that in case any accident should befal the one, the other may
                    forward the despatches, which are kept in a varnished box bearing the arms of
                    the emperor, to the next stage; and all travellers, and even princes of the
                    empire and their retinues, must retire out of the way in order to give a free
                    passage to these messengers.</p>
                <p>The Japanese are represented as a vigorous people, both in their bodily and
                    mental habits. They are well made, active, free, and easy in their motions. The
                    men are of the middling size, and in general not very corpulent. They are, says
                    Thunberg, of a yellowish colour all over, sometimes bordering on brown, and
                    sometimes inclining to white. The labouring classes, who, in summer, when they
                    are at work, lay bare the upper part of their bodies, are sun-burnt, and
                    consequently brown. Their features are masculine and perfectly European, with
                    the exception of the small lengthened Tartar eye, which almost universally
                    prevails, and is the only feature of resemblance between them and the Chinese.
                    Dr Ainslie gives rather a different account <hi rend="italic">of</hi> their
                    complexion from Thunberg. He represents them as perfectly fair, and indeed
                    blooming; though this seems to apply chiefly to the women, who, he says, are
                    equally fair with Europeans, and have the bloom of health more generally
                    prevalent amongst them than is usually found in Europe. Thunberg also mentions
                    that ladies of distinction, who seldom go out in the open air without being
                    covered, are perfectly white. Their eyes are generally dark-brown, or rather
                    black; and the deep furrow which the eyelids form in the great angle of the eye
                    discriminates the Japanese <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944549"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4549-0519"/>from other nations. They have generally large
                    heads and short necks, with black, thick, and shining hair, from the oil which
                    they put upon it. Their noses are rather thick and short, though by no means
                    flat.</p>
                <p>The dress of the Japanese is a complete uniform, from the monarch down to the
                    lowest of his subjects; it is the same in both sexes, and has been unchanged for
                    the space of more than two thousand years. It consists everywhere of long and
                    wide gowns, one or more of which is worn by all ranks. The dress of the poor is
                    distinguished from that of the rich only in the materials being made of cotton
                    instead of the finest silken stuffs, which are frequently flowered, and
                    sometimes interwoven with figures in gold. They reach down to the feet, and are
                    frequently worn by women of quality with a train. Travellers, soldiers, and
                    labouring people, either tuck them up, or wear them so short that they only
                    reach to the knees. These gowns are fastened about the waist with a belt, which
                    is of such a length as to go twice round the body with a large knot and rose,
                    which is worn by the married women before, and.by the single behind. To this
                    belt the men fasten their sabre, fan, tobacco-pipe and pouch, and medicinebox.
                    The gowns are rounded off about the neck; they are open before, and display the
                    bare bosom. The sleeves are ill shaped and wùde, and sewed together in front so
                    as to form a bag at the bottom, in which they put their hands in cold weather,
                    or use it as a pocket to hold their papers and other things. They wear, besides,
                    breeches, which are more like a petticot than breeches, being sewed between the
                    legs, and left open at the sides for about two thirds of their length. There is,
                    besides, a dress of ceremony, which is worn on the outside, over the gowns. It
                    consists of two pieces; the undermost the above-described breeches, which are
                    generally made of a blue stuff, printed with white flowers; the uppermost is a
                    frock, not unlike a half gown. Besides silk and cotton, they use a kind of
                    linen, which is manufactured from a certain species of nettles. The silk worn by
                    the richer classes far exceeds in tenuity and fineness the silks either of India
                    or Europe. The shoes are the most indifferent part of the Japanese dress.</p>
                <p>Of the population of Japan no accurate account has ever been obtained, and all
                    our information on this subject is merely conjectural. Every spot is cultivated
                    even to the mountain tops; and all Europeans who have ever visited Japan concur
                    in representing it as extensively populous. On these grounds, and taking into
                    account also the area of the country, it is supposed that the population cannot
                    be less than fifteen or twenty millions. Sir Stamford Raffles’ estimate, from
                    the accounts brought to him by Dr Ainslie, is twenty-five millions.</p>
                <p>It was from the Portuguese that the nations of Europe received the earliest
                    accounts <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the Japanese islands. The mariners of
                    Portugal first adventured on the Indian Ocean in the year 1497, and they long
                    carried on a lucrative commerce in the ports of the East. The conquest of Goa by
                    Albuquerque, in the year 1510, laid the foundation of their future power; and
                    from that time they pursued with success their conquests and discoveries in the
                    East, and carried on an extensive trade. In 1542 one of their ships was forced
                    by a storm on the yet unknown islands of Japan; and afterwards a ship, richly
                    freighted, sailed every two years for one of their ports. In 1549, a young
                    Japanese, who had fled to Goa, and there embraced the Christian faith and was
                    baptized, held out to the Portuguese the most sanguine prospects of gain from a
                    trade to Japan, and even gave hopes to the Jesuits of converting the people to
                    the Christian faith. These pious fathers were not slow to profit by the hints of
                    their new proselyte; and, with a view to a permanent establishment in Japan, the
                    young Japanese was sent back to his own country on board a Portuguese ship,
                    accompanied by several of the Jesuits, and by St Francis Xavier, the head of the
                    mission. At that time no restraint was imposed on the intercourse of the
                    Japanese with foreign states; the Portuguese were therefore allowed to trade
                    with whatever parts of the empire they thought fit, and were much caressed by
                    several of the princes, and invited to settle within their territories. The
                    princes and nobles of the country vied with each other to obtain the favour of
                    the strangers, and a most lucrative trade was carried on in European and Indian
                    commodities, such as raw-silk, fine silk stuffs, drugs, wines, medicines, and a
                    great variety of other productions, both natural and artificial, which were
                    exchanged for gold and other produce or manufactures of the country. By this
                    traffic the merchants were enriched, and in a few years carried off a large
                    amount of treasure, though not perhaps three hundred tons of gold every year, as
                    Kaempfer says, with a boldness of assertion not very consistent with his usual
                    caution and accuracy. The Jesuit missionaries on their part were not idle. They
                    laboured diligently in their vocation, and they commended the doctrines of the
                    gospel by their modest and virtuous life, and by their disinterested benevolence
                    to the sick and the poor; whilst the pomp and majesty of the Catholic service
                    arrested the attention and affected the senses of the Japanese. The first
                    difficulties being surmounted, converts began to flow from all quarters; and
                    many of the princes and nobles, being converted to the new doctrines, were
                    baptized, and agreed to send an embassy to Pope Gregory XIII. with letters and
                    presents, assuring him of their devotion to the Christian faith. In this manner
                    the Portuguese prospered in all their concerns, both spiritual and temporal; and
                    fresh supplies of missionaries and merchants from Manilla, Macao, and Goa, daily
                    flocked to this profitable mart of religion as well as of trade. But the fair
                    prospect was at last overcast by the darkest clouds of bigotry and persecution;
                    the Christian faith, which had been so successfully planted and propagated, was
                    rooted up and completely extirpated; and, instead of the free intercourse
                    formerly allowed with all nations, commerce was placed under the most severe
                    restraints, and was finally restricted to one part, that of Nagasaki, and to two
                    nations, the Chinese and the Dutch.</p>
                <p>This great revolution originated in various causes. The great prosperity of the
                    Portuguese appears to have filled' them with insolence and pride; the priests
                    and others no longer walked on foot, but, being carried about in stately chairs,
                    mimicked in this and other matters the pomp of the pope and cardinals at Rome;
                    whilst the Japanese priests, and others who profited by the prevailing religion,
                    were displeased at the alterations which had been introduced, being fearful of
                    the injurious consequences to their interest, and contrived to instil into the
                    emperor a jealousy of the new sect. It is related of one of the Portuguese
                    priests, that having met on the road one of the counsellors of state, the
                    haughty prelate would not allow his chair to stop, according to the fashion of
                    the country, in order to pay respects to the great man, but commanded his men to
                    pass on without even showing him common marks of civility. This neglect inspired
                    the nobleman with an unconquerable hatred of the Portuguese; and, in an
                    interview with the emperor, he gave such an odious picture of the insolence,
                    pride, and vanity of the whole nation, as raised the emperor’s, indignation to
                    the highest pitch. In 1586 a proclamation was issued by the emperor, forbidding
                    any of his subjects, under pain of death, to embrace the Christian religion; and
                    the same year began the persecution, which is the most sanguinary every recorded
                    in any age or country. Several converts were executed for disobeying the
                    imperial commands; and, <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944562"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4562-0520"/>according to the letters of the Jesuits, more than
                    twenty thousand persons suffered death in the year 1590. Still the converts
                    increased, for in 1591 and 1592, after all the churches had been shut up, twelve
                    thousand new converts were made. In 1597 a new persecution was raised against
                    the Christians, and twenty-six persons, including Jesuits, and several of the
                    Franciscan fathers, were executed on the cross. It happened that the crown was
                    about this period usurped by an adventurer of the name of Ijejas, whose doubtful
                    title conspired with his fears and jealousy of the Christians to render him a
                    cruel persecutor. He issued a proclamation, strictly forbidding the Portuguese
                    missionaries any longer to preach the Christian faith; and directing all the
                    governors, princes, and lords in the several provinces of the empire, to induce
                    their subjects, either by force or persuasion, to renounce the Christian and
                    adopt their former faith. The monks and priests already in the country were
                    banished, and the Portuguese were strictly forbidden to bring any more of them
                    to Japan. These orders, however, were not at first rigidly enforced. The Jesuits
                    could not be persuaded to quit a country where their labours had been so
                    successful in gaining both wealth and proselytes; and fresh supplies of
                    ecclesiasties were still brought from the Portuguese settlements. But the
                    rashness of the Francisean friars, who were ambassadors at the imperial court,
                    and who insisted on openly preaching in the streets of Miaeo, and built a
                    chapel, in direct opposition to the edict that had been published, hastened the
                    total ruin of the Portuguese interests in Japan. Many were also disgusted by
                    their ambition and covetousness, when they saw that these spiritual fathers
                    aimed fully as much at the possession of money and lands as the salvation of
                    souls. From all these various causes a dreadful persecution was commenced
                    against the Christians, who were put to death without mercy wherever they were
                    found. This persecution lasted forty years, and, after the cruel butehery of
                    thousands, ended at last in the total extirpation of the Christian faith, the
                    ruin of the trade, and the final expulsion of the Portuguese and Castillians
                    from Japan. It was long before this last severe measure was resolved on, as the
                    Japanese, however intolerant in matters of religion, were still anxious to
                    obtain the commodities of Europe; and they appointed the island of Desima, in
                    the harbour of Nagasaki, as the residence of the Portuguese merchants. But the
                    Dutch, who some time prior to the year 1600 had extended their navigation to
                    these seas, were now the zealous competitors of the Portuguese and Spaniards for
                    the eastern trade; and the two nations being at this time at war, were not
                    scrupulous in using the most unworthy arts to supplant each other in the good
                    opinion of the Japanese. It is asserted by Kaempfer that the Portuguese invented
                    the most malicious stories in order to blacken the character of the Dutch,
                    representing them as rebels and pirates, and altogether unworthy of trust. The
                    Dutch on their part resorted to the same artifices, and with some suceβss. It is
                    stated, that in a Portuguese ship which was taken by the Dutch, they found
                    letters to the king of Portugal, written by one Captain Moro, a Japanese by
                    birth, and a Christian proselyte, containing the scheme of a conspiracy for
                    overthrowing the existing government. The Dutch were not slow to profit by this
                    precious discovery. They immediately communicated the letters to the Japanese
                    authorities. Captain Moro was arrested, and, notwithstanding the most earnest
                    protestations of innocence, was burned alive. In proof of the Portuguese
                    treason, intercepted letters were shown, disclosing, as was alleged, the whole
                    plot against the emperor’s life and throne; the want the conspirators stood in
                    of ships and soldiers, which were expected from Portugal; the names of the
                    Japanese princes concerned in the conspiracy; and various other particulars,
                    which were received as convincing evidence of this extensive treason. On this
                    discovery the edict was forthwith issued, in 1637, forbidding, on pain of death,
                    all intercourse with foreigners; prohibiting, under severe penalties, the
                    propagation of the Christian religion, and the purchase of any article by a
                    native of Japan from a stranger; banishing all the Portuguese to Macao and
                    shutting out forever all other nations from the Japanese islands.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese and Spaniards still lingered, in hopes of mitigation of this
                    severe decree; but the Japanese court, being assured by the Dutch that they
                    would supply them with European goods, proceeded to a rigorous execution of the
                    edict, and from this period the trade of Japan has been entirely confined to the
                    Dutch. An attempt to renew the trade, by sending an embassy from Macao, entirely
                    failed, the ship being seized, and the crew executed, with the exception of
                    twelve, who were sent back to their countrymen with an account of this tragical
                    result, but who perished on their way home. It appears to have been chiefly by
                    the intrigues of the Dutch that this great revolution was brought about. The
                    persecutions to which the Portuguese were exposed might naturally enough have
                    engaged them in plots against the Japanese government; but the whole story rests
                    on the evidence of the Dutch, the rivals of the Portuguese, whom they were
                    anxious to ruin, without much scrupling at the means of attaining their end; and
                    in revealing the plot which produced an edict for the extirpation of the
                    Christian faith, and the massaere and banishment of thousands of Europeans, it
                    is plain that they were actuated by the basest motives.</p>
                <p>By the ruin and expulsion of the Castillians and Portuguese from Japan, the Dutch
                    acquired the monopoly of the trade, which they were so intent on securing that
                    they cultivated the favour of the Japanese monarch by the most servile and
                    criminal compliances. Their conduct was indeed most degrading. They made
                    presents to the imperial court, of all the rare animals they could collect from
                    the most remote quarters of the world; and they complied with all the commands
                    of the emperor, however despotic or unjust. They were obliged, in 1638, to
                    abolish their factory on the island of Firando, for no other reason but because
                    it was built of hewn stones, and finer than the other buildings of the country,
                    and because the Christian era was engraved on the front; and the part which they
                    aeted in the massaere of the Japanese Christians at Siina-bara leaves a deep
                    stain on the national character, proving as it does that the love of gain had
                    extinguished every sentiment of humanity in the breasts of these traders. The
                    Japanese Christians, by the unparalleled cruelties and torments to which they
                    were exposed, were driven to despair; and they had retired, to the number of
                    forty thousand, to a fortified place in the neighbourhood of Simabara, where
                    they were resolved to defend themselves to the last extremity. The emperor
                    requested the aid of the Dutch in the siege of this last stronghold, in the
                    massaere of these Christians, and in the utter extirpation of the Christian name
                    in Japan. This aid was at once afforded. A Dutch vessel of war was sent to
                    batter the town, and a breach was made in the defences of these unfortunate
                    refugees, through which their enemies entered and perpetrated a massacre
                    unparalleled for enormity even in the blood-stained annals of the East.
                    Aeeording to the information received by Dr Ainslie from the Japanese, they were
                    prompted to this massacre by European intrigue; and the alacrity of the Dutch in
                    lending their aid, joined to their hatred of the Portuguese, concurs to fix on
                    them a deep share in this shocking atroeity. But they were far from recommending
                    themselves to the Japanese by their treacherous conduct. “By this submissive
                    readiness,” says Kaempfer, <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">to</hi>

                    destruction of Christianity in his dominions, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192944575" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4575-0521"/>’ tis true indeed that we
                    stood our ground so’far as to maintain ourselves in the country, and to be
                    permitted to carry on our trade, although the court had then some thoughts of a
                    total exclusion of all foreigners whatever. But many generous and noble persons,
                    at court and in the empire, judged quite otherwise of our conduct, and not too
                    favourably for the credit we had thereby endeavoured to gain. It seemed to them
                    inconsistent with reason that the Dutch should ever be expected to be sincerely
                    faithful to a foreign monarch, and one, too, whom they looked upon as a heathen
                    prince, whilst they showed so much forwardness to assist him in the destruction
                    of a people with whom they otherwise agreed in the most essential parts of their
                    faith, as the Japanese had been informed by the Portuguese and Manilhese
                    fathers, and to sacrifice to their own worldly interest those who followed
                    Christ the very same way, and entered the kingdom of heaven through the same
                    gate; expressions which I have often heard the natives make use of when the
                    conversation happened to turn upon this subject. In short, our humble,
                    complaisant, and obliging conduct notwithstanding, we were so far from bringing
                    this proud and jealous nation to any greater confidence, or more intimate
                    friendship, that, on the contrary, their jealousy and mistrust seemed to
                    increase in proportion to the many convincing proofs of sincerity and
                    faithfulness we gave them; and that the better we deserved of them, the more
                    they seemed to hate and despise us, till at last, in the year 1641, soon after
                    the total expulsion of the Portuguese, orders were sent us to quit our old
                    factory at Firando, to exchange the protection of a good and indulgent prince
                    for the severe and strict government of Nagasaki, and under a very narrow
                    inspection to confine ourselves within that small island, I should rather say
                    prison, which was built for the Portuguese.” In this island or prison, 600 feet
                    long by 240 broad, the Dutch continue to carry on their trade, where they are
                    guarded like thieves or pirates, and placed under the most degrading
                    restrictions. Kaempfer gives a minute account of the guards that are placed over
                    them, of the vigilance with which they are watched, of the daily musters that
                    are made to see that none is amissing, of the extraordinary precautions employed
                    to prevent the introduction of contraband goods, and of the sure penalty of
                    death that follows the violation of the law. He gives an account of the
                    punishment of two men, Japanese, who were detected with camphor concealed about
                    their persons, which they had purchased from the Dutch, and who for this crime
                    had their heads struck off by the common executioner; a deputy from the Dutch
                    establishment being expected to attend at the execution, and to witness, for the
                    instruction of himself and his companions, this wholesome example of severity.
                    On one occasion, also, he relates that a Dutch sailor had thrown himself over
                    board, and that when he did not appear at the daily muster the Japanese were all
                    in despair, being terrified that it might be a Roman Catholic priest, and that
                    he might have escaped into the country. “All the officers,” he observes, “ran
                    about scratching their heads, and behaving themselves as if they had lost their
                    senses; and some of the soldiers in the guard-ships were already preparing to
                    rip open their bellies, before superior orders could compel them to answer for
                    their carelessness and neglect of their duty.” It was not till the man’s body
                    was got up from the bottom of the sea that this alarm began to subside.</p>
                <p>The moment the Dutch vessels are seen steering for the harbour by the spy-guards
                    with their glasses, the system of vigilance begins. The ship is boarded by three
                    persons from the Dutch factory, and the public interpreter, and the deputies
                    from the governor, demand forthwith the list of the cargo and crew, also the
                    letters on board, which are carried to Nagasaki, where they arc examined by the
                    governors. On entering the harbour, two guard-boats, with a number of soldiers
                    on board, are placed on each side of her, and continued in their position, the
                    guards being regularly changed till her departure. All arms, namely, guns,
                    cutlasses, swords, and also the ship’s stock of gunpowder, are given into the
                    custody of the proper officers. The persons and trunks of the sailors are all
                    searched with the utmost strictness, also every corner of the vessel; and the
                    different packages arc rigidly examined. All the approaches to the island in
                    which the Dutch are settled are strictly guarded, both day and night, by
                    officers appointed for the purpose. There is a company or corporation of
                    interpreters, amounting to one hundred and sixty, who also do the duty of spies;
                    and during the time of the annual sale the vigilance of all these functionaries
                    is redoubled. Those who come to trade with the Dutch must submit to a strict
                    search of their persons before they are admitted within the gates leading to
                    their residence. No letters can either be sent or received unless they are
                    previously entered in a register book, and a copy left with the governors.</p>
                <p>The Chinese, who are admitted to trade along with the Dutch, are subjected to
                    similar restrictions. They formerly carried on a free intercourse with Japan;
                    but it was intimated to the Japanese that the Jesuits, after their expulsion
                    from the country, had experienced a most friendly reception in China, and it was
                    discovered that several of their books had been brought over by the Chinese and
                    privately sold. This, together with the vast influx of the Chinese into Japan,
                    raised the jealousy of the emperor and the court, and the Chinese were finally
                    laid under the same restraints as the Dutch.</p>
                <p>The goods chiefly imported into Japan are raw silk from China, all sorts of silk
                    and woollen stuffs, coarse cotton stuffs, woollen cloth from Europe, hides raw
                    and tanned, sugar, coffee, spices of all kinds, quicksilver, cinnabar, saffron,
                    lead, saltpetre, borax, musk, gums, coral, amber, various articles of glass, and
                    iron, lead, tin. The returns are chiefly made in copper, and along with it
                    camphor, lackered ware, painted paper, and other articles of comparatively
                    little moment. The trade of the Dutch and the Chinese with Japan was formerly
                    very extensive. From the year 1611 to the year 1671 the speculations of the
                    former were unrestricted, and their profits were enormous. According to the
                    account of Kaempfer, the Dutch gradually fell into discredit with the Japanese;
                    their commerce was curtailed, they were subjected to ignominious treatment,
                    their profits were diminished, and the trade is now confined to two annual
                    ships, which sail from the port of Batavia. The Chinese send annually ten junks
                    to the port of Nagasaki, the only port which is open to foreigners.</p>
                <p>In 1814, when the island of Java was in possession of the British, Sir Stamford
                    Raffles, the governor, distinguished on all occasions by his enlightened zeal
                    for the interests of science and of social improvement, was deeply impressed
                    with the importance <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> of opening a commercial
                    intercourse with the Japanese, and of acquiring for Britain a participation in
                    the trade hitherto monopolised by the Dutch. The Japanese islands, containing,
                    according to his estimate, about twenty-five millions of inhabitants, who
                    require woollens, hardware, iron manufactures, and glass, besides many other
                    articles, might, he justly conceived, afford a very extensive market for British
                    goods. With this view, when the time arrived for the annual visit of the Dutch
                    to Japan, he joined two other gentlemen in the mission, one of whom was Dr
                    Ainslic, for the purpose of obtaining accurate information respecting the
                    Japanese, and the Dutch establishment in Japan. He confirms all the previous
                    accounts that had been received of the narrow and exclusive policy of the
                    government, in consequence of which few op <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944588"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4588-0522"/>portunities were afforded of a free communication
                    with the natives. The commissioners, however, who were sent to Japan by Sir
                    Stamford Raffles, state that the character of the Japanese had been greatly
                    misrepresented by the Dutch for their own selfish purposes, and through fear of
                    being interfered with by any other of the European states. So far from being a
                    bigoted and intolerant race, as they are represented, they appeared to be
                    remarkable for frankness of manner and disposition, for intelligence and the
                    spirit of inquiry; and, in regard to religion or superstitious prejudices, to be
                    perfectly inoffensive. The British commissioners were strongly of opinion that
                    the commercial restrictions did not so much arise from the limitations or from
                    the laws of the Japanese, as from the constitution of the Dutch factory. It is
                    the interest of the resident and other functionaries to narrow the trade, that
                    they may secure a larger profit for themselves; and, living at a distance from
                    control, with a limited salary, they are compelled to scramble for every petty
                    advantage to themselves, to the neglect of the general interests and prosperity
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> trade. From the degraded state of the Dutch factory,
                    and the corruptions which prevail, the national character of this commercial
                    people is lowered in the eyes of the Japanese, at whose hands they endure every
                    species of humiliation. They prostrate themselves not only to the emperor, but
                    also to the inferior chiefs, for which they are despised by the Japanese, as
                    well as for all the other mean compliances which they submit to, rather than run
                    the risk of sacrificing the trade. It was indeed intimated by the Japanese
                    interpreters to Dr Ainslie, that the Dutch were the secret instigators of the
                    massacre of the Christians at Simabara, and it is certain that they lent their
                    active aid in that bloody transaction. The English commissioners were most
                    courteously received in Japan; the people evinced the most earnest desire to
                    communicate with them; their presents were even graciously received by the
                    emperor; and, from this auspicious commencement, the most favourable hopes were
                    entertained of a closer and more friendly intercourse with this singular people.
                    But the surrender of Java to the Dutch put an end to all these expectations of
                    extended trade; and the intercourse with Japan has since been continued on its
                    former footing, all competitors having beep, as heretofore, rigidly
                    excluded.</p>
                <p>Various attempts have been made by the Russians to open an intercourse with these
                    islands, from their establishments along the eastern coast of Asia. But all
                    friendly overtures with a view to a commercial intercourse have been decidedly
                    rejected. In 1792 a deputation arrived from Japan at Okhotzk, requesting,the aid
                    of the Russians to extricate some unfortunate Japanese who had been thrown upon
                    the desolate island of Oonalaska. The Russians were extremely ready in lending
                    their aid in the cause of humanity, and the Japanese expressed the utmost
                    gratitude for the services which they rendered them. The opportunity was deemed
                    favourable for renewing the offer of commercial intercourse, and Captain Laxmann
                    was sent, by orders of the empress, to that part of the coast of Jesso or
                    Matsmai which is occupied by the Japanese. He was kindly received, and loaded
                    with presents; but all commercial intercourse was steadily rejected. In 1814
                    Count Krensenstern, despatched to Japan on a similar errand, met with no better
                    success. He was peremptorily told, by orders of the emperor, that his subjects
                    traded only with the Dutch and the Chinese; and from the moment that he and his
                    attendants arrived, they were exposed, as has already been related, to every
                    possible ignominy, through the influence of the Dutch factory, jealous of
                    competition; and they were finally requested to return to their own country, as
                    they valued their lives, and never to come back. Since this time Captain
                    Golownin, who was enticed on shore and detained in a severe captivity by the
                    Japanese, reports that they are extremely jealous of the ascendency both of the
                    Russians and of the English in the East, from the establishments of the Russians
                    along the northern, and of the English along the southern coasts of Asia. These
                    jealousies, there is every reason to suppose, are fostered by the Dutch, who
                    alone have access to the Japanese, and who have even persuaded them that the
                    Europeans are intent on adding Japan to the other extensive conquests which they
                    have acquired in the East. At present, therefore, there is no prospect <hi
                    rend="italic">of any</hi> change in the exclusive policy of this singular
                    people. They are even more rigid in their maxims of exclusion than the Chinese,
                    who, through the free port of Canton, trade indiscriminately with all nations.
                    But the Japanese confine the privilege of commerce to one port and to two
                    nations, who either cannot or do not find it their interest to supply them with
                    foreign produce to the extent which would be required if the existing
                    restrictions were abolished. The cession of Java to the Dutch at the peace of
                    1814 is deeply to be regretted on this account, that it closed the door against
                    all further communication of the British with Japan, and for ever frustrated the
                    judicious and enlightened plans of Sir Stamford Raffles for promoting a free
                    intercourse and a more extended trade with these islands. (<hi
