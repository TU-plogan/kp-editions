                    one of the most distinguished dramatic poets of the Elizabethan age, whether we
                    consider the number or the merit of his productions. He was born at Westminster
                    in 1574, and was educated at the public school there, under the great Camden. He
                    was descended from a Scottish family; but as his father, who had lost his estate
                    under Queen Mary, died before our poet was born, and his mother married a
                    brick-layer for her second husband, Ben was taken from school to work at his
                    father-in-law’s trade. Not being captivated with this employment, however, he
                    went into the Low Countries, and distinguished himself in a military capacity.
                    On his return to England, he entered himself at St John’s College, Cambridge;
                    and having killed a person in a duel, he was condemned, and narrowly escaped
                    execution. After this he turned actor; and Shakspeare is said to have first
                    introduced him to the world, by recommending a play of his to the stage, after
                    it had been rejected. His Alchymist gained him such reputation, that in 1619 he
                    was, at the death of Mr Daniel, made poet-laureate to King James I. and master
                    of arts at Oxford. As we do not find Jonson’s economical virtues anywhere
                    recorded, it is the less to be wondered that, after this, we should find him
                    petitioning King Charles, on his accession, to enlarge his father’s allowance of
                    a hundred merks into pounds; and soon afterwards we learn that, being very poor
                    and sick, he lodged in an obscure alley. On this occasion it was that Charles,
                    having been moved in his favour, sent him ten guineas, upon which Ben remarked,
                    “His majesty sent me ten guineas because I am poor, and live in an alley; go and
                    tell him that his soul lives in an alley.” He died in August 1637, at the age of
                    sixty-three, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. The most complete edition of
                    his works was that printed in 1756, in 7 vols. 8vo.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Johnson,</hi><hi rend="italic">Dr Samuel,</hi> one of the
                    brightest ornaments of the eighteenth century, was born in the city of
                    Litchfield, in Staffordshire, on the 18th of September 1709. His father Michael
                    was a bookseller, and must have had some reputation in the city, as he more than
                    once held the office of chief magistrate. By what casuistry he reconciled his
                    conscience to the oaths required to be taken by all who occupy such stations
                    cannot now be known; but it is certain that he was zealously attached to the
                    exiled family of Stuart, and instilled the same principles into the youthful
                    mind of his son. So earnest was he in this, and at so early a period did he
                    commence it, that when Dr Sacheverel, in his memorable tour through England,
                    came to Litchfield, Mr Johnson carried his son, not then quite three years of
                    age, to the cathedral, and placed him on his shoulders, that he might see as
                    well as hear the famous preacher.</p>
                <p>But political prejudices were not the only doubtful qualities which young Sam
                    inherited from his father. He derived from the same source a morbid melancholy,
                    which, though it neither depressed his imagination, nor clouded <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192945537" xml:id="kp-eb0712-5537-0595"/>his perceptions, filled him
                    with dreadful apprehensions of insanity, and rendered him wretched through life.
                    From his nurse he contracted the scrofula or king’s evil, which made its
                    appearance at a very early period, disfigured a face naturally well-formed, and
                    deprived him of the sight of one <hi rend="italic">of</hi> his eyes.</p>
                <p>When he had arrived at a proper age for receiving grammatical instruction, he was
                    placed in the free school of Litchfield, of which Mr Hunter was then master; a
                    man whom his illustrious pupil thought “very severe, and wrongheadedly severe,”
                    because he would beat a boy for not answering questions which the latter could
                    not expect to be asked of him. He was, however, a skilful teacher; and Johnson,
                    when he stood in the very front of learning, was sensible how much he owed to
                    him; for upon being asked how he had acquired so accurate a knowledge of the
                    Latin tongue, he replied, “My master beat me very well; without that, Sir, I
                    should have done nothing.”</p>
                <p>At the age of fifteen, Johnson was removed from Litchfield to the school of
                    Stourbridge in Worcestershire, at which he remained little more than a year, and
                    then returned home, where he staid two years without any settled plan of life or
                    any regular course of study. But he read a great deal in a desultory manner, as
                    chance threw books in his way, and as inclination directed him through them; so
                    that when, in his nineteenth year, he was entered a commoner of Pembroke
                    College, Oxford, his mind was stored with a variety of such knowledge as is not
                    often acquired in universities, where boys seldom read any books but those which
                    are put into their hands by their tutors. He had given very early proofs of his
                    poetical genius, both in his school exercises and in other occasional
                    compositions; but what is perhaps more remarkable, as evincing that he must have
                    thought a good deal on a subject on which other boys of that age seldom think at
                    all, he had, before he was fourteen, entertained doubts of the truth of
                    revelation. From the melancholy of his temper, these naturally preyed upon his
                    spirits, and gave him great uneasiness; but they were happily removed by a
                    proper course of reading; for his studies being honest, ended in conviction. He
                    found that religion was true; and what he had learned by inquiry, he ever
                    afterwards endeavoured to teach to mankind.</p>
                <p>Concerning his residence at the university, and the means by which he was there
                    supported, his two principal biographers contradict each other; and hence on
                    these points it is impossible to write with certainty. According to Sir John Haw
                    kins, the time of his continuance at Oxford is divisible into two periods; but
                    Mr Boswell represents it as only one period, with the usual interval of a long
                    vacation. Sir John says that he was supported at college by Mr Andrew Corbet, in
                    quality of assistant to his son. But Mr Boswell assures us, that though he was
                    promised pecuniary aid by Mr Corbet, that promise was not in any degree
                    fulfilled. With regard to the knight’s account of this transaction, it seems to
                    be inconsistent with itself. He says, that the two young men were entered in
                    Pembroke on the same day; that Corbet continued in the college two years; but
                    that Johnson was driven home in little more than one year, because, by the
                    removal of Corbet, he was deprived of his pension. A story of which one part
                    contradicts the other cannot be wholly true. Sir John adds, that “meeting with
                    another source, the bounty, as is supposed, of some one or more of the members
                    of the cathedral of Litchfield, he returned to college, and made up the whole of
                    his residence in the university about three years.” Mr Boswell has told us
                    nothing more than that Johnson, though his father was unable to support him,
                    continued three years in college, and that he was then driven from it by extreme
                    poverty.</p>
                <p>These gentlemen differ likewise in their accounts of Johnson’s tutors. Sir John
                    Hawkins says that he had two, Mr Jordan and Dr Adams. Mr Boswell affirms that Dr
                    Adams could not be his tutor, because Jordan did not quit the college till 1731,
                    the year in the autumn of which Johnson himself was compelled to leave Oxford.
                    Yet the same author represents Dr Adams as saying, “I was Johnson’s nominal
                    tutor, but he was above my mark ;” a speech of which it is not easy to discover
                    the meaning, if it formed no part of Johnson’s duty to attend upon Adams’s
                    prelections. In most colleges we believe there are two tutors in different
                    departments of education; and therefore it is not improbable that Jordan and
                    Adams may have been at the same time tutors to Johnson, the one in languages,
                    and the other in science. Jordan was a man of such mean abilities, that though
                    his pupil loved him for the goodness of his heart, he would often risk the
                    payment of a small fine rather than attend his prelections; nor was he studious
                    to conceal the reason of his absence. Upon occasion of one such imposition,
                    Johnson is reported to have said, “Sir, you have sconced me twopence for
                    non-attendance at a lecture not worth a penny.” For some transgression or
                    absence his tutor imposed upon him, as a Christmas exercise, the task of
                    translating into Latin verse Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Messiah.</hi> This Johnson
                    performed, and on his translation being shown to the author of the original, the
                    latter, after perusal, returned it with this observation, “The writer of this
                    poem will leave it a question for posterity, wdιether his or mine be the
                    original.” The particular course of his reading whilst in college, and during
                    the vacation which he passed at home, cannot be traced. That at this period he
                    read much, we have his own evidence in what he afterwards told the king; but his
                    mode of study was never regular, and at all times he thought more than he read.
                    He informed Mr Boswell, that what he read solidly at Oxford was Greek, and that
                    the study of which he was fondest was that of metaphysics.</p>
                <p>In the year 1731 Johnson left the university without a degree; and as his father,
                    who died in the month of December of that year, had suffered great misfortunes
                    in trade, he was driven out as a commoner of nature, and excluded from the
                    regular modes of profit and prosperity. Having therefore not only a profession,
                    but the means of subsistence, to seek, he, in the month of March 1732, accepted
                    an invitation to the office of under-master of a free school at Market-Bosworth,
                    in Leicestershire; but not knowing, as he said, whether it was more disagreeable
                    for him to teach or for the boys to learn the rules of grammar, and being
                    likewise disgusted at the treatment which he had received from the patron of the
                    school, he in a few months relinquished a situation which he ever afterwards
                    recollected with horror. Being thus again without any fixed employment, and with
                    very little money in his pocket, be translated Lobo’s Voyage to Abyssinia, for
                    the trifling sum, it is said, of five guineas, which he received from a
                    bookseller in Birmingham. This was the first attempt which he made to procure
                    pecuniary assistance by means of his pen; and it must have held forth very
                    little encouragement to his commencing author by profession.</p>
                <p>In 1735, being then in his twenty-sixth year, he married Mrs Porter, the widow of
                    a mercer in Birmingham; a woman whose age was almost double his, whose external
                    form had never been captivating, and whose fortune amounted to scarcely L.800.
                    That she had a superiority of understanding and talents, is extremely probable,
                    both because she certainly inspired him with a more than ordinary passion, and
                    because she was herself so delighted with the charms of his conversation as to
                    overlook his external disadvantages, which were many and great. He now set up a
                    private academy, for which purpose he had hired a large house, well situated,
                    near his native city; but his name having then nothing of that celebrity which
                    afterwards commanded the <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945550"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-5550-0596"/>attention and respect of the world, this
                    undertaking did not succeed. The only pupils who are known to have been placed
                    under his care, were the celebrated David Garrick, his brother George Garrick,
                    and a young gentleman of fortune, of the name of Offely. He kept this academy
                    only a year and a half; and it was during the period in question that he
                    constructed the plan and wrote the greater part of his tragedy of <hi
                    rend="italic">Irene.</hi></p>
                <p>The respectable character of his parents, and his own merit, had secured him a
                    kind reception in the best families at Litchfield; and he was particularly
                    distinguished by Mr Walmsley, registrar of the ecclesiastical court, a man of
                    great worth, and of extensive and various erudition. That gentleman, upon
                    hearing part of Irene read, thought so highly of Johnson’s abilities as a
                    dramatic writer, that he advised him by all means to complete the tragedy and
                    produce it on the stage. To men of genius the stage holds forth temptations
                    almost irresistible. The profits arising from a tragedy, including the
                    representation and printing of it, and the connections which it sometimes
                    enables the author to form, were in Johnson’s imagination inestimable.
                    Flattered, it may be supposed, with these hopes, he, in the year 1737, set out
                    for London, with his pupil David Garrick, leaving Mrs Johnson to take care of
                    the house and the wreck of her fortune. The two adventurers carried with them
                    from Mr Walmsley an earnest recommendation to the Reverend Mr Colson, then
                    master of an academy, and afterwards Lucasian professor of mathematics in the
                    university of Cambridge; but from that gentleman it does not appear that Johnson
                    ever found either protection or encouragement.</p>
                <p>How he spent his time upon his arrival in London is not particularly known. His
                    tragedy was refused by the managers of the day; and for some years the
                    Gentleman’s Magazine seems to have been his principal resource for employment
                    and support. To enumerate his various communications to that miscellaoy would be
                    equally tedious and unnecessary. It is sufficient to say, that his connection
                    with Cave the proprietor became very close; that he wrote prefaces, essays,
                    reviews of books, and poems; and that he was occasionally employed in correcting
                    the papers written by other correspondents. When the complaints of the nation
                    against the administration of Sir Robert Walpole became loud, and on the 13th of
                    February 1740 a motion was made to remove him from his majesty’s counsels for
                    ever, Johnson was pitched upon by Cave to write what was in the Magazine
                    entitled “Debates in the Senate of Lilliput,” but was understood to be the
                    speeches of the most eminent members in both houses of parliament. These
                    orations, which induced Voltaire to compare British with ancient eloquence, were
                    hastily sketched by Johnson whilst he was not yet thirty-two years of age, but
                    little acquainted with life, and struggling, not for distinction, but for
                    existence. Perhaps in none of his writings has he given a more conspicuous proof
                    of a mind prompt and vigorous almost beyond conception. They were composed from
                    scanty notes taken by illiterate persons employed to attend in both houses; and
                    sometimes he had nothing communicated to him but the names of the several
                    speakers, and the part which they took in the debate.</p>
                <p>His separate publications which at this time attracted the greatest notice were,
                    <hi rend="italic">London,</hi> a poem in imitation of Juvenal’s third Satire;
                    <hi rend="italic">Marmor</hi><hi rend="italic">Norfolciense,</hi> or an Essay on
                    an ancient prophetical Inscription in Monkish Rhyme, discovered near Lynne, in
                    Norfolk; and a complete Vindication of the Licensers of the Stage from the
                    malicious and scandalous aspersions of Mr Brook, author of Gustavus Vasa. The
                    poem, which was published in 1738, by Dodsley, is universally known and admired
                    as the most spirited instance in the English language of ancient sentiments
                    adapted to modern topics. Pope, who then filled the poetical throne without a
                    rival, being informed that the author’s name was Johnson, and that he was an
                    obscure person, replied, “He will soon be <hi rend="italic">deterre!</hi> The
                    two pamphlets, which were published in 1739, are filled with keen satire on the
                    government. Sir John Hawkins has thought fit to declare that they display
                    neither learning nor wit; but Pope was of a different opinion; for in a note of
                    his preserved by Mr Boswell, he says, that “the whole of the Norfolk prophecy is
                    very humorous.”</p>
                <p>Mrs Johnson, who went to London soon after her husband, now lived sometimes in
                    one place and sometimes in another, sometimes in the city and sometimes at
                    Greenwich; but Johnson himself was offener to be found at St John’s Gate, where
                    the Gentleman’s Magazine was published, than in his own lodgings. It was there
                    that he became acquainted with Savage, with whom he was induced, probably by the
                    similarity of their circumstances, to contract a very close friendship; and such
                    were their extreme necessities, that they often wandered duringwhole nights in
                    the street, for want of money to procure them a lodging. In one of these
                    nocturnal rambles, when their distress was almost incredible, so far were they
                    from being depressed by their situation, that, in high spirits and brimful of
                    patriotism, they traversed St James’s Square for several hours, inveighed
                    against the minister, and, as Johnson said in ridicule of himself, his
                    companion, and all such pennyless patriots, “resolved that <hi rend="italic"
                    >they</hi> would stand by their country.” In 1744, he published the life of his
                    unfortunate companion; a work which, had he never written any thing else, would
                    have placed him very high in the rank of authors. His narrative is remarkably
                    smooth and well disposed; his observations are just, and his reflections
                    disclose the inmost recesses of the human heart. But, to say nothing of the
                    pretended birth of Savage, whom Mr Boswell considered as an impostor, the moral
                    character of this person was undoubtedly unworthy of such a biographer; and it
                    is not easy to discover any thing either in his intellectual or poetical
                    qualifications which could reasonably have entitled him to the prominent place
                    amongst English poets which the partiality of Johnson has assigned to his
                    companion in misfortune.</p>
                <p>In 1749, when Drury-lane theatre was opened under the management of Garrick,
                    Johnson wrote for the occasion a prologue, which, for just dramatic criticism,
                    as well as poetical excellence, is confessedly unrivalled. This year is also
                    distinguished in his life as the epoch when his arduous and important work, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of the English Language,</hi> was announced to the
                    world by the publication of its plan or prospectus, addressed to the Earl of
                    Chesterfield. From that nobleman Johnson was certainly led to expect patronage
                    and encouragement; and it seems equally certain that his lordship expected, when
                    the book made its appearance, to be honoured with the dedication. But the
                    expectations of both were disappointed. Lord Chesterfield, after once or twice
                    seeing the lexicorapher, suffered him to be repulsed from his door; but
                    afterwards thinking to conciliate him when the work was upon the eve of
                    publication, he wrote two papers in <hi rend="italic">The World,</hi> warmly
                    recommending it to the public. This artifice was seen through; and Johnson, in
                    very polite language, rejected his lordship’s advances, letting him know that he
                    was unwilling the public should consider him as owing that to a patron which
                    Providence had enabled him to do for himself. This great and laborious work its
                    author expected to complete in three years; but he was certainly employed upon
                    it seven years; for we know that it was begun in 1747, and that the last sheet
                    was sent to the press in the end of the year 1754. When we consider the nature
                    of the undertaking, it is indeed astonishing that it was finished so soon, since
                    it was writ <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945563" xml:id="kp-eb0712-5563-0597"
                    />ten, as he says, “with little assistance of the learned, and without any
                    patronage of the great; not in the soft obscurities of retirement, or under the
                    shelter of academic bowers, but amidst inconvenience and distraction, in
                    sickness and in sorrow.” The sorrow to which he here alludes is probably that
                    which he felt for the loss of his wife, who died in March 1752, and the loss of
                    whom he continued to lament as long as he lived.</p>
                <p>The Dictionary did not occupy his whole time; for whilst he was pushing it
                    forward, he fitted his tragedy for the stage, wrote the lives of several eminent
                    men for the Gentleman’s Magazine, published an Imitation of the tenth Satire of
                    Juvenal, entitled the Vanity of human Wishes, and began and finished <hi
                    rend="italic">The Rambler.</hi> This last work is so well known, that it is
                    hardly necessary to say that it was a periodical paper, published twice a week,
                    from the 20th of March 1750 to the 14th of March 1752 inclusive; but to convey
                    some notion of the vigour and promptitude of the author’s mind, it may not be
                    improper to observe, that notwithstanding the severity of his other labours, all
                    the assistance which he received did not amount to five papers; and that many of
                    the most masterly of these essays were written on the spur of the occasion, and
                    were never seen entire by the author till they returned to him from the
                    press.</p>
                <p>Soon after the Rambler was concluded, Dr Hawkesworth projected <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Adventurer,</hi> upon a similar plan; and, by the assistance of friends, he
                    was enabled to carry it on with almost equal merit. For a short time, indeed, it
                    was the more popular work of the two; and the papers with the signature T, which
                    are confessedly the most splendid in the whole collection, are now known to have
                    been communicated by Johnson, who received for each the sum of two guineas. This
                    was double the price for which he sold sermons to such clergymen as either would
                    not or could not compose their own discourses; indeed he seems to have made a
                    kind of trade of sermon-writing.</p>
                <p>Though, during the time that he was employed on the Dictionary, he had exhausted
                    more than the sum for which the booksellers had bargained as the price of the
                    copy, yet, by means of the Rambler, Adventurer, sermons, and other productions
                    of his pen, he now found himself in greater affluence than he had ever before
                    been; and as the powers of his mind, distended by long and severe exercise,
                    required relaxation to restore them to their proper tone, he appears to have
                    done little or nothing from the close of the Adventurer till the year 1756, when
                    he undertook the office of reviewer in the Literary Magazine. Of his reviews, by
                    far the most valuable is that of Soame Jenyns’s Free Inquiry into the Nature and
                    Origin of Evil. Never were wit and metaphysical acuteness more closely united
                    than in that criticism, which exposes the weakness and holds up to contempt the
                    reasonings of those vain mortals who presumptuously attempt to grasp the scale
                    of existence, and to form plans of conduct for the Creator of the universe. But
                    the furnishing of magazines, reviews, and even newspapers, with literary
                    intelligence, and authors of books with dedications and prefaces, was considered
                    as an employment unworthy of Johnson. It was therefore proposed by the
                    booksellers that he should give a new edition of the dramas of Shakspeare; a
                    work which he had projected many years before, and of which he had published a
                    specimen which was commended by Warburton. When one of his friends expressed a
                    hope that this employment would furnish him with amusement, and add to his fame,
                    he replied, “I look upon it as I did upon the Dictionary; it is all work; and my
                    inducement to it is not love or desire of fame, but the want of money, which is
                    the only motive to writing that I know of.” He issued proposals, however, of
                    considerable length, i∏ which he showed that he knew perfectly what a variety of
                    research such an undertaking required; but his indolence prevented him from
                    pursuing it with diligence, and it was not published till many years
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p>On the 15th of April 1785, he began a new periodical paper entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Idler,</hi> which came out every Saturday, in a weekly
                    newspaper called the Universal Chronicle, or Weckly Gazette, published by
                    Newberry. Of these essays, which were continued till the 5th of April 1760, many
                    were written as hastily as an ordinary letter; and one in particular, composed
                    at Oxford, was begun only half an hour before the departure of the post which
                    carried it to London. About this time he had the offer of a living, of which he
                    might have rendered himself capable by entering into orders. It was a rectory,
                    in a pleasant country, of such yearly value as would have been an object to one
                    in much better circumstances; but, sensible, as is supposed, of the asperity of
                    his temper, he declined it, saying, “I have not the requisites for the office,
                    and I cannot in my conscience shear the flock which I am unable to feed.”</p>
                <p>In the month of January 1759, his mother died, at the advanced age of ninety; an
                    event which deeply affected him, and gave birth to the forty-first paper in the
                    Idler, in which he laments, that “the life which made his own life pleasant was
                    at an end, and that the gate of death was shut upon his prospects.” Soon
                    afterwards he wrote his <hi rend="italic">Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia,</hi>
                    that with the profits he might defray the expense of his mother’s funeral, and
                    pay some debts which she had left. He told a friend that he received for the
                    copy L.100, and L.25 more when it came to a second edition; that he wrote it in
                    the evenings of a week, sent it to the press in portions as it was written, and
                    had. never since read it.</p>
                <p>Hitherto, notwithstanding his varions publications, he was poor, and obliged to
                    provide by his labour for the wants of the day that was passing over him; but
                    having been, early in 1762, represented to the king as a very learned and good
                    man, without any certain provision, his majesty was pleased to grant him a
                    pension, which Lord Bute, then first minister, assured him, “was not given for
                    any thing which he was to do, but for what he had already done.” But a fixed
                    annuity of three hundred pounds, if it diminished his distress, increased his
                    indolence; for as he constantly avowed that he had no other motive in writing
                    than to gain money, as he had now what was abundantly sufficient for all his
                    purposes, and as he delighted in conversation, and was visited and admired by
                    the witty, the elegant, and the learned, very little of his time was passed in
                    solitary study. Solitude was indeed his aversion; and, that he might avoid it as
                    much as possible, Sir Joshua Reynolds and he, in 1764, instituted a club, which
                    existed long without a name, but was afterwards known by the title of the
                    Literary Club. It consisted of some of the most enlightened men of the age, who
                    met at the Turk’s Head in Gerard Street, Soho, one evening in every week, at
                    seven, and till a late hour enjoyed “the feast of reason and the flow of
                    soul.”</p>
                <p>In 1765, when Johnson was more than usually oppressed with constitutional
                    melancholy, he was fortunately introduced into the family of Mr Thrale, one of
                    the most eminent brewers in England, and member of parliament for the borough of
                    Southwark; and it is but justice to acknowledge, that to the assistance which Mr
                    and Mrs Thrale gave him, to the shelter which their house afforded him for
                    sixteen or seventeen years, and to the pains which they took to soothe or
                    repress his uneasy fancies, the public is probably indebted for some of the most
                    masterly as well as the most popular works which he ever produced. At length, in
                    the October of this year, he gave to the world his edition of Shakspeare, which
                    is chiefly valuable for the preface, where the excellencies and defects of that
                    immortal bard are displayed with a judgment which must please every man whose
                    taste is not regulated by the stand <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945576"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-5576-0598"/>ard of fashion or national prejudice, and where
                    the question of the unities is discussed with an ability and force of reasoning
                    which leaves nothing to be added or desired on the subject. In 1767 he was
                    honoured by a private conversation with the king, in the library at the queen’s
                    house; and two years afterwards, upon the establishment of the Royal Academy of
                    Painting and Sculpture, he was nominated professor of ancient literature; an
                    office merely honorary, and conferred on him, as is supposed, at the
                    recommendation of his friend the president.</p>
                <p>In the variety of subjects on which he had hitherto exercised his pen, he had
                    forborne, since the administration of Sir Robert Walpole, to meddle with the
                    disputes of contending factions; but having seen with indignation the methods
                    which, in the business of Mr Wilkes, were taken to work upon the populace, he
                    published in 1770 a pamphlet, entitled <hi rend="italic">The False Alarm,</hi>
                    in which he asserts, and labours to prove by a variety of arguments founded on
                    precedents, that the expulsion of a member of the House of Commons is equivalent
                    to exclusion, and that no such calamity as the subversion of the constitution
                    was to be feared from an act warranted by usage, and conformable to the law of
                    parliament. Whatever may be thought of the principles maintained in this
                    publication, it unquestionably contains much wit and argument, expressed in the
                    author’s best style of composition; and yet it is known to have been written
                    between eight o’clock on Wednesday night and twelve o’clock on the Thursday
                    night, when it was read to Mr Thrale upon his return from the House of Commons.
                    In 1771 he published another political pamphlet, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thoughts on the Late Transactions respecting Falkland’s Islands,</hi> in which
                    he attacked <hi rend="italic">Junius</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and he ever
                    afterwards delighted himself with the thought of having vanquished that able
                    writer, whom he certainly rivalled in nervous language and pointed ridicule.</p>
                <p>In 1773, he, in company with Mr Boswell, visited some of the most considerable of
                    the Hebrides or Western Islands of Scotland, and published an account of his
                    journey, in a volume which abounds in extensive philosophical views of society,
                    ingenious sentiments, and lively descriptions, but which offended many persons
                    by the vehement attack which it contained on the authenticity of the poems
                    attributed to Ossian. For the degree of offence that was taken, the book can
                    hardly be thought to contain a sufficient reason; and if the antiquity or
                    genuineness of these poems be yet doubted, this is owing more to the conduct of
                    their editor than to the violence of Johnson. In 1774&lt;, the parliament being
                    dissolved, he addressed to the electors of Great Britain a pamphlet, entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">The Patriot;</hi> of which the design was to guard them from
                    'imposition, and teach tham to distinguish true from false patriotism. In 1775
                    he published <hi rend="italic">Taxation no Tyranny, in Answer to the Resolutions
                    and Address of the American Congress.</hi> In this performance his admirer Mr
                    Boswell cannot, he says, perceive that ability of argument or felicity of
                    expression for which on other occasions Johnson was remarkable. This seems a
                    singular criticism. To the assumed principle upon which the reasoning of the
                    pamphlet rests many have objected, and perhaps their objections arc well
                    founded; but if it be admitted that “the supreme power of every community has
                    the right of requiring from all its subjects such contributions as are necessary
                    to the public safety or public prosperity,” it will be found a difficult task to
                    break the chain of argument by which it is proved that the British parliament
                    had a right to tax the Americans. As to the style of the pamphlet, the reader
                    who adopts the maxim recorded in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of a Tour to the
                    Hebrides,</hi> that a controversialist “ought not to strike soft in battle,”
                    must acknowledge that it is uncommonly happy, and that the whole performance is
                    one of the most brilliant as well as correct pieces of composition that ever
                    fell from the pen of its author. These essays drew upon him numerous attacks,
                    all of which he heartily despised; for though it has been supposed that a Letter
                    addressed to Dr Samuel Johnson occasioned by his Political Publications, gave
                    him great uneasiness, the contrary is manifest, from his having, after the
                    appearance of that letter, collected them into a volume under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Political Tracts by the Author of the Rambler.</hi> In 1765
                    Trinity College, Dublin, had created him doctor of laws by diploma; and he now
                    received the same honour from the University of Oxford, an honour with which,
                    though he did not boast of it, he was highly gratified. ∙ In 1777 he was
                    induced, by a case of an extraordinary nature, to exercise that humanity which
                    in him was obedient to every call. Dr William Dodd, a clergyman, under sentence
                    of death for the crime of forgery, found means to interest Johnson in his
                    behalf, and procured from him two of the most energetic compositions ever
                    written; the one being a petition from himself to the king, and the other a
                    similar address from his wife to the queen. But these petitions failed of
                    success. Lord Mansfield’s opinion was unfavourable to Dodd, and the reverend
                    forger underwent the last punishment of the law.</p>
                <p>The principal booksellers in London having determined to publish a body of
                    English poetry, Johnson was prevailed upon to write the lives of the poets, and
                    give a character of the works of each. This task he undertook with alacrity, and
                    upon the whole executed it in a manner worthy of his reputation. The work was
                    published in ten small volumes, of which the first four appeared in 1778, and
                    the others in 1781. Whilst the world in general was filled with admiration of
                    the great powers of the man who at the age of seventy-two, and labouring under a
                    complication of diseases, could produce a work which displays so much genius and
                    learning, there were narrow circles in which prejudice and resentment were
                    fostered, and whence attacks of different sorts issued against him. But these
                    gave him not the smallest disturbance. When told of the feeble though shrill
                    outcry that had been raised, he replied, “Sir, I considered myself as intrusted
                    with a certain portion of truth. I have given my opinion sincerely; let them
                    show where they think me wrong.”</p>
                <p>He had hardly begun to reap the laurels gained by this performance, when death
                    deprived him of Mr Thrale, in whose house he had enjoyed the most comfortable
                    hours of his life; but it abated not in Johnson that care for the interests of
                    those whom his friend had left behind him, and whom he thought himself bound to
                    cherish, in duty as one of the executors of his will, and in gratitude for the
                    kindness he had experienced at his hands. On this account, his visits to
                    Streatham, Mr Thrale’s villa, were for some time after his death regularly made
                    on Monday, and protracted till Saturday, as they had been during his life; but
                    they soon became less frequent, and at length he studiously avoided the mention
                    of the place or the family. Mrs Thrale, who ere long changed her name for that
                    of Mrs Piozzi, says, indeed, that “it grew extremely perplexing and difficult to
                    live in the house with him when the master of it was no more, because his
                    dislikes grew capricious, and he could scarce bear to have any body come to the
                    house whom it was absolutely necessary for her to see.” The person whom she
                    thought it most necessary for her to see may perhaps be guessed at without any
                    extraordinary share of sagacity; and if these were the visits which Johnson
                    could not bear, posterity, so far from thinking his dislikes capricious, though
                    they may have been perplexing, would, if he had acted otherwise, have blamed him
                    for the want of gratitude to the friend whose “face for fifteen years had never
                    been turned upon him but with respect or benignity.”</p>
                <p>About the middle of June 1783, his constitution sustained a severer shock than it
                    had ever before experienced, <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945589"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-5589-0599"/>from a stroke of the palsy, which was so sudden
                    and so violent, that it awakened him out of a sound sleep, and rendered him for
                    a short time speechless. As usual, he had recourse, under this affliction, to
                    piety, which in him was constant, sincere, and fervent. He tried to repeat the
                    Lord’s prayer, first in English, then in Latin, and afterwards in Greek; but
                    succeeded only in the last attempt, immediately after which he was again
                    deprived of the power of articulation. From this alarming attack he in a short
                    time recovered, but it left behind it presages of a dropsical affection; and he
                    was soon afterwards seized with a spasmodic asthma of such violence that he was
                    confined to the house in great pain, whilst his dropsy increased,
                    notwithstanding all the efforts of the most eminent physicians. He had, however,
                    such an interval of ease as enabled him, in the summer of 1784·, to visit his
                    friends at Oxford, Litchfield, and Ashbourne in Derbyshire. One day the Roman
                    Catholic religion being introduced as the topic of conversation when he was in
                    the house of Dr Adams, Johnson said, “If yôu join the Papists externally, they
                    will not interrogate you strictly as to your belief in their tenets. No
                    reasoning Papist believes every article of their faith. There is one side on
                    which a good man might be persuaded to embrace it. A good man of a timorous
                    disposition, in great doubt of his acceptance with God, and pretty credulous,
                    might be glad of a church where there are so many helps to go to heaven. I would
                    be a Papist if I could. I have fear enough; but an obstinate rationality
                    prevents me. I should never be a Papist unless on the near approach of death, of
                    which I have very great terror.” His constant dread of death was indeed so
                    great, that it astonished all who had access to know the piety of his mind and
                    the virtues of his life. Attempts have been made to account for it in various
                    ways; but that probably is the true account which is given by an elegant and
                    pious writer, in the <hi rend="italic">Olla Podrida.</hi> “That he should not be
                    conscious of the abilities with which Providence had blessed him was impossible.
                    He felt his own powers; he felt what he was capable of having performed; and he
                    saw how little, comparatively speaking, he had performed. Hence his apprehension
                    on the near prospect of the account to be made, viewed through the medium of
                    constitutional and morbid melancholy, which often excluded from his sight the
                    bright beams of divine mercy.” This, however, was the case only whilst death was
                    approaching from a distance. From the time that he was certain it was near, all
                    his fears were calmed; and he died on the 13th of December 1784, full of
                    resignation strengthened by faith, and joyful in hope.</p>
                <p>Dr Johnson was a man of herculean form of body, as well as of great powers of
                    mind. His stature was tall, his limbs were large, his strength was more than
                    common, and his activity in early life had been greater than such a form gave
                    reason to expect; but he was subject to an infirmity of the convulsive kind,
                    resembling the distemper called St Vitus’s dance; and he had the seeds of so
                    many diseases sown in his constitution, that a short time before his death he
                    declared that he hardly remembered to have passed one day wholly free from pain.
                    He possessed extraordinary powers of understanding, which were much cultivated
                    by reading, and still more by meditation and reflection. His memory was
                    retentive, his imagination vigorous, and his judgment penetrating. He read with
                    great rapidity, retained with wonderful exactness what he so easily collected,
                    and possessed the power of reducing to order and system the scattered hints on
                    any subject which he had gathered from different books. It would not be safe to
                    claim for him the highest place amongst his contemporaries in any single
                    department of literature; but he brought more mind to every subject, and had a
                    greater variety of knowledge ready for all occasions, than any other man that
                    could easily be named. Though prone to superstition, he was in other respects so
                    incredulous, that Hogarth observed, whilst Johnson firmly believed the Bible, he
                    seemed determined to believe nothing but the Bible. Of the importance of
                    religion he had a strong sense; his zeal for its interests was always awake,
                    whilst profaneness of every kind was abashed in his presence. The same energy
                    which he displayed in his literary productions, or even greater, was exhibited
                    also in his conversation, which was various, striking, and instructive. Like the
                    sage in Rasselas, he spoke, and attention watched his lips; be reasoned, and
                    conviction closed his period. When he pleased, he could be the greatest sophist
                    that ever contended in the lists of declamation; and perhaps no man ever
                    equalled him in nervous and pointed repartees. His veracity, from the most
                    trivial to the most solemn occasions, was strict even to severity. He scorned to
                    embellish a story with fictitious circumstances; for what is not a
                    representation of reality, he used to say, is not worthy of our attention. As
                    his purse and his house were ever open to the indigent, so was his heart tender
                    to those who wanted relief, and his soul susceptible of gratitude, and every
                    kind impression. He had a roughness in his manner which subdued the saucy and
                    terrified the meek; but it was only in his manner, for no man was more loved
                    than Johnson by those who knew him; and his works will be read with admiration
                    as long as the language in which they are written shall be understood.</p>
