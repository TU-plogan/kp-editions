                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Jury Trial.</hi> The method of trial by jury is one of the
                    most ancient of judicial institutions; so ancient, indeed, that its origin lies
                    beyond the commencement of authentic history amongst the nations of Europe,
                    particularly in the north. In the earliest of the Scandinavian <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192946252" xml:id="kp-eb0712-6252-0650"/>• histories, it is spoken of
                    or referred to as familiarly known. The oldest code of Iceland, composed in the
                    beginning of the tenth century, also treats of it as an existing institution;
                    and so also does the most ancient Norwegian code, the precise date of which has
                    not been ascertained. Kofod Ancher, a sagacious critic and eminent lawyer, does
                    not scruple to admit the authority of the Edda, from which it would appear that
                    Odin had introduced this method of trial into Scandinavia. But all that the Edda
                    says is, that Odin ordained the twelve Asagods to adjudge all causes in the
                    metropolis of Asgard. It is curious to observe, however, that the old juries
                    invariably consisted of twelve; a number which seems to characterise the
                    institution as one of high antiquity; for as the verdict was commonly given by
                    the majority, an uneven number would have been preferable, to avoid the
                    contingency of an equality of votes. Saxo informs us, that Ragnar Lodbrok, who,
                    according to Torfoeus, governed Denmark between the years 750 and 790, first
                    instituted trial by jury; but the authority of this monastic writer is not such
                    as to induce us to attach much importance to his statement. In fact, the Edda is
                    a much better historical authority than Saxo; and, according to that record,
                    trial by jury is several centuries older than the commencement of Ragnar
                    Lodbrok’s reign, in the year 750 of our era. But the precise antiquity of this
                    institution cannot now be determined. We find that it was in existence at the
                    earliest dawn of northern history, and spoken of as a mode of trial then
                    familiarly known; but beyond this all is conjecture. We can trace it as far back
                    as a thousand years; this is the farthest limit to which legal antiquaries have
                    carried their researches, the history of northern Europe, before that period,
                    being involved in Cimmerian darkness.</p>
                <p>It seems pretty certain, however, that, though trial by jury was early known in
                    Scandinavia, yet it was not so generally resorted to before the beginning of the
                    tenth century as afterwards. In these rude times, trial by battle often
                    superseded trial by jury. Men of rank, or in other words warriors, always
                    preferred it; they would have deemed it pusillanimous to submit any cause in
                    which they were concerned to the decision of a jury. The weak and the aged alone
                    claimed the benefit of this mode of trial; and women frequently appealed to it.
                    Even after it had become common, the trial by battle, when demanded with certain
                    legal formalities, was admitted in preference. In Scandinavia, however, this
                    species of trial is of pagan origin; that is, it was in use prior to the
                    introduction of Christianity into that northern region. But as the relations of
                    society multiplied, and differences increased both in number and nicety, the
                    inconvenience of such a mode of trial began to be felt. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >jus</hi><hi rend="italic">fortioris,</hi> barbarous in itself, had no powers of
                    adaptation. A man sometimes became involved in a new law-suit before he bad
                    recovered of his last wounds; some were prevented by the infirmity of age from
                    prosecuting a cause in itself just; others had no male relations to espouse it
                    for them; and a third class, though firmly convinced of the justice of their
                    cause, were as fully persuaded of the superior strength or dexterity of their
                    adversaries. Thus, the trial by battle became gradually unpopular; and hence,
                    when the Christian faith began to be generally received, it rapidly declined,
                    though without being entirely abolished.</p>
                <p>In this state of things trial by jury would, in all probability, have become
                    universal, if the clergy, who soon acquired great influence both with sovereigns
                    and subjects, had not introduced a new mode of deciding causes. This was the
                    Christian <hi rend="italic">ordeal,</hi> which was more the result of
                    circumstances than of any preconcerted design. The clergy had to preach a new
                    faith to people slow of belief; and, as the arguments which they advanced in
                    support of it were chiefly founded upon recorded or traditionary miracles, their
                    sceptical hearers naturally asked, “Show us one such miracle, and we will
                    believe.” The validity of this reasoning has always been admitted by the
                    Catholic clergy, who, accordingly, set about working miracles. Hence the origin
                    of the Christian ordeal, which agreed with the trial by battle in this, that it
                    was an appeal to heaven, though in a less rude and barbarous form. To a miracle
                    said to have been performed by Bishop Pappo in Jutland, where, according to the
                    legend, he put his hand in an iron glove red-hot, and withdrew it unhurt, is
                    attributed the introduction of this method of trial into Denmark. This is a
                    point which Ancher considers as established. But, whatever may have been the
                    occasion of introducing it, the clergy endeavoured to substitute for every other
                    kind of trial that which they called “the judgment of God ;” and from this
                    period the ordeal was frequently employed in all the countries of the north,
                    particularly in Denmark, and in that part of Sweden called Scancy or Scania. In
                    the code of laws still preserved, and known under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shaanshe Lov,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Lex Scanica,</hi> the crdeal of hot
                    iron is expressly ordered to be employed, particularly in cases of theft. This
                    mode of trial subsisted during two centuries and a half; but, though frequently
                    employed during that period, it was always regarded with suspicion and distrust
                    by the greater number of the laity. It afforded occasions for jugglery and
                    deception to which the most ignorant could scarcely be altogether blind. By a
                    little dexterity of management, the innocent might be condemned, and the guilty
                    suffered to escape.</p>
                <p>We have already seen that the insufficiency of the trial by battle was early
                    felt, and that, as society advanced, the law of the stronger fell into disuse.
                    The same fate likewise awaited the trial by ordeal, which, being substituted in
                    its stead, long retarded the adoption of trial by jury. But, whilst each of
                    these three modes struggled for pre-eminence, that by jury was always considered
                    as the most <hi rend="italic">normal</hi> or regular; and hence the appellation
                    of <hi rend="italic">law,</hi> which, in Denmark, was applied to a jury of a
                    particular description. The trial by battle, and the ordeals, were no doubt
                    recognised and admitted by the law; but every one felt that the trial by the
                    country was the only one to which the term <hi rend="italic">legal</hi> could
                    with propriety be applied. That form of trial was the <hi rend="italic">law,
                    κaτsξοχ</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> ι</hi><hi rend="italic">ην,</hi>
                    although the other forms were not contrary to the law; and this superior <hi
                    rend="italic">legality</hi> the ancients vindicated, in the strongest manner, by
                    the term they employed. Thus, in the history of the northern judicatories, we
                    recognise, first, the <hi rend="italic">trial by battle</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> secondly, the <hi rend="italic">trial by ordeal</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and, thirdly, the <hi rend="italic">trial by jury.</hi> This, however,
                    is to be considered only as the order of general usage or practice; for,
                    although some theorists have assumed that trial by battle is the most ancient
                    mode, there is sufficient evidence to prove that which we have already stated,
                    that amongst the northern nations trial by jury is at least of equal antiquity.
                    In fact, it cannot be said that the most ancient codes sanction any other form
                    of trial than that by jury. In none, not even in those of the tenth century, is
                    the trial by battle even mentioned; and very few have prescribed the ordeals,
                    which, being ecclesiastical inventions, must consequently be sought for chiefly
                    in the ecclesiastical codes. But all the ancient laws abound with references to
                    jury trial, and contain elaborate regulations respecting its form, applications,
                    contingencies, and uses. ∙ Hence it may, with some confidence, be concluded that
                    the trial by jury is the most ancient <hi rend="italic">strictly legal</hi> mode
                    of trial which obtained in the countries of the north.</p>
                <p>The time was when it would have been considered necessary to inquire whether any
                    enactment respecting jury trial occurs in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sachsenspiegel</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a code which, according to an
                    opinion once universal amongst jurists, had been <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192946265" xml:id="kp-eb0712-6265-0651"/>compiled in the time of
                    Charlemagne. But Couring, in his work De <hi rend="italic">Origine</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Juris</hi><hi rend="italic">Germanici,</hi> has demonstrated that
                    the Sachsenspiegel was compiled subsequently to the year 1230, though soon after
                    that period; and this is also the period to which a philologist, unaided by
                    history or jurisprudence, would refer that compilation. In fact, the
                    Sachsenspiegel itself contains evidence that it was composed after the council
                    of Lateran, held in the year 1215; for it mentions a prohibition against
                    matrimony in the fifth remove, which was first issued by that council under
                    Innocent IΠ., though the bull on the same subject was not published until 1230;
                    and hence it is probable that the Sachsenspiegel was not compiled until after
                    that year. But as jury trial had been introduced into Britain, and other
                    northern countries, long before this period, it follows that the authority of
                    the Sachsenspiegel (a crude collection of ancient customs, moral precepts,
                    legendary divinity, and nursery tales), is of no avail whatever in the present
                    question. Yet, even in this code, something may be found analogous to the
                    institution of jury trial, though, upon examination, it will be found difficult
                    to determine whether the mode of trial indicated in the Sachsenspiegel should
                    not be considered as <hi rend="italic">τvager of law,</hi> rather than trial by
                    jury in the strict acceptation of the terms.</p>
                <p>The case is quite different with respect to the ancient Saxon as well as Frisian
                    law, two codes (if that which may easily be printed on a sheet of paper deserves
                    the name of code) of high antiquity. The Saxon law is written in Latin, a
                    language unknown in Saxony before the time of Charlemagne. It was discovered in
                    the library of Fulda, and first edited at Basil by John Herald, in the year
                    1557. It is a Christian code, addressed to the Saxons, over whom the ancestors
                    of Charlemagne had no authority, and with whom they had little or no
                    intercourse. Spelman (see his Glossary under the term <hi rend="italic">Lex
                    Saxonurn)</hi> attributes this code to Harald Bluetooth, king of Denmark, who
                    reigned about the middle of the tenth century; and in this opinion he is
                    supported by Adam of Bremen, Helmold, and Albert. But are the laws which Harald
                    gave to the Transalbians and Frisians identical with the <hi rend="italic">Leges
                    Saxonum</hi> of Fulda, and with the Frisian laws which Siccama edited? We cannot
                    say that this is certain; but it is at least highly probable, and such
                    undoubtedly was the opinion of Spelman. Mr T. G. Repp, who has discussed this
                    subject with much learning and ability, sums up his reasoning by stating that
                    the <hi rend="italic">Capitularia</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Leges</hi>
                    could not emanate from the same legislator; that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Capitularia</hi> are justly attributed to Charlemagne, who could not,
                    therefore, be the author of the <hi rend="italic">Leges</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> that, as the <hi rend="italic">Leges</hi> abrogate an enactment of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Capitularia,</hi> the former are consequently of more recent
                    date; and that, as there is only a question as to two legislators, if
                    Charlemagne be not the author, the <hi rend="italic">Leges</hi> must he ascribed
                    to Harald.</p>
                <p>From these codes, if they may be called such, we find that the Saxons had no
                    juries in the strict modern acceptation of the term. They had only <hi
                    rend="italic">wagers of law.</hi> A man, when accused of a crime, either paid a
                    certain fine, or, if he wished to establish his innocence, he convened a certain
                    number of persons, before whom he cleared himself by oath of the crime with
                    which he was charged. From the words used in the Saxon and Frisian law, it is
                    not clear in what manner the <hi rend="italic">conjuratores</hi> were bound to
                    swear; but it seems probable that they only affirmed upon oath their belief that
                    the accused was innocent. The number of the <hi rend="italic">conjuratores</hi>
                    varied according to the magnitude of the crime; and the fine, in case the
                    accused tailed to prove his innocence, varied in the same ratio. For crimes of
                    the least aggravated kind only three compurgators were required; for those of a
                    more heinous character six were necessary; and for such as were marked by
                    peculiar atrocity, eleven, the accused himself being the twelfth. Lut there were
                    some crimes for which no fine was deemed a sufficient expiation; and in these
                    cases no wager of law is mentioned, because it was not allowed. From the nature
                    and constitution of this mode of expurgation, it is obvious that unanimity was
                    indispensable. This seems to be implied in the words <hi rend="italic"
                    >Undecima</hi><hi rend="italic">manu</hi><hi rend="italic">jurat;</hi> nor could
                    it well be otherwise, seeing that the accused chose his own jurors or
                    compurgators.</p>
                <p>Although Norway derived from Sweden the stock of its actual population, and the
                    first seeds of civilization, yet, strangely enough, there are preserved
                    Norwegian codes of higher antiquity than any now extant in Sweden. The history
                    of Norwegian law has been divided into three periods; the first commencing in
                    the reign of Hakon Athelstane, about the year 940; the second in the reign of
                    Magnus, about 1274; and the third in 1397, at the union of Calmar. During all
                    these periods, the trial by jury was more or less used, and invariably
                    prescribed by law. In the first and second periods its use was universal,
                    scarcely any cause of importance being decided without the intervention of a
                    jury; but in the second period, the authority of the jury was modified by the
                    judges acquiring greater authority in every judicial decision, and exercising,
                    as they still do, an influence on the verdict; and, during the third, this
                    authority and influence increased so greatly, that, by the end of the
                    seventeenth century, the functions of the jury had become almost nominal, and,
                    in many cases, were entirely superseded. The constitution of Norwegian juries is
                    clearly explained in Lagaboetir’s amended Law of Gulathing (b. i. c. 2 and 3),
                    promulgated by King Magnus; <hi rend="italic">thing,</hi> in the Scandinavian
                    countries, signifying an assembly of the deputies of the people. The Logman or
                    Lawman presided, and his function originally was to recite the laws of the land,
                    which he knew by heart; but after the promulgation of King Magnus’s code, he had
                    only to state the king’s written law, to interpret it, and to point out the
                    portion which applied to each particular case. It is not certain by whom,
                    practically, juries were most frequently selected; but, from the northern codes,
                    it appears that they might be chosen, first, by the deputies from their own
                    number; secondly, by the lawman; thirdly, by the officers of the crown; and,
                    lastly, by the parties themselves. It seems prqþable, however, that in Norway,
                    juries were commonly chosen by the deputies. In the old Saxon, Danish, and
                    Icelandic laws, a simple majority of the jury decided finally, and without
                    appeal, in every case brought before them. But Magnus, in the event of a
                    difference of opinion, gave the power of decision, not to the majority, but to
                    the lawman along with the minority; reserving to himself the privilege of
                    reversing their verdict, in the last resort, and, if he so pleased, affirming
                    the deliverance of the majority. Further, by the code of this prince, the lawman
                    was for the first time constituted a judge; the judicial authority of the crown
                    was extended; unanimity was not insisted on, any more than in other Scandinavian
                    laws; the king was virtually constituted supreme judge; and it was-provided,
                    that in all cases where the law did not decide, that was to be considered as the
                    law which the jurors agreed upon.</p>
                <p>We find jury trial described in the ancient codes of Sweden, a country where the
                    regulations respecting it are in some instances stricter and more detailed than
                    in Norway, where this institution has been more fully developed for the trial of
                    every description of causes, and wĥere, also, it has longer subsisted in full
                    force. There were several kinds or species of jury in Sweden, viz the Lawman’s,
                    the Bishop’s, and the Hundred’s jury; but in all, the decision of the majority
                    was final. The circumstances and ceremonies attending the election of jurors,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:192946278" xml:id="kp-eb0712-6278-0652"/>the
                    qualifications which rendered them eligible, the parties who elected them, the
                    oath which they took before proceeding to try a case, and the validity of their
                    deliverance or verdict, together with the functions of the lawman, will all be
                    found stated and explained in Mr Repp’s very curious book, to which the reader
                    is referred. The king’s jury consisted of twelve, and constituted a species of
                    appeal court; it took cognisance of all offences against the public law of the
                    state calculated to disturb or molest the people; and its decision was in every
                    case final. No servant could be a juror; they required to be men having a fixed
                    residence; and persons of infamous character or lawless habits were also
                    excluded. The absence of a juror subjected the absentee to a heavy fine. Causes
                    of every description appear to have been tried by Swedish juries. Important
                    questions of property, as well as criminal cases of every kind, were referred to
                    their decision; they formed a sort of mixed tribunal, by which the law as well
                    as the fact was determined; and, in particular circumstances, they acted as a
                    court of review, as in the case of the king’s jury on the Landsthing, before
                    which causes o. great importance came ultimately for decision. In fact, the only
                    limitation (if limitation it maybe called) in the authority of the jury to judge
                    and decide, consisted in this, that cases of minor importance which occurred
                    between terms, were adjudicated by the magistrate or the lawman, whilst all
                    causes of moment were reserved for the cognisance of the jury.</p>
                <p>The subject of Danish juries has been ably treated by Peter Kofod Ancher, for
                    many years professor of the civil law in the university of Copenhagen, a writer
                    who, in his <hi rend="italic">Dansh Lovhistorie</hi> (Copenhagen, 1769-1776, in
                    2 vols. 4to), has surveyed ancient judicial institutions with a scrutinising
                    eye. Ancher is by no means an admirer of this form of trial; but, as he is a
                    conscientious and critical historian, he takes pains to place every fact in its
                    true light, without reference to his own particular views or opinions. According
                    to him, there were four kinds of persons employed in the ancient courts of
                    Denmark to adjudicate causes; and these were either regular jurors, or <hi
                    rend="italic">conjuratores</hi> in a wager of law, or persons who, from the
                    principles on which they were nominated, resembled these. He then proceeds to
                    consider each of the four classes separately, viz. first, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tingmaend</hi> or Thingmen, that is, those who frequent a Thing, or are
                    enjoined by law to be present at it; secondly, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Naevningcr,</hi> or regular juries, an institution of very high antiquity in
                    Denmark; thirdly, the <hi rend="italic">Sandemcend</hi> or Truthsmen, who were
                    employed for deciding important causes, and took cognisance of homicide, cutting
                    and maiming, rape, armed aggression, disputes respectingboundaries, and
                    questions in which church property was concerned; and, lastly, the Wager of Law
                    in Denmark. For ample details under each of these heads, we refer to Anchor’s
                    work above mentioned, and also to the distinct and satisfactory abridgment of
                    his investigations, given by Mr Repp in his book on Ancient Juries. It is
                    sufficient to state here, that in Denmark trial by jury was not resorted to
                    excepting in causes of importance, and that particular care was taken that none
                    but good and impartial men should be chosen as jurors. They were selected from
                    the inhabitants of a district generally; no friend or relative of the parties
                    could be chosen; and they required to be men of substance, “three-marks-men,”
                    who could pay a compensation to the injured party, in case they found a wrong
                    verdict. The number of Danish jurors was originally twelve, a number common to
                    all the northern countries; but, at subsequent periods, the law of Denmark in
                    this respect was somewhat changed. In Scania the jurors were twelve, but the
                    accused was permitted to challenge three; and the Scanian law provided that the
                    prosecutor should either nominate fifteen, or that, if three were challenged, he
                    should pray a <hi rend="italic">tales</hi> to complete the number twelve. The
                    Jutland law, chary of numbers, provided that there should only be eight jurors
                    in each hundred, or two in each quarter; but <hi rend="italic">kindred
                    jury,</hi> as it was called, consisted of twelve, as well as juries which took
                    cognisance of forgery, arson, and highway robbery. By the law of Erik, the
                    number of jurors in the more important class of cases was <hi rend="italic"
                    >thirteen,</hi> and in the less important <hi rend="italic">seven,</hi> that is,
                    twelve, and the half of twelve, with one additional to secure a majority. In
                    fact, the basis of all the numbers of jurors is the number twelve. In Denmark,
                    as in Sweden and in Iceland, the cause was decided by the suffrages of the
                    majority of the jurors impannelled in each case.</p>
                <p>From these historical notices, it appears that trial by jury, in one or other of
                    the various forms under which it is found, was not only of great antiquity
                    amongst the northern nations, but employed to an extent of which, in this
                    country, we have hitherto had no adequate conception. Nor can it be doubted
                    that, for the institution which we now justly regard as the palladium of
                    liberty, and one of the best safeguards against the arbitrary abuse of power,
                    and which time and experience have enabled us to adapt to a more advanced state
                    of society, we are indebted to those nations which we are perhaps a little too
                    prone to undervalue, and which, even at a period of comparative barbarism,
                    seemed to have fully divined the benefits which might accrue from this mode of
                    deciding causes, whether civil or criminal. For accounts of the origin,
                    progress, and improvement of jury trial in our own country, we must refer the
                    reader generally to its history, and, in a particular manner, to the different
                    institutional writers. (See Repp’s <hi rend="italic">Historical Treatise on
