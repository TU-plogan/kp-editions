                    district of Hindustan, in the province of Allahabad, included principally
                    between the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth degrees of north latitude. It is
                    situated between the river Gogra on the east, and the Ganges on the south; to
                    the north it is bounded by the Gogra and part of Oude; and on the west it has
                    the nabob of Oude’s territories. It is well watered, and extremely fertile; and
                    the soil is under good cultivation, and well covered with wood. The inhabitants
                    are Mahommedans and Hindus, in nearly equal proportions. Of the Hindus there was
                    one tribe amongst whom the practice of female infanticide greatly prevailed;
                    but, by the humane influence of the British government, it has been in a great
                    measure abolished. This district came into the possession of the British in
                    1775, as forming part of the Benares zemindary. The principal towns are
                    Jionpoor, Gazypoor, and Azimgar.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Jionpoor,</hi> the chief town in the above district, and
                    formerly the capital of an independent principality. It is situated upon the
                    banks of the Goomty. The fort, which is built of solid stone-work, was rounded
                    in 1370, by Sultan Feroze III. of Delhi, and named after his uncle and
                    predecessor, whose name was Joana. He ordered a Hindu temple to be levelled, and
                    erected the fort around the ruins of it. After his return to the capital, he
                    collected numerous artificers, and persons of every description, and sent them
                    to inhabit the new city, which was completed in twelve years. On the subversion
                    of the empire of Delhi by Timour or Tamerlane, Khuaje Jehan, a governor of the
                    eastern districts, assumed the royal dignity, and he made Jionpoor his capital.
                    He was succeeded in 1399 by his son Moba-rik Shah, whose successor was Sultan
                    Ibrahim. During his prosperous reign of forty years he spared no expense to
                    strengthen and improve the fortress and city, and Jionpoor became one of the
                    most celebrated cities of Hindustan, famed for religion and learning. J ionpoor
                    was again annexed to the empire of Delhi in the year 1478, when the reigning
                    prince was overthrown. Many of the mosques, and some of the caravanserais and
                    colleges built at that period, are still in existence. The fortress is built
                    upon a high bank of the river Goomty, so named from its meandering course. It is
                    built of solid stone, and rises considerably above the level of the surrounding
                    country. It was frequently taken in the contests between the Afghans and the
                    Moguls, and much dilapidated; but about the year 1570 it was thoroughly repaired
                    by a nobleman from the court of Akbar, who was governor of Bengal. It was also
                    during his time that the celebrated bridge of Jionpoor was built, which has now
                    stood 250 years, and still remains a monument of ancient magnificence and of
                    architectural skill. In 1773, when this bridge was submerged during the rainy
                    season, a brigade of British troops sailed over it. Such is the strength and
                    solid construction of this bridge, that it suffered no damage from the violence
                    of the current. The town surrounds the fort on three sides, and contains a good
                    bazar and a number of brick houses. The surrounding country for several miles is
                    covered with the ruins of tombs and mosques. Of the latter there are several in
                    a good state of repair, namely, the Jamai Musjed, which is very handsome, and is
                    built of stone. The travelling distance from Benares is forty-two miles, and
                    from Lucknow 147 miles. Long. 82. 39. E. Lat. 25. 45. N.</p>
