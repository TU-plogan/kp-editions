                <p><label type="entry">JEWEL</label>, any precious stone, or ornament set with
                    precious stones.</p>
                <p>Jewels formed part of the ornaments with which the Jews, Greeks, and Romans,
                    especially their ladies of distinction, adorned themselves. So great was the
                    extravagance of the Roman ladies in this respect, that Pliny the Elder says he
                    saw Lollia Paulina with an equipage of this kind, amounting, according to Dr
                    Arbuthnot’s calculation, to L.322,9l6. Í3s. 4d. of our money. It is worthy of
                    observation, that precious stones amongst the Romans, and all the ancients, were
                    much scarcer, dearer, and consequently in higher estimation, than amongst us,
                    since a commerce was opened with the Indies. The ancients did not know how to
                    cut and polish them to much perfection; but coloured stones were not scarce, and
                    they cut them very well either hollow or in relief. When luxury had gained
                    ground amongst them, the Romans hung pendants and pearls in their ears; and for
                    this purpose the ears of both sexes were frequently bored. See <hi

                    >John,</hi> a learned English divine, was born in the year 1522, and educated at
                    Oxford. In 1540, having been created bachelor of arts, he became a noted tutor,
                    and was soon afterwards chosen rhetorical lecturer in his college. In February
                    1544, he took his degree as master of arts. Having early imbibed protestant
                    principles, he inculcated the same on his pupils; but this was carried on
                    privately till the accession of Edward VI. in 1546, when he made a public
                    declaration of his faith, and entered into a close friendship with Peter Martyr,
                    then professor of divinity at Oxford. In 1550, he took the degree of bachelor of
                    divinity, and frequently preached with great applause before the university. At
                    the same time he preached and catechised every alternate Sunday, at Sunningwell
                    in Berkshire, of which place he was rector. Upon the accession of Queen Mary in
                    1553, he was one of the first who felt the effects of the storm then raised
                    against the Reformation; for, before any law was made, or order given by the
                    queen, he was expelled from Corpus Christi College by the fellows, of their own
                    private authority; but he continued in Oxford till he was called upon, under the
                    severest penalties, to subscribe to some of the Catholic doctrines, a call which
                    he submitted to. However, this did not secure his safety, for he was obliged to
                    fly; and, after encountering many difficulties, he arrived, in the second year
                    of Mary’s reign, at Frankfort, where he made a public recantation of his
                    subscription to the Catholic doctrines. He then went to Strasburg, and
                    afterwards to Zurich, where he attended Peter Martyr, in whose house he resided.
                    He returned to England in 1558, after Queen Mary’s death; and, in 1559, was
                    consecrated Bishop of Salisbury. This promotion was conferred upon him as a
                    reward for his great merit and learning; and another attestation was given him
                    by the university of Oxford, which, in 1565, conferred upon him in his absence
                    the degree of doctor in divinity. In this character he attended the queen to
                    Oxford the following year, and presided at the theological disputations held
                    before her majesty on that occasion. He had before distinguished himself by a
                    sermon preached at St Paul’s cross, in which he gave a public challenge to all
                    the Roman Catholics in the world to produce but one clear and evident testimony,
                    out of any father or famous writer who flourished within six centuries after
                    Christ, for any one of the articles which the Romanists maintain against the
                    church of England; and, two years afterwards, he published his famous Apology
                    for this church. In the mean time, he paid particular attention to his diocese,
                    where, in his visitations, he began, and at length perfected, such a
                    reformation, not only in his cathedral and parochial churches, but in all the
                    churches within his jurisdiction, as procured him and the whole order of bishops
                    due reverence and esteem. He was a careful and strict observer, not only of all
                    the flocks, but also of the pastors, in his diocese; and he watched so narrowly
                    the proceedings of his chancellor and archdeacons, and of his stewards and
                    receivers, that they had no opportunities of committing oppression, injustice,
                    or extortion, nor of being a burden to the people, or a scandal to himself.
                    Amidst these employments, however, he neglected the care of his health, to
                    which, indeed, his general course of life was unfavourable. He rose at four
                    o’clock in the morning; and, after prayers with his family at five, and in the
                    cathedral about six, he applied so intensely to his studies all the morning,
                    that he could not without difficulty be drawn from them. After dinner his doors
                    and ears were open to all suitors; and it was observed of him, as of Titus, that
                    he never sent any away sorrowful. About nine at night he called all his servants
                    to an account of how they had spent the day, and he went to prayers with them.
                    From the chapel lie withdrew again to his study till near midnight, and thence
                    retired to bed, when the gentleman, of his bed-chamber read to him till he fell
                    asleep. This watchful and laborious life, without any recreation at all, except
                    what his necessary refreshment at meals and a very few hours of rest afforded
                    him, soon wasted his life. He died at Monkton-Farley, in 1571, in the fiftieth
                    year of his age. He was the author of, LA View of a Seditious Bull sent into
                    England by Pope Pius V. in 1569; 2. A Treatise on the Holy Scriptures; 3. An
                    Exposition of St Paul’s two Epistles to the Thessalonians; 4. A Treatise on the
                    Sacrament; 5. An Apology for the National Church; 6. Several sermons,
                    controversial treatises, and other works. Bishop Jewel was one of the great
                    champions of the reformed religion, and was to the church of England what
                    Bellarmine was to that of Rome. His Apology was translated by Anne, the second
                    of the four learned daughters of Sir Anthony Coke, and mother of Sir Francis
                    Bacon. It was published, as it came from her pen, in 1564, with the approbation
                    of the queen and the prelates. The same Apology was printed in Greek at
                    Constantinople, under the direction of St Cyril the patriarch. His defence of
                    his Apology, against Harding and other Catholic divines, was held in such
                    esteem, that Queen Elizabeth, King James I. King Charles I. and four successive
                    archbishops,· ordered it to be kept chained in all parish churches for public
                    use.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Jewel</hi><hi rend="italic">Blocks,</hi> in nautical
                    language, a name given to two small blocks suspended at the extremities of the
                    main and fore top-sail yards, by means of an eye-bolt driven from without into
                    the middle of the yard-arm, parallel to its axis. The use of these blocks is to
                    retain the upper part of the top-mast studding-sails beyond the skirts of the
                    top-sails, so that each of those sails may have its full force of action, which
                    would be diminished by the encroachment of the other over its surface. The
                    halyards, by which these studding-sails are hoisted, are accordingly passed
                    through the jewel-blocks, whence, communicating with a block on the top-mast
                    head, they lead downwards to the top or decks, where they may be conveniently
                    hoisted.</p>
