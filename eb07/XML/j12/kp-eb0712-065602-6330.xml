                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">JUSTINIAN</label>, the first Roman emperor of his name, and
                    more celebrated for his code of laws than for the military achievements which
                    distinguished his reign, was nephew of Justin I. and succeeded to the imperial
                    purple on the death of his uncle in 527. He began his reign with the character
                    of being a religious prince; and having published severe laws against heretics,
                    and repaired ruined places of worship, he openly declared himself the protector
                    of the church. But whilst thus engaged in re-establishing Christianity at home,
                    he carried his arms against the enemies of the empire abroad, and, through his
                    generals, proved so successful, that he in some measure reinstated it in its
                    ancient glory. By means of Belisarius, the greatest captain of his age, the
                    Persians were conquered, and the Vandals exterminated; Africa was regained; the
                    Goths in Italy were subdued; the Moors were defeated; and the Roman empire was
                    restored almost to its primitive glory. But, in the midst of these successes,
                    the Emperor was endangered by a powerful faction at home; Hypalius, Pompeius,
                    and Probus, nephews of the Emperor Anastasius, the immediate predecessor of
                    Justin, raised an insurrection to dethrone him, and it required all the energy
                    of Belisarius, seconded by Mundus, to put down the rebellion. This, however, was
                    at length effected; the conspiracy was broken, and the ringleaders were
                    capitally punished. The empire being now in the full enjoyment of profound peace
                    and tranquillity, Justinian made the best use of it, by collecting the immense
                    variety and number of the Roman laws into one body. To this end he selected ten
                    of the most able lawyers in the empire, who, having revised the Gregorian,
                    Theodosian, and Hermogenian codes, compiled one body, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Codex</hi><hi rend="italic">Justinianus.</hi> This may be called the statute
                    law, as consisting of the rescripts of the emperors. But the reduction of the
                    other part was a much more difficult task. It was made up of the deci-· sions of
                    the judges and other magistrates, together with the authoritative opinions of
                    the most eminent lawyers, all which lay scattered, without any order, in no less
                    than two thousand volumes. These were reduced to the number of fifty books; but
                    ten years were spent in the reduction. The design was completed in the year 553,
                    and the name of <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pandects</hi>
                    given to it. Besides these, for the use chiefly of young students in the law,
                    and to facilitate that study, Justinian ordered four books of Institutes to be
                    drawn up, containing an abstract or abridgment of the text of all the laws; and,
                    lastly, the laws of a date posterior to that of the former were, in the year
                    541, thrown into one volume, called the <hi rend="italic">Novelloe,</hi> or New
                    Constitutions. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Civil Law.</hi></p>
                <p>This transaction has immortalised the name of Justinian, who, in other respects,
                    was neither a great nor a good man, and whose name was held in abhorrence by the
                    people, partly on account of his rash and inconsiderate conduct in
                    ecclesiastical matters, but still more by reason of the heavy burdens which he
                    imposed on them. He died suddenly in 565, after a reign of thirty-nine years, at
                    the advanced age of eighty-three. Justinian built a great number of churches,
                    particularly the famous St Sophia at Constantinople, which is esteemed a
                    masterpiece of architectural design.</p>
