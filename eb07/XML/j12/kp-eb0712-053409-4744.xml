                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">JEDBURGH</label>, a royal burgh, the seat of a presbytery,
                    and the capital of a parish of the same name, as well as the county town or
                    Roxburghshire in Scotland. It is beautifully situated in the romantic valley of
                    the Jed, on the left bank of that stream, environed with sylvan banks, and
                    embosomed in venerable orchards. This town is of very ancient date, and the name
                    appears to have been at a former period indiscriminately written Gedworde,
                    Jedworth, Jed-wood, Jeddart (still in use amongst the common people), and
                    Jedburgh. The name of the river being anciently written Ged, and perhaps Gad,
                    has afforded an opportunity for antiquaries conjecturing that this parish was
                    the principal seat of the Gadeni, a tribe who inhabited the district between the
                    river Teviot and Northumberland. In the twelfth century David I. founded a
                    monastery here, which greatly enhanced the importance of the town. From the
                    antique choir which remains, in a dilapidated state, some have been led to
                    suppose that a sacred edifice existed on the same site prior to the time of
                    David I., and that the venerable ruin, which still attracts much attention, was
                    not founded, but only rebuilt, by that munificent monarch. He also gave to the
                    canons the chapel of Scarsburgh, lying in a recess of the forest, to the east of
                    the Jed; and at a later period the dependencies of Restennet in Angus, and
                    Cannoby in Dumfriesshire, came into the possession of the monastery. The
                    importance of the town was still further secured by the erection of a castle;
                    but by whom it was founded is not known. It was a royal residence, and for ages
                    continued a place of great strength, the object of eager dispute to the
                    contending kingdoms. It was frequently honoured with the presence of the
                    Scottish monarchs, and was the scene of the royal festivities of Alexander III.
                    on the occasion of his second marriage. After the fifteenth century, the town is
                    frequently mentioned in the history of the wars between the Scotch and English.
                    It was burned by the Earl of Surrey in 1523, at which period it appears to have
                    been a very considerable town; for Surrey, in his despatches to Henry VIII.
                    says, that “there was two times more houses therein than in Berwick, and well
                    builded, with many honest and fair houses in garrison, and six good towers
                    therein.” The same writer also extols, in no measured terms, the warlike
                    character and bravery of the men of Jedburgh. Their favourite weapon was the
                    Jedwoöd axe; and their war-cry or slogan, “Jedworth’s here.” But an account of
                    the various battles and skirmishes in which they distinguished themselves
                    belongs rather to the history of the county, than to a description of the town.
                    At the present day, Jedburgh has four principal streets, crossing each other at
                    right angles, and terminating in a square or market-place. They are wide and
                    clean, and the houses are well built. In recent times the town has been
                    generally improved, and many elegant, if not spacious buildings have been
                    erected. It contains numerous handsome shops, in which all the necessaries and
                    most of the luxuries of life can be readily obtained. It is celebrated for the
                    production of excellent bread, which is exported in great quantities to the
                    north of England, as well as to the surrounding villages of the county. It is
                    entitled to hold two markets every week, on Tuesday and Saturday. The Tuesday’s
                    market is well attended, and grain is then sold by sample to a considerable
                    extent. There are two banks in Jedburgh, branches of the British Linen Company
                    and of the National Bank. Besides the established church, Jedburgh contains
                    several meeting houses for dissenters, who are here a numerous body. The
                    principal manufactures are blankets, flannels, tartans, shawls, shepherds’
                    plaidings, hosiery, lamb’s-wool yarn, and carpets; and the town also derives
                    part of its income from fruit, which is produced in considerable quantities in
                    private gardens. There is here an excellent grammar and English school, united
                    in 1804, several subscription libraries, a savings bank for the district, a
                    dispensary, one or two religious societies, and there are letter-press printers
                    in the town. An establishment for making printing presses, on a new principle of
                    construction, has likewise been or considerable benefit to Jedburgh. It is
                    governed by a council, consisting of a provost, four bailies, a dean of guild,
                    and eighteen ordinary councillors. There are eight incor porated trades, who
                    annually elect their own deacons and office-bearers, and four of these deacons
                    are admitted into the council to represent the trades for the year. Jedburgh
                    unites with Haddington, North Berwick, Lauder, and Dunbar, in sending a member
                    to parliament. The revenue of the burgh amounts at present to L.573 per annum,
                    being chiefly derived from the rent of the mills. Jedburgh is forty-six miles
                    south of Edinburgh, ten west of Kelso, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944757"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4757-0535"/>twelve north of the borders of England. The
                    population of the burgh amounted in 1821 to 2500, and in 1831 to 3709.</p>
