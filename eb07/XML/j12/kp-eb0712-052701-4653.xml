                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> large and fertile island belongs to the group
                    which modern geographers denominate the Sunda Islands. It extends eastward, with
                    a slight deviation on the south, from 105. 11. to 114. 33. of east longitude
                    from Greenwich, and lies between the latitudes of 5. 52. and 8. 46. south. It is
                    in length, between Java Head and the south-east point of the island, 666 statute
                    miles; and its breadth varies from 135⅛ miles, between the south-west point of
                    Pachitan Bay and the north point of Japara, to fifty-six miles, between the
                    mouth of the Serayu River and the Marabaya. Its area is estimated at 50,000
                    miles. On the south and west it is washed by the Indian Ocean; to the north-west
                    by a strait called the Straits of Sunda, which separates it from the island of
                    Sumatra at a distance, at the narrowest point, of only fourteen miles; and on
                    the south-east by the Straits of Bali, only two miles wide, which divide it from
                    the island of that name. These islands, and others stretching eastward, form
                    with Java a gentle curve of more than 2000 geographical miles. From the eastern
                    peninsula of India, Java is distant 140 leagues, from Borneo about fifty-six
                    leagues, and from New Holland 200.</p>
                <p>The island of Java is of a rectangular form, so that if it were divided into five
                    or six parts, each would form a parallelogram. It is extremely diversified on
                    its surface. An uninterrupted range of lofty mountains, varying in elevation
                    from 5000 to 11,000 and even 12,000 feet above the level of the sea, and
                    exhibiting in their round bases or pointed tops their volcanic origin, extends
                    almost east and west through the whole length of the island. They rise to their
                    greatest elevations towards the centre, which is much broken. The tops of these
                    mountains were formerly the craters of volcanoes, which are now extinguished,
                    though many of them emit smoke after heavy rains. From this great chain other
                    innumerable ranges of hills of inferior height run in various directions, and
                    serve to form and confine plains and valleys of different elevations and extent.
                    These mountainous regions present all the most romantic and highly diversified
                    scenery which is to be found amid waving forests, never-failing streams, and
                    constant verdure, heightened by a pure atmosphere, and the glowing tints of a
                    tropical sun. The aspect of the northern coast is low, in many places swampy,
                    and overgrown with mangrove trees and bushes, particularly towards the west. But
                    in advancing five miles inland a sensible improvement is experienced in the
                    atmosphere and climate. Every step in advance leads to a purer air and a
                    brighter scene. Here, amid the mountains, are found elevated and fertile plains,
                    the seat of industry and skilful cultivation. “Here,” says Sir Stamford Raffles,
                    “stupendous mountains are clothed with abundant harvests, impetuous cataracts
                    tamed to the peasant’s will. Here is perpetual verdure; here are tints of the
                    brightest hue. In the hottest season the air retains its freshness, in the
                    driest the innumerable rills and rivulets preserve much of their water. This the
                    mountain farmer directs in endless conduits and canals, to irrigate the land,
                    which he has laid out in terraces for its reception; it then descends to the
                    plains, and spreads fertility wherever it flows, till at last, by numerous
                    outlets, it discharges itself into the sea.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Raffles, vol. i. p. 24.</p></note> The principal harbour is that of Sourabaya,
                    in the eastern districts, formed by the approaching extremities of Java and
                    Madura, which is broad and spacious, and secure against the violence of the sea
                    and the wind. The next in importance is that of Batavia, more properly the roads
                    of Batavia, which <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944666"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4666-0528"/>are sheltered by several islands lying in the
                    outer part of the bay. There are other positions along the northern coast which
                    might be improved into convenient harbours, though the whole coast affords
                    excellent anchorage at moderate depths during nearly all seasons of the year. In
                    the smooth sea and moderate weather which usually prevail, the native vessels
                    and small craft always find sufficient shelter at the change of the monsoon,
                    when it is dangerous to anchor on the coast, by running for shelter under some
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the islands which are scattered in those seas, or
                    passing up the rivers, which, though presenting a difficult entrance, from the
                    mud banks, that form a bar at their mouth, are mostly navigable for small
                    vessels as far up as the maritime capitals through which they run. The south
                    coast, which rises into high and rugged cliffs, is inaccessible, with the
                    exception of a few bays, on account of its exposure to the open sea, and the
                    violent surf which in consequence dashes against it.</p>
                <p>From the mountains of Java numerous streams pour down into the plains. There is
                    no space, indeed, for the formation of large rivers. But there are probably no
                    less than fifty which in the wet season bear down rafts of timber and other
                    rough produce of the country, and not less than five or six at all times
                    navigable to the distance of some miles from the coast; and those which are
                    useful to the agriculturist for the irrigation of the lands cannot be numbered.
                    The principal rivers are the Solo, the largest in the island, which discharges
                    itself on the north side by two principal outlets into the sea near Gressek, and
                    by which the produce of an extensive country is carried down in flat-bottomed
                    boats to the sea. The river of Sourabaya, which is the second in magnitude,
                    falls into the sea by five outlets near Sourabaya. There are several smaller
                    rivers in these eastern districts, which fall into the ocean on the northern
                    shore, and which are highly useful for the conveyance of teak timber from the
                    interior forests to the coast; or which, being directed into canals, tend to
                    improve the inland navigation of the country. Towards the west, the principal
                    rivers which fall into the sea on the northern coast are the Chikandi, the
                    Chidani, the Chi-taram, and the Chimanok. Those which discharge themselves by
                    the south coast are the Chimandiri, which falls into the sea at Wyn-Coop’s Bay,
                    the Chitandui, the Serayu, and others. Along the northern coast almost every
                    district has its principal river, but they have all the disadvantage of being
                    blocked up at their entrance by the accumulation of mud banks, an evil which is
                    increasing with the extension of agriculture, from the quantity of soil
                    necessarily washed down in the process of irrigating the land for the
                    cultivation of rice. Java contains no lakes of any considerable size, though
                    there are several very beautiful lakes of small dimensions among the hills, many
                    of which are the craters of extinguished volcanoes. There are also extensive
                    swamps, which, though they are filled with water during the wet season, are for
                    the rest of the year dried up or choked by vegetation.</p>
                <p>Java possesses a soil that is extremely rich, and remarkable for its depth,
                    owing, as Sir Stamford Raffles conjectures, to the exclusively volcanic
                    constitution of the country, and the quantity of new mould that is constantly
                    washed down the sides of its mountains. The best soil resembles the richest
                    garden mould in Europe. The seasons, as in all tropical countries, are
                    distinguished into wet and dry, and depend on the periodical winds, or the
                    monsoons. The west monsoon, which brings on the annual rains, begins in October,
                    and becomes more steady in November and December; it continues till the latter
                    end of February or the beginning of March. It often blows with great violence,
                    and is accompanied with heavy rains, which renders this the most unhealthy
                    season. The month of April ushers in the easterly winds and fair weather, which
                    continue for the remaining half year. But the rains, though they often fall in
                    torrents, are not so constant nor so violent as on the continent of India.
                    During the rainy season there are days free from showers; while, again, in July
                    and August, occasional rains refresh the atmosphere, and preserve the brightest
                    verdure of the landscape throughout the year. Thunder-storms are frequent, and
                    the lightning very vivid. The thermometer on the northern coast, at Batavia,
                    Semarang, and Sourabaya, occasionally rises, about three in the afternoon, to
                    90°, which it rarely exceeds; but in general it has been found to range between
                    70° and 74° in the evenings, and 83° at noon, or at Semarang 87°. At thirty or
                    forty miles inland from Batavia, on the mountains, it ranges between 60° and
                    70°, above which it seldom rises. On the hills of Semarang, where Europeans
                    frequently reside during the dry season, at an elevation of about 4000 feet, it
                    is frequently, in the mornings, as low as 45°, and ranges between 50° and 62°;
                    and on the summit of one of the highest mountains, Sindoro, it has been seen as
                    lo was 27°.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Railles’

                    >Batavian Transactions,</hi> vol. viii. Introductory Discourse.</p></note> From
                    its insular situation, Java enjoys the benefit <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    land and sea breeze; and its diversified surface affords the choice of climate,
                    and a regular diminution of temperature, in proportion to the elevation. With
                    the exception of the city of Batavia, where the climate is the most baneful in
                    the world, and the low marshy flats on the northern shore, the island of Java
                    is, in point of salubrity, equal to the healthiest parts of British India, or of
                    any tropical country in the world. This fact is attested by the medical
                    registers of the different British regiments stationed in this island. From the
                    1st November 1813 to the 1st November 1814, the deaths among 7470 British
                    troops, who were exposed to many disadvantages and privations, did not exceed
                    504, which was only in the proportion of 1 to 14. From November 1814 to November
                    1815, out of 7487 troops, 252 died, 63 by fever, 123 by dysentery, and 65 by
                    other diseases, which is only in the proportion of 1 in 30 in a year; a low
                    estimate for climates that have borne a better character for salubrity than that
                    of Java.</p>
                <p>This island abounds in the number and extraordinary variety of its vegetable
                    productions. Between the tops of the mountains and the sea-shore is comprised
                    almost every degree of temperature, and hence the produce of every region finds
                    here some congenial spot. Rice, of which there are a hundred varieties, is
                    cultivated on all the low grounds and ravines along the sea-coast, and in other
                    situations commanding a supply of water. It is the great staple of agriculture
                    in Java, to which every other species of husbandry is subordinate; and this
                    island is the granary of the eastern archipelago, from which all the other
                    adjacent islands and states of Sumatra, Molucca, Borneo, Celebes, and the
                    Moluccas, have been long supplied; while every year about six or eight thousand
                    tons were formerly sent by the Dutch to Ceylon, Coromandel, the Cape, and their
                    other settlements. Notwithstanding this abundant produce, it is calculated that
                    about seven eighths of the island are either neglected or badly cultivated; and
                    such is the fertility of the soil, that it is from the remaining one eighth that
                    these great supplies are derived. Maize or Indian corn ranks next in importance
                    to rice, and is principally cultivated in the higher regions, and in those
                    tracts where there are no mountain streams for the irrigation of the soil. Its
                    cultivation has of late been extended in Java, and is becoming more and more a
                    favourite article of food. Wheat has been introduced by the Europeans, and
                    cultivated<pb break="no" facs="nls:192944679" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4679-0529"/>
                    with success to an extent required by the European inhabitants. It thrives well
                    in the interior of the country. Oats and other grain thrive in those parts of
                    the island, and would be produced in great abundance were due attention given to
                    their culture. Potatoes have been cultivated during the last forty years, in
                    elevated situations, near all the principal European establishments, and are
                    found of a good quality; also most of the common culinary vegetables of Europe,
                    though their quality is apt to degenerate unless fresh supplies of seed be
                    procured from Europe. Other species of grain, and leguminous vegetables, and a
                    variety of pulses, are raised as green crops in intervals between those of rice;
                    and in times of scarcity the natives make use of various kinds of the plantain,
                    also the yam and the sweet potato. But in general Indian corn is the only
                    article used by some as a substitute for rice. Cotton of an inferior quality to
                    the Indian cotton is cultivated in almost every part of the island, and its
                    cheapness occasions a considerable exportation. The coffee plant thrives
                    luxuriantly in Java. It was first introduced about the year 1723 by the Dutch,
                    who established a monopoly of the article, and forced the natives to cultivate
                    it, and deliver it into the government stores at a reduced price. During the
                    French administration of Marshal Daendels this cruel oppression was carried
                    still further, and in certain districts every family was forced to take care of
                    a thousand plants, and deliver the produce into the government stores. Under the
                    more humane rule of the British governor, Sir Stamford Raffles, the free
                    cultivation of coffee was permitted to the inhabitants, and all compulsory
                    labour was abolished. The quality of the Java coffee is reckoned superior to
                    that of the West Indies, and ranks with that of Bourbon in the European markets;
                    its cultivation, for which many parts of the island are eminently adapted, has
                    therefore been greatly extended; and it is exported to the amount of twenty-six
                    millions of pounds, which is about two sevenths of the produce of the West
                    Indies. The soil is very favourable to the growth of tobacco, which was
                    introduced by Europeans, and is now extensively raised for exportation in the
                    central districts of the island, about five millions of pounds being sent to the
                    rest of the archipelago. In some parts it forms, after rice, the most important
                    article of cultivation. Pepper was at one time the principal export from Java;
                    but it was strictly monopolized by the government, and the most oppressive modes
                    were resorted to in order to enhance its price. For some time past it has ceased
                    to be cultivated to any extent. Indigo is raised in most parts of the island;
                    and both the climate and soil of Java offer peculiar advantages for the
                    extensive cultivation of this plant. The natives prepare the indigo very
                    unskilfully, and hence it is of very indifferent quality. But if it were more
                    carefully manufactured, it might form a most valuable and important export for
                    the European market.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the extent to which cultivation has been carried in many
                    districts of the island, large portions of the surface are covered with primeval
                    forests, affording excellent timber for almost every purpose. Extensive forests
                    of teak are found in almost all the eastern provinces, but especially in the
                    central districts of the island. There are great varieties of other kinds of
                    timber, as the <hi rend="italic">suren</hi> (the <hi rend="italic">tuna</hi> of
                    BengaD, of which the wood is light, strong, and durable, having something of the
                    smell of cedar, and which, as the grain is not fine, is used for making chests,
                    trunks, and carriages. The <hi rend="italic">wungu</hi> is often used instead of
                    teak. It is of a somewhat finer grain, and, when in full blossom, is the most
                    beautiful tree existing. The <hi rend="italic">wadang</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >bayur,</hi> a light wood, is well adapted for the masts and sparsof small
                    vessels. There areseveral other similar woods, of which are formed the handles
                    of spears and pikes. There is a close and ponderous wood, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nangha,</hi> which is used for beams and rafters in the construction of houses,
                    and sometimes for household furniture. There are other woods, heavy, hard, and
                    close in the grain, which are used for the anchors of small vessels, for ships’
                    blocks, for naves of wheels, for handles of tools for carpenters and other
                    artificers, for cart-wheels, for machinery, and such like purposes. There are
                    other light woods, which are useful for canoes, for the handles of axes and
                    other like tools, and which are manufactured into planks. There are various
                    descriptions of woods that are well adapted for household furniture, cabinet
                    ware, &amp;c. of a deep-brown or black colour, and which take a fine polish;
                    others of a lighter colour, and finely grained, that are used for inlaying.
                    There are other kinds of woods of various colours, variegated, white, and black,
                    or of yellowish or brown colours, and very heavy, which are employed for canes,
                    handles, and spears. The bamboo flourishes in great luxuriance and variety. The
                    rattans of Java arc, however, inferior to those of Sumatra and Borneo. Many
                    woods afford excellent fuel; and amongst the useful trees may be reckoned the
                    soap tree, of which the fruit is very commonly used in the washing of linen; the
                    <hi rend="italic">kasemah,</hi> from the bark of which is made a varnish for
                    umbrellas; the <hi rend="italic">onmpang</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> from the resin of which the natives prepare a shining varnish
                    for the wooden sheaths of krises; the cotton-tree, from which a silky wool is
                    obtained for stuffing pillows and beds; the wax-tree, from the kernel of which
                    an oil is expressed, which some time after becomes hard, and bears a resemblance
                    to wax, and may be burnt in lamps or converted into candles, affording when
                    burning an agreeable odour; the shrub is also produced which yields the elastic
                    gum from which the India rubber is prepared. This substance is converted into
                    torches, which are employed in searching for edible bird-nests in the caves of
                    the rocks. Few of the trees in Java exude the odoriferous resins which abound in
                    Sumatra, Borneo, and the eastern islands. The camphor tree is unknown. None of
                    the finer kinds of spices, such as the nutmeg, the clove, or the cinnamon, are
                    indigenous to Java; but the few trees planted by Europeans in gardens have
                    thriven well, and there is little doubt that the nutmeg and the clove might be
                    extensively cultivated throughout the island. The vine would also thrive well in
                    some of the eastern provinces; but its growth was always discouraged by the
                    narrow policy of the Dutch, who were afraid lest it should interfere with the
                    wine trade of the Cape of Good Hope. The cottage of every peasant is surrounded
                    with plantations of cocoa-nut trees, which constitute an inheritance that is
                    transmitted from father to son, and which it is reckoned a sacred duty to
                    transmit, and to augment by new plantations. The various species of the
                    palm-tree are found in Java; and, besides the cocoa-nut, there are many trees
                    growing spontaneously, of which the seeds and kernels are used as food. The true
                    sago of Amboyna and the eastern islands is found in a fair, low, and marshy
                    situation, though the preparation of it from the pith of the tree is not known
                    to the inhabitants of Java; but from the <hi rend="italic">αren</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">sagurus rumpnii,</hi> which abounds in all parts, and, from its
                    various and extensive uses, ranks next in importance to the cocoa-nut, a
                    substance is prepared similar in all respects to the true sago of the eastern
                    islands. Other trees exude gums and balsamic oils. The kubab yields a balsamic
                    oil or jelly, which is much esteemed, which has the smell and taste of camphor,
                    and is taken inwardly for violent coughs, or disorders in the stomach. The
                    benzoin-tree produces an odoriferous gum, of an orange colour, which is a
                    valuable article of commerce. The <hi rend="italic">upas</hi> or famous
                    poison-tree of Java has long attracted the curiosity of naturalists, and has
                    been the subject of many wonderful, and, as now appears, fabulous tales. It is
                    one of the largest trees in the forests of Java, and rises with a completely
                    naked stem to the perpendicular height of <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944692"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4692-0530"/>sixty, seventy, and eighty feet, when it sends jff
                    a few stout branches. The bark, which in old trees is almost half an inch thick,
                    on being cut yields a milky juice, from which a poison is prepared equal in
                    fatality to the strongest animal poisons hitherto known. The inner bark
                    resembles a coarse piece of linen which is worked into ropes, and which, after
                    much bruising, washing, and immersion in water, is worn by the lower classes
                    when working in the fields. But it is remarkable, that after being exposed to a
                    shower of rain, this dress produces an intolerable itching, the effect of a
                    small portion of the poison still adhering to the bark. The story of the tree
                    poisoning the surrounding atmosphere is altogether a fable. It is extremely
                    difficult to penetrate into the forests of Java, from the quantity of underwood
                    and creeping plants with which they are entangled.</p>
                <p>“No region of the earth,” says Marsden, “can boast of a greater abundance and
                    variety of indigenous fruits than Java. The <hi rend="italic">mangustin,</hi>
                    pre-eminent for delicacy of flavour amongst all the fruits of the East, of a
                    round form and a purple colour, is found in great abundance. The <hi
                    rend="italic">dorian,</hi> a large fruit, like the bread fruit in appearance, of
                    a disgusting smell, and of a flavour like a custard, is said, when seasoned with
                    garlic, to become by frequent use extremely fascinating. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >rambutan,</hi> a cool and agreeable fruit, of a delicate sub-acid flavour,
                    grows on a showy and elegant tree. The <hi rend="italic">lanseh</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">lanseb,</hi> much relished by the lower classes, grows in clusters
                    like grapes, and has a pulpy substance, with a delicate sub-acid flavour. The
                    <hi rend="italic">pumplemoos,</hi> the Batavian lembu or vine of Bengal, and the
                    shaddock of the West Indies, is in Java of an exquisite flavour; as also the
                    pine-apple, which is much superior to that of Hindustan. There are besides
                    extensive varieties of the atrocarpus or jack-fruit, which grows wild in
                    abundance; of the mango, of which no less than forty varieties are enumerated;
                    the plantain, the guava, the rose-apple, the custard-apple, the papaw, besides
                    dates, pomegranates, tamarinds, figs, annanas, oranges, lemons, citrons, melons,
                    pumpkins. In some of the mountainous tracts are to be found peaches, Chinese
                    pears, and other fruits imported from Japan, the Cape of Good Hope, and China.
                    Of the oil-giving plants there are many. From the <hi rend="italic"
                    >palma</hi><hi rend="italic">christi</hi> is obtained most of the oil that is
                    burned in lamps. There are numerous trees, plants, and shrubs, which supply,
                    from the bark or the leaves, fibres that are converted into ropes, threads,
                    lines used for fishing, thread, and finally cloth, or spun into a kind of stuff
                    resembling silk, gauze, &amp;c. Mats are made from a kind of grass, and from the
                    leaves of various palms; and the paper in common use amongst the Javans is
                    manufactured from the <hi rend="italic">morus papyrifera.</hi></p>
                <p>The plants and herbs, and the innumerable flowers which bloom in perpetual
                    succession in Java throughout the year, and impregnate the air with their
                    fragrance, present an inexhaustible field for the researches of the botanist.
                    Many of the flowers are used by the natives in adorning their persons, and are
                    remarkable for their fragrance. From the <hi rend="italic">fula</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">majori,</hi> of which whole fields are cultivated, a water is
                    distilled superior to rose-water; and from the eglantine tree, originally
                    imported from Persia, a rose-water is distilled which is in great repute. The
                    coral trees, of different species, are all elegant and showy; and amongst the
                    trees and shrubs there are some that are rare and curious, such as the <hi
                    rend="italic">casuarina equisetifolia,</hi> whose pendent branches resemble the
                    hair of the cassowary. The bombax bears a long pod, which contains a silky
                    substance that is used for stuffing cushions. Many varieties of flowers and
                    plants are cultivated in gardens on account of their beauty and fragrance, such
                    as the elastic gum-tree, the <hi rend="italic">convolvulus jalappa,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">styrax</hi><hi rend="italic">liquida,</hi> and the mountain
                    cabbage-tree of the West Indies. The pitcher-plant <hi rend="italic">(nepenthes
                    dzstulatoria)</hi> is found in the most arid situations, and is provided with a
                    curious contrivance for retaining the rains or the dews which refresh the
                    parched ground. To the stalk which bears the leaves, a small tube in the form of
                    a pitcher, and covered with a lid, is attached. By means of a hinge or strong
                    fibre passing over the handle, and connected with the leaf, which is contracted
                    when the weather is showery, or when the dews fall, the lid is opened for the
                    reception of the moisture; and when it is filled it closes again, so firmly as
                    to prevent evaporation, and thus water is secured for the sustenance of the
                    plant. Java produces a variety of medicinal plants, many of which are little
                    known in Europe, though several whose properties have been investigated, are
                    likely to become valuable articles in medicinal practice. It yields also a great
                    variety of culinary vegetables, such as the kurkum, a favourite plant used by
                    the Malays in cooking their fish and flesh, to which it gives the colour and
                    taste of saffron; the pattatas, reckoned a very wholesome root, and eaten either
                    raw or roasted, in which state it has the taste of a chestnut; the foki-foki,
                    which, when boiled in wine with pepper, tastes like an artichoke. All other
                    garden plants, such as endives, cauliflowers, beans, cabbages, pompions,
                    water-melons, yams, potatoes, &amp;c. are produced in great abundance throughout
                    the island.</p>
                <p>Neither the camel nor the elephant is found in Java, nor have they either the ass
                    or the mule. But they have a male breed of fine horses, strong, fleet, and well
                    made; and a still finer breed is imported from Buna, or the neighbouring island
                    of Sumbawa, which much resembles the Arabian horse in all qualities excepting
                    size. The bull and the cow are common, and the breed has been improved by a
                    species brought from the continent of India. But the animal of most essential
                    use in agriculture is the buffalo, which is a large and fierce animal, heavier
                    than our largest oxen, and well qualified for a beast of burden. Goats of a
                    small size are numerous; sheep are scarce and small. The hog is principally
                    reared by the Chinese. Wild animals abound in the forests. The royal tiger is
                    here as powerful and as large as in Bengal. There is a smaller species of a
                    black kind which is very ferocious, and in size and shape resembles a leopard;
                    there is also the leopard and the tiger-cat. The rhinoceros is amongst the
                    largest quadrupeds found in Java. It is principally met with in the western
                    parts, lying in the deep jungles of the high grass, remote from observation.
                    Deer and antelopes abound in the woods; also hares and rabbits, as well as all
                    the varieties of the wild hog, which are extremely destructive to the
                    plantations. Other smaller quadrupeds, such as the weasel and squirrel, are
                    common. Amongst the feathered tribes are found the cassowary, called emeu by the
                    Indians, a very large and powerful bird; the white eagle, and several varieties
                    of the falcon; also the carrion-crow and the owl, the peacock, two species of
                    parrots, one of which is very beautiful, and sells at a high price. Birds of
                    paradise sometimes visit the island. Pigeons of the most beautiful plumage are
                    found; also pheasants, jingle and pea-fowl, quail, snipes; wild ducks and geese
                    are not so common. The Java sparrow is a very handsome bird. Amongst the most
                    interesting subjects for the study of the naturalist is the small swallow, which
                    forms edible nests, of which large quantities are annually exported to the
                    Chinese market, where they are considered as a very great luxury. The aquatic
                    tribe are numerous. At the mouths of the rivers the cayman or alligator, more
                    resembling the crocodile of Egypt than that of the Ganges, is found lurking for
                    its prey. The waterguana, in length about six or seven feet, infests the rivers
                    and ponds, where it is very destructive. There are various kinds of lizards;
                    amongst others a small one, which is not above eighteen or twenty inches in
                    length. Two species<pb break="no" facs="nls:192944705"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4705-0531"/> of the turtle are found in the surrounding seas,
                    which abound also in a variety of excellent fish not known in Europe; and in
                    soles and carp, as well as in oysters and shell-fish of every kind. There are
                    thirty-four species of river-fish, many of which are excellent. In the several
                    bays on the shores of the island are numerous sharks, which are often seen
                    swimming around the ships.</p>
                <p>The serpent brood are numerous, and of various kinds. It is uncertain whether the
                    boa constrictor be found in Java-There are several which attain to a very large
                    size, from twenty-five to thirty feet in length. One of these, the <hi
                    rend="italic">ular lalang</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> is much
                    dreaded by the natives, and is said to be poisonous. Scorpions and musquitoes
                    abound in marshes; and there are various sorts of dangerous and disgusting
                    vermin, such as ants, spiders, fire-flies, which swarm in the roads, houses, and
                    even bed-chambers of the inhabitants. In the woods is found a venomous spider,
                    the body of which is nearly two inches in diameter, the fore legs and claws
                    nearly four inches in length, and the webs spun by it so strong as frequently to
                    entangle and catch the smaller birds.</p>
                <p>Manufacturing industry can scarcely be said to exist in Java. Weaving is
                    exclusively practised by the women, who make coarse cloths of cotton, and
                    sometimes of silk, for the use of their families. These they dye of various
                    colours; but, with the exception of blue and scarlet, all their dyes are apt to
                    fade. Tanning is carried on in some districts with tolerable success; also
                    saddlery; and there are manufactures in iron, brass, and tin. Salt is
                    manufactured in Java to a great extent, both for the home supply and also for
                    exportation. Under the Dutch government, the manufacture of salt was farmed out
                    to the Chinese as an exclusive privilege; a system liable to much abuse, and
                    which left the price in a great measure at the discretion of the farmer. The
                    farming of salt was abolished under the British regime in 1813. Saltpetre is
                    obtained in many parts of the island, and whilst the French possessed the
                    island, saltpetre works were established underEuropean superintendents;
                    powder-mills, founderies for shells, shot, anvils, &amp;c. and manufactories of
                    swords and small arms. From the resources and industry of this island alone the
                    French were enabled to equip an army of 15,000 men, besides a numerous militia
                    in every district; a proof of the progress of manufacturing industry amongst the
                    natives. The trade of a blacksmith is held in high estimation, and considered
                    almost as a liberal profession; chiefly, it is probable, on account of the value
                    attached to the manufacture of arms. Their small boats and barks are made of
                    various and convenient shapes; but they fail whenever they attempt to construct
                    vessels of any magnitude.</p>
                <p>The commerce of Java was very extensive at the period of the Dutch establishment
                    in the Eastern Seas. “But,” says Sir Stamford Raffles, “it would be painful to
                    point out how far, or to show in what manner, that commerce was interfered with,
                    checked, changed in its character, and reduced in its importance, by the
                    influence of a withering monopoly, the rapacity of avarice armed with power, and
                    the short-sighted tyranny of a mercantile administration.” The Javans were,
                    prior to this time, plentifully supplied both with gold and jewels, and with
                    other valuable articles, in exchange for the produce of their tranquil industry
                    and their fertile soil. Constant requisitions were made by the government for
                    the services of native vessels, at rates far below a just compensation; and
                    native traders were forbidden to trade in any of the articles of the Dutch
                    monopoly. This traffic was almost entirely annihilated, or diverted from its
                    course, by the restrictive policy of the Dutch, and by their monopolies. The
                    commerce of the country revived under the more liberal administration of the
                    British governor Sir Stamford Raffles, one of those great and enlightened men
                    who seemed to value the possession of power only as it enabled him to benefit
                    mankind. This extension of trade appears from the increasing amount of tonnage
                    employed tocarryiton. The shipping that cleared outfrom the port of Batavia in
                    1812, was 52,375 tons; in 1813, 64,306; in 1814, 72,718. By an official return
                    in March 1816, it appears that the total quantity of tonnage in vessels boarded
                    in their passage through the Straits of Sunda, amounted, in 1812, to 45,000
                    tons; in 1813, to 56,000 tons; in 1814, to 64,000 tons; and in 1815, to 130,000
                    tons; and, adding vessels not boarded, the whole tonnage for four years would
                    amount to 390,000. Java has great advantages for its internal trade, from its
                    navigable rivers, by which the produce of the interior is conveyed to the coast,
                    and from its excellent roads. A high post-road, passable for carriages at all
                    seasons of the year, runs nearly the whole length of the island east and west, a
                    distance of 800 English miles; and a high military one, equally well made,
                    crosses the island from north to south; cross roads branching off from these
                    main roads, so that there is easy access to all parts of the island. The
                    internal trade of the island was, however, heavily oppressed by local duties,
                    rendered still more oppressive in the hands of the Chinese, to whom they were
                    farmed out; and by market duties. From this oppression it was only partially
                    relieved by the British. The coasting and foreign trade of Java is carried on in
                    vessels belonging chiefly to Chinese, Arabs, Bugis, natives of Celebes, and in
                    smaller Malayan craft. The island is a great entrepôt for the produce of the
                    whole eastern archipelago; and its merchants, a great proportion of them
                    Chinese, are very rich, and remarkable for honourable dealing and persevering
                    industry. Java exports for the use of the other islands, including the Malayan
                    ports on the peninsula, rice, a variety of vetches, salt, oil, tobacco, timber,
                    Java cloths, brass-wire, edible bird-nests to the value of L.40,000 or L.50,000,
                    a variety of minor articles, the produce of her agriculture and manufactures,
                    besides a considerable quantity of European, Indian, and Chinese goods. The
                    following articles, the exclusive produce of the eastern islands, are collected
                    at its principal ports for re-exportation to India, China, and Europe; tin from
                    Banca; gold-dust, diamonds, camphor, benjamin, and other drugs, edible
                    bird-nests, biche de mer, rattans, bees’ wax, tortoise-shell, and dyeing woods,
                    from Borneo and Sumatra; sandal and other fine woods, nutmegs, cloves, and mace,
                    coarse, wild, and damaged spices, kayu-puti, and other pungent oils, from the
                    Moluccas; horses and sapan wood from Sumbawa; Bugis cloths, and many collections
                    for the Chinese market, from Celebes. A very extensive trade is carried on with
                    China in Chinese junks, about eight or ten of which annually arrive from Canton
                    or Amoi with cargoes of teas, raw silk, silk piece goods, varnished umbrellas,
                    iron pots, coarse China ware, sweetmeats, nankeen paper, and numerous other
                    minor articles, for the use of the Chinese settlers, many of whom come annually
                    to Java, where they employ themselves as labourers on their first arrival; but,
                    by frugal habits and persevering industry, they soon acquire property, and
                    become extensive merchants. European vessels carry out from Java to China, tin,
                    pepper, spices, rattans, and betelnut; and bring back Chinese produce for the
                    European market, a balance of cash, and manufactures for Batavia. Whilst Java
                    was in possession of the English, all kinds of piece goods, opium, and other
                    articles, were imported from Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay, and bills, gold-dust,
                    bees’ wax, tin, Japan camphor, sago, and teak-timber, were taken away in return.
                    Under the English rule the trade was free, and great quantities of teak were
                    imported into the markets of Bengal. But since the island was ceded to the
                    Dutch, the old system has been revived, and the teak of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192944718" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4718-0532"/>Java has been artificially
                    raised in price two hundred per cent. The latter is of a superior quality to
                    that of Pegu or the Malabar coast; and, notwithstanding that it was monopolized
                    by the Dutch government, it was exported to the Moluccas, to Malacca, and to the
                    Cape of Good Hope, where all the public buildings are constructed of Javan teak.
                    Large quantities of Javan sugar, which is of a superior quality, were exported
                    to Bombay, and also by Arab vessels to the Red Sea, and particularly to Moeha.
                    But Arab traders of capital have since been driven out of the market by the
                    monopolies of the Dutch. Java, since the partial opening of the Indian trade in
                    1810, has largely imported European manufactures.</p>
                <p>It appears from Mr Crawfurd’s statement that there does not exist here the same
                    inveterate prejudice against European ιnanufactures as in India and China. Since
                    the opening of the free trade, the fine cottons of Britain have, from their
                    cheapness, in a great measure superseded those of Hindustan. Chintzes are the
                    favourite article, in which the pattern is of much consequence. The taste of the
                    Javanese is for bright colours, red and green in preference to all others, and
                    next to these yellow and brown; whilst black is unsaleable. The pattern should
                    be small, filling the ground without crowding it. White calicoes and cotton
                    cambrics are also purchased by the natives, to be painted by themselves.
                    Although Java lies under the tropics, its mountainous and maritime situation
                    produces a demand for light woollens. These should be cheap Yorkshire cloths,
                    such as cost at Leeds 5s. to 6s. 6d. per yard. Iron, to the extent of 28,000 cw
                    t., and to the value of L.22,500, is annually imported into Java, which is
                    destitute of that important metal. The Swedish is preferred, though British iron
                    has of late been introduced to a considerable extent. Fire-arms and ammunition
                    are the most saleable articles, but their export has hitherto been prohibited by
                    European governments. There has been recently a great extension of demand for
                    our glass and earthen ware. A constant demand, limited only by the means of the
                    purchaser, is also daily increasing for gold lace, and the other European
                    manufactures used as dress, furniture, saddlery, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Amongst the two races of people who inhabit the oriental islands, distinguished
                    into the brown coloured race, and the Papuas or oriental negroes, the natives of
                    Java belong to the former. They are under the middle size, the standard for men
                    being five feet two inches, and for women four feet eleven inches. Their
                    complexion is a yellowish brown, generally without any tincture of red. Of this
                    colour they admire the fair specimens, and their standard beauty is a virgin
                    gold; but they consider the European white as a sickly tint. They have a round
                    face, little black eyes, a small nose, and a large mouth, with thick lips. On
                    the head, beard, and other parts of the body, there is a remarkable deficiency
                    of hair. Compared with the Europeans and southern Asiatics, they are considered
                    by Mr Crawfurd as an ill-looking race; but the opinion of Sir Stamford Raffles
                    is, in this respect, more favourable. Their constitution is healthy, and they
                    seem to attain a longevity equal to that of Europeans. Early marriages are as
                    universal as amongst other Asiatics, a man being scarcely ever known single at
                    twenty-five, whilst an unmarried female at eighteen is considered as an old
                    maid. The lot of the female sex differs considerably from what it usually is
                    among Asiatics. They are by no means immured with the same jealousy; British
                    gentlemen have even been admitted to visit the harems of the sultans and chiefs,
                    where they were received by the ladies with all the dignified propriety of
                    persons accustomed to mix in general society. To women the commercial and
                    pecuniary affairs of the family are almost wholly intrusted. Of these privileges
                    and advantages, however, they are said not always to make the very best use. The
                    right of divorce, with which they are indulged equally with the other sex, is
                    carried by them beyond all excusable limits. R is very common for a woman,
                    before the age of thirty, to have divorced three or four husbands; and Mr
                    Crawfurd had one pointed out to him who was living with her twelfth. No
                    difficulty occurs in regard to the disposal of the children, who, in Java, are
                    never viewed in the light of a burden. Besides being easily supported, they are
                    usually few in number, a circumstance ascribed to the hard labour which the
                    mothers undergo, and the consequent frequency of abortion. Besides the
                    management of the household, they weave all the cloths worn in the family, and
                    perform various other offices which in Europe devolve on the other sex. Polygamy
                    is permitted by law, but it is known only amongst the great; and, even with
                    them, the first wife alone is of their own rank, and mistress of the family; the
                    others occupy a place decidedly inferior. The natives of Java were drawn by
                    their Dutch masters in very dark colours; but the English residents, after
                    careful observation, have described them much more favourably. They are
                    generous, warm-hearted, and susceptible of strong attachments. Their affections
                    of kindred are peculiarly forcible; so that, even in civil contests, those
                    fraternal enmities, so conspicuous in other Asiatic states, are scarcely ever
                    observable. The English, who placed confidence in them, found them honest in the
                    intercourse of common life; and they share only in a slight degree those habits
                    of piracy for which the Malay tribes are so notorious. In society they are
                    uncommonly good humoured, courteous, and polite, and are scarcely ever seen in a
                    passion, unless on those occasions when they are hurried to the last extreme of
                    violence. These unhappily too often occur under the impulse of that violent
                    jealousy and revenge which form their ruling passions. The disregard of human
                    life seems to proceed to an excess amongst them scarcely known in any other
                    quarter of the globe. It is stated that, in any part of Java, an assassin may be
                    hired for the moderate sum of fifteen or twenty shillings; but, in general, the
                    injured party conceives it more honourable to decline this cheap mode of
                    redress, and to seek vengeance with his own hand. Some, driven to the extreme of
                    desperation, run furiously into the streets, and kill indiscriminately all whom
                    they meet, till they are themselves overpowered and cut down. This dreadful
                    atrocity, which, by a corruption of the native term, is called “running a muck,”
                    is said, however, to prevail, not amongst the native Javanese, but amongst the
                    other Malay tribes resident in the capital.</p>
                <p>In the ancient religion of the Javanese, which was undoubtedly derived from
                    Hindustan, Siva, with his family, and Buddha, were the chief objects of
                    adoration. Their temples appear, from the late inquiries of our countrymen, to
                    have rivalled in splendour those erected in the native seats of their religion.
                    In the course of the fifteenth century, the whole island of Java was, by Arab
                    traders and settlers, converted to Mahommedanism. This faith, however, which is
                    generally observed with so much strictness, is professed here in a very loose
                    and imperfect manner. It need only be observed, that wine and spirits are not
                    only used without scruple on ordinary occasions, but are even sometimes produced
                    at religious festivals. An extreme indifference prevails as to all its outward
                    observances. In return, superstitious credulity is common to a degree almost
                    unparalleled. A belief in sorcery is universal. If a person write the name of
                    another on a skull, bone, or leg, and suspend it from a tree on haunted ground,
                    where two roads meet, the laws doom to death, himself, his friends, his
                    children, and his children’s children. Availing themselves of this credulity,
                    various persons usually start up, in troubled times, as saints, prophets, or as
                    the descendants of one of the ancient kings of Java, and at <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192944731" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4731-0533"/>tract a multitude of
                    followers. Christianity has not obtained any footing in Java; and Mr Crawfurd
                    doubts if it ever will, till the conduct of its Indian professors becomes more
                    conformable to its precepts.</p>
                <p>The Javanese language is the most copious and improved of any used in the Indian
                    islands. It has Sanscrit for its basis, but with considerable variations. In the
                    beauty of its written characters it is not surpassed by any of the languages of
                    Asia. It is distinguished by its vast copiousness as to particular, and
                    barrenness as to general terms. Thus there are five names for a dog, and seven
                    for a horse, but no general word for an animal. The abstract terms nature,
                    space, and others of that kind, are entirely wanting. All their literature, as
                    is usual among rude nations, is metrical, and may be divided into lyrical
                    compositions or songs; romances founded on Hindu legends; romances founded on
                    modern story; histories of modern transactions; with legal and ethical tracts,
                    chiefly in prose. Of these compositions, the songs, in which feeling and passion
                    are simply expressed, appear to be the most pleasing. The romances consist
                    chiefly of abridged translations of the Mahabarat and Ramayana, from the Hindu
                    original into a now dead. Javanese language called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kawi.</hi> These versions, being free from the endless prolixity of the
                    originals, may be read with greater pleasure. Java had no history previous to
                    the Mahommedan invasion; and even now, its annals consist merely of metrical
                    legends, which, being written under the eye of the prince whose deeds they
                    relate, cannot be suspected of very strict impartiality. Besides the rudeness of
                    these compositions, there is an absence of that energy, ardour, and sublimity,
                    which have often characterised the poetry of far ruder nations. This seems
                    justly ascribed to the despotic form of the government, which represses all the
                    nobler sentiments natural to independent man, when individual character is
                    permitted to unfold itself.</p>
                <p>The government of Java is more absolute than that of any other part of the
                    archipelago, and differs little in this respect from the great monarchies of
                    Asia. There is no rank but what emanates from the sovereign; and no bounds are
                    set to the marks of respect shown by inferiors to the higher classes. No
                    individual, of whatever rank, can stand in the presence of a superior, not even
                    the heir-apparent in that of the sovereign. Whenever a chief appears in public,
                    all his inferiors must throw themselves into the posture called <hi
                    rend="italic">dodoh,</hi> which may be rendered by the English term “squatting,”
                    in which they remain till he disappears. Sir Stamford Raffles describes himself
                    as much annoyed at seeing, in one of his progresses, the whole population of the
                    country quitting their work, and remaining fixed in this uneasy posture as long
                    as he remained in sight. They have a language, or at least a modification of the
                    language, which must be used by the inferior in addressing those of higher rank.
                    The revenue of the sovereign, as is usual in Asiatic despotisms, arises from the
                    rent of all the cultivated lands in the country, levied in kind, and in the
                    enormous proportion of one half of the entire produce. This, however, by the
                    allowance of one sixth for reaping, is reduced to about two fifths. It is paid,
                    not into the treasury, but by the king assigning to each of his officers and
                    servants a certain number of cultivators, whose rents he is to receive. The
                    Javan farmer is supposed, on the whole, to be more mildly treated than the
                    Hindoo.</p>
                <p>The population of Java, including the small contiguous island of Madura, was
                    found, by a census taken in 1815, to amount to 4,600,000. Of these, three
                    millions are in the provinces immediately subject to European authority; the
                    rest is subject to the native princes. The principal European capitals, Batavia,
                    Samarang, and Surabaya, contain respectively 60,000, 25,000, and 20,000
                    inhabitants; the chief native capitals, Surakerta and Vug Yukerta, about 105,000
                    each. The Chinese, amounting to 94,000, form the most active and industrious
                    part of the population; the manufactures of salt, sugar, and arrack, are solely
                    in their hands. Slavery in Java prevails to a much less extent than in the other
                    islands. The slaves do not exceed 30,000; and none of them are native Javans,
                    but obtained by purchase or capture from Celebes or Borneo. The philanthropic
                    measures adopted by Sir Stamford Raffles, with a view to the abolition of the
                    trade, were seconded by the chiefs, and productive, to a considerable extent, of
                    the desired effect. <hi rend="smallcaps">(f.)</hi></p>
