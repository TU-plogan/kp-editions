                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">JEFFREYS</label>, StR <hi rend="smallcaps">George,</hi> Baron
                    Wem, commonly called <hi rend="italic">Judge Jeffreys,</hi> was the sixth son of
                    Mr John Jeffreys, of Acton, in Denbighshire; and was educated at Westminster
                    School, whence he removed to the Inner Temple, where he applied himself to the
                    study of the law. Alderman Jeffreys, who was probably related to him, introduced
                    him among the citizens of London; and being a merry bottle companion, he soon
                    came into great business, and was chosen their recorder. He was afterwards
                    chosen solicitor to the Duke of York; and in 1680 he was knighted, and made
                    chief justice of Chester. At length, resigning the recordership, he obtained the
                    post of chief justice of the king’s bench, and, soon after the accession of
                    James II. the great seal. During the reign of King Charles II. he showed himself
                    a bitter enemy to those dissenting ministers who, in that time of persecution,
                    were tried by him. He was one of the principal advisers and promoters of all the
                    oppressions and arbitrary measures carried on in the reign of James II.; and his
                    sanguinary and inhuman proceedings against Monmouth’s unhappy adherents in the
                    west will for ever render his name infamous. Whenever the prisoner was of a
                    different party, or whenever he could please the court by condemning him,
                    instead of appearing, according to the duty of his office, as his counsel, he
                    would scarcely allow him to speak for himself, but would load him with the
                    grossest and most vulgar abuse, browbeat, insult, and turn to ridicule the
                    witnesses that spoke in his behalf, and even threaten the jury with fines and
                    imprisonment if they made the least hesitation about bringing in the prisoner
                    guilty. Yet it is said, that when he was in temper, and matters perfectly
                    indifferent came before him, no one became a seat of justice better. Nay, it
                    even appears, that when he was under no state influence, he was sometimes
                    inclined to protect the natural and civil rights of mankind, of which the
                    following instance has been recorded. The mayor and aldermen of Bristol had been
                    used to transport convicted criminals to the American plantations, and sell them
                    by way of trade. This turning to good account, when any pilferers or petty
                    rogues were brought before them, they threatened them with hanging, and then
                    some officers who attended earnestly persuaded the ignorant, intimidated
                    creatures to beg for transportation, as the only way to save their lives; and in
                    general the advice was followed. Then, without more form, each alderman in
                    course took one, and sold him for his own benefit; and sometimes warm disputes
                    arose between ,them about the next turn. This infamous trade, which had been
                    carried on for many years, coming to the knowledge of the lord chief justice, he
                    made the mayor descend from the bench, and stand at the bar in his scarlet and
                    fur, with his guilty brethren the aidermen, and plead as common criminals. He
                    then obliged them to give securities to answer informations; but the proceedings
                    were stopped by the Revolution. However, the brutality which Jeffreys commonly
                    showed on the bench, where his voice and visage were equally terrible, at length
                    exposed him to a severe mortification. A scrivener of Wapping having a cause
                    before him, one of the opponent’s council said he was a strange fellow, and
                    sometimes went to church, and sometimes to conventicles, and it was thought he
                    was a trimmer. At this the chancellor fired. “A trimmer !” said he; “I have
                    heard much of that monster, but never saw one. Come forth, Mr Trimmer, and let
                    me see your shape.” He then treated the poor fellow so roughly, that, on his
                    leaving the hall, he declared he would not undergo the terrors of that man’s
                    face again to save his life, and that he should certainly retain the frightful
                    impressions of it as long as he lived. Soon afterwards, when the Prince of
                    Orange landed, the lord chancellor, dreading the public resentment, disguised
                    himself in a seaman’s dress in order to leave the kingdom, and was drinking in a
                    cellar, when this scrivener, coming into the cellar, and seeing again the face
                    which had filled him with such horror, started; upon which Jeffreys, fearing he
                    was known, feigned a cough, and turned to the wall with his pot of beer in his
                    hand. But Mr Trimmer going out, gave notice that he was there; and the mob
                    rushing in, seized him, and carried him before the lord mayor, who sent him with
                    a strong guard to the lords of the council, by whom he was committed to the
                    Tower, where he died in 1689. It is remarkable, that the late Countess of
                    Pomfret met with very rude insults from the populace on the western road, solely
                    because she was grand-daughter to the inhuman Jeffreys.</p>
