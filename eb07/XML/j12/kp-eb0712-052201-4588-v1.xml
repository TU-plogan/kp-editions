                <p><label type="entry">JAPANNING</label>, the art of varnishing and drawing figures
                    on wood, after the manner of the Japanese, from whom it takes its name. The
                    substances which admit of being japanned are almost every kind that are dry and
                    rigid, or not too flexible; as wood, metals, leather, and prepared paper. The
                    practice of japanning gdods has varied from time to time. The following are some
                    of the methods practised at present.</p>
                <p>Mix up some vegetable black with naphtha or spirit of turpentine, and let it sour
                    for a night; then add as much japan as will not take away the body of the black.
                    After the article has been freed from rust, coat it with this, and put it into
                    the stove. When dry, let it be coated with japan; two coats are sufficient if
                    the japan be rich or old. If the article is intended to be polished, another
                    coat or two may be given, according to the surface of the article; and let it be
                    gently cooled between each coat. To polish the above, take a piece of
                    close-grained pumice-stone, ground down to a smooth and perfectly level surface,
                    and with this slightly rub down all the knots. When this is effected, put the
                    article into the stove till the parts which have been rubbed are hardened. Then
                    take a piece of woollen cloth, stuffed with something of the same description,
                    to the size of a small hand mallet, which japanners call a polishing bob; wet it
                    through with water, then dip it amongst pumice-stone which lias been sifted
                    through muslin, and rub the whole surface till it is smooth. Sponge it clean
                    with water when dry. The surface is then made perfectly smooth and fine by being
                    rubbed with a piece of cloth similar to that just mentioned, and ground
                    rotten-stone moistened with water. It is then wiped clean with soft silk; and,
                    when dry, hard powdered rotten-stone is rubbed upon it with the points of the
                    fingers, lengthways, when it receives a beautiful gloss. To preserve the lustre,
                    sprinkle a small quantity of sweet oil and water over the whole, then smartly
                    with both hands clean off the oil and water. This will produce a permanent and
                    brilliant glossy black. If the cast or sheet iron is not ground, there is no use
                    for the first coat of black, as the same coats of japan answer the purpose
                    perfectly well.</p>

                <p>In japanning tin, care must be taken to deprive the article of any rosin or
                    grease. It then receives one coat of black and two coats of japan, as in the
                    case of cast or sheet iron. If it has to be polished previously to being coated,
                    it is rubbed smooth lengthways with a piece of wool-çoinb-er’s card, or coarse
                    sand-paper. This will greatly aid the polisher, and in some instances may save a
                    coat of japan. The article is then polished and oiled as before described.</p>
                <p>Clean the tin as before mentioned, and give it one coat of japan. Let it then be
                    put into the stove, and when dry give it another. If a dark brown is required,
                    it is subjected to a strong heat; and if a light brown, a coating and a gentle
                    heat only is necessary. Care must be taken that each coat is well settled or
                    stiffened in the air, by turning it upside down to keep it from flowing all one
                    way, before putting it in the stove.</p>
                <p>Grind some Venetian red in spirit of turpentine very fine, to which add three
                    parts of mixing varnish with one part of japan, that is, as much as will not
                    take away the body of the red. Coat the article, and put it into the stove till
                    it dry. Then give it one coat of japan pretty fluid, and let it settle in the
                    air, as mentioned above. Put it again into the stove, and when dry it will
                    appear of a fine brown colour. All metals may be japanned in this way,
                    especially old tin ware. If a polish is required, use common vermilion instead
                    of Venetian red, as it will require more coats. Another brown, commonly called
                    chocolate, may be produced by using purple brown in the same way.</p>
                <p>In japanning wood in the same way as metal, it ought to be dried or seasoned well
                    in the stove before coating. A black is obtained by using the same black as that
                    already mentioned. After the article has been dried in the stove and taken out,
                    it is coated with japan; and this is repeated until the surface becomes smooth.
                    Care must be taken not to let the article cool between the periods of each
                    successive application of the japan, else the air may insinuate itself into the
                    pores of the wood, and cause it to blister when put into the stove again. The
                    article made or turned must be in one piece.</p>
                <p>In japanning table tops, the best Spanish mahogany, plained and smoothed with
                    sand-paper, must be used. First put it in the stove between two plates of iron,
                    with a sufficient weigh ton it to keep it from casting or warping, till it be
                    properly seasoned. Take it out and coat it with black as above mentioned.
                    Afterwards put it into the stove to dry. Then coat it with japan until it has a
                    flowing appearance. Should it blister between the coatings, rub the blisters
                    down with fine sand or glass-paper. After the last coat has been applied, allow
                    it to become perfectly hardened, and then polish it in the same way as metal is
                    polished. This method is not generally known or practised, a prejudice existing
                    that it will not stand the heat; but Spanish mahogany, three fourths of an inch
                    thick, will stand the same heat as tin.</p>
                <p>Small fire-screens made of plain-tree and other kinds of wood may be japanned in
                    the same manner; but as they are done on both sides, it requires a frame made of
                    tin, tapered inwards, so that the screen may rest gently on the edges of it.
                    Flat articles, which cannot stand the necessary temperature, are japanned in the
                    following manner. Grind fine some ivory-black with turpentine, then add two
                    parts of japan and two parts of drying copal varnish; and after the wood has
                    been well dried, coat it over three times. When it is dry, smooth it down with
                    wet rag and ground pumice-stone. The smoothing being finished, take extra quick
                    copal varnish, tinged with ivory-black, and give the article two coats. When
                    these are hardened it may be polished. If great care be taken in laying on the
                    varnish, polishing may not be necessary.</p>
                <p>1o a white lead ground in turpentine add one part of drying copal varnish, and
                    mix them together. Coat the wood till the pores be filled up, and then rub it
                    down as before described. 1hen take flake-white ground in turpentine, and add to
                    it three parts of fine dial varnish; strain it through fine muslin, and let it
                    stand for five or six hours; after which, coat the wood over twice, and let the
                    first coat be properly hard before the other is applied. When sufficiently
                    hardened, take a piece of fine flannel dipped in rotten-stone ground in water,
                    and rub it till smooth, when it is rendered fit for working on. But if it is to
                    be finished in the white, let it be rubbed all over with a mixture of sweet oil
                    and flour, and then dusted with dry flour, which is afterwards wiped clean off
                    with both hands, leaving a fine glossy surface.</p>
                <p>The yellow ground may be filled up in the same way as the above with the lead.
                    When it is filled up, take chrome-yellow ground in turpentine, and add three
                    parts of fine drying copal varnish; strain this, and coat the article with it,
                    as in the above case, and varnish and polish it in a similar manner.</p>
                <p>Take common vermilion ground in turpentine, to which add one part of quick-mixing
                    varnish. Ffll up the ground with this, and then take Chinese vermilion ground in
                    fine drying oil, thick, adding to it a small quantity of fine mixing varnish, to
                    make it free in working. With this preparation the article is twice thinly
                    coated, which method is preferable to laying on only one thick coat. When dry,
                    it will be fit for working on. But if it is intended to be polished, give it two
                    coats of fine quick-polishing varnish, and let the first coat be very hard
                    before it receives the second. After it is properly hardened, take a woollen rag
                    dipped in ground pumice-stone and water, and rub the ground all over. When it is
                    smooth, take a flannel rag dipped in ground rotten-stone, and finish it, as in
                    the case of the white.</p>
                <p>Fill up the blue ground in the same manner as the white is filled up; and a
                    little Prussian blue may be added to it. W <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> hen
                    filled up, Prussian blue and white lead are ground by themselves upon the same
                    stone, and afterwards mixed together in proportions varying according to the
                    shade required. The after-process for polishing is the same as that already
                    described.</p>
                <p>Ffll the green ground as in the case of the white, adding lamp-black to make it
                    of a lead colour, the quantity employed being in proportion to the shade
                    required. When filled up and smoothed, take emerald-green ground in turpentine,
                    and add a small quantity of mixing varnish to it, so that the green may be flat,
                    for it will require three coats, as the green has a very little body. It is then
                    smoothed and rendered fit for working on. If a dark hue is wanted, take
                    Brunswick green, which may be made lighter by adding a little chrome-yellow; or
                    darker, by adding Prussian blue and black. This green is more easily produced
                    than any other. Varnish and polish the article as before described.</p>
                <p>Take white lead ground in turpentine, and add crimson-lake and Prussian blue,
                    according to the shade wanted. The article is then coated, varnished, and
                    polished, in the same way as the red. All the above grounds may be enriched by
                    giving each a coat of thin primitive colours ground in turpentine, and mixed up
                    with fine clear mixing varnish. These are crimson-lake for red, yellow-lake for
                    yellow, Prussian blue for blue, verdigris for green, and lake and blue for
                    purple.</p>
                <p>To produce damask grounds for white, when the ground is fit for working on, take
                    fine dial varnish for size, so that it may not discolour the ground, and size
                    the device. Let it stand till it slightly attaches itself to the finger; then
                    take a piece of shamoy leather, dip it in silver powder, and shade the device
                    with it, when it will appear like damask.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944614?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4614-0524"/>
                <p>For obtaining red or erimson, after the ground has been smoothed with the eommon
                    vermilion, take japanners’ gold size, thin, and size the device; when it adheres
                    to the finger, take orange-bronze and shade it as above. This being dry, coat it
                    with crimson-lake ground in turpentine and mixed with fine polishing varnish;
                    polish it as usual, and a rieh damask ground will appear.</p>
                <p>This ground must be a very light yellow. Use size and silver powder, the same as
                    in the case of the white; eoat it with yellow-lake ground in turpentine and
                    mixed with polishing varnish; coating, varnishing, and polishing it as
                    usual.</p>
                <p>Make the ground a very light blue, almost approaching to white; use the size and
                    silver as in the above case; take Prussian blue ground in turpentine and mixed
                    with polishing varnish, and coat it to the shade required, then varnish and
                    polish it as usual.</p>
                <p>Make a light bluish-green with verdigris and white lead ground, use size and
                    silver as in the case of the white, then take verdigris ground in terpentine,
                    and mix it with slow-drying varnish, to prevent it from cracking, as the
                    verdigris is very brittle; coat it to the shade wanted, and varnish and polish
                    it as usual.</p>
                <p>Make a ground of crimson lake and Prussian blue mixed with white lead, very
                    light; then take lake and blue ground in turpentine and mixed with polishing
                    varnish; eoat it to the shade required, size and silver it as in the case of
                    white, and varnish and polish it as usual.</p>
                <p>Beautiful grounds are produced with the silver powder; and devices on black
                    grounds with either of the above eolours, which greatly enrich the appearance of
                    the deep or pale gold ornaments that are wrought upon then.</p>
                <p>All the above coloured grounds may be produced on metals in the same way, with
                    the exception of the white. In filling up metals, take Venetian red ground in
                    turpentine or tar spirits, add as mueh japan as will give it body enough, so as
                    not to craek, and afterwards eoat the article till it is filled up; then smooth
                    it down with lump pumice-stone. Put it into the stove till dry every time it is
                    coated, then lay on the ground colour as before mentioned.</p>
                <p>With regard to sizing and gilding on japan grounds, take the gloss off the part
                    that is to be worked on, by which means the size will be better seen. In
                    ornamenting any article, as, for instance, a tea-tray, with various golds,
                    bronze, and colour, proeeed thus: After tracing or drawing out the ornaments,
                    size the parts for your deep gold first, and then gild them, the parts for the
                    pale gold being also gilt; and eare must be taken that the size has but a slight
                    adhesive feel before the gold is put on. If bronze shaded is introduced, size
                    the part first, and then take a hair pencil and dip it into the bronze or gold
                    powder gently’; then rub the sized part, and it will produce a soft shade. If it
                    is to be solid bronze, let it be nearly dry; rub the sized part gently over with
                    a piece of shamoy leather dipped in bronze, then warm the tray, and rub the part
                    over smartly, when it will appear solid with a metallic lustre. After all is
                    gilt and bronzed, take a common pen and eteh up all the finer parts of the
                    ornament with it; but for the stronger parts take a fine eamel-hair pencil
                    dipped in blaek, to open up the ornament. The gold may be shaded with terre
                    senna, and then put into the stove till dry, when it may be varnished and
                    polished in the usual way.</p>
                <p>In putting on raised work, take Chinese vermilion two parts, and white lead two
                    parts; mix them thick together with turpentine, adding a small quantity of japan
                    so as to make it adhere to the ground. Then take a long hair pencil and dip it
                    amongst the raising, keeping the peneil upright so as to feed the point.
                    Although the raising appear flat or dull, it will take a bright polish by
                    rubbing it with the finger, after which it is sized and gilt.</p>
                <p>In imitating Japanese or Chinese, this must be done on gloss or polished ground.
                    As this kind of work is not varnished, a little oil-colour may be mixed with the
                    gold size, sueh as white lead or chrome-yellow, which will enable the fine lines
                    to be better seen, and make the work more elosely resemble gilding.</p>
                <p>In painting on japan work, either oil or varnish colour may be used. The varnish
                    colour looks clearest, and is most showy, but it requires great practice to
                    blend the colours so as to appear soft; oil-colour is at present that most
                    frequently used.</p>
                <p>In varnishing white wood-work, or work covered with paper, take sheep-skin size
                    in a liquid state, dip into it a eamel-hair flat brush, and come over the work
                    swiftly with it, so as not to wash up the painting. When this is dry, take hard
                    white spirit varnish and a eamel-hair flat brush, and eoat the work over
                    smartly. It will appear whitish at first, but it will beeome clear as it dries.
                    After it has received four eoats, let it stand for a day, until small cracks
                    appear all over it. Rub the gloss off the work, or any knots, with the dry
                    fingers, and then wipe it clean; after whieh give three or four coats more, when
                    the varnish will appear full and flowing. Allow it to stand for a day or two,
                    then take a piece of woollen cloth wet with water, dip it in ground
                    pumiee-stone, and smooth down the work with it, and then wipe it clean. After
                    this take a pieee of woollen cloth and dip it in rottenstone ground in sweet
                    oil, with whieh rub the work till a gloss appears. After wiping it, dip a piece
                    of fine flannel in sweet oil mixed with flour, and rub the work smartly; powder
                    it with dry flour, then rub it quickly off with the palms of the hands, and a
                    brilliant gloss will appear.</p>
                <p>In japanning paper after it comes out of the dip-stove, it must be eoated till a
                    full flowing body of japan is produced. In polishing the above, care must be
                    taken that the ground is not overheated in the rubbing. If it be brought up with
                    amber varnish, it must stand till it be thoroughly cool, otherwise the
                    attraction of the ground will draw the size out of the pencil before the work
                    can be executed. As black japan is generally the colour that paper-grounds are
                    filled up with, it greatly depends on the japan or varnish being rieh or old, as
                    either will produce a good gloss to the number of coats given. For any other
                    colour that is required, rub down the above ground smooth; for the first coat
                    let it be white, but tinged a little with the eolour wanted, unless it be
                    marone. The first eoat must be a light-olive colour smoothed down, thinly eoated
                    with crimson lake; if a dark marone, purple-lake is the pigment employed. The
                    best polishing varnish ought to be used in the finishing. Paper trays are
                    brought up in boards, sheet above sheet, with paste, to the thickness required,
                    with the exception of tĥe edges, which are done upon iron moulds, and then taken
                    off, planed, glued, and nailed together, like a pieee of wood. With regard to
                    Bristol board, or any other paper, it is japanned in the usual manner, with a
                    first coat of sheep-skin size to make it bear out.</p>
