                    rend="italic                     smallcaps"> Jesus,</hi> a famous religious
                    order of the Roman Catholic church, founded by Inigo de Loyola, called also
                    Ignatius Loyola. The plan which this fanatic formed of its constitution and laws
                    was suggested, as he gave out, and as his followers still teach, by the
                    immediate inspiration of heaven. But, notwithstanding this high pretension, his
                    design met at first with violent opposition. The pope, to whom Loyola had
                    applied for the sanction of his authority to confirm the institution, referred
                    his petition to a committee of cardinals; and as they represented the
                    establishment as not only unnecessary, but dangerous, Paul refused to grant his
                    approbation. At last, however, Loyola removed all his scruples by an offer which
                    it was impossible for any pope to resist. He proposed, that besides the three
                    vows of poverty, chastity, and monastic obedience, which are common to all the
                    orders of regulars, the members of his society should take a fourth vow of
                    obedience to the pope, binding themselves to go whithersoever he should command
                    them for the service of religion, and without requiring any thing from the holy
                    see for their support. At a time when the papal authority had received a severe
                    shock by the revolt of so many nations from the Romish church; at a time when
                    every part of the popish system was attacked with so much violence and success;
                    the acquisition of a body of men thus peculiarly devoted to the see of Rome, and
                    whom it might set in opposition to all its enemies, was an object of the highest
                    consequence. Paul instantly perceiving this, confirmed the institution of the
                    Jesuits by his bull, granted the most ample privileges to the members of the
                    society, and appointed Loyola to be the first general of the order. The event
                    fully justified Paul’s discernment, in expecting such beneficial consequences to
                    the see of Rome from this institution. In less than half a century, the society
                    obtained establishments in every country that adhered to the Roman Catholic
                    church; its power and wealth increased amazingly; the number of its members
                    became great; their character as well as accomplishments were still greater; and
                    the Jesuits were celebrated by the friends and dreaded by the enemies of the
                    Catholic faith, as the most able and enterprising order in the church.</p>
                <p>The constitution and laws of the society were perfected by Laines and Aquaviva,
                    the two generals who succeeded Loyola; men far superior to their master in
                    abilities and in the science of government. They framed that system of profound
                    and artful policy which distinguishes the order. The large infusion of
                    fanaticism mingled with its regulations should be imputed to Loyola its founder.
                    Many circumstances concurred in giving a peculiarity of character to the order
                    of Jesuits, and in forming the members of it not only to take a greater share in
                    the affairs of the world than any other body of monks, butalso to acquire
                    superior influence in the conduct of them.</p>
                <p>The primary object of almost all the monastic orders is to separate men from the
                    world, and from any concern in its affairs. In the solitude and silence of the
                    cloister, the monk is called to work out his own salvation by extraor <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192944991" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4991-0553"/> dinary acts of
                    mortification and piety. He is dead to the world, and ought not to mingle in its
                    transactions. He can be of no benefit to mankind but by his example and by his
                    prayers. The Jesuits, on the contrary, were taught to consider themselves as
                    formed for action. They were chosen soldiers, bound to exert themselves
                    continually in the service of God, and of the pope his vicar upon earth.
                    Whatever tended to instruct the ignorant, whatever could be of use to reclaim or
                    to oppose the enemies of the holy see, was their proper object. That they might
                    have full leisure for this active service, they were totally exempted from those
                    functions the performance of which forms the chief business of other monks. They
                    appeared in no processions; they practised no rigorous austerities; they did not
                    consume one half of their time in the repetition of tedious offices. But they
                    were required to attend to all the transactions of the world, on account of the
                    influence which these might have upon religion; they were directed to study the
                    dispositions of persons in high rank, and to cultivate their friendship; and, by
                    the very constitution as well as genius of the order, a spirit of action and
                    intrigue was infused into all its members.</p>
                <p>As the object of the society of Jesuits differed from that of the other monastic
                    orders, the diversity was no less in the form of its government. The other
                    orders might be considered as voluntary associations, in which whatever affected
                    the whole body was regulated by the common suffrage of all its members. The
                    executive power was vested in the persons placed at the head of each house or of
                    the whole society; but the legislative authority resided in the community.
                    Affairs of moment, relating to particular houses, were determined in conventual
                    chapters; but such as respected the whole order were considered in general
                    congregations. But Loyola, full of the ideas of implicit obedience, which he had
                    derived from his military profession, provided that the government of his order
                    should be purely monarchical. A general, chosen for life by deputies from the
                    several provinces, possessed power which was supreme and independent, extending
                    to every person and to every case. He, by his sole authority, nominated
                    provincials, rectors, and every other officer employed in the government of the
                    society, and he could remove them at pleasure. In him was vested the sovereign
                    administration of the revenues and funds of the order. Every member belonging to
                    it was at his disposal; and by his uncontrollable mandate he could impose upon
                    them any task, or employ them in whatsoever service he pleased. To his commands
                    they were required to yield not only outward obedience, but even to resign to
                    him the inclinations of their own wills and the sentiments of their own
                    understandings. They were to listen to his injunctions as if these had been
                    uttered by Christ himself. Under his direction they were to be mere passive
                    instruments, like clay in the hands of the potter, or like dead carcasses
                    incapable of resistance. Such a singular form of policy could not fail to
                    impress its character upon all the members of the order, and to give a peculiar
                    force to all its operations. There is not in the annals of mankind any example
                    of such a perfect despotism, exercised not over monks shut up in the cells of a
                    monastery, but over men dispersed amongst all the nations of the earth.</p>
                <p>As the constitutions of the order vested in the general absolute dominion over
                    all its members, they carefully provided for his being perfectly informed with
                    respect to the character and abilities of his subjects. Every novice who offered
                    himself as a candidate for entering into the order was obliged to manifest his
                    conscience to the superior, or a person appointed by him; and required to
                    confess not only his sins and defects, but to discover the inclinations, the
                    passions, and the bent of his soul. This manifestation they were required to
                    renew every six months. The society, not satisfied with penetrating in this
                    manner into the innermost recesses of the heart, directed each member to observe
                    the words and actions of the novices. They were constituted spies upon their
                    conduct, and were bound to disclose every thing of importance concerning them to
                    the superior. In order that this scrutiny into their character might be as
                    complete as possible, they served a long noviciate, during which they passed
                    through the several gradations of ranks in the society; and they must have
                    attained the full age of thirty-three years before they could be admitted to
                    take the final vows, by which they became professed members. By these various
                    methods, the superiors, under whose immediate inspection the novices were
                    placed, acquired a thorough knowledge of their dispositions and talents. In
                    order that the general, who was the soul which animated and moved the whole
                    society, might have under his eyε every thing necessary to inform or direct him,
                    the provincials and heads of the several houses were obliged to transmit to him
                    regular and frequent reports concerning the members under their inspection. In
                    these they descended into minute details respecting the character of each
                    person, his abilities natural or acquired, his temper, his experience in
                    affairs, and the particular department for which he was best fitted. These
                    reports, when digested and arranged, were entered into registers kept on
                    purpose, that the general might at one comprehensive view survey the state of
                    the society in every corner of the earth; observe the qualifications and talents
                    of its members; and thus choose, with perfect information, the instruments which
                    his absolute power could employ in any <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> service
                    for which he thought fit to destine them.</p>
                <p>As it was the professed intention of the order of Jesuits to labour with
                    unwearied zeal in promoting the salvation of men, this engaged them of course in
                    many active functions. From their first institution, they considered the
                    education of youth as their peculiar province; they <hi rend="superscript">
                    7</hi> aimed at being spiritual guides and confessors; they preached frequently
                    in order to instruct the people; and they set out as missionaries to convert
                    unbelieving nations. The novelty of the institution, as well as the singularity
                    of its objects, procured the order many admirers and patrons. The governors of
                    the society had the address to avail themselves of every circumstance in its
                    favour; and in a short time the number as well as influence of its members
                    increased prodigiously. Before the expiration of the sixteenth century, the
                    Jesuits had obtained the chief direction of the education of youth in every
                    catholic country of Europe. They had become the confessors of almost all its
                    monarchs; an office of no small importance in any reign, but, under a weak
                    prince, superior even to that of the minister himself. They were the spiritual
                    guides of almost every person eminent for rank or power. They possessed the
                    highest degree of confidence and interest with the papal court, as the most
                    zealous and able champions of its authority. The advantages which an active and
                    enterprising body of men might derive from all these circumstances are obvious.
                    They formed the minds of men in their youth, and they retained an ascendant over
                    them in their advanced years. They possessed, at different periods, the
                    direction of the most considerable courts in Europe. They mingled in all
                    affairs; they took part in every intrigue and revolution. The general, by means
                    of the extensive intelligence which he received, could regulate the operations
                    of the order with the most perfect discernment; and, by means of his absolute
                    power, could carry them on with the utmost vigour and effect.</p>
                <p>Along with the power of the order, its wealth continued to increase. Various
                    expedients were devised for eluding the obligation of the vow of poverty. The
                    order acquired ample possessions in every catholic country; and, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192945004" xml:id="kp-eb0712-5004-0554"/>by the number as well as
                    magnificence of its public buildings, together with the value of its property,
                    moveable or real, it vied with the most opulent of the monastic fraternities.
                    Besides the sources of wealth common to all the regular clergy, the Jesuits
                    possessed one which was peculiar to themselves. Under pretext of promoting the
                    success of their missions, and of facilitating the support of their
                    missionaries, they obtained a special license from the court of Rome to trade
                    with the nations which they laboured to convert. In consequence of this, they
                    engaged in an extensive and lucrative commerce both in the East and West Indies.
                    They opened warehouses in different parts of Europe, in which they vended their
                    commodities. Not satisfied with trade alone, they imitated the example of other
                    commercial societies, and aimed at obtaining settlements. They accordingly
                    acquired possession of a large and fertile province in the southern continent of
                    America, and reigned as sovereigns over some hundred thousand subjects.</p>
                <p>Unhappily for mankind, the vast influence which the order of Jesuits acquired by
                    all these different means was often exerted with the most pernicious effect.
                    Such was the tendency of that discipline observed by the society in forming its
                    members, and such were the fundamental maxims in its constitution, that every
                    Jesuit was taught to regard the interest of the order as the capital object to
                    which every consideration was to be sacrificed. This spirit of attachment to
                    their order, the most ardent perhaps that ever influenced any body of men, is
                    the characteristic principle of the Jesuits, and serves as a key to the genius
                    of their policy as well as the peculiarities in their sentiments and
                    conduct.</p>
                <p>As it was for the honour and advantage of the society, that its members should
                    possess an ascendancy over persons in high rank or of great power, the desire of
                    acquiring and preserving such a direction of their conduct with greater facility
                    led the Jesuits to propagate a system of relaxed and pliant morality, which
                    accommodates itself to the passions of men, justifies their vices, tolerates
                    their imperfections, and authorizes almost every action that the most audacious
                    or crafty politician would wish to perpetrate.</p>
                <p>As the prosperity of the order was intimately connected with the preservation of
                    the papal authority, the Jesuits, influenced by the same principle of attachment
                    to the interests of their society, were the most zealous patrons of those
                    doctrines which tend to exalt ecclesiastical power upon the ruins of civil
                    government. They attributed to the court of Rome a jurisdiction as extensive and
                    absolute as was claimed by the most presumptuous pontiffs in the dark ages. They
                    contended for the entire independence of ecclesiastics on the civil magistrates.
                    They published such tenets concerning the duty of opposing princes -who were
                    enemies of the catholic faith, as countenanced the most atrocious crimes, and
                    tended to dissolve all the ties which connect subjects with their rulers.</p>
                <p>As the order derived both reputation and authority from the zeal with which it
                    stood forth in defence of the Romish church against the attacks of the
                    Reformers, its members, proud of this distinction, considered it as their
                    peculiar function to combat the opinions and to check the progress of the
                    Protestants. They made use of every art, and employed every weapon against them.
                    They set themselves in opposition to every gentle or tolerating measure in their
                    favour; and they incessantly stirred up against them all the rage of
                    ecclesiastical and civil persecution.</p>
                <p>Monks of other denominations have indeed ventured to teach the same pernicious
                    doctrines, and have held opinions equally inconsistent with the order and
                    happiness of civil society. But, from reasons which are obvious, they either
                    delivered such opinions with greater reserve or propagated them with less
                    success. Whoever recollects the events which have happened in Europe during two
                    centuries, will find that the Jesuits may justly be considered as responsible
                    for most of the pernicious effects arising from that corrupt and dangerous
                    casuistry, from those extravagant tenets concerning ecclesiastical power, and
                    from that intolerant spirit, which have been the disgrace of the church of Rome
                    throughout that period, and which have brought so many calamities upon civil
                    societv.</p>
                <p>But, amidst many bad consequences flowing from the institution of this order,
                    mankind, it must be acknowledged, have derived from it some considerable
                    advantages. As the Jesuits made the education of youth one of their capital
                    objects, and as their first attempts to establish colleges for the reception of
                    students were violently opposed by the universities in different countries, it
                    became necessary for them, as the most effectual method of acquiring the public
                    favour, to surpass their rivals in science and industry. This prompted them to
                    cultivate with extraordinary ardour the study of ancient literature. It put them
                    upon various methods for facilitating the instruction of youth; and, by the
                    improvements which they made in education, they contributed so much towards the
                    progress of polite learning, that upon this account they have merited well of
                    society. Nor has the order of Jesuits been successful only in teaching the
                    elements of literature; it has likewise produced eminent masters in many
                    branches in science, and can alone boast of a greater number of ingenious
                    authors than all the other religious fraternities taken together.</p>
                <p>But it is in the new world that the Jesuits exhibited the most wonderful display
                    of their abilities, and contributed most effectually to the benefit of the human
                    species. The conquerors of that unfortunate portion of the globe had nothing in
                    view but to plunder, to enslave, and to exterminate its inhabitants. The Jesuits
                    alone made humanity the object of their settling there. About the beginning of
                    the seventeenth century, they obtained admission into the fertile province of
                    Paraguay, which stretches across the southern continent of America, from the
                    bottom of the mountains of Potosi to the confines of the Spanish and Portuguese
                    settlements on the banks of the river La Plata. They found the inhabitants in a
                    state very little different from that which takes place amongst men when they
                    first begin to unite together; strangers to the arts, subsisting precariously by
                    hunting or fishing, and hardly acquainted with the first principles of
                    subordination and government. The Jesuits set themselves to instruct and to
                    civilize these savages. They taught them to cultivate the ground, to rear tame
                    animals, and to build houses. They brought them to live together in villages.
                    They trained them to arts and manufactures. They made them taste the sweets of
                    society, and accustomed them to the blessings of security and order. These
                    people became the subjects of their benefactors, who governed them with a tender
                    attention, resembling that with which a father directs his children. Respected
                    and beloved almost to adoration, a few Jesuits presided over some hundred
                    thousand Indians. They maintained a perfect equality amongst all the members of
                    the community. Each of them was obliged to labour, not for himself alone, but
                    for the public. The produce of their fields, together with the fruits of their
                    industry of every species, were deposited in common storehouses, from which each
                    individual received every thing necessary for the supply of his wants. By this
                    institution, almost all the passions which disturb the peace of society, and
                    render the members of it unhappy, were extinguished. A few magistrates, chosen
                    for the most part by the Indians themselves, watched over the public
                    tranquillity, and secured obedience to the laws. The sanguinary punishments
                    frequent under other governments were unknown. An admonition from a Jesuit, a
                    slight mark of infamy, or, upon some singular occasion, a few lashes with a
                    whip, were sufficient to maintain good order amongst these innocent and happy
                    people.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945017" xml:id="kp-eb0712-5017-0555"/>
                <p>But even in this meritorious effort of the Jesuits for the good of mankind, the
                    genius and spirit of their order mingled and were discernible. They plainly
                    aimed at establishing in Paraguay an independent empire, subject to the society
                    alone, and which, by the superior excellence of its constitution and police,
                    could scarcely have failed to extend its dominion over all the southern
                    continent of America. With this view, in order to prevent the Spaniards or
                    Portuguese in the adjacent settlements, from acquiring any dangerous influence
                    over the people within the limits of the province subject to the society, the
                    Jesuits endeavoured to inspire the Indians with hatred and contempt of these
                    nations. They cut off all intercourse between their subjects and the Spanish or
                    Portuguese settlements. They prohibited any private trader of either nation from
                    entering their territories. When they were obliged to admit any person in a
                    public character from the neighbouring governments, they did not permit him to
                    have any conversation with their subjects; and no Indian was allowed even to
                    enter the house where these strangers resided, unless in the presence of a
                    Jesuit. In order to render any communication between them as difficult as
                    possible, they industriously avoided giving the Indians any knowledge of the
                    Spanish or of any other European language; but encouraged the different tribes
                    which they had civilized to acquire a certain dialect of the Indian tongue, and
                    laboured to make that the universal language throughout their dominions. As all
                    these precautions, without military force, would have been insufficient to
                    render their empire secure and permanent, they instructed their subjects in the
                    European arts of war. They formed them into bodies of cavalry and infantry,
                    completely armed and regularly disciplined. They provided a great train of
                    artillery, as well as magazines stored with all the implements of war. Thus they
                    established an army so numerous and well appointed, as to be formidable in a
                    country where a few sickly and ill-disciplined battalions composed all the
                    military force kept on foot by the Spaniards or Portuguese.</p>
                <p>Such were the laws, the policy, and the genius of this formidable order, of
                    which, however, a perfect knowledge has only been of late attainable. Europe had
                    observed, for two centuries, the ambition and power of the order. But whilst it
                    felt many fatal effects of these, it could not fully discern the causes to which
                    they were to be imputed. It was unacquainted with many of the singular
                    regulations in the political constitution or government of the Jesuits, which
                    formed the enterprising spirit of intrigue that distinguished its members, and
                    elevated the body itself to such a height of power. It was a fundamental maxim
                    with the Jesuits, from their first institution, not to publish the rules of
                    their order. These they kept concealed as an impenetrable mystery. They never
                    communicated them to strangers, nor even to the greater part of their own
                    members. They refused to produce them when required by courts of justice; and,
                    by a strange solecism in policy, the civil power in different countries
                    authorized or connived at the establishment of an order of men, whose
                    constitution and laws were concealed with a solicitude which alone was a good
                    reason for excluding them. During the prosecutions carried on against them in
                    Portugal and France, the Jesuits were so inconsiderate as to produce the
                    mysterious volumes of their institute. By the aid of these authentic records,
                    the principles of their government may be delineated, and the sources of their
                    power investigated, with a degree of certainty and precision which, previously
                    to that event, it was impossible to attain. The pernicious effects, however, of
                    the spirit and constitution of this order rendered it early obnoxious to some of
                    the principal powers in Europe, and gradually brought on its downfall. The
                    Emperor Charles V. saw it expedient to check its progress in his dominions; it
                    was expelled from England by a proclamation of James I. in 1604, from Venice in
                    1606, from Portugal in 1759, from France in 1764, from Spain and Sicily in 1767,
                    and it was totally suppressed and abolished by Pope Clement XIV. in 1773. In
                    1801, Pius VII. reestablished the society of Jesuits, but only for Russia; and
                    in 1814, the same pope re-established it throughout the whole earth. The
                    following judicious and discriminating character of the order is from the
                    masterly pen of Sir James Mackintosh, and forms the conclusion of the eighth
                    chapter of his Historical View of the Reign of James II.</p>
                <p>“The party which had now the undisputed ascendant was denominated Jesuits, as a
                    term of reproach, by the enemies of that famous society in the church of Rome,
                    as well as among the Protestant communions. A short account of their origin and
                    character may facilitate a faint conception of the admiration, jealousy, fear,
                    and hatred, the profound submission or fierce resistance, which that formidable
                    name once inspired. Their institution originated in pure zeal for religion,
                    glowing in the breast of Loyola, a Spanish soldier; a man full of imagination
                    and sensibility, in a country where wars, rather civil than foreign, waged
                    against unbelievers for ages, had rendered a passion for spreading the catholic
                    faith a national point of honour, and blended it with the pursuit of glory as
                    well as with the memory of past renown. The legislative forethought of his
                    successors gave form and order to the product of enthusiasm, and bestowed laws
                    and institutions on their society which were admirably fitted to its various
                    ends. Having arisen in the age of the reformation, they naturally became the
                    champions of the church against her new enemies. Being established in the period
                    of the revival of letters, instead of following the example of the unlettered
                    monks, who decried knowledge as the mother of heresy, they joined in the general
                    movement of mankind; they cultivated polite literature with splendid success;
                    they were the earliest, and, perhaps, the most extensive reformers of European
                    education, which, in their schools, made a larger stride than it has at any
                    succeeding moment; and, by the just reputation of their learning, as well as by
                    the weapons with which it armed them, they were enabled to carry on a vigorous
                    contest against the most learned impugners of the authority of the church.
                    Peculiarly subjected to the see of Rome by their constitution, they became
                    ardently devoted to its highest pretensions, in order to maintain a monarchical
                    power, of which they felt the necessity for concert, discipline, and energy in
                    their theological warfare.</p>
                <p>“While the nations of the Spanish peninsula hastened with barbaric chivalry to
                    spread religion by the sword in the newly explored regions of the East and the
                    West, the Jesuits alone, the great missionaries of that age, either repaired or
                    atoned for the evils caused by the misguided zeal of their countrymen. In India
                    they suffered martyrdom with heroic constancy'. They penetrated through the
                    barrier which Chinese policy opposed to the entrance of strangers; they
                    cultivated the most difficult of languages with such success as to compose
                    hundreds of volumes in it; and, by the public utility of their scientific
                    acquirements, they obtained toleration, patronage, and personal honours, from
                    that jealous government: and the natives of America, who generally felt the
                    superiority of the European race only in a more rapid or a more gradual
                    destruction, and to whom even the excellent Quakers dealt out little more than
                    penurious justice, were, under the paternal rule of the Jesuits, reclaimed from
                    savage manners, and instructed in the arts and duties of civil life. At the
                    opposite point of society they were fitted, by their release from conventual
                    life, and their allowed intercourse with the world, for the perilous office of
                    secretly guiding the conscience of princes. They maintain the highest station as
                    a religious body in the literature of catholic countries. No other association
                    ever sent forth so many disciples who reached such eminence in departments so
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945030" xml:id="kp-eb0712-5030-0556"/>various and
                    unlike. While some of their number ruled the royal penitents at Versailles or
                    the Escurial, others were teaching the use of the spade and the shuttle to the
                    naked savages of Paraguay; a third body daily endangered their lives in an
                    attempt to convert the Hindus to Christianity; a fourth carried on the
                    controversy against the reformers; a portion were at liberty to cultivate polite
                    literature, and the greater part continued to be employed either in carrying on
                    the education of catholic Europe, of which they were the first improvers, or in
                    the government of their society, in ascertaining the ability and disposition of
                    the junior members, so that well-qualified men might be selected for the
                    extraordinary variety of offices in their immense commonwealth. The most famous
                    constitutionalists, the most skilful casuists, theablest schoolmasters, the most
                    celebrated professors, the best teachers of the humblest mechanical arts, the
                    missionaries who could most bravely encounter martyrdom, or who with most
                    patient skill could infuse the rudiments of religion into the minds of ignorant
                    tribes or prejudiced nations, were the growth of their fertile schools. The
                    prosperous administration of such a society for two centuries is probably the
                    strongest proof afforded from authentic history that an artificially formed
                    system of government and education is capable, under some circumstances, of
                    accomplishing greater things than the general experience of it would warrant us
                    in expecting from it. Even here, however, the materials were supplied and the
                    first impulse given by enthusiasm; and in this memorable instance the defects of
                    such a system are discoverable. The whole ability of the members being
                    constantly, exclusively, and intensely directed to the various purposes of the
                    order, the mind of the Jesuits had not the leisure or liberty necessary for
                    works of genius, or even for discoveries in science, to say nothing of original
                    speculations in philosophy, which are interdicted by implicit faith. That great
                    society, which covered the world for two hundred years, has no names which can
                    be opposed to those of Pascal and Racine, produced by the single community of
                    Port Royal, which was in a state of persecution during the greater part of its
                    short existence. But this remarkable peculiarity amounts perhaps to little more
                    than that they were more eminent in active than in contemplative life. A far
                    more serious objection is the manifest tendency of such a system, while it
                    produces the precise excellences aimed at by its mode of cultivation, to raise
                    up all the neighbouring evils with a certainty and abundance, a size and
                    malignity, unknown to the freer growth of nature. The mind is narrowed by the
                    constant concentration of the understanding; those who are habitually intent on
                    one object, learn at last to pursue it at the expense of others equally or more
                    important. The Jesuits, the reformers of education, sought to engross it, as
                    well as to stop it at their own point. Placed in the front of the battle against
                    the Protestants, they caught a more than ordinary portion of that theological
                    hatred against their opponents which so naturally springs up where the greatness
                    of the community, the fame of the controversialist, and the salvation of
                    mankind, seem to be at stake. Affecting more independence in their missions than
                    other religious orders, they were the formidable enemies of episcopal
                    jurisdiction; and thus armed against themselves the secular clergy, especially
                    in Great Britain, where they were the chief missionaries. Intrusted with the
                    irresponsible guidance of kings, they were too often betrayed into a compliant
                    morality; excused probably to themselves by the great public benefits which they
                    might thus obtain by the numerous temptations which seemed to palliate royal
                    vices, and by the real difficulties of determining, in many instances, whether
                    there was more danger of deterring such persons from virtue by unreasonable
                    austerity, or of alluring them into vice by unbecoming relaxation. This
                    difficulty is indeed so great, that casuistry has, in general, vibrated between
                    these extremes, rather than rested near the centre. To exalt the papal power,
                    they revived the scholastic doctrine of the popular origin of government, that
                    rulers might be subject to the people, while the people themselves, on all
                    questions so difficult as those which relate to the limits of obedience, were to
                    listen with reverential submission to the judgment of the sovereign pontiff, the
                    common pastor of sovereigns and subjects, the unerring oracle of humble
                    Christians in all cases of perplexed conscience. The ancient practice of
                    excommunication, which, in its original principle, was no more than the
                    expulsion from a community of an individual who did not observe its rules, being
                    stretched so far as to interdict intercourse with offenders, and, by
                    consequence, to suspend duty towards them, became, in the middle age, the means
                    of absolving nations from obedience to excommunicated sovereigns. Under these
                    specious colours both popes and councils had been guilty of alarming
                    encroachments on the civil authority. The church had indeed never solemnly
                    adopted the principle of these usurpations into her rule of faith or of life,
                    though many famous doctors gave them a dangerous continuance. She had not
                    condemned, or even disavowed, those equally celebrated divines who resisted
                    them; and though the court of Rome undoubtedly patronized opinions so favourable
                    to its power, the catholic church, which had never pronounced a collective
                    judgment on them, was still at liberty to disclaim them, without abandoning her
                    haughty claim of exemption from fundamental error. On the Jesuits, as the most
                    staunch of the polemics who struggled to exalt the church above the state, and
                    who ascribed to the supreme pontiff an absolute power over the church, the odium
                    of these do ’ ctrines principally fell. Among reformed nations, and especially
                    in Great Britain, the greatest of them, the whole order was regarded as
                    incendiaries, perpetually plotting the overthrow of protestant governments, and
                    as immoral sophists, who employed their subtle casuistry to silence the remains
                    of conscience in tyrants of their own persuasion. Nor was the detestation of
                    Protestants rewarded by general popularity in catholic countries. All other
                    regulars envied their greatness; the universities dreaded their acquiring a
                    monopoly of education. Monarchs, the most zealously catholic, though they often
                    favoured individual Jesuits, often also looked with fear and hatred on a society
                    who would reduce them to the condition of vassals of the priesthood; and in
                    France, the magistrates, who preserved their integrity and dignity in the midst
                    of general servility, maintained a more constant conflict with these formidable
                    adversaries of the independence of the state and the church. The kings of Spain
                    and Portugal envied their well-earned authority, in the missions of Paraguay and
                    California, over districts which they had conquered from the wilderness. The
                    impenetrable mystery in which a part of their constitution was enveloped, though
                    it strengthened their association, and secured the obedience of its members, was
                    an irresistible temptation to abuse power, and justified the apprehensions of
                    temporal sovereigns, while it opened an unbounded scope for heinous accusations.
                    Even in the eighteenth century, when many of their peculiarities had become
                    faint, and they were perhaps little more than the most accomplished, opulent,
                    and powerful of religious orders, they were charged with spreading secret
                    confraternities over France. Their greatness became early so invidious as to be
                    an obstacle to the advancement of their members; and it was generally believed
                    that if Bellarmine had belonged to any other than the most powerful order in
                    Christendom, he would have been raised to the chair of Peter. The court of Rome
                    itself, for w hom they had sacrificed all, dreaded auxiliaries who were so
                    potent that they might easily become masters. These champions of the papal
                    monarchy were regarded with <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945043"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-5043-0557"/>jealousy by popes whose policy they aspired to
                    dictate or control. Temporary circumstances at this time created a more than
                    ordinary alienation between the Jesuits and the Roman court. They, in their
                    original character of a force raised for the defence of the church against the
                    Lutherans, always devoted themselves to the temporal sovereign who was at the
                    head of the catholic party; they were attached to Philip II. at the time when
                    Sextus V. dreaded his success; and they now placed their hopes on Louis XIV., in
                    spite of his patronage, for a time, of the independent maxims of the Gallican
                    church. On the other hand, Odeschalchi, who governed the church under the name
                    of Innocent XI., feared the growing power of France, resented the independence
                    of the Gallican church, and was, to the last degree, exasperated by the insults
                    offered to him in his capital by the command of Louis. He was born in the
                    Spanish province of Lombardy, and, as an Italian sovereign, he could not be
                    indifferent to the bombardment of Genoa, and to the humiliation of that
                    respectable republic, by requiring a public submission from the doge at
                    Versailles. As soon, then, as James became the pensioner and creature of Louis,
                    the resentments of Odeschalchi prevailed over his zeal for the extension of the
                    church.</p>
                <p>" The Jesuits had treated himself, and those of his predecessors who hesitated
                    between them and their opponents, with offensive liberty. While they bore sway
                    at Versailles and St James’s, they were on that account less obnoxious to the
                    Roman court. Men of wit remarked at Paris, that things would never go well till
                    the pope became a Catholic, and King James a Huguenot. Such were the intricate
                    and dark combinations of opinions, passions, and interests, which placed the
                    nuncio in opposition to the most potent order of the church, and completed the
                    alienation of the British nation from James, by bringing on the party which now
                    ruled his councils the odious and terrible name of Jesuits.”</p>
