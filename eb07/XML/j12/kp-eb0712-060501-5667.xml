                <p><label type="entry">JOINERY</label>.</p>
                <p>Is one of the useful arts which contributes most materially to the comfort and
                    convenience of man. As the arts of joinery and carpentry are often followed by
                    the same individual, it appears, at first view, natural to conclude, that the
                    same principles are common to both these arts. But a closer examination of their
                    objects leads us to a different conclusion.</p>
                <p>The art of Carpentry is directed almost wholly to the support of weight or
                    pressure; and, therefore, its principles must be found in the mechanical
                    sciences. In a building, it includes all the rough timber-work necessary for
                    support, division, or connection; and its proper object is to give firmness and
                    stability. See the Article <hi rend="smallcaps">Carpentry.</hi></p>
                <p>The art of Joinery has for its object the addition in a building of all the fixed
                    wood-work necessary for convenience or ornament. It is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Intestinum</hi><hi rend="italic">opus</hi> of Vitruvius, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Menuiserie</hi><hi rend="italic">des bâtvrnens</hi> of the
                    French.</p>
                <p>The joiner’s works are many of them of a complicated nature, and require to be
                    executed in an expensive material; therefore joinery requires much skill in that
                    part of geometrical science which treats of the projection and description of
                    lines, surfaces, and solids, as well as an intimate knowledge of the structure
                    and nature of wood.</p>
                <p>It may also be remarked, that the rough labour of the carpenter renders him in
                    some degree unfit to produce that kind of accurate and neat workmanship which is
                    expected from a modern joiner.</p>
                <p>In early times, very little that resembles modern joinery was known; every part
                    was rude, and joined in the most artless manner. The first dawnings of the art
                    appear in the thrones, stalls, pulpits, and screens of our cathedrals and
                    churches; but, even in these, it is of the most simple kind, and is indebted to
                    the carver for every thing that is worthy of regard. Whether in these monuments,
                    the carver and the joiner had been one and the same person we cannot now
                    determine, though we imagine, from the mode of joining in some of them, that
                    this was the case.</p>
                <p>During several centuries joinery seems to have been gradually improving, but
                    nothing appears to have been written on the art before 1677, when Mr Joseph
                    Moxon, a Fellow of the Royal Society, published a work, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Mechanick Exercises,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Doctrine of
                    Handyworks.</hi> In this work the tools, and common operations in joinery, are
                    described, with a collection of the terms then in use. It must have been a
                    valuable work at that time, but to a master in the art it would convey little if
                    any thing that was new. Sash-windows were introduced into England some time
                    before the date of Moxon’s work, but he has not noticed them. According to the
                    observations of Dr Thomson this important improvement has not yet found its way
                    into Sweden.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Travels in Sweden,</hi> p. 8.</p></note></p>
                <p>About the beginning of the last century several works of a most interesting kind
                    made their appearance. Forms began to be introduced in architecture, which could
                    not be executed at a moderate expense without the aid of new principles, and
                    these principles were discovered and published by practical joiners. As might
                    naturally be expected, these authors had but confused notions, with a scanty
                    portion of geometrical knowledge; and, accordingly, their descriptions are often
                    obscure, and sometimes erroneous.</p>
                <p>The hand-rails of stairs offered many difficulties, and an imperfect attempt to
                    remove them was first made by Halfpenny, in his <hi rend="italic">Art of Sound
                    Building,</hi> published in 1725. Price, the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >British Carpenter,</hi> published in 1733, was more successful, and his remarks
                    show a considerable degree of knowledge of the true nature and object of his
                    researches.</p>
                <p>The publication of Price’s work must have produced a considerable sensation among
                    joiners, for it was soon followed by many other works of different degrees of
                    merit. Of these the works of Langley and Pain were the most popular.</p>
                <p>The establishment of the principles of joinery, on the sound basis of geometrical
                    science, was reserved for Nicholson. In his <hi rend="italic">Carpenters’
                    Guide,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Carpenter and Joinerd Assistant,</hi>
                    published in 1792, he has made some most valuable corrections and additions to
                    the labours of his predecessors.</p>
                <p>Corresponding improvements were also made in the practice of joinery, for which
                    we are much indebted to the late Mr James Wyatt. This celebrated architect kept
                    together some of the best workmen in London, who were looked up to with a degree
                    of emulation by young men, which had a beneficial effect on the progress of
                    joinery. But the art is still far short of perfection. We conceive that many of
                    those operations, on which the soundness of work chiefly depends, might be done
                    with greater exactness, and less labour, by means of tools contrived for these
                    purposes. The truth and certainty which have been introduced in block-making, is
                    sufficient to encourage some one to extend the same manner of mortising in
                    joinery. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Block-Machinery.</hi></p>
                <p>The principles of joinery were cultivated in France by a very different class of
                    writers. In the extensive work of Frezier, entitled <hi rend="italic">Coupé des
                    Pierres</hi><hi rend="italic">ct</hi><hi rend="italic">des Bois,</hi> 3 vols.
                    4to, 1739, all the leading principles are given and explained with tedious
                    minuteness, offering a striking contrast to the brevity of our English writers.
                    The first elementary work on that part of geometrical science, which contains
                    the principles of joinery, appeared in France in 1705, from the pen of the
                    celebrated Gaspard Monge, who gave it the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Géométrie</hi><hi rend="italic">Descriptive.</hi> Much of what has been given
                    as new in English works, had been long known on the Continent; but there does
                    not appear to have been much, if any, assistance derived from these foreign
                    works by any writer prior to Nicholson.</p>
                <p>The latest French work which treats of joinery is Rondelet’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >L’Art de Batir.</hi> It is also the best foreign work on the subject that we
                    have seen; but it is not at all adapted to the state of joinery in England. In
                    practice, the French joiners are very much inferior to our own Their work is
                    rough, slovenly, and often clumsy, and at the best is confined to external
                    effect. The neatness, soundness, and accuracy, which is common to every part of
                    the works of an English joiner, is scarcely to be found in any part of the works
                    of a French one. The little correspondence, in point of excellence, between
                    their theory and practice, leads us to think that their theoretical knowledge is
                    confined to architects, engineers, &amp;c. in - stead of being diffused among
                    workmen, as it is in this country.</p>
                <p>In cabinet-work the French workmen are certainly superior, at least as far as
                    regards external appearance; but when use, as well as ornament, is to be
                    considered, our own countrymen must as certainly carry away the palm.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945680" xml:id="kp-eb0712-5680-0606"/>
                <p>The appearance of French furniture is much indebted to a superior method of
                    polishing, which is now generally known in this country.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The method of making and using the French
                    polish is minutely described in Dr Thomson’s <hi rend="italic">Αηηαls of
                    Philosophy,</hi> vol. xi. p∙ H9 and 371.</p></note> For many purposes, however,
                    copal varnish (such as coachmakers use) is preferable; it is more durable, and
                    bears an excellent polish.</p>
                <p>Geometry is useful in all, and absolutely necessary in some, parts of a joiner’s
                    business; but it is absurd to encounter difficulties in execution, and to
                    sacrifice good taste, convenience, economy, and comfort, merely for the purpose
                    of displaying a little skill in that science. It is, however, a common fault
                    among such architects as are better acquainted with geometrical rules than with
                    the production of visible beauties, to form designs for no other purpose than to
                    create difficulties in the execution.</p>
                <p>But, when geometrical science is properly directed, it gives the mind so clear a
                    conception of the thing to be executed, that the most intricate piece of work
                    may be conducted with all the accuracy it requires.</p>
                <p>The practice of joinery is best learned by observing the methods of good workmen,
                    and endeavouring to imitate them. But the sooner a workman begins to think for
                    himself the better; he ought always to endeavour to improve on the processes of
                    others; either so as to produce the same effect with less labour, or to produce
                    better work.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>We intend, in this article, to give a plain and simple exposition of the most
                    valuable principles of the art of joinery, which will, we hope, place many parts
                    of the practice under a new point of view, and ultimately tend to improve
                    them.</p>
                <p>Cabinet-making, or that part of the art of working in wood which is applied to
                    furniture, has little affinity with joinery, though the same materials and tools
                    be employed in both. Correctness and strict uniformity are not so essential in
                    moveables as in the fixed parts of buildings; they are also more under the
                    dominion of fashion, and therefore are not so confined by rules as the parts of
                    buildings.</p>
                <p>Cabinet-making offers considerable scope for taste in beautiful forms, and also
                    in the choice and arrangement of coloured woods. It requires considerable
                    knowledge in perspective, and also that the artist should be able to sketch with
                    freedom and precision.</p>
                <p>If the cabinet-maker intend to follow the higher departments of his art, it will
                    be necessary to study the different kinds of architecture, in order to make
                    himself acquainted with their peculiarities, so as to impress his works with the
                    same character as the rooms they arc to furnish.</p>
                <p>In as far as regards materials, and the principles of joining work, the
                    cabinet-maker will find some useful information in the second and third sections
                    of this article. In ornamental composition he may derive much benefit from

                    Drawings.</hi></p>
                <p>1. In this section we propose to lay before the reader the most important part of
                    the principles of describing, on a plane surface, the lines necessary for
                    determining bevels, forming moulds, or any other purpose required in the
                    practice of joinery. The limits within which such an article as joinery must be
                    confined, in a work like this, will not permit us to enter much into detail on
                    the various points to be illustrated in this section; but we hope, by judicious
                    selection, to place under one point of view the principles that are most useful
                    to the joiner.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Projection of Bodies.</hi><hi rend="italic">2.</hi> A clear
                    idea of the nature of projection is so essential in making working drawings,
                    that, in our endeavours to illustrate it, we cannot proceed upon principles too
                    simple. In the first stage of such an inquiry, experiment furnishes at once the
                    most clear and satisfactory evidence, particularly to those who are not familiar
                    with mathematical subjects.</p>
                <p>If some small pieces of wood, or pieces of wire, were joined together, so as to
                    represent the form of a solid body, a cube for example, and if this figure were
                    held between the sun and the surface of a plane board, then the shadow of the
                    figure upon the board would be its projection upon that plane. From this simple
                    experiment, it will appear, that the projection of any line placed in the
                    direction of the sun’s rays will be a point: the projection of any line parallel
                    to tĥc plane will be of the same length as the line itself, and the projection
                    of any line inclined to the plane will be always shorter than that line.</p>
                <p>3. We have supposed the board to be placed at any angle with the direction of the
                    rays of the sun; but, for our present purpose, it is sufficient to consider them
                    to fall perpendicularly upon it; hence it is obvious, that to project a straight
                    line upon a plane, a perpendicular to the plane should be let fall from each end
                    of the line, and the line joining the points where the perpendiculars meet the
                    plane will be the projection required.</p>
                <p>When a projection is made upon a horizontal plane, it is usually called <hi
                    rend="italic">a plan</hi> of the body. When the projection is upon a vertical
                    plane, it may be an <hi rend="italic">elevation</hi> or a <hi rend="italic"
                    >section</hi> of the body; it is a section when a portion is supposed to be cut
                    off; and the plane of projection is usually parallel to the plane of the
                    section.</p>
                <p>4. Bodies may be divided into three classes, according to the kinds of surfaces
                    by which they are bounded. The first class, comprehending those which are
                    bounded by plane surfaces, such are cubes, prisms, pyramids, and the like. The
                    second class contains those which are bounded in part by plane surfaces, and the
                    rest by curved surfaces, as cylinders, cones, &amp;c. The third, including those
                    which are bounded by curved surfaces only, as spheres, spheroids, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The projections of the first class of bodies will consist of straight lines;
                    those of the second class, of curved as well as straight lines; and those of the
                    third class, of curved lines only.</p>
                <p>4. Let ABCD, and CDEF, Fig. 1, be two plane surfaces, connected by a joint at CD,
                    so that while the plane CDEF remains horizontal, the plane AB CD may be placed
                    perpendicular to it, and thus represent a vertical plane. Then, if a line be so
                    placed in space that <hi rend="italic">αb</hi> is its projection on the vertical
                    plane, and <hi rend="italic">a'b</hi> ’ its projection on the horizontal plane,
                    its projection on any other vertical plane, HGEC, may be determined. This is
                    easily effected, for we have seen, that if a perpendicular be drawn <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192945693" xml:id="kp-eb0712-5693-0607"/> to the plane from
                    each end of the given line, they will give the positions of the ends of the line
                    in the projection (Art. 3). Now, the same thing will be done, by drawing <hi
                    rend="italic">a'a"</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b'b"</hi> perpendicular to EC, and
                    setting off the points <hi rend="italic">a!'</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b"</hi>
                    at the same height above EC respectively, as <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> are above CD, then the line <hi rend="italic">a"b"</hi> is
                    the projection required.</p>
                <p>The heights may be transferred from one vertical plane to another when they are
                    both supposed to be laid flat, by drawing the line IC, so as to bisect the angle
                    ECD, and if <hi rend="italic">cb</hi> be parallel to CD, meeting IC in c, then a
                    line drawn parallel to EC, from the point <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> will give
                    the height of the point <hi rend="italic">b",</hi> and so may be found the
                    height of any other point</p>
                <p>6. In the particular case we have drawn, none of the projections represents the
                    real length of the given line. To obtain this length, draw <hi rend="italic"
                    >a'</hi><hi rend="italic">e</hi> parallel to CD, and with the radius <hi
                    rend="italic">ab'</hi> describe the arc <hi rend="italic">b'e</hi> cutting <hi
                    rend="italic">a'</hi><hi rend="italic">e</hi> in e; draw <hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi> perpendicular to CD, cutting the line <hi rend="italic">cb</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">d∙,</hi> join <hi rend="italic">ad,</hi> and it is the length of
                    the given line.</p>
                <p>The real lengths of lines frequently are not given, therefore another general
                    method of finding them will be found useful, and which may be stated as follows:
                    the length of an inclined line projected upon a plane is equal to the
                    hypothenuse of a right-angled triangle, of which one side is the projection upon
                    the plane, and the other side is the difference between the perpendicular
                    distances of the extremes of the line from the plane.</p>
                <p>7. In fig. 2, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">b</hi> ’ <hi
                    rend="italic">cd</hi> represents the horizontal projection, or plan, of a
                    rectangular surface, and the elevation <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> shows its
                    inclination; and its projection against another vertical plane, making any angle
                    ECD vγith the former, or plane of elevation, is shown by <hi rend="italic"
                    >a"b''dd'.</hi> GC being perpendicular to EC, and A C perpendicular to CD, the
                    heights may be transferred by means of arcs of circles described from C as a
                    centre. This is a better method than that by bisecting the angle given in fig.
                    1; but neither of them so good, in practice, as setting of the heights with die
                    compasses, or with a lath. In our figures it is desirable to shew the connection
                    of corresponding parts as much as possible; therefore, the reader will bear in
                    mind that many of the operations we describe may be done with fewer lines when
                    the operator is fully master of his subject.</p>
                <p>8. It may be further noticed in this place, that when a point is to be determined
                    in one line by the intersection of another, the lines should cross each other as
                    nearly at right angles as possible; for, when the intersecting lines cross very
                    obliquely, a point cannot be determined with any tolerable degree of
                    accuracy.</p>
                <p>9. A curved line can seldom be projected by any other means than by finding a
                    number of points through which the projected line must be drawn, or finding a
                    series of tangents to the section. In giving an example of the projection of a
                    body bounded by a curved surface, we shall select a case of frequent occurrence
                    in practice, referring to the <hi rend="italic">Geometric Descriptive</hi> of
                    Monge, for more general methods.</p>
                <p>Let ABC be part of the plan of the base of a solid, fig. 3, and FED its end
                    elevation; the upper side of the solid being bounded by the curved surface FD.
                    This solid is supposed to be cut at AB by a plane perpendicular to the base, and
                    our intention is to shew the form of the section.</p>
                <p>Draw EH parallel to BA, and GIHE will represent the plane upon which the section
                    is to be projected. Set off any convenient number of points, 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c.
                    in the given curve FD,from each of these points draw a line perpendicular to ED,
                    to meet BA; and from the points in BA, thus determined, erect perpendiculars,
                    which will cut HE at right angles. Make GH equal to FE, and set off the points
                    1, 2, 3, &amp;c. in G HE at the same distances respectively from HE as the
                    corresponding points 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. in EFD are from the line ED. A curve being
                    drawn through the points E, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, G will complete the section. In large
                    works, the joiner will often find it useful to put nails in the points, and to
                    bend a regular lath against the nails; with the assistance of the lath, the
                    curve may be drawn with more regularity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A simple and convenient instrument for this purpose is
                    described in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Society of Arts,</hi> for
                    1817, vol. xxxv. p. 109.</p></note></p>
                <p>If the curve FD were very irregular, or a mixed line of straight parts and curved
                    ones, the same method would determine the section; all the caution required is,
                    that a sufficient number of points should be fixed upon in the given curve; and
                    upon the proper selection of these points much of the accuracy of the section
                    will depend.</p>
                <p>The angle ribs of groined ceilings, the angle ribs for coved ceilings, or
                    brackets for large cornices, and the angle cantilevers for balconies or other
                    works of a similar kind, are found by this method. If FD be the cross rib of a
                    groin, then GE will be the form of the corresponding angle rib. Also, if the
                    angle of a room be represented by LAC, and FD be the cove for the ceiling, then
                    GE will be the proper angle rib for such a cove.</p>
                <p>In some cases, the section may be determined by means of the properties of the
                    given curve, when the nature of that curve is known. Thus the oblique section of
                    a cylinder is an ellipse, and the sections of a cone are certain figures
                    depending on the direction of the plane of section (see the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Conic Sections);</hi> but if an architect were confined to the
                    use of geometrical curves, there would be small scope, indeed, for a display of
                    taste in his art; therefore the joiner must generally have recourse to the
                    simple method we have described.</p>
                <p>10. The section of a body may often be drawn by a more simple and direct process;
                    and yet where the principle is still the same. Thus the section of the half
                    cylinder ACB, in fig. 4, being compared with the process in fig. 3, will be
                    found to be the same in every respect, excepting in the position of the parts of
                    the figure. In fig. 4, ACB is the end or plan of the cylinder, and DE the
                    inclination of the plane by which it is cut. Let the ordinates <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> 1, <hi rend="italic">b2,</hi> &amp;c. in the plan, be drawn
                    perpendicular to AB, and continued till they cut the inclined line DE. Also draw
                    the ordinates <hi rend="italic">a'</hi> 1 ’, <hi rend="italic">b'2',</hi>
                    &amp;c. perpendicular to the line DE, and make the distances <hi rend="italic"
                    >a'</hi> ∖ <hi rend="italic">', b'21,</hi> &amp;c. respectively equal to the
                    corresponding distances <hi rend="italic">al, b2,</hi> &amp;c. upon the plan.
                    Through the points E, 1, <hi rend="italic">2',</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                    &amp;c.</hi> draw the curve DFE.</p>
                <p>As the curve DFE is an ellipse, when ABC is a circle, in that case it will be
                    better to draw an ellipse with a trammel, <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945706"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-5706-0608"/>or any other machine that produces the curve by a
                    continued motion. (See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Elliptograph.)</hi> DE
                    is the transverse, and Fc'the semi-conjugate axis of the ellipse.</p>
                <p>The most important application of the case, in fig. 4, is to the hand-railing of
                    a staircase, with a curvilineal wellhole, or opening down the middle. For, if
                    AE, or <hi rend="smallcaps">ízB,</hi> show the breadth of the rail, Ac C <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> B would be its plan; and D√Fα'E the form of a mould,
                    commonly called a face mould, for cutting out the rail by, when DE is the
                    inclination of the plank. We cannot, however, proceed directly to the subject of
                    stair-rails, without considering the development of the surfaces of bodies.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Development of Surfaces.</hi></p>
                <p>11. To develope the surface of a solid, is to draw, on some plane surface, a form
                    that would cover it. If this form were drawn upon paper, and the paper were cut
                    to it, the paper, so cut, ought to cover exactly the surface of the solid. Now,
                    in joinery, it is often required that a mould should apply to a curved surface;
                    and, therefore, the development of that surface upon a flexible material gives
                    the form of the mould.</p>
                <p>The covering of a square pyramid may be found by erecting a perpendicular from
                    the middle of one of the sides of its base, as from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in
                    the side AB, fig. 5. Upon this perpendicular set off <hi rend="italic">a</hi> C
                    equal to the slant height of the pyramid; then, with the radius AC and centre C
                    describe the arc A3, and set off the distance AB three times upon the arc. Join
                    the points C3, C2, Cl, CA, and CB, and draw the lines 32, 21, 1 A, which
                    determine the covering required.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, that we could develope a pyramid of which the base might have any
                    number of sides, by the same method; and that a near approximation to the
                    development of a right cone might be effected by the same means, which, in fact,
                    is the means usually employed. But the following method of spreading out the
                    surface of a cone will be found more correct.</p>
                <p>12. Let ABC, fig. 6, be the elevation of a cone, and ADB half the plan of its
                    base. With the radius AC describe the arc AE, which will be the line bounding
                    the development; and, to find the length of the arc, or rather the angle
                    containing it, multiply 3Ô0 by the radius <hi rend="italic">A a</hi> of the
                    base, and divide the product by the slant height AC of the cone; the quotient
                    will be the number of degrees in the arc AE, when the surface ACE exactly covers
                    the whole cone. Thus, let <hi rend="italic">A a</hi> 3fi0 y 12</p>
                <p>be 12 feet, and AC 40 feet; then = 108 degrees,</p>
                <p>40°</p>
                <p>and making ACE an angle of 108 degrees, we have the sector ACE that would cover
                    the cone.</p>
                <p>This applies to the soffits of windows, where they are enlarged towards the
                    inside, to admit light more freely than square recesses would do. If <hi
                    rend="italic">αb</hi> be the width of the soffit, draw <hi rend="italic">cb</hi>
                    parallel to AB, and from the centre C describe the arc <hi rend="italic"
                    >cd.</hi> Then half the developement AecJwill be the mould for the soffit; or
                    the form of a veneer that would cover it.</p>
                <p>13. The development of a cylinder is also of use in forming the mould for
                    soffits, but is still more useful in the construction of stairs; and, as we are
                    obliged to consider it as a prism with numerous sides, it is obvious that anv
                    other body of a like kind may be developed by the same means.</p>
                <p>Let ABC, fig. 7, be the plan of half a cylinder, and A ’ E its height. Divide the
                    curve ACB into any convenient number of equal parts, and let these parts be set
                    off from C to A, and from C to B'. When the curve is a semicircle, divide the
                    diameter AB into the proposed number of parts, and make αD equal to
                    three-fourths of the radius. From D, through the points A and B, draw the lines
                    DA', DB', then A'B' is nearly equal to the curve ACB stretched out 5<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This has been shown by Dr C.
                    Hutton, in his <hi rend="italic">Mathematical Tracts,</hi> vol. i. p.
                    160.</p></note> and, by drawing a line from D through each of the divisions in
                    AB, the line A'B' will be divided into the same number of equal parts.</p>
                <p>In either case, erect a perpendicular from each point of division, and EA'B ʹ F
                    will be the development of the surface.</p>
                <p>If we suppose A'B' to be divided into the number of steps that would be necessary
                    to ascend from B to A, in a circular staircase, the development of the ends of
                    these steps may be drawn as in the upper part of the figure. The projection G of
                    the cylinder, with the lines of the development drawn upon it, and the ends of
                    the steps, shews the waving line formed by the nosings of the steps, and
                    consequently by the hand-rail of a circular staircase.</p>
                <p>When a part of a cylinder is cut off by a plane, the line of section will be a
                    curved line upon the development, as is shewn in the lower part of the
                    development, fig. 7∙ The faint lines shew the manner of finding the edge of the
                    covering, and is the same as finding a mould for a soffit formed by an arch
                    cutting obliquely into a straight wall.</p>
                <p>14. In an oblique cone, the lines drawn on its surface, from its base to the
                    vertex, would be of different lengths; and as those lengths are not shewn by the

                    being preserved at the crown or top, as at the sides of the window; in such
                    cases the soffit is made level at the crown, or with such an inclination only as
                    will prevent the architrave cutting into the cornice of the room.</p>
                <p>Let AB CD, fig. 9, be the plan of the space to be covered with a soffit, ED the
                    arch of half the opening, which is in its proper position when set
                    perpendicularly over the line CD; and let F c be the height of the arch over AB.
                    Produce AC and BD to meet at G; set off <hi rend="italic">c m</hi> equal to <hi

                    inclination of the soffit at the highest part of it. Divide the arch ED into any
                    number of equal parts (in our example we have only divided it into three parts),
                    and from each point of division let fall a perpendicular to CD, meeting the line
                    CD in the points 1, 2. Through these points draw the lines G α, G <hi

                    a centre, determines another point in the edge of the covering. Proceed in the
                    same manner till half the development of one edge be completed; the other edge
                    will be obtained by drawing lines through the points <hi rend="italic">s, t,

                <p>As both sides are the same, the soffit mould for one side requires only to be
                    reversed for the other side. If the soffit be level at the crown, the process
                    may be rendered shorter; but, where it is possible to get space for a slight
                    inclination, the appearance of the soffit is always materially improved.</p>
                <p>If the plan of the wall be circular, find the development of the arc ED as
                    before, and transfer the distances from CD of the points in the curved wall, to

                <p>16. The development of a sphere, or globe, can be effected only by an approximate
                    process, as it is impossible to apply a plane surface so as to touch more than
                    one point at a time; but various methods may be employed which are useful in
                    forming spherical surfaces.</p>
                <p>A sphere may be divided into numerous zones, the surface of each zone may be
                    considered as that of the frustum of a cone, and developed in the same manner as
                    has been described for a portion of a cone in art. 12. The upper part of fig. 10
                    shews half a sphere developed in this manner: and when it is divided into very
                    narrow zones, the covering found by this process has some advantages, in
                    practice, that are peculiar to it.</p>
                <p>17- The surface of a sphere may also be developed by inscribing it in a cylinder,
                    LMNO, fig. 10, and considering a small portion, or gore, ABD, to coincide with
                    the surface of the cylinder. Then, if the portion ABD, considered as part of a
                    cylinder, be developed by the process described in art. 13, one gore, AB <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> will be obtained; and by dividing the circumference of the
                    sphere into any number of equal parts, and making AB equal to one of these
                    parts, the same mould will serve for the whole of the sphere.</p>
                <p>Another method of developing a sphere consists in supposing it to be a
                    polyhedral, or many-sided figure; but this method has no advantage over the
                    preceding ones, while it has the inaccuracies of both of them.</p>
                <p>In lining and boarding domes, the position of the ribs to which the boards are to
                    be fixed will determine the method of developement that ought to be adopted; but
                    the form of the veneers for a spherical surface may be determined by either
                    method.</p>

                    according to the line AB, so that it may turn upon that line as a joint; then,
                    to whatever angle, CED, fig. 11, the parts may be turned, the lines EC and ED
                    will be always in the same plane. Also, a line FD, drawn from any point D, in
                    the line ED, to any point, F, in the line EC, will be always in the same plane.
                    From these self-evident properties of planes, it is easy to determine the angle
                    formed by any two planes, when two projections, or one projection and the
                    development of the surfaces, are given.</p>

                <p>21. When an inclined or raking moulding is intended to .join with a level
                    moulding, at. either an exterior or an interior angle, the form of the level
                    moulding being given, it is necessary that the form of the inclined moulding
                    should be determined, so that the corresponding parts of the surfaces of the two
                    mouldings should meet in the same plane, this plane being the plane of the
                    mitre. It may be otherwise expressed, by saying that the mouldings should mitre
                    .truly together.</p>
                <p>If the angle be a right angle, the method of finding the form of the inclined
                    moulding is very easy; and as it is not very difficult for any other angle, it
                    may perhaps be best to give a general method, and to illustrate it by examples

                <p>Let ABC, fig. 13, be the plan of the angle of a body, which is to have a level
                    moulding on the side AB; and this level moulding is to mitre with an inclined

                    the moulding. The moulding thus found will mitre with the given one; also,
                    supposing the inclined moulding to be given, the level one may be found in like
                    manner.</p>
                <p>If the angle ABC be less than a right angle, the whole process remains the same;

                    are necessary when the angle is any other than a right angle.</p>
                <p>22. It is in pediments, chiefly, that the method of forming raking mouldings is
                    of use. Fig. 14 represents part of]</p>
                <p>a pediment; ∙AB is that part· of t∩e evel moulding which mitres with the inclined

                    the lower members of the raking cornice stop upon it, and, therefore, do not
                    require to be traced from the other.</p>
                <p>In that part of the cornice marked AB, set off a sufficient number of points; and

                <p>When a pediment has a cornice with modillions, the caps of the modillions require

                <p>23. It sometimes happens, that an inclined base-moulding has to mitre with a
                    level one at an angle; and as the same thing occurs still more frequently with
                    other moulding, such as cornices under the steps of stairs, &amp;c. we shall
                    give another example, which will serve still farther to illustrate the method of
                    proceeding in such cases.</p>
                <p>In fig. 15, a raking base-moulding is shewn, where the inclined moulding B is
                    traced to mitre with the horizontal moulding C; and the horizontal moulding A is
                    traced to mitre with the inclined one B. The preceding examples being
                    understood, the lines and letters in the figure will be sufficient to show the
                    mouldings are traced.</p>
                <p>24. Mouldings being almost the only part of modern joiners’ work, which can, in
                    strictness, be called ornamental, and consequently that in which the taste of
                    the workman is most apparent, we shall offer a remark or two that may have their
                    use. The form of a moulding should be distinct and varied, forming a bold
                    outline of a succession of curved and flat surfaces, disposed so as to form
                    distinct masses of light and shade. If the mouldings be of considerable length,
                    a greater distinction of parts is necessary than in short ones.</p>
                <p>Mouldings for the internal part of a building should not, however, have much
                    projection; the proper degree of shade may always be given, with better effect,
                    by deep sinkings judiciously disposed. The light in a room is not sufficiently
                    strong to relieve mouldings, without resorting to this method; and hence it is
                    that quirked mouldings are so much esteemed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II.— <hi rend="smallcaps">On the Construction of
                    Joiners’ Work.</hi></p>
                <p>25. The goodness of joiners’ work depends chiefly upon the care that has been
                    bestowed in joining the materials. In carpentry, framing owes its strength to
                    the form and position of its parts; but in joinery, the*strength of a frame
                    depends upon the strength of the joinings. The importance, therefore, of fitting
                    the joints together as accurately as possible, is obvious. It is very desirable,
                    that a joiner should be a quick workman; but it is still more so that he should
                    be a good one; that he should join his materials with firmness and accuracy;
                    that he should make surfaces even and smooth, mouldings true and regular, and
                    the parts intended to move so that they may be used with ease and freedom.</p>
                <p>Where dispatch is considered as the chief excellence of a workman, it is not
                    probable that he will strive to improve himself in his art, further than to
                    produce the greatest quantity of barely tolerable work with the least quantity
                    of labour. In some articles of short duration, dispatch in the manufacture may
                    be of greater importance; but in works that ought to remain firm for years, it
                    certainly is bad economy to spare a few shillings’ worth of labour at the risk
                    of being annoyed with a piece of bad work as long as it will hold together.</p>
                <p>We have seen, with no small degree of pleasure, the effect of encouraging good
                    workmanship in the construction of machinery, and would recommend that a like
                    encouragement should be given to superior workmen in other arts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Joining Angles.</hi></p>
                <p>* 26. When the length of a joint at an angle is not considerable, it is
                    sufficient to cut the joint, so that when the parts are joined, the plane of the
                    joint shall bisect the angle. This kind of joint is shew n for two different
                    angles, by fig. 16.</p>
                <p>When an angle of considerable length is to be joined, and the kind of work does
                    not require a joining should be concealed, fig. 17 is often employed; the small
                    bead renders the appearance of the joint less objectionable, because any
                    irregularities, from shrinkage, are not seen in the shade of the quirk of the
                    bead.</p>
                <p>A bead upon an angle, where the nature of the thing does not determine it to be
                    an arris, is attended with many advantages; it is less liable to be injured, and
                    admits of a secure joint, without the appearance of one. Fig. 18 shews a joint
                    of this description, which should always be used in passages.</p>
                <p>Fig. 19 represents a very good joint for an exterior angle, whether it be a long
                    or short one. Such a joint may be nailed both ways. But the joint represented
                    byffiġ. 20 is superior to it; the parts being drawn together by the form of the
                    joint itself, they can be fitted with more accuracy, and joined with certainty.
                    The angles of pilasters are often joined, as fig. 20.</p>
                <p>Interior angles are commonly joined, as shewn by fig. 21. If the upper or lower
                    edge be visible, the joint is mitred, as in fig. 16, at the edge only, the other
                    part of the joint being grooved, as in fig. 21. In this manner are put together
                    the skirting and dado at the interior angles of rooms, the backs, and
                    backlinings of windows, the jambs of door-ways, and various other parts of
                    joiners’ work.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Framing.</hi></p>
                <p>27∙ Frames in joinery are usually connected by mortise tenon joints, with gooves
                    to receive panneis. Doors, window-shutters, &amp;c. are framed in this manner.
                    The object in framing is, to reduce the wood into narrow pieces, so that the
                    work may not be sensibly affected by its shrink <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192945758" xml:id="kp-eb0712-5758-0612"/>age; and, at the same time,
                    it enables us to vary the surface without much labour.</p>
                <p>From this view of the subject, the joiner will readily perceive, that neither the
                    parts of the frame nor the panneis should be wide. And as the frame should be
                    composed of narrow pieces, it follows, that the panneis should not be very long,
                    otherwise the frame will want strength. The panneis of framing should not be
                    more than 15 inches wide, and 4 feet long, and pannels so large as this should
                    be avoided as much as possible.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Panneis of external doors and shutters may be rendered more
                    secure by boring them, and inserting iron wires. See <hi rend="italic">Trans. of
                    iho Society of Arts,</hi> vol. xxv. p. 106.</p></note> The width of the framing
                    is commonly about one-third of the width of the pannel.</p>
                <p>It is of the utmost importance, in framing, that the tenons and mortises should
                    be truly made. After a mortise has been made with the mortise chisel, it should
                    be rendered perfectly even with a float; an instrument which differs from a
                    single cut, or float file, only by having larger teeth. An inexperienced workman
                    often makes his work fit too tight in one place, and too easy in another, hence
                    the mortise is split by driving the parts together, and the work is never firm;
                    whereas if the tenon fill the mortise equally, without using any considerable
                    force in driving the work together, is is found to be firm and sound. The
                    thickness of tenons should be about one-fourth of that of the framing, and the
                    width of a tenon should never exceed about five times its thickness, otherwise,
                    in wedging, the tenon will become bent, and bulge out of the sides of the
                    mortise. If the rail be wide, two mortises should be made, with a space of solid
                    wood between; fig. 22 shews the tenons, for a wide rail.</p>
                <p>In thick framing, the strength and firmness of the joint is much increased by
                    putting a cross or feather tongue in on each side of the tenon; these tongues
                    are about an inch in length, and arc easily put in with a plough proper for such
                    purposes. The projected figure of the end of a rail, fig. 22, shews these
                    tongues put in, in the style there are grooves ploughed to receive them.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, in thick framing, a double tenon in the thickness is made; but we give
                    the preference to a single one, when tongues are put in the shoulders, as we
                    have described; because a strong tenon is better than two weak ones, and there
                    is less difficulty in fitting one than two.</p>
                <p>The pannels of framing should be made to fill the grooves, so as not to rattle,
                    and yet to allow the pannels to shrink without splitting.</p>
                <p>28. When a frame consists of curved pieces, they are often joined by means of
                    pieces of hard wood called keys. Fig 23 is the head of a Gothic window frame,
                    joined with a key, with a plan of the joint below it. A cross tongue is put in
                    on each side of the key, and the joint is tightened by means of the wedges <hi
                    rend="italic">a a. ,</hi></p>
                <p>It is, however, a better method to join such pieces by means of a screw bolt
                    instead of a key, the cross tongues being used whichever method is adopted.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Joining with Glue.</hi></p>
                <p>29. It is seldom possible to procure boards sufficiently wide for pannels without
                    a joint, on account of heart shakes, which open in drying. In cutting out
                    pannels, for good work, shaken wood should be carefully avoided. That part near
                    the pith is generally the most defective.</p>
                <p>If the pannels be thick enough to admit of a cross or feather tongue in the
                    joint, one should always be inserted, for then, if the joint should fail, the
                    surfaces will be kept even, and it will prevent light passing through.</p>
                <p>Sometimes plane surfaces of considerable width and length are introduced in
                    joiners’ work, as in dado, window backs, &amp;c.; such surfaces are commonly
                    formed of inch, or inch and quarter, boards joined with glue, and a cross or
                    feather tongue ploughed into each joint. When the boards are glued together, and
                    have become dry, tapering pieces of wood, called keys, are grooved in, across
                    the back, with a dovetail groove. These keys preserve the surface straight, and
                    also allow it to shrink and expand with the changes of the weather.</p>
                <p>30. It would be an endless task to describe all the methods that have been
                    employed to glue up bodies of such varied forms as occur in joinery; for every
                    joiner forms methods of his own, and merely from his being most familiar with
                    his own process, he will perform his work, according to it, in a better manner
                    than by another, which, to an unprejudiced mind, has manifestly the advantage
                    over it. The end and aim of the joiner, in all these operations, is to avoid the
                    peculiar imperfections and disadvantages of his materials, and to do this with
                    least expense of labour or material. The straightness of the fibres of wood
                    renders it unfit for curved surfaces, at least when the curvature is
                    considerable. Hence short pieces are glued together as nearly in the form
                    desired as can be, and the apparent surface is covered with a thin veneer; or
                    the work is glued up in pieces that are thin enough to bend to the required
                    form. Sometimes a thin piece of wood is bent to the required form upon a
                    cylinder or saddle, and blocks are jointed and glued upon the back; when the
                    whole is completetely dry it will preserve the form that had been given to it by
                    the cylinder.</p>
                <p>The proper thickness for the pieces to be bent may be easily determined by an
                    easy experiment on a piece of the same kind of wood. Thus, select a piece of
                    wood, of the same kind as that to be used, and bend it as much as it will bear
                    without injury; then ascertain the radius of curvature, and also the thickness
                    of the piece, at the most curved part of it. From these data the proper
                    thickness for any other curve will be determined by the following
                    proportion:</p>
                <p>As the radius of curvature, found by experiment, is to the thickness of the piece
                    tried; so is the radius of any other curve to the thickness of the piece that
                    may be bent into it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>ſhe

                <p>For example, we have found that a piece of straight grained white deal, of an
                    inch in thickness, may be bent, without injury, into a curve of which the radius
                    is 120 radius inches, therefore, 120: 1:: radius: thickness =———-. That 1 <hi
                    rend="italic smallcaps"> £\j</hi> is, a piece of deal of the same quality may be
                    bent into any curve, of which the radius is not less than 120 times its
                    thickness.</p>
                <p>A piece of work glued up in thicknesses should be very well done; but it too
                    often happens that the joints are visible, irregular, and in some places open;
                    therefore other methods have been tried.</p>
                <p>31. If a piece of wood be boiled in water for a certain time, then taken out and
                    immediately bent into any particular form, and it be retained in that form till
                    it be dry, a <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945771" xml:id="kp-eb0712-5771-0613"
                    />permanent change takes place in the mechanical relations of its parts; so that
                    though, when relieved, it will spring back a little, yet it will not return to
                    its natural form.</p>
                <p>The same effect may be produced by steaming wood; but though both these methods
                    have been long practised to a considerable extent in the art of ship-building,
                    we are not aware that any general principles have been discovered, either by
                    experiment or otherwise, that will enable us to apply it to an art like joinery,
                    where so much precision is required. We are not aware that it has been tried;
                    but, before it can be rendered extensively useful, the relation between the
                    curvature to which it is bent, and that which it assumes, when relieved, should
                    be determined, and also the degree of curvature which may be given to a piece of
                    a given thickness.</p>
                <p>The time that a piece of wood should be boiled, or steamed, in order that it may
                    be in the best state for bending, should be made the subject of experiments; and
                    this being determined, the relation between the time and the bulk of the piece
                    should be ascertained.</p>
                <p>For the joiner’s purposes, we imagine, that the process might be greatly
                    improved, by saturating the convex side of each piece with a strong solution of
                    glue, immediately after bending it. By filling, in this manner, the extended
                    pores, and allowing the glue to harden thoroughly before relieving the pieces,
                    they would retain their shape better.</p>
                <p>32. Large pieces of timber should never be used in joinery, because they cannot
                    be procured sufficiently dry to prevent them splitting with the heat of a warm
                    room. Therefore, the external part of columns, pilasters, and works of a like
                    kind, should be formed of thin pieces of dry wood; and, if support be required,
                    a post, or an iron pillar, may be placed within the exterior column. Thus, to
                    form columns of wood, so that they shall not be liable to split, narrow pieces
                    of wood are used, not exceeding five inches in width. These are jointed like the
                    staves of a cask, and glued together, with short blocks glued along at each
                    joint.</p>
                <p>Fig. 24 is a plan of the lower end of a column glued up in staves; the bevel at A
                    is used for forming the staves, that at B is used for adjusting them when they
                    are glued together. A similar plan must be made for the upper end of the column,
                    which will give the width of the upper end of the staves. The bevels taken from
                    the plan, as at A and B, are not the true bevels; but they are those generally
                    used, and are very nearly true, when the columns are not much diminished. To
                    find the true bevels, the principle we have given in art. 19 should be applied.
                    The same method may be adopted for forming large pillars for tables, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>If a column have flutes, with fillets, the joints should be in the fillets, in
                    order to make the column as strong as possible; also, if a column be intended to
                    have a swell in the middle, proper thickness of wood should be allowed for
                    it.</p>
                <p>When columns or pillars are small, they may be made of dry wood; and to secure
                    them against splitting, a hole may be bored down the axis of each column.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fixing Joinerd Work.</hi></p>
                <p>33. We have hitherto confined our remarks to that part of joinery which is
                    performed at the bench; but by far the most important part remains to be
                    considered. For, however well a piece of work may have been prepared, if it be
                    not properly fixed, it cannot fulfil its intended purpose. As in the preceding
                    part, we shall state the general principles that ought to be made the basis of
                    practice, and illustrate those principles by particular examples.</p>
                <p>If the part to be fixed consist of boards jointed together, but not framed, it
                    should be fixed so that it may shrink, or swell without splitting. The nature of
                    the work will generally determine how this may be effected. Let us suppose that
                    a plain back of a window is to be fixed. Fig 25 is a section shewing B the back
                    of the window, A the window-sill, D the floor, and C the skirting. The back is
                    supposed to be prepared, as we have stated in art. 29, and that it is kept
                    straight by a dovetailed key <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Now, let the back be
                    firmly nailed to the window-sill A, and let a narrow piece <hi rend="italic"
                    >d,</hi> with a groove, and cross tongue, in its upper edge, be fixed to bond
                    timbers or plugs in the wall; the tongue being inserted also into a
                    corresponding groove in the lower edge of the back of B.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, that the tongue being loose, the back B may contract or expand, as
                    a pannel in a frame. The dado of a room should be fixed in the same manner. In
                    the principal rooms of a house, the skirting C is usually grooved into the floor
                    D, and fixed only to the narrow piece <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> which is called
                    a ground. By fixing, in this manner, the skirting covers, the joint, which would
                    otherwise soon be open by the shrinking of the back, and from the skirting being
                    grooved into the floor, but not fastened to it, there cannot be an open joint
                    between the skirting and floor. When it is considered, that an open joint, in
                    such a situation, must become a receptacle for dust, and a harbour for insects,
                    the importance of adopting this method of fixing skirting will be apparent.</p>
                <p>In fixing any board above five or six inches wide, similar precautions are
                    necessary; otherwise it is certain to split when the house becomes inhabited. We
                    may, in general, either fix one edge, and groove the other, so as to leave it at
                    liberty, or fix it in the middle, and leave both edges at liberty.</p>
                <p>Sometimes a wide board, or a piece consisting of several boards, may be fixed by
                    means of buttons, screwed to the back, which turn into grooves in the framing,
                    bearers, or joists, to which it is to be fixed. If any shrinking takes place the
                    buttons slide in the grooves. In this manner the landing of stairs are fixed,
                    and it is much the best mode of fixing the top of a table to its frame.</p>
                <p>34. The extension of the principle of ploughing and tonguing work together is one
                    of the most important of the improvements that have been introduced by modern
                    joiners. It is an easy, simple, and effectual method of combination, and one
                    that provides against the greatest defect of timber work, its shrinkage. By
                    means of this method, the bold mouldings of Gothic architecture can be executed
                    with a comparatively small quantity of material; and even in the mouldings of
                    modern architecture it saves much labour. For example, the moulded part of an
                    architrave may be joined with the plain part, as shewn by fig. 26. If this
                    method be compared with the old method of glueing one piece upon another, its
                    advantage will be more evident.</p>
                <p>33. The architraves, skirtings, and surbase mouldings, are fixed to pieces of
                    wool called <hi rend="italic">grounds</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and as the
                    straightness and accuracy of these mouldings must depend upon the care that has
                    been taken to fix the grounds truly; it will appear, that fixing grounds, which
                    is a part often left to inferior workmen, in reality requires much skill and
                    attention; besides, they are almost always the guide for the plasterer. Where
                    the plasterer’s work joins the grounds, they should have a small groove ploughed
                    in the edge to form a key for the plaster.</p>
                <p>36. In our remarks on construction, we must not omit to say a few words on laying
                    floors, because it will give us <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945784"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-5784-0614"/>an opportunity of pointing out a defect which
                    might be easily remedied. The advice of Evelyn, to tack the boards down only the
                    first year, and nail them down for good the next, is certainly the best, when it
                    is convenient to adopt it; but, as this is very seldom the case, we must expect
                    the joints to open more or less. Now these joints always admit a considerable
                    current of cold air, and also, in an upper room, unless there be a counter
                    floor, the ceiling below may be spoiled by spilling a little water, or even by
                    washing the floor. To avoid this, we would recommend a tongue to be ploughed
                    into each joint, according to the old practice. When the boards are narrow, they
                    might be laid without any appearance of nails, in the same way as a dowelled
                    floor is laid, the tongue serving the same purpose as the dowels. In this case
                    we would use cross or feather tongues for the joints. <hi rend="superscript"
                    >;</hi></p>
                <p>There is a method sometimes used in laying floors, which workmen call folding;
                    according to this method, two boards are laid, and nailed at such a distance
                    apart, that the space is a little less than the aggregate width of the boards
                    intended for it; these boards are then put to their places, and, on account of
                    the narrowness of the space left for them, they rise like an arch between its
                    abutments. The workmen force them down by jumping upon them. According-ingly,
                    the boards are never soundly fixed to the joists, nor can the floor be laid with
                    any kind of evenness or accuracy. We merely notice this method here, in order
                    that it may be avoided.</p>
                <p>As boards can seldom be got long enough to do without joints, it is usual, except
                    in very inferior work, to join the ends with a tongued joint, as shewn in fig.
                    27, where B is the joist. The etched board is first laid, and nailed to the
                    joist.</p>
                <p>In oak floors, the ends are forked together sometimes, as shewn at A, fig. 28, in
                    order to render the joints less conspicuous.</p>
                <p>The joints should be kept as distant from one another as possible.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hinging.</hi><hi rend="italic">T].</hi> It requires a
                    considerable degree of care to hang a door, a shutter, or any other piece of
                    work in the best manner. In the hinge, the pin should be perfectly straight, and
                    tndy cylindrical, and the parts accurately fitted together.</p>
                <p>The hinges should be placed so that their axes may be in the same straight line,
                    as any defect in this respect will produce a considerable strain upon the hinges
                    every tirrie the hanging part is moved, which prevents it from moving freely,
                    and is injurious to the hinges.</p>
                <p>In hanging doors, centres are often used instead of hinges; but, on account of
                    the small quantity of friction in centres, a door moves too easily, or so that a
                    slight draft of air accelerates it so much in falling to, that it shakes the
                    building, and is disagreeable. We have seen this in some degree remedied by
                    placing a small, spring to receive the shock of the door.</p>
                <p>The greatest difficulty, in hanging doors, is to make them to clear a carpet, and
                    be close at the bottom when shut. To do this, that part of the floor which is
                    under the door, when shut, may be made to rise above a quarter of an inch above
                    the general level of the floor; which, with placing the hinges so as to cause
                    the door to rise as it opens, will be sufficient, unless the carpet should be a
                    very thick one. Several mechanical contrivances have been used for either
                    raising the door, or adding a part to spring close to the floor as the door
                    shuts. The latter is much the better method. The reader who may be desirous of
                    examining this method, may consult the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the
                    Society of Arts,</hi> (vol. xxvi. p. 196.)</p>
                <p>38. Various kinds of hinges are in use. Sometimes they are concealed, as in the
                    kind of joints called rule joints; others project, and are-intended to let a
                    door fold back over projecting mouldings, as in pulpit doors. When hinges
                    project, the weight of the door acts with an increased leverage upon them, and
                    they soon get out of order, unless they be strong and well fixed.</p>
                <p>The door of a room should be hung so that, in opening the door, the interior of
                    the room cannot be seen through the joint. This may be done by making the joint
                    according to fig. 29∙ The bead should be continued round the door, and a common
                    but-hinge answers for it.</p>
                <p>The proper bevel for the edge of a door or sash may be found by drawing a line
                    from the centre of motion C, fig. 30, to <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> the interior
                    angle of the rebate, draw <hi rend="italic">ed</hi> perpendicular to C <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> which gives the bevel required. In practice, the bevel is
                    usually made less, leaving an open space in the joint when the door is shut;
                    this is done on account of the interior angle of the rebate often being filled
                    with paint.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stairs.</hi></p>
                <p>39. The construction of stairs is generally considered the highest department of
                    the art of joinery, therefore we treat of it under a distinct head.</p>
                <p>The principal object to be attended to in stairs is, that they afford a safe and
                    easy communication between floors of different levels. 'The strength of a stair
                    ought to be apparent as well as real, in order that those who ascend it may feel
                    conscious of safety. In order to make the communication safe, it should be
                    guarded by a railing of proper height and strength; in order that it may be
                    easy, the rise and width, or tread, of the steps should be regular and justly
                    proportioned to each other, with convenient landings; there should be no winding
                    steps, and the top of the rail should be of a convenient height for the
                    hand.</p>
                <p>The first person that attempted to fix the relation between the height and width
                    of a step, upon correct principles, was, we believe, Blondel, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Cours d’Architecture.</hi> If a person walking npon a level plane
                    move over a space, P, at each step, and the height which the same person could
                    ascend vertically, with equal ease, were H; then, if <hi rend="italic">h</hi> be
                    the height of a step, and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> its width; the relation
                    between <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> must be such, that
                    when <hi rend="italic">p</hi> = P, <hi rend="italic">h</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi><hi rend="italic">0</hi>; and when H = <hi rend="italic">h, p = o.</hi>
                    These conditions are satisfied by an equation of the form <hi rend="italic"
                    >h</hi> = H 1 — . Blondel assumes 24</p>
                <p>inches for the value of P, and 12 inches for that of H; substituting these values
                    in our equation, it becomes <hi rend="italic">It</hi><hi rend="italic">— —</hi>
                    (24— <hi rend="italic">p),</hi> which is precisely Blondel’s rule. We do <hi
                    rend="italic">Zi</hi> not think these the true values of P and H; indeed, it
                    would be difficult to ascertain them; but they are so near, and agree so well
                    with our observations on stairs of easy ascent, that they may be taken for the
                    elements of a practical rule. Hence, according as <hi rend="italic">h</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is given, we have A = ļ (24 — <hi rend="italic">p,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">p =</hi> 24 — <hi rend="italic">Th.</hi><hi rend="italic
                    smallcaps"> Zì</hi></p>
                <p>Thus, if the height of a step be six inches, then 24—12= 12, the width or tread
                    for a step that rises six inches.</p>
                <p>40. The forms of staircases are various. In towns, where <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192945797" xml:id="kp-eb0712-5797-0615"/>space cannot be allowed for
                    convenient forms, they are often made triangular, circular, or elliptical, with
                    winding steps, or of a mixed form, with straight sides and circular ends. In
                    large mansions, and in other situations, where convenience and beauty are the
                    chief objects of attention, winding steps are never introduced when it is
                    possible to avoid them. Good stairs, therefore, require less geometrical skill
                    than those of an inferior character.</p>
                <p>The best architectural effect is produced by rectangular Staircases, with
                    ornamented railing and newels. In Gothic structures scarcely any other kind can
                    be adopted, with propriety, for a principal staircase. Modern architecture
                    admits of greater latitude in this respect; the end of the staircase being
                    sometimes circular, and the hand-rail continued, beginning either from a scroll
                    or a newel.</p>
                <p>41. When a rectangular staircase has a continued rail, it is necessary that it
                    should be curved so as to change gradually from a level to an inclined
                    direction. This curvature is called the <hi rend="italic">ramp</hi> of the rail.
                    The plan of a staircase of this kind is represented by AB CD, fig. 31, and fig.
                    32 shews a section of it, supposing it to be cut through at <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab,</hi> on the plan.</p>
                <p>The hand-rail is supposed to begin with a newel at the bottom, and the form of
                    the cap of the newel ought to be determined, so that it will mitre with the
                    hand-rail. Let H, fig. 33, be the section of the hand-rail, and <hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi> the radius of the newel; then the form of the cap may be
                    traced at C by the method we have already described. (Art. 9 and 10.)</p>
                <p>The sections of handrails are of various shapes; some of the most common ones are
                    too small; a hand-rail should never be less than would require a square, of
                    which the side is 2∣ inches, to circumscribe it.</p>
                <p>For the level landings of a staircase the height of the top of the hand-rail
                    should be about 40 inches, and in any part of the inclined rail the height of
                    its upper side above the middle of the width of the· step should be 40 inches
                    less the rise of one step, when measured in a vertical direction.</p>
                <p>To describe the ramps, let <hi rend="italic">rs</hi> be a vertical line drawn
                    through the middle of the width of the step, fig. 32; set <hi rend="italic"
                    >ru</hi> equal to <hi rend="italic">rs,</hi> and draw <hi rend="italic">ut</hi>
                    at right angles with the back of the rail, cutting the horizontal line <hi
                    rend="italic">st</hi> in <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> From the point <hi
                    rend="italic">t,</hi> as a centre, describe the curve of the rail. When there is
                    a contrary flexure, as in the case before us, the method of describing the
                    lesser curve is the same.</p>
                <p>42. The hand-rail of a stair often begins from a scroll·; and that kind of spiral
                    which is called the logarithmic spiral, has been proposed as the best for the
                    purpose. It is shewn⅛y writers on curve lines, that any radial lines drawn from
                    the centre will be cut by the logarithmic spiral in one and the same angle. By
                    means of this property of the curve, it may be described as follows:</p>
                <p>Let C be the centre, fig. 34, and draw AB perpendicular to DE, crossing it in C.
                    Bisect the angles by the lines <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cd.</hi> Draw eB6 to cut CB at the angle proposed for the curve, and to meet
                    CZ&gt; in <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> draw <hi
                    rend="italic">cb</hi> perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">be,</hi> cutting Cc in
                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> draw <hi rend="italic">c a</hi>
                    perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">c</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi> cutting <hi
                    rend="italic">Ċa</hi> in <hi rend="italic">a;</hi> and proceed round with as
                    many revolutions as may be required in the same manner. Then B, E, A, D, F, G,
                    &amp;c. are points in the curve, and the lines <hi rend="italic">eb, cb, ca,
                    ad,</hi> &amp;c. are tangents to the curves at these points. Therefore, the
                    curve may be either drawn by hand, or by means of circular arcs. Also, any
                    number of interior or exterior spirals may be drawn by drawing lines parallel to
                    the tangents, as <hi rend="italic">xy,</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">z,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">eb</hi> were to cross BC at a right angle, the curve would
                    be a circle.</p>
                <p>43. The scrolls and volutes used in architecture are always made to terminate in
                    a circle at the centre; consequently none of the curves described by
                    mathematicians are adapted for these purposes. But the construction we have
                    employed for the logarithmic spiral readily leads to a species of spiral that
                    appears well suited for scrolls or volutes. In the logarithmic spiral the angle
                    of the curve is constant; but imagine the angle to change regularly, and to
                    become a right angle at the point where the circle called the eye begins. This
                    would afford us a regular and pleasing curve, unfolding itself from a circle in
                    the centre. This curve might be called the Architectural Spiral.</p>
                <p>Let C be the centre, fig. 35, and round this centre describe a circle for the eye
                    of the scroll, or volute. Divide this circle into eight equal parts, and draw
                    lines from the centre through the points of division.</p>
                <p>With any radius <hi rend="italic">a</hi> C, and C as a centre, describe the arc
                    <hi rend="italic">ac,</hi> and upon this arc set off any number of equal
                    divisions. The extent of a division must be regulated by the quantity the curve
                    may unfold at each revolution, and the number depends on the number of
                    revolutions.</p>
                <p>Then, beginning at A, draw <hi rend="italic">Ab</hi> perpendicular to <hi

                    number of revolutions. The points A, B, D, E, F, G, and H, in the curve, and the
                    tangents to these points, are found; therefore the curve may be described by
                    hand, or by means of circular arcs.</p>
                <p>The tangents to any interior or exterior spiral will be parallel to the ones
                    first found, and, therefore, any number may be drawn with the greatest
                    facility.</p>

                <p>Neither the logarithmic nor the architectural spiral can be drawn truly by
                    circular arcs; but we shall here point out the principle by which such spirals
                    may be drawn. When a spiral is drawn by means of circular arcs only, the centres
                    of the adjoining arcs must always be upon the same straight line; and the
                    regularity of the curve will depend on the number of arcs employed to describe
                    one revolution. Let the proposed distance between the revolutions be divided
                    into as many equal parts as there are to be circular arcs in one revolution;
                    and, on the eye as a centre, construct a regular polygon of the same number of
                    sides as the number of divisions, and on each side equal to one division. Then
                    the angles of the polygon will be the centres for describing the spiral, as
                    shewn by the figures below, where the triangle, square, and hexagon, are given
                    as examples:</p>
                <p>If a spiral be drawn to begin from a circle at the centre, let the arcs be
                    described from the angles of a rectangular fret, as in fig. 39, the sides of
                    which may increase in any regular proportion. Or, a figure may be drawn in the
                    same manner as the tangents of the spiral, fig. 35, and the arcs described in
                    the angle, as in fig. 40. By either of these methods a pleasing curve may be
                    obtained.</p>
                <p>44. Fig. 41 represents the plan of a staircase, beginning with a scroll, and
                    having steps winding round the circular part of the well-hoļe.</p>
                <p>In the first place, let the end of the steps be developed according to the method
                    we have given in Art. 13. Fig. 43 shews this development. 'Now, the hand-rail
                    ought to follow the inclination of a line drawn to touch the nosings of the
                    steps, except where there is an abrupt transition from the rake of the winding
                    to that of the other steps; at such places it must be curved; the curve may be
                    drawn by the help of intersecting lines, as in fig. 44. if the workman cannot
                    trust to his eye.</p>
                <p>The part which is shaded in fig. 43, represents the handrail and ends of the
                    steps, when spread out, and the handrail is only drawn close to the steps for
                    convenience, as it would require too much space to raise it to its proper
                    position. This development of the rail is called the falling mould.</p>
                <p>The wood used for hand-rails being of an expensive kind, it becomes of some
                    importance to consider how the plank may be cut so as to require the least
                    quantity of material for the curved part of the rail. Now, if we were to suppose
                    the rail executed, and a plain board laid upon the upper side of it, the board
                    would touch the rail at three points; and a plank laid in the same position as
                    the board would be that out of which the rail could be cut with the least waste
                    of material.</p>
                <p>Let it be required to find the moulds for the part <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the rail, fig. 41, and to avoid confusing the lines in our
                    small figure, the part <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> has been drawn to a larger
                    scale in fig. 42. The plain board, mentioned above, would touch the rail at the
                    points marked C and B in the plan; draw the line CB, and draw a line parallel to
                    CB, so as to touch the curve at the point E. Then E is the other point on the
                    plan; and <hi rend="italic">a!, e',</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b',</hi> are the
                    heights of these points in the development, fig. 43.</p>
                <p>Erect perpendiculars to CB, from the points C, E, and B, fig. 42, and set off C
                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> on fig. 42, equal to <hi rend="italic">a'c,</hi> fig.
                    43; Ee equal to <hi rend="italic">de',</hi> and B6 equal to <hi rend="italic"
                    >fb.</hi> Through the points C and E, draw the dotted line <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ch</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> through <hi rend="italic">ae</hi> draw a line
                    to meet CE in <hi rend="italic">h</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and through the
                    points <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> draw a line to meet CB in <hi rend="italic"
                    >g;</hi> then join <hi rend="italic">hg,</hi> and make <hi rend="italic">Ci</hi>
                    perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">hg.</hi></p>
                <p>Now, if <hi rend="italic">Cd</hi> be equal to <hi rend="italic">Ca,</hi> and
                    perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">Ci;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">di</hi> be
                    joined, it will be the angle which the plank makes with the horizontal plane, or
                    plan. Therefore, draw FD parallel to <hi rend="italic">Ci,</hi> and find the
                    section by the process described in Art. 10. This section is the same thing as
                    would be obtained by projecting vertical lines from each point in the hand-rail
                    against the surface of a board, laid to touch it in three points. The
                    inexperienced workman will be much assisted in applying the moulds if he
                    acquires a clear notion of the position when executed.</p>
                <p>To find the thickness of the plank, take the height to the under side of the rail
                    <hi rend="italic">cr</hi> in the development, fig. 43, and set it off from v, in
                    the line C <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> to <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> in fig. 42;
                    from <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945823" xml:id="kp-eb0712-5823-0617"/>the point
                    <hi rend="italic">r</hi> draw a line parallel to <hi rend="italic">di,</hi> and
                    the distance between those parallel lines will be the thickness of the
                    plank.</p>
                <p>The mould, fig. 42, which is traced from the plan, is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">face mould.</hi> It is applied to the upper surface of the plank,
                    which being marked, a bevel should be set to the angle <hi rend="italic"
                    >idC,</hi> and this bevel being applied to the edge will give the points to
                    which the mould must be placed to mark out the under side. It is then to be sawn
                    out, and wrought true to the mould. In applying the bevel, care should be taken
                    to let its stock be parallel to the line <hi rend="italic">di,</hi> if the plank
                    should not be sufficiently wide for <hi rend="italic">di</hi> to be its
                    arris.</p>
                <p>After the rail is truly wrought to the face mould, the falling mould, fig. 43,
                    being applied to its convex side, will give the edge of the upper surface, and
                    the surface itself will be formed by squaring from the convex side, holding the
                    stock of the square always so that it would be vertical if the rail were in its
                    proper situation. The lower surface is to be parallel to the upper one.</p>
                <p>The sudden change of the width of the ends of the steps causes the soffit line to
                    have a broken or irregular appearance; to avoid it, the steps are made begin to
                    wind before the curved part begins. Different methods of proportioning the ends
                    of the steps are given by Nicholson, Roubo, Rondelet, and Krafft. We cannot in
                    this place enter into a detail of these methods, but for the reader’s
                    information a list of the principal writers on staircases is subjoined.</p>

                <p>45. There is no art in which it is required that the structure and properties of
                    wood should be so thoroughly understood as in joinery. The practical joiner, who
                    has made the nature of timber his study, has always a most decided advantage
                    over those who have neglected this most important part of the art.</p>
                <p>In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy, Vegetable</hi> (vol. iii. ρ. 61 and
                    82), the structure of wood is described; in this place, therefore, we shall only
                    show how the joiner may, in a great measure, avoid the warping caused by its
                    irregular texture.</p>
                <p>46. It is well known that wood contracts less in proportion, in diameter, than it
                    does in circumference; hence a whole tree always splits in drying. Mr Knight has
                    shown that, in consequence of this irregular contraction, a board may be cut
                    from a tree that can scarcely be made, by any means, to retain the same form and
                    position when subjected to various degrees of heat and moisture. From the ash
                    and the beech he cut some thin boards, in different directions relatively to
                    their transverse septa, so that the septa crossed the middle of some of the
                    boards at right angles, and lay nearly parallel with the surfaces of others.
                    Both kinds were placed in a warm room, under perfectly similar circumstances.
                    Those which had been formed by cutting across the transverse septa, as at A in
                    fig. 44, soon changed their form very considerably, the one side becoming
                    hollow, and the other round; and in drying, they contracted nearly 14 per cent,
                    in width.</p>
                <p>The other kind, in which the septa were nearly parallel to the surfaces of the
                    boards, as at B in fig. 44, retained, with very little variation, their primary
                    form, and did not contract in drying more than three and a half per cent, in
                    width.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions,</hi> part ii. for 1817, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Magazine,</hi> vol. 1. p. 437∙</p></note></p>
                <p>As Mr Knight had not tried resinous woods, two specimens were cut from a piece of
                    Memel timber; and, to render the result of our observation more clear, conceive
                    fig. 45 to represent the section of a tree, the annual rings being shewn by
                    circles. BD represents the manner in which one of our pieces was cut, and AC the
                    other. The board AC contracted 3*75 per cent, in width, and became hollow on the
                    side marked <hi rend="italic">b.</hi></p>
                <p>The board BD retained its original straightness, and contracted only 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 7 per cent. The difference in the quantity of
                    contraction is still greater than in hard woods.</p>
                <p>From these experiments, the advantages to be obtained merely by a proper
                    attention in cutting out boards for pannels, &amp;c. will be obvious; and it
                    will also be found that pannels cut so that the septa are nearly parallel to
                    their faces, will appear of a finer and more even grain, and require less labour
                    to make their surfaces even and smooth.</p>
                <p>The results of these experiments are not less interesting to cabinet-makers,
                    particularly in the construction of billiard-tables, card-tables, and indeed
                    every kind of table in use. For such purposes, the planks should be cut so as to
                    cross the rings as nearly in the direction BD as possible. We have no doubt that
                    it is the knowledge of this property of wood that renders the billiard-tables of
                    some makers so far superior to those of others.</p>
                <p>In wood that has the larger transverse septa, as the oak, for example, boards cut
                    as BD will be figured, while those cut as AC will be plain.</p>
                <p>47∙ There is another kind of contraction in wood whilst drying, which causes it
                    to become curved in the direction of its length. In the long styles of framing
                    we have often observed it; indeed, on this account, it is difficult to prevent
                    the style of a door, hung with centres, from curving, so as to rub against the
                    jamb. A very satisfactory reason for this kind of curving has been given by Mr
                    Knight,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid.</p></note>
                    which also points out the manner of cutting out wood, so as to be less subject
                    to this defect, which it is most desirable to avoid. The interior layers of
                    wood, being older, are more compact and solid than the exterior layers of the
                    same tree; consequently, in drying, the latter contract more in length than the
                    former. This irregularity of contraction causes the wood to curve in the
                    direction of its length, and it may be avoided by cutting the wood so that the
                    parts of each piece shall be as nearly of the same age as possible.</p>
                <p>48. Besides the contraction which takes place in drying, wood undergoes a
                    considerable change in bulk with the variations of the atmosphere. In
                    straight-grained woods the change in length is nearly insensible;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Ramsden and General Roy

                    few seasons, but it is of some importance to the joiner to be aware, that even
                    in very old wood, when the surface is removed, the extent of variation is nearly
                    the same as in new wood.</p>

                    degree of dryness, the extent of contraction and expansion, produced by the
                    usual changes in the state of the atmosphere, was, in fir wood, from —ļto — part

                    show the importance of attending to the maxims of construction we have already
                    laid before the reader; for, if a board of that width should be fixed at both
                    edges, it must unavoidably split from one end to the other.</p>
                <p>49∙ The kinds of wood commonly employed in joinery are, the oak, the different
                    species of pine, mahogany, lime-tree, and poplar.</p>
                <p>Of the oak, there are two species common in this island; that which Linnaeus has
                    named <hi rend="italic">Quercus Robur</hi> is the most valuable for joiners’
                    work; it is of a finer grain, less tough, and not so subject to twist as the
                    other kind. Oak is also imported from the Baltic ports, from Germany, and from
                    America. These foreign kinds being free from knots, of a straighter grain, and
                    less difficult to work, they are used in preference to our home species. Foreign
                    oak is also much used for cabinet-work; and lately, the fine curled oak that is
                    got from excrescences produced by pollard, and other old trees, has been used
                    with success in furniture. When well managed, it is very beautiful, and makes a
                    pleasing variety. It is relieved by inlaid borders of black or white wood, but
                    these should be sparingly used. Borders of inlaid brass, with small black lines,
                    give a rich effect to the darker coloured kinds.</p>
                <p>The greater part of joiners’ work is executed in yellow fir, imported from the
                    north of Europe. White fir is often used for internal work, and American pine is
                    much used for mouldings.</p>
                <p>The forest of Braemar, in Aberdeenshire, furnishes yellow fir of an excellent
                    quality, little inferior to the best foreign kinds.</p>
                <p>For the general purpose of joinery, the wood of the larch tree seems to be the
                    best; this useful tree thrives well on our native hills. We have seen some fine
                    specimens of this wood from Blair-Athol. It makes excellent steps for stairs,
                    floors, framing, and most other articles.</p>
                <p>Mahogany, in joinery, is only used where painted work is improper, as for the
                    hand-rails of stairs, or for the doors and windows of principal rooms. For doors
                    it is not now so often used as it was formerly; its colour is found to be too
                    gloomy to be employed in large masses. In cabinetwork it is almost the only kind
                    used for ornamental work.</p>
                <p>Lime-tree, and the different species of poplar, make very good floors for
                    inferior rooms, and may often be used for other purposes, in places where the
                    carriage of foreign timber would render it more expensive. Lime-tree is valuable
                    for carved work, and does not worm-eat; but carving is at present seldom used in
                    joinery.</p>
