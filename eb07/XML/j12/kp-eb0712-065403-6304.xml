                    Scotland</hi></label>, officially the chief judge of the supreme criminal court
                    of Scotland, but of old, as in England, the chief justice of the kingdom. The
                    origin of this high office cannot, from the want of records, be traced. There
                    can scarcely be a doubt, however, but that it was derived to us from England
                    after the Norman conquest. The earliest notice we <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192946317" xml:id="kp-eb0712-6317-0655"/>have of it is in the time of
                    Male. IV.; and then <hi rend="italic">two</hi> justiciars appear, a justiciar of
                    <hi rend="italic">Scotland,</hi> and a justiciar <hi rend="italic">eA'
                    Lothian,</hi> or the territory subject to the king of Scots south of the Forth.
                    Here, as in England, the justiciar was the king’s chief officer, and at the
                    head, not only of the <hi rend="italic">law</hi> in all its departments, civil,
                    criminal, and maritime, but also of the <hi rend="italic">military force</hi> of
                    the kingdom, <hi rend="italic">caput</hi><hi rend="italic">legis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">militiae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    accordingly we find several instances of the martial prowess, as well as
                    judicial authority, of the justiciar of Scotland in early times, particularly of
                    the valiant justiciaries <hi rend="italic">Buchan</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Durward,</hi> in the middle of the thirteenth century. Durward, indeed, during
                    his temporary removal from office, is known to have joined the standard of King
                    Henry III. of England in the French campaign; and Fordun’s character of him is
                    more that of a gallant military officer than a sober gownsman.</p>
                <p>In 1296, a single justiciar appears for the whole kingdom, in the person of Sir
                    William de Ormesby, a justice of the Common Pleas in England, who was
                    constituted by King Edward I. lord-justiciar of Scotland; but this appointment
                    was of short continuance. In 1305, the English monarch having again put down the
                    Scotch, distributed the kingdom into four districts, and appointed for each
                    district two justices; an arrangement in which the English Justinian had
                    certainly an eye to the judicial system of England, and to the introduction of
                    justices in eyre or of assize, as delegates of the <hi rend="italic">aula
                    regia,</hi> or justice-deputes, such as were established in that country. The
                    death of Edward, however, soon .afterwards put an end to the project; and the
                    old practice of having two justiciars was returned to, and continued till the
                    time of King James IV., but under the designation of a justiciar <hi
                    rend="italic">north of Forth,</hi> and a justiciar of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lothian,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">south of Forth.</hi></p>
                <p>Soon after the fatal battle of Flodden, in the beginning of the sixteenth
                    century, the office of justiciar, or, as he was now styled, justice-general (in
                    contradistinction to the special justices now frequently appointed, as well for
                    particular places as for particular trials), came again into the hands of a
                    single individual, viz. the Earl of Argyll, in which noble family it was
                    hereditary for a century. The High Court of Justiciary, also, began then to be
                    settled at Edinburgh; whereas, before, the parliament and superior courts were
                    held chiefly north of Forth.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of the same century, an alteration was made on the manner of
                    going circuit. In the time of King Robert HL, the justiciars were each required
                    to pass twice in circuit through every shire of their jurisdiction. But by 1587,
                    cap. 82, instead of passing through the realm from shire to shire successively,
                    the realm was divided into four quarters, and two senators or advocates of the
                    College of Justice were appointed as justice-deputes for each quarter. This
                    system continued about <hi rend="italic">a</hi> century, when, by 1672, cap. 16,
                    instead of the former justice-deputes, certain lords of Session were constituted
                    commissioners of Justiciary, along with the justice-general, and the
                    justice-clerk was made vice-president of the court, to preside in absence of the
                    justice-general; an arrangement which has continued to the present day.</p>
                <p>The jurisdiction and the powers of the justiciar of England arc known to have
                    been distributed amongst the superior courts now existing there. The history of
                    the powers possessed by the justiciar of Scotland we shall now notice. In
                    England the justiciar became a formidable officer, a terror at once to the crown
                    and the people. It does not appear that such was ever the case in Scotland. This
                    no doubt arose much from the early partition of the office into a justiciary
                    north and south oř Forth. But his great adversary was the lord-chancellor, as
                    the organ and instrument of the papal clergy, in whose hands the office of
                    chancellor had here, as in the other countries of Europe, long been vested. The
                    high office or justiciar was the envy of the ecclesiastics, always noted for
                    their ambition; but it being forbidden them by the papal constitutions, as a
                    secular tribunal and a place of blood, they could not directly seize upon it as
                    they had done upon the office of chancellor. They therefore set about filching
                    its jurisdiction; and in 1425 the first Court of Session was erected, composed
                    of the chancellor, and with him “certaine discreete persones of the three
                    estates,” chosen by the king, with power to judge in all matters competent to
                    the king and his council. In 1503, the Court of Daily Council was instituted
                    instead of the Court of the Session; and at length, in 1532, the present Court
                    of Session and College of Justice was established at Edinburgh, with a
                    jurisdiction in all civil causes. From that time forward, the civil jurisdiction
                    of the justiciar (whose office, it will be remembered, was now hereditary in the
                    family of Argyll, and consequently feeble and inefficient) ceased. And not only
                    so, but its relative importance expired, and the Court of Session became the
                    supreme court of the kingdom; for, by clerical ability, or by lay subserviency
                    not found in England, where the old common Jaw has ever continued the antagonist
                    of Roman jurisprudence, an act passed here (1540, cap. 72), requiring all
                    sheriffs and other temporal judges to copy the proceedings (not of the
                    justiciar, as heretofore, but) of the Court of Session. The triumph of the papal
                    clergy was then complete; the old common law ceased; its records became
                    obsolete, and are to this day of apocryphal authority; and the civil and canon
                    laws became, what they were in use to be denominated, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >common law of</hi> Scotland. And what the Court of Session effected ∕n the
                    civil jurisdiction of the justiciar, the Court of Admiralty did in its maritime
                    jurisdiction. That court was little known before the end of the sixteenth
                    century. About that time Mr Alexander King, advocate, was appointed judge of the
                    Admiralty; and almost immediately, owing to the compilation of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Treatise on Maritime Law</hi> (perhaps the earliest regular work
                    on that branch of jurisprudence in Britain), the Court of Admiralty rose to
                    importance; and in 1681 it was declared a sovereign judicature, and the
                    high-admiral, the king’s lieutenant, and justice-general on the seas. In our own
                    day, however, the High Court of Admiralty has been abolished, and the Court of
                    Justiciary has re-acquired a criminal jurisdiction on the seas. As respects the
                    military power once possessed by the justiciar, that departed from him long ago,
                    and became vested in the army itself, superintended by the crown; yet to this
                    day a recognition of the ancient power may be observed at the Justiciary
                    circuits.</p>
                <p>The supreme judicative power of Scotland is therefore now vested in the Courts of
                    Session and Justiciary. The justice-general being now wholly nominal, and a
                    sinecure, the chief judge of Justiciary is the justice-clerk, and the puisne
                    judges are certain lords of Session. The justiceclerk is also president of the
                    Second Division of the Court of Session, though, which is singular, he is not
                    necessarily a lord of Session; and by a late act of parliament, the president of
                    the Court of Session is, on the termination of the existing interest, to assume
                    the office of justice-general. In effect, therefore, though in a very bungling
                    and awkward sort of way the Court of Session will, on the act in question coming
                    into operation, take the place and jurisdiction of the ancient justiciar, (u. u.
                    u.)</p>
