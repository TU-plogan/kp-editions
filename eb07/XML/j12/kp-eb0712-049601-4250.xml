                    Indians, and St Jago by the Spaniards, is the largest and most valuable island
                    in the British West Indies. It is situated between the parallels of 17° 35' and
                    18° 30' north latitude, and of 76° and 78° 40' west longitude, being one hundred
                    and sixty miles in length by forty-five in breadth, and containing 4,000,000
                    acres of land. It lies ninety miles west of St Domingo, the same distance south
                    of Cuba, four hundred and thirty-five miles north of Carthagena on the South
                    American continent, and four thousand miles south-west of England.</p>
                <p>Jamaica was discovered by Columbus on the 3d of May 1494, whilst coasting along
                    the southern side of the island of Cuba, during his second voyage to the western
                    world. It was found to be densely peopled by Indians, who opposed the landing of
                    the Spaniards; but a discharge of ar-balcts put them to flight, and the
                    discoverer formally took possession of the island in the name of his sovereign.
                    His stay, however, was short, and for eight years the natives were allowed to
                    remain in tranquil possession of their own territory. In 1503 was effected the
                    first European settlement in Jamaica, and this was the result of necessity
                    rather than of choice. During his fourth voyage, Columbus was forced, by stress
                    of weather, to seek shelter on the northern side of the island, where he saved
                    the lives of his exhausted comrades at the expense of the vessels, by running
                    the latter ashore at a point called St Ann’s Bay. Here for twelve months he
                    endured great hardships and privations. He despatched a small squadron to
                    Hispaniola, or Cuba as it is now called, for succours; but the governor of that
                    island was his mortal enemy, and mocked his sufferings instead of alleviating
                    them. A body of Spaniards also threw off their allegiance to their commander,
                    and seizing on ten canocs which he had been preparing, put to sea in them, with
                    the intention of crossing over to Hispaniola; but a storm forced them back to
                    Jamaica, where they committed ravages on the unoffending Indians, and made
                    attacks on Columbus and his few but faithful followers. At length, however, the
                    renegades, after suffering some loss in a battle, were permitted to return to
                    their allegiance; and, on the 28th of June 1504, Columbus bade a final adieu to
                    the shores of Jamaica, in vessels prepared for his relief. In 1509, three years
                    after the death of the discoverer, Jamaica became the theatre of rapine,
                    bloodshed, and every species of cruelty. It was placed at the disposal of the
                    two governors of the Darien government, to make what use of it they thought fit,
                    as an emporium whence provisions might be obtained, or a market from which
                    slaves could be taken at pleasure to work in the mines. The rival governors vied
                    with each other in making the most of the island and its unhappy inhabitants. A
                    detail of the enormities committed would sicken humanity. It is sufficient to
                    say, that they were not less aggravated than those perpetrated in other parts of
                    the New World, at a period when crime was uniformly worked on a gigantic scale.
                    The sanguinary reign of the two governors was put a stop to by Diego Columbus,
                    the son of the great navigator, who appeared to assert his prior claim to rule
                    in the island, which the council of the Indies adjudged to be his right. He
                    despatched Don Juan d’Esquimel with seventy men, who formed a settlement at
                    Santa Gloria. The seat of government was fixed on the banks of a small rivulet
                    called Seville Nueva, where a splendid city arose, but of which no memorial now
                    remains except the name. At first it received its designation from the stream on
                    which it stood, but was afterwards called Seville d’Oro. The peaceably-inclined
                    Indians sank unresistingly down to the condition of serfs and slaves to the
                    white superiors, who now usurped the sole occupancy of the soil. The government
                    of Don Juan d’Esquimel appears to have been as mild as it was unfortunately
                    brief. During its continuance, however, the agriculture of the island was
                    materially advanced. The sugar-cane, the vine, and European cattle, were
                    introduced; and from the wool of the cotton tree, which was celebrated in
                    commerce, fabrics were manufactured of a quality so fine as to prove a source of
                    wealth to the Spaniards. But, in their avaricious search for the precious
                    metals, this means of Aggrandisement was comparatively neglected. The colony,
                    however, continued to increase rapidly in wealth and importance, and was enabled
                    to send off branches from the parent stock to other parts of the island. But
                    improvement for a time suffered a retardation by the death of Diego Columbus in
                    1526. He was succeeded by Don Pedro d’Esquimel, who has been singled out from
                    amongst other tyrants as a most uncompromising destroyer of the Indians; and his
                    cruelties, added to those inflicted by French corsairs, called flibustiers, had
                    nearly put a period to the prosperity of Jamaica. The Spaniards fled from these
                    plundering attacks across the mountain range, on the further side of which they
                    founded St Jago de la Vega, which soon rose to be a flourishing city. Meanwhile,
                    the French flibustiers reduced Seville d’Oro to ruins in their attacks upon the
                    Spaniards; for the wars between Henry of France and Charles V. were in part
                    transferred from the Old to the New World. The native Indians, thus placed as it
                    were between two fires, continued to suffer severely; and it is stated that in
                    1558 they had been entirely extirpated. By the junction of the crowns of Spain
                    and Portugal in 1580, Jamaica came into the possession of the latter, and new
                    energy was infused into the colony by the Portuguese who emigrated thither. The
                    cultivation of sugar and other articles was prosecuted with energy; and the
                    breeds of live stock which bad been originally imported from Hispaniola
                    increased so rapidly, that a considerable trade arose in provisions, land, and
                    hides. Passing over two predatory inroads made by the English in 1605 and 1644,
                    we come to the period when the British made a conquest of the island in 1655. By
                    order of Cromwell, a considerable armament was fitted out for the conquest of
                    Hispaniola, at the moment that hostilities were declared against Spain in
                    Europe. The expedition was despatched under the command of General Venables and
                    Admiral Penn; but the intentions of the English were frustrated by the vigilance
                    of the Spaniards. To make amends, however, for the discomfiture, Jamaica was
                    captured in May 1655, after having remained in the possession of Spain for a
                    period of 146 years. For sometime little progress was made, many of the
                    Spaniards still retaining possession of the mountains, and causing annoyance to
                    those in the plains. But after some years they were gradually reduced,
                    notwithstanding occasional assistance obtained from Cuba. A more formidable
                    attempt to recover the island was made by the Spaniards in 1658, but without
                    success. Under its first governors, Jamaica became the head-quarters of
                    buccaneers, who infested these seas, and derived untold wealth from the plunder
                    of the Spanish colonies, and vessels laden with the spoils of the New World. A
                    considerable proportion of the population consisted of outlaws, and soldiers and
                    negro slaves likewise began to be imported by the British, whilst emigration
                    from England on a small scale commenced. Charles at his restoration adopted
                    various lenient and wholesome measures to stifle the feuds which existed between
                    the republican and royalist parties, and held <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192944263" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4263-0497"/>out every encouragement to
                    new settlers. In 1662, on the accession of Lord Windsor to the chief authority,
                    a municipal government was constituted, and other means adopted to secure
                    subordination, peace, and justice to all. In 1664, a popular legislative
                    assembly was established, and for sixty-four years it continued to check the
                    encroachments of the crown, as well as to regulate the internal affairs of the
                    island. In about fourteen years after Jamaica came into the possession of
                    Britain, it exhibited a remarkable progress in commercial prosperity.
                    Fifty-seven sugar works, forty-nine indigo works, forty-seven cocoa walks, and
                    several salt pans, attested the enterprise and industry of the colonists.
                    Cattle, sheep, goats, and tame hogs, were reared in great numbers; and attention
                    had been turned to the cultivation of cotton, tobacco, arnotta, and other
                    articles. The white population at this time exceeded 15,000. In 1684, the
                    impolicy of slave labour became apparent, in a serious revolt of the blacks,
                    which, however, was speedily suppressed; but the maroons or runaway negroes
                    became exceedingly troublesome to the planters. Two serious calamities overtook
                    Jamaica within the space of two years. The first was the destruction of Port
                    Royal, by one of those sudden convulsions to which this region of the globe is
                    so liable. With the exception of about two hundred houses of the fort, the whole
                    town, with its vast wealth, was submerged by the overflow of the sea. The
                    greater number of the inhabitants perished, and their dead bodies, floating in
                    shoals in a putrid state about the harbour, occasioned an epidemic, to which
                    three thousand individuals fell victims. This earthquake took place in June
                    1692; and, exactly two years afterwards, a formidable descent was made on the
                    island by the French; but the militia gallantly repulsed the invaders. During
                    the remaining years of the seventeenth century, no memorable events occurred in
                    the annals of Jamaica. The earlier part of that which followed was marked by
                    various attempts made to bring the supplies raised by the representatives of the
                    people under the control of the crown; but without success. In 1727, the revenue
                    bill passed through the House of Assembly, the required fund being L.8000 per
                    annum; and that which has beentermedthemagnachartaof Jamaica was passed,namely,
                    that the laws and statutes of England, which had been introduced and acted upon,
                    should be considered as part of the legislative code of the island for ever.
                    Matters being thus arranged, the prosperity of the colony continued to increase,
                    notwithstanding the annoyance given to the planters by the negro marauders. In
                    1760, there took place a desperate revolt of the Indians, which ended in the
                    destruction of the greater number of the rebel slaves. The contest was
                    characterised by acts of cruelty and barbarity, which rivalled the early
                    atrocities of the Spaniards. Some were burned, and others, gibbeted alive, were
                    allowed to be broiled to death by a tropical sun. The slaughter or
                    transportation of about one thousand slaves made little impression upon the
                    population, which rapidly increased. The energies of Jamaica were called forth
                    on the occasion of the meditated attack of the combined fleets of France and
                    Spain in 1782. But the victory gained by Admiral Rodney, on the 12th of April of
                    that year, over the French squadron, preserved the island to the British crown.
                    The Jamaicans showed their gratitude by erecting a handsome marble statue in
                    memory of the hero who triumphed on that day. Along with the other colonies of
                    Great Britain, both in the East and West Indies, Jamaica suffered by the
                    imposition of heavy duties on the produce of the island when imported into
                    England. In 1795, another alarming insurrection of the maroons took place, on
                    account of the intemperate policy of Earl Balcarras, then governor of the
                    island. This rebellion continued upwards of seven months, the war being carried
                    on with savage cruelty on both sides; indeed excesses were committed by ∙ the
                    whites, and means employed to subjugate the maroons, <hi rend="superscript">
                    s</hi> which tended more to exasperate than to bring them under control. Into
                    the particulars of this intestine commotion it were superfluous to enter. The
                    savages exhibited their deep hatred of the whites by all those methods of
                    retaliation common to barbarous tribes. Without openly facing the military
                    forces which were sent against them, they lay in covert, and, whenever an
                    opportunity presented itself, surprised them by unexpected sallies. In the
                    fastnesses of the mountains they found a secure retreat; and as the ordinary
                    means of civilized warfare appeared inadequate to bring the contest to a speedy
                    issue, the governor resolved to call to his aid the bloodhounds of Cuba. This
                    bears the aspect of a harsh, but it finally turned out to be a merciful
                    expedient; for it paralyzed the energies of the Indians, and terrified them into
                    a general capitulation. Their lives were spared, but they were transported, at
                    the expense of the island, first to Nova Scotia, and afterwards to Sierra Leone
                    in Africa. The only other slave insurrection which threatened the well-being of
                    the colony, was that which took place in 1831-32; and with this it is hoped that
                    the servile or predial war which the island has so often been doomed to witness
                    will for ever cease. By the slave emancipation bill the principal ground for
                    dissatisfaction on the part of the black population has been removed; but a
                    discussion of this subject, with the results of the measure, belongs to another
                    part of the present work. Besides the destructive visitation already noticed,
                    Jamaica has repeatedly been visited by earthquakes, although only on one
                    occasion was serious injury sustained. The hurricane, that scourge of the
                    western archipelago, has not passed innocuously over this island. One of these,
                    which occurred in 1780, was particularly destructive, the loss of life and
                    property being both very great on that occasion. Besides these evils, the
                    diseases of this country arc occasionally malignant; the yellow fever, in
                    particular, has long been proverbially fatal.</p>
                <p>Jamaica is somewhat of an oval shape, and its surface is more beautifully
                    diversified by hills and valleys than that of any other island in the West
                    Indies. An elevated ridge, called in the eastern and highest part the Blue
                    Mountains, runs longitudinally from east to west through the centre of the
                    island, and occasionally rises to nearly 8000 feet above the level of the ocean.
                    Other high ridges running from north to south occasionally intersect this chain.
                    On the south they approach to the sea in gigantic spines, difficult of access,
                    and covered with dense forests. On the opposite side the aspect of the country
                    is very different. Instead of being rugged and abrupt, the hills are remarkable
                    rather for their beauty than their boldness. They are of a gentle acclivity,
                    uniformly rounded at the top with singular felicity, and commonly separated from
                    each other by spacious vales and romantic inequalities. This gently-undulating
                    surface is diversified with groves of pimento, luxuriant pastures, and all the
                    exquisite verdure of the tropics. Viewed from a lofty eminence, the country
                    presents an aspect of grandeur united with beauty, which can scarcely be
                    surpassed. A splendid panorama of mountains appears towering up to the clouds,
                    whilst, lower down, vast savannahs or plains clothed with various vegetation,
                    vales, ravines, majestic woods, rivers, cascades, and mountain torrents, appear
                    spread out before the eye of the spectator in all the beautiful irregularity of
                    nature. The view of the island from the sea has also been celebrated by voyagers
                    for its splendour. At Point Morant, the eastern cape of Jamaica, the scenery is
                    magnificent. The Blue Mountains appear embosomed in a stratum of clouds, the
                    rugged hills below being furrowed with ravines, and descending abruptly to the
                    sea.</p>

                <p>Upon a nearer approach, they are found to have their sides covered with black
                    forests; whilst patches of bright green, and white houses, are descried on
                    running along the south coast towards Port Royal. From Fort Nugent, which is
                    conspicuous under a steep hill, to Port Royal, there is a narrow bit of land
                    called the Palisades, composed of sand overgrown with mangroves, and studded
                    with grave-stones. Behind this is the harbour of the capital; and Kingston is
                    seen stretching over an extended level, and encircled by the loftiest ridge of
                    the Blue Mountain chain. The heights of the principal mountains have been
                    computed as follows: Blue Mountain Peak, 7770 feet; ridge of the same, 7163
                    feet; Portland Gap ridge, 6501 feet; Portland Gap, 5640 feet; Catherine’s Peak,
                    4970 feet; with others of a lower elevation. It is stated, however, by some
                    authorities, that the three very remarkable peaks on the grand ridge of the Blue
                    Mountains, called Coldridge, have their respective summits 8184, 7656, and 7576
                    feet above the level of the sea, whilst other mountains of the same chain exceed
                    a mile in height. The greater number of the mountains present a conical form,
                    with steep but forest-clad declivities, approaching very near the shore on the
                    north coast, and leaving plains of about twelve miles wide on the south. The
                    dark and deep ravines between the lofty mountains, denominated cockpits, are
                    closed in by dense woods, and present a striking contrast to the lower
                    mountains, where coffee, pimento, cotton, capsicums, and other tropical
                    vegetables, flourish luxuriantly.</p>
                <p>Jamaica is abundantly supplied with water. Upwards of two hundred rivers have
                    been enumerated; but, owing to the irregularity of the surface of the country,
                    few of these are navigable for vessels of any burden. Black River, the largest
                    and least rapid of these, flows through a level country, and is navigable by
                    small craft for about thirty miles. The other chief rivers on the south side are
                    Rio Cobre and Rio Minho; and on the north Marthabrae, White, Ginger, and Great
                    Rivers. It is a striking faet, that in an island of such limited extent as
                    Jamaica, there are no less than forty rivers varying from twenty to an hundred
                    feet or more in breadth. They are all of great value, turning the mills and
                    irrigating the plantations through which they flow, besides adding a beautiful
                    feature to the landscape. The springs and rivulets are very numerous, but are
                    unequally distributed. In some parts of the island seven or eight may be
                    enumerated within the circuit of as many miles; whilst other districts are so
                    far removed from water, that, for supplying their necessities, the inhabitants
                    are obliged to have recourse to tanks and ponds. Several of the springs possess
                    medicinal virtues. Two of a sulphureous nature, in particular, one hot, and the
                    other cold, are celebrated as exceedingly beneficial in cutaneous diseases. With
                    regard to harbours, the Jamaica shore has sixteen secure havens, besides thirty
                    bays, roads, or shipping stations, which afford good anchorage.</p>
                <p>The soil of this island is in most places deep and fertile. On the north side
                    there is a species of red soil, the shades of which vary from a deep chocolate
                    to a rich scarlet, and in some places approach to a bright yellow. What is
                    denominated the brick mould is a deep, warm, yellow, hazel mould, reposing on a
                    retentive under stratum. This is reckoned one of the best soils in the West
                    Indies for the cultivation of sugar-cane. It is of great depth, easily laboured,
                    and so inexhaustible as to require no manure. The black shell mould is the next
                    in fertility, and this it owes to the mineral salts and exuviae which are
                    intermingled with it. The principal soils on the interior hills and mountains of
                    Jamaica have been thus enumerated: A red clay, on a white marl; a red clay, on a
                    grit; a reddish-brown clay, on marl; a yellowish day, mixed with common mould; a
                    red grit; a loose concha-ceous mould; a black mould, on a clay or other
                    substratum a loose black vegetable mould, on rock; a fine sand; and the
                    varieties of all the foregoing soils. The mountain land in general, when first
                    cleared of its wood, possesses more or less a deep surface of rich black mould
                    mixed with shells a soil which will grow anything. Different parts of the island
                    are characterised by peculiarities of soil, which are either those enumerated,
                    or their varieties intermixed with different mineral or earthy substances.
                    Silver and golden mica are frequently met with, and sometimes mistaken for the
                    genuine metal. Amongst other mineral substances found, are mixed and purplish
                    schistus, and the hard lamellated amianthus, which occurs in large detached
                    masses, having all the appearance of petrified wood. White freestone, quartz of
                    different species, and limestone, are abundant. Subcrystalline spar is found in
                    small detached masses, and rock spar in blocks of great magnitude. A species of
                    bastard marble, having a smooth even grain, is frequently used for limestone.
                    There is a species of smooth clammy marl found, which is sometimes eaten by the
                    negroes when they are diseased, to the detriment of their health. Lead ore,
                    rich, and heavily impregnated with silver, striated antimony, varieties of
                    copper ore, and iron-stone, which is attracted by the magnet, are found; but
                    neither gold nor silver ore has yet been discovered, although the natives
                    possessed these metals in abundance when the island was first visited by the
                    Spaniards.</p>
                <p>The climate of Jamaica is conformable to the latitude in which it is placed, but
                    the heat is by no means so fearful as is usually represented. The highest
                    temperature of course prevails in the low situations, those more elevated being
                    colder, in conformity with nature’s universal law. The climate of the island
                    since its cultivation has undergone very considerable change∙ The medium heat at
                    Kingston throughout the year is 80°, and the minimum 70°, of Fahrenheit. The
                    latter is the maximum at eight miles from Kingston; and at an elevation of from
                    4000 to 5000 feet, the average range is from 55° to 65°, the minimum in winter
                    being 44°, of Fahrenheit. The alternation of temperature is from eight to ten
                    degrees on the south side of the mountains, and it is more so on the north; but
                    the transitions are not so sudden and detrimental as in many parts of the
                    continent of North America. The grand compensation for excess of temperature is
                    afforded by the breezes which regularly every morning set in from the sea to the
                    land, and every evening flow from the land towards the sea, as it were by a wise
                    provision of nature, to preserve the equilibrium which the intense heat of the
                    noon-day sun has disturbed. During the most sultry months, also, a succession of
                    light, fleecy clouds continually cross the sun’s disc, and thus, by intercepting
                    his rays, mitigate their general arden-ey∙ It is cooler and more salubrious on
                    the north side of the island than on the south, and the dwellers on the
                    mountains enjoy a purer and more wholesome air than those resident on the low
                    grounds. There is no striking variation of season, excepting what is occasioned
                    by the alternation of dry and rainy weather. Thunder and lightning arc
                    prevalent, without being mischievous; and although the hurricane season ranges
                    from July to October, severe storms at the windward Caribbee Islands are not
                    experienced at Jamaica. The rains do not always take place in the same months;
                    and in different parts of the island there is a considerable variation in the
                    time of their commencement. In the mountains they are earlier, more frequent,
                    and more heavy, than in the low country. In the latter, one district will have
                    rain a month or six weeks sooner or later than another not twenty miles.distant
                    from it. What are called the spring rains sometimes <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192944289" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4289-0499"/>do not set in till June, and
                    even later; but occasionally they commence as early as March or April, which is
                    always a great impediment to agricultural operations, this being the time for
                    getting in the sugar crops on the north side of the island. The seasons vary
                    much on either side. On the south, spring may be said to range from November to
                    April, summer from May to August, and winter from September to October. On the
                    north, however, winter ranges from October to March, and on this side there is a
                    more plentiful supply of rain than on the other, but distributed in smaller and
                    more frequent showers. It is, moreover, cooler, and has a vegetation of greater
                    bulk and height. The spring rains are the most violent, and the atmosphere is
                    then exceedingly sultry, and, being much charged with electricity, thunder
                    storms are of frequent occurrence. The distribution of rain is sometimes very
                    capricious, some parts being favoured with plenteous showers, whilst plantations
                    divided from them only by a ridge of hills suffer from drought; and it often
                    happens that, whilst the mountainous regions are visited by daily torrents, the
                    low country is parched for want of rain. During droughts, however, vegetation is
                    much assisted by the fall of dews. The climate of Jamaica is by no means so
                    inimical to the human constitution as is generally represented, that is,
                    provided those resident on the island live temperately. Fevers of various kinds
                    are not uncommon; but the malignant epidemic, the yellow fever, has of late
                    years almost, if not quite, disappeared from Jamaica and the other West India
                    islands. Generally the climate has improved, and the high lands of this
                    beautiful isle are well adapted to the European constitution, and they will be
                    more especially so when they become cleared and cultivated. There are, besides,
                    many districts in the interior where climate and soil are nearly as favourable
                    to health as in any part of Britain; districts which are crown property, and at
                    present lying waste.</p>
                <p>Besides the vegetable productions indigenous to Jamaica, the island has been
                    enriched with numerous exotics, the whole forming a vast and interesting
                    catalogue of plants and trees, which our limits will not admit of our
                    enumerating or describing in systematic detail. The forests abound with woods
                    fit for various purposes, as building, mill-work, wheel-making, cabinet-making,
                    dyeing, and so on. There are several species which, from their extreme hardness,
                    cannot be used in cabinet-making, but are valuable for building and other
                    purposes in which durability is principally required. Of these, the black and
                    neesberry bully trees, the green heart, the rose-wood, and fiddle-wood, grow to
                    a great height. The iron-wood, the nature of which tree corresponds with its
                    name, does not grow to a great size, and is principally used for rough posts for
                    the negroes’ houses. There are various beautiful woods for ornamental cabinet
                    work, of which the mahogany, the bread-nut-heart, and the satin-wood, are most
                    highly esteemed. The mahogany tree is one of the most elegant in the island, and
                    grows to from forty to fifty fleet in height; but having been found a profitable
                    article of exportation, the greater part has been cut down for that purpose, and
                    there are not many trees now remaining on the island. The bread-nut tree is
                    pretty abundant in most parts of Jamaica. Its wood is beautifully variegated,
                    and takes a fine polish. The leaves are a nutritious food for horses and other
                    animals; and the negroes find a substantial article of diet in the kernels of
                    the fruit. The cedar grows to a great size, sometimes measuring thirty feet in
                    girth near the root, and it is of proportionable height. The cotton-trce is the
                    largest of all the trees on the island, but it is only used for making canoes,
                    which are hollowed out from the trunks. The pimento is a highly valuable tree,
                    and it flourishes spontaneously in great abundance on the north side of the
                    island. This tree is celebrated for its beauty, and the leaves, when bruised,
                    emit a fine aromatic odour, nearly as powerful as that of the spice itself. A
                    single tree will produce one hundred and fifty of the raw, or one hundred pounds
                    of the dried fruit. One of the most useful trees in the island is the bamboo,
                    which is applied to numerous important purposes. The trumpet tree, which grows
                    from thirty to forty feet in height, produces an agreeable fruit similar to our
                    strawberry; its strong and fibrous bark is used for cordage, and its light trunk
                    for bark logs, and the like purposes. One of the most curious trees is the
                    mangrove, which takes root in the sands, and grows within the margin of the
                    ocean. The coffee-trce is a handsome plant, and its fecundity is much improved
                    by regular pruning. The coffee-bean is covered with a pulp, which when ripe
                    assumes a fine crimson red. The cocoa-tree grows to the height of from fifteen
                    to twenty feet, and bears its nuts in pods. The cultivation of this article is
                    now neglected, not much more being raised than is necessary for the consumption
                    of the inhabitants. The oil-nut tree <hi rend="italic">(ricinus),</hi> which
                    produces the castor oil, grows to the height of twelve or fifteen feet, and has
                    a large indented leaf. It bears the fruit, which produces the oil, in clusters.
                    There are two species of the cabbage-tree, the Barbadoes and the native
                    cabbage-tree, the former being the most stately and beautiful. The cocoa-nut
                    tree grows in great luxuriance, and abounds in every part of the island. Besides
                    the above trees, Jamaica is plentifully provided with black and green ebony,
                    yellow sanders, lignum vitae, fustic, logwood, bitter wood, the valuable
                    palmetto (sometimes one hundred and forty feet in height), and others. There is
                    an abundant supply <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the most delicious fruits, every
                    month presenting a fresh collation. Amongst these may be mentioned the
                    pine-apple or anana, orange, shaddock, pomegranate, fig, granedillo, necsberry,
                    cashew-apple, kennip, spadillo, banana, mamee (a wild fruit), star-apple, sweet
                    sop, musk-melon, water-melon, sweet melon, citron, avagato pear, several
                    varieties of the mango, the chirimoya, akee, jack-fruit, bread-fruit, very fine
                    grapes, plantain, plum, tamarind, olive, date, mulberry, as well as other
                    delicious fruits. Amongst vegetables, potatoes, yams, cassava, peas and beans of
                    every variety, artichokes, beetroot, carrots, parsnips, cucumbers, tomatoes,
                    radishes, celery, choco, ochro, Lima bean, Indian kale, calalue, and various
                    salads, flourish in abundance. Both maize and Guinea corn grow in great
                    luxuriance in this island; and rice is capable of being raised in certain
                    situations, but it is not an object of attention. Maize or Indian corn is
                    universally cultivated, and it yields an almost incredible return; on an
                    average, it is said, one thousand fold. Guinea grass, which abounds, is
                    considered as of great importance, as the cattle that supply manure to the sugar
                    plantations arc fed by it. The various drugs, dye-stuffs, and spiccs, are of
                    excellent quality. Aloes, cochineal, spikenard, canella, liquorice root, the
                    castor-oil nut already noticed, vanilla, peppers, arrow-root, ginger,
                    ipecacuanha, scammony, jalap, cassia, euphorbia, senna, and others, attest the
                    fruitfulness and capabilities of the soil and climate.</p>
                <p>But it is now time to advert to the grand staple plant of the island, the
                    sugar-cane. The question which has divided inquirers into this subject, namely,
                    whether the sugar-cane was indigenous to the Antilles, does not require to be
                    discussed in this place. It seems certain that at an early period this valuable
                    plant was extensively cultivated by the Spaniards in Jamaica; and in 1671 a
                    writer speaks of the complicated sugar works scattered over the island as
                    resembling towns or villages. There are several varieties of the sugar-cane,
                    viz. the common cane of the island, the Bourbon cane (so called from its being
                    brought last from the island of that name, though originally a na<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192944302" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4302-0500"/>tive of the Society Islands),
                    the transparent cane, the ribbon cane, the Batavian or purple cane, and the
                    green stripe cane. Those chiefly cultivated are the Bourbon and transparent
                    cane. The ribbon cane is also sometimes planted, on account of its hardy nature,
                    though it yields much less juice than the other two. It is the most beautiful of
                    all the species, being finely variegated with alternate stripes of crimson and
                    pale yellow, whence it takes its name. The Batavian cane is in no estimation,
                    being unproductive, and is only preserved as a variety. An idea of the extent of
                    ground appropriated to the cultivation of the sugar-cane may be obtained from
                    the fact, that for some years the importations into Great Britain have averaged,
                    in hundredweights, 1,400,000, which, rated so low as a guinea per hundredweight,
                    would give nearly one million and a half sterling. It is of very fine quality,
                    and, by the improved systems of culture and manufacture which are coming into
                    operation, there seems little doubt but that both the quantity and quality may
                    yet be more extended. The quantity of rum made from the sugar is likewise very
                    great. The average imports made annually into England may be taken at 3,500,000
                    gallons, which may be estimated in value at one million sterling. The next grand
                    staple plant of the island is coffee. It was introduced into Jamaica in 1728,
                    from which period the cultivation of it was extended, until about the beginning
                    of this century, when it appears to have reached its maximum. This plant thrives
                    in almost every soil about the mountains of Jamaica, and in the very driest
                    spots has frequently produced abundant crops. The importation into Great Britain
                    averages about 20,000,000 pounds yearly, which, estimated at the low rate of one
                    shilling per pound, is another million sterling. Cotton, indigo, and cocoa, are
                    not now so extensively cultivated as formerly, having given way to the foregoing
                    staples of the island. The attention of the planters has recently been turned to
                    other vegetable productions, particularly to the sun-flower, which, it is said,
                    may be rendered valuable in a pecuniary point of view. Its fecundity in this
                    climate gives it an advantage over corn for the common purposes of food for
                    poultry, and when mixed with corn it constitutes a nutritious food for horses.
                    The seeds also yield an oil, which, in the opinion of some, is preferable to
                    olive oil. With respect to the other vegetable productions of Jamaica, such as
                    flowers and flowering shrubs, there is little to demand particular attention. A
                    few European flowers thrive, and there are a variety of others indigenous to the
                    island, which flourish wild in the woods and mountain recesses. Here, even in
                    winter, may be seen, what is often witnessed in the torrid zone, fruitsand
                    blossoms suspended at once from the same bough, the rivalship of Pomona and
                    Flora.</p>
                <p>Jamaica, like the rest of the islands appertaining to the new continent, when
                    discovered, contained but few species of animals. Only eight varieties of
                    quadrupeds are enumerated as belonging to it, viz. the agouti, peccari,
                    armadillo, opossum, racoon, musk rat, alco, and monkey. The wild hog, the rat,
                    and the mouse, seem now to be the only wild quadrupeds in the island. The wild
                    hogs, which are larger and more fierce than the common kind, frequent the remote
                    woods, and subsist on the fruits and roots with which these abound. The rats are
                    most destructive animals, and their numbers and ravages are almost
                    inconceivable. The island abounds with the feathered tribes remarkable for the
                    brilliancy of their plumage, but there are only a few of them birds of song. Of
                    these the most remarkable is what is termed the nightingale, a species of mock
                    bird, possessing great variety, compass, and sweetness of tone. There are
                    numerous species of the wild pigeon, and also of the parrot; and a variety of
                    aquatic birds, as ducks, teal, coots, divers, and the like. In October the crane
                    and the white galding (one of the heron family), come over in flocks from the
                    island of Cuba. The plover, snipe, and ortolan, are also migratory. Within the
                    last half century the quail has become a very common bird. But the most valuable
                    of the winged inhabitants of the island is the black vulture or carrion crow,
                    which is very useful in devouring all putrid matter.</p>
                <p>The sea around this island, and the rivers by which it is watered, abound in
                    excellent fish. There are also salt ponds, which, if properly attended to, might
                    render the planters in a great measure independent of supplies of salt fish from
                    Europe. The sprat, herring, dolphin, anchovy or silver fish, the flying, sword,
                    sun, parrot, rock, king, and gar fishes, the flounder, sole, eel, bream,
                    snapper, mullet, perch, bonecto, Spanish mackerel, sea-devil (weighing from 100
                    to 300 pounds), old wife, shark, porpoise, sting ray, thrasher, as well as many
                    others, may be caught in abundance. Sea and land turtle are likewise plentiful,
                    and of good eating. Some of the largest rivers contain alligators, but the chief
                    harm which they usually do ⅛ the destroying of the fish, and devouring the
                    poultry and pigs which come in their way. There are three species of snake in
                    Jamaica, the yellow, black, and brown snake, the last being the smallest and
                    least numerous of the three. None of these are venomous in their bite, at least
                    to a serious degree. Several species of the lizard abound here, and scorpions
                    and centipedes are common. There is a very troublesome insect called the
                    cockroach, swarms of which infest every house; but the most annoying of these
                    animals is the mosquito. There are numerous fire-flies, which dis])lay their
                    harmless but vivid coruscations during the night. Bees are very numerous in the
                    woods, and the honey which they produce is of an exquisitely fine flavour.</p>
                <p>Amongst the animals useful to man, the ox may be placed first. Oxen, though
                    generally smaller than those of England, are capable of performing a great deal
                    of labour; and they are chiefly employed in those operations for which horses
                    are used in Britain. The horses bred in the island are middle sized, hardy, and
                    active, well fitted for the saddle or the harness, but not for the cart or
                    plough, to which they are never yoked. The mules in Jamaica are far more hardy
                    than the horses, and are consequently more valuable to the planter in assisting
                    him in his operations. The sheep are very good, and the mutton is excellent, but
                    high priced. Goats thrive and increase with little care, and the milk they yield
                    is much superior to that of cows. For the most part the foregoing animals feed
                    on the Guinea grass, and occasionally on the leaves of the bread-nut tree. Hogs
                    are very plentiful, and their flesh is sweet and delicious. All kinds of poultry
                    are raised here in great abundance, excepting geese and the common duck. But the
                    Muscovy duck, the turkey, the Guinea fowl, and the common dunghill fowl, thrive
                    and multiply wonderfully well.</p>
                <p>Jamaica is divided into three counties, viz. Surrey, Cornwall, and Middlesex; and
                    these are subdivided into twenty-one parishes. Surrey comprises seven parishes,
                    has an area of 1,522,149 acres, and contains two towns and eight villages;
                    Cornwall comprises five parishes, has an area of 1,305,235 acres, and contains
                    three towns and eight villages; and Middlesex comprises nine parishes, has an
                    area of 672,616 acres, and contains one town and thirteen villages. Kingston,
                    the most considerable town in the island, and in reality, though not nominally,
                    the capital, is situated on a gentle slope of about one mile in length, which is
                    bounded on the south by a spacious basin, through which all vessels must advance
                    beneath the commanding guns of Port Royal. The extended inclined plane, on the
                    verge of which Kingston stands, is enclosed on the north by the loftiest ridge
                    of the Blue Mountain chain, termed Liguana, which forms a semicircle, and <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192944315" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4315-0501"/> terminates on the
                    east at the narrow defile of Rock Fort. From this a long neck of land stretches
                    to Port Royal, and forms the south barrier of a beautiful haven. On the west the
                    semicircle terminates at a contracted pass, upon the edge of an impracticable
                    lagoon, from which the main land sweeps round to Port Henderson, which, together
                    with the projecting salt ponds, forms a natural harbour, where all the navies of
                    Europe might anchor at once. The entrance is defended in such a manner as to
                    render it altogether unassailable by sea. For nine miles around Kingston
                    stretches an alluvial plain, surrounded by a series of irregular mountains, some
                    of which have a considerable elevation. Kingston is principally built of wood;
                    and the houses, which are generally two stories in height, have piazzas fitted
                    up all round with Venetian blinds, or “jalousies,” as they are termed. The
                    streets, which are long, straight, and regular, incline gradually to the
                    harbour, being intersected at right angles by some cross ones. There are several
                    handsome private buildings in the West India style; the public offices are in
                    some instances elegant; and the English and Scotch churches are spacious
                    structures, particularly the former, which is built on a picturesque spot,
                    commanding a splendid view of the city, the plains around it, the amphitheatre
                    of mountains, and the spacious harbour of Port Royal. There are some good
                    institutions here for charitable purposes, particularly the free school, the
                    hospital, the lunatic asylum, and the asylum for deserted negroes. There are
                    excellent stores for all descriptions of goods, and during crop time the wharfs
                    present a busy spectacle, being crowded with buyers and sellers of all kinds of
                    goods here trafficked in. Kingston contains about 30,000 inhabitants, and lies
                    in longitude 76. 33. west, latitude 18. north. On a plain at the top of the
                    declivity on which Kingston is built, are the fine barracks called Up-Park Camp.
                    The camp covers an irregular square of between two and three hundred acres,
                    sloping towards Kingston. The barracks consist of two long parallel lines of
                    buildings, extending from east to west, two stories high, having a six feet
                    basement, an excellent hospital, and a splendid bath. The whole cantonment is
                    surrounded by a wall six feet in height, and surmounted by an iron palisading.
                    Twelve hundred and eighty-four European soldiers are here comfortably encamped;
                    and the attached offices are spacious, lofty, and commodious. A description of
                    the other military stations may also be introduced here. Port Royal is situated
                    nearly at the extremity of a tongue of land which forms the boundary of the
                    harbours of Kingston and of Port Royal. A great part of the town of Port Royal
                    is only a few feet above the level of the ocean, and the tongue of land towards
                    the sea is frequently inundated. The royal naval yard lies to the north, the
                    naval hospital to the south-west, and the works of Fort Charles and the
                    soldiers’ barracks to the southward. The fortifications are very strong, and the
                    situation, though low, is healthy, from its exposure to the sea breeze. The
                    harbour is capable of containing a thousand large ships with convenience. It was
                    upon this spot that the former Port Royal stood when it was overwhelmed by the
                    earthquake in 1692, and, with two thousand houses, was buried eight fathoms
                    under water. On the shore opposite to Port Royal is Apostle’s Battery, a small
                    fort erected on a rock, hort Augusta is a strong fortress, built upon a low neck
                    of land or peninsula, joined to the hills at Port Henderson by a narrow isthmus
                    of sand, having a coal formation for its base. The buildings of the fort occupy
                    the whole area of the point of the peninsula. The barracks are two stories high,
                    well ventilated, healthy, and generally contain four service companies. Stony
                    Füll garrison is situated nine miles north of Kingston, on a ridge of mountains,
                    about 2000 feet above the level of the sea. The barracks, which, generally
                    speaking, are placed on small detached eminences, are capable of containing five
                    hundred men; and as this post commands the grand pass which intersects the
                    island from north to south, it is jus <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> ly
                    considered as of great importance. Port Antonio, situated at the extremity of
                    the island, eighty tuiles from Kingston, is nearly insulated. The fort is a
                    half-moon battery, with a magazine in the rear. The barracks are new, elevated,
                    and commodious, but not capable of containing a great force. Marson Town is
                    situated in the interior, between the parishes of Westmoreland and St James, on
                    a very high mountain. The station is excellent, both in a military and a
                    sanatory point of view; and the barracks can accommodate upwards of two hundred
                    men. Lucea, or Fort Charlotte, is built on the north-eastern extremity of a
                    peninsula, being bounded on one side by the bay and harbour of Lucea, and on the
                    other by the sea. Majestic mountains rise immediately behind the town, about one
                    mile from the garrison.</p>
                <p>St Iago de la Vega, or Spanish Town as it is usually called, the capital of
                    Jamaica, is situated at the extremity of an extensive plain, extending far to
                    the south, southeast, and west, but with the mountains closely approaching the
                    town on the north and north-west, and distant from the sea at Port Royal harbour
                    six miles. At about a quarter of a mile to the north-east of the city runs the
                    Cobre, a river of considerable depth. The town is small, but the buildings are
                    in the magnificent style of Spanish architecture. The government residence,
                    termed the King’s House, is a large building occupying one whole side of a
                    quadrangle. On either side are a variety of public edifices appropriated to
                    government purposes; and the buildings fronting it comprehend the court-house,
                    grand and petty jury, and a variety of other apartments above, whilst the lower
                    part is occupied by a number of public offices. There are many splendid edifices
                    in the town and neighbourhood, possessed for the most part by gentlemen of the
                    legal or medical professions, and in some eases by government officers or
                    country proprietors. Spanish Town has a free school, poor-house, a charity for
                    the support of widows, and another for the support of poor maidens and
                    distressed strangers; and the population amounts to about .5000.</p>
                <p>Montego Bay is the chief town and sea-port of St James. It is situated at the
                    foot of a range of mountains, which nearly surround it, except on the sea side,
                    and is, in consequence of its trade, a thriving and pretty populous place. It is
                    not, however, equal to what it once was, having twice suffered severely from
                    fire. There is here a neat church, a school, a jail, and other public buildings,
                    including barracks, which are commodious and comfortable. Falmouth, or
                    Marthabrae, which is fifteen miles east of Montego Bay, is the principal town
                    and sea-port of Trelawny. From being an inconsiderable village, this place has
                    become larger and more populous than Montego Bay. It has derived its advantages
                    from its harbour, where a greater quantity of produce is shipped than from any
                    other part of the island, with the exception of Kingston. There is a good church
                    here, a handsome and spacious court-house, a marine hospital, a neat jail,
                    substantial and commodious barracks, with an hospital, stores, and quarters, and
                    a free school. Savannah-le-Mar is a fine military station, in the midst of a
                    highly-cultivated country. The town is situated on the beach, from which a low
                    alluvial flat extends for several miles. In this plain, about one mile from the
                    town, is an excellent range of barracks. In the other towns there is nothing
                    that claims particular attention; each of them having its church, its
                    court-house, its free school, its jail, and its workhouse.</p>
                <p>Jamaica is ruled by a governor or captain-general, aided by a council of twelve,
                    and a house of assembly. The <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944328"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4328-0502"/>governor is always, and the council generally,
                    appointed by the king, through his secretary for the colonies, from amongst the
                    <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> justices of the peace. The governor, who bears
                    the title of his excellency, is invested with the chief civil and military
                    authority, and has the disposal of such appointments as his majesty does not
                    reserve to him-selfor his ministers. The council of twelve are appointed by
                    mandamus from the king, and hold their offices during pleasure. The members of
                    this body stand in the same relation to the governor as the privy council in
                    England does to his majesty, giving advice to the superior when necessary. They
                    also constitute a part of the legislature of the colony, and occasionally sit as
                    judges. The lieutenant-governor, chief-justice, attorney-general, and the
                    bishop, are all <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> members of the council. The
                    assembly consists of forty-five members, each of the parishes sending two
                    representatives, and Spanish Town, Kingston, and Port-Royal, one additional
                    member each. The qualification for a representative is a freehold of L.300 per
                    annum, or a personal estate of L.3000. An elector must be of age, and possessed
                    of a freehold of L.10 per annum in the parish for which he votes. The governor
                    and council may, as occasion requires, summon the assembly together; and the
                    former, of his own authority, can adjourn, prorogue, and dissolve them. They
                    have the sole power of levying taxes, and the distribution thereof, with the
                    exception of an annual permanent revenue to the crown of L.10,000. The council
                    and assembly, with the consent of the king or the governor, may make laws,
                    statutes, and ordinances for the public peace, welfare, and good government of
                    the Colony, provided these be not repugnant, but, as near as may be, agreeable,
                    to the laws and statutes of Great Britain. The English common law is in force in
                    Jamaica, but many of the statute laws are not; for example, the game-laws,
                    poor-laws, bankruptlaws, and most of those relating to the revenue. An English
                    statute, to have force in Jamaica, must be re-enacted by the colonial
                    legislature. With regard to the imposition of any duty payable in the colonies,
                    Jamaica is placed in the same situation as the other colonies of Great Britain.
                    By the 18th Geo. III. cap. 12, the king and parliament declared, that
                    thenceforth they would not impose any duty payable in the colonies, except for
                    the regulation of commerce, the produce whereof should always be applied to the
                    use of the colony in which it is levied. The English bankruptcy laws are not in
                    force here; but there is in force the insolvent debtor’s act, by which a debtor,
                    on making oath that he is possessed of no property above bare necessaries, and
                    delivering his books, if he has any, into the hands of the deputy-marshal or
                    sheriff’s deputy, is, after remaining three months in jail, exonerated from all
                    demands against him. Any person proposing to leave the island must give three
                    weeks’ notice of his intention, on account of creditors.</p>
                <p>The supreme court of judicature holds its sittings i∏ Spanish Town, three times a
                    year, for three weeks each time. The chief justice, a nominee of government,
                    presides in it, and with him are associated several assistant-judges, who hold
                    their offices during pleasure. Thejuris-diction of the supreme court is
                    co-extensive with those of the courts of king’s bench, common pleas, exchequer,
                    and insolvent debtors in England, taken collectively. It also decides on
                    questions relative to trade and navigation, th <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi>
                    laying on of duties or customs on the import and export of goods, on
                    informations for land under the quit-rent acts, and all escheats; and is
                    likewise a court of appeal from the inferior courts of common pleas. There are
                    two assize-courts, one for the county of Surrey, and the other for the county of
                    Cornwall. Their sittings are similar to those of the supreme court, but at
                    different periods. For each of these there are eight assistant judges appointed,
                    two or three of whom sit in turns with the chief justice. They receive no
                    salaries, and, like the judges of the supreme court, they hold office only
                    during his majesty’s pleasure. The several inferior courts of common pleas have
                    jurisdiction over all causes (except those in which a freehold is concerned) to
                    the value of L.20 with costs; but, by the aid of <hi rend="italic">⅛</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">justifias</hi> from the chancellor, who is the governor, they may
                    hold pleas to any amount, except in actions where the title to land or negroes
                    is concerned. These courts are held at the same time, and in the same place of
                    the respective precincts, as the justices of the peace hold the
                    quarter-sessions, once in every three months; but some of them have the
                    privilege of sitting oftener.</p>
                <p>The parishes are under the government of a chief magistrate, termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">custos rotulorum,</hi> and bench of justices, who hold sessions of
                    the peace every month, and courts of common pleas, for trying actions to the
                    extent of L.20; debts not exceeding 40s. being determined by a single justice.
                    Each parish has a rector and church officers, according to the number of
                    churches or chapels therein; the vestries consist of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >custos,</hi> two magistrates, ten vestrymen, and the rector; the vestries have
                    the power of assessing and appropriating local taxes, alloting labourers for
                    repairing the highways, appointing way-wardens, nominating collectors of public
                    and parochial rates, and regulating the police of their several parishes.</p>
                <p>In the court of chancery the governor sits as chancellor, with powers similar to
                    those of the lord high chancellor in England, and the proceedings are the same
                    as those of the English court of chancery. There is also a court of error, where
                    appeals lie from the courts of law, and of which the governor and council are
                    the judges; acourt of ordinary, for determining ecclesiastical matters, of which
                    the governor is judge; and a court of vice-admiralty, the judge of which is
                    appointed by the crown.</p>
                <p>The commerce of this important island consists of the trade with the mother
                    country, the trade with British North America, and the trade with the island of
                    Cuba and other Spanish islands, the Spanish Main, and other territories on the
                    American continent formerly belonging to Spain. Its extent will be seen by the
                    following return.</p>

                <p>It is always a difficult matter to form a definite idea of the amount of property
                    in any place; but that in Jamaica, moveable and immoveable, is not
                    over-estimated at L.50,000,000 sterling money.</p>
                <p>The annual income, or ways and means, of the island, on an average of ten years,
                    has been estimated at about L.490,000. The returns, however, are far from being
                    explicit, for it is nearly impossible to ascertain the actual state of taxes in
                    the island, and the nature of their bearing and operation on commerce. The
                    expenditure for 1831, according to a return laid before parliament, amounted to
                    L.370,000, the items being as follows :—</p>

                <p>L.370,000</p>
                <p>According to the Jamaica budget for 1832, the income of the island was as follows
                    :—Taxes and internal duties, L.207,367; duties on vessels and cargoes, L.95,970;
                    certificates in circulation, L.399,205; and loan certificates, including
                    L.64,415 loan deposits, L.250,035. Of the expenditure, the military amounts to
                    L.184,I43, besides L.222,729 for the general defence of the island, of which
                    L.176,691 was incurred for martial law in 1832. The civil expenditure was
                    L.85,078, of which L.15,544 was for interest. “On a general view,” says
                    Montgomery Martin, “it may be stated that the annual public revenue of Jamaica
                    is L.300,000; and the vestry or parish, or local taxation of the different
                    counties, a nearly similar sum.” Jamaica thus contributes a very considerable
                    sum to the national exchequer.</p>
                <p>The want of an established currency in the West India islands has long been felt
                    as an evil. In no two islands is the currency alike; and in these again it
                    varies in proportion to sterling money, thus:</p>
                <p>Sterling. Currency. Dollar. Currency. Jamaica L.100 = L,140 1 = 6s. 8d.</p>
                <p>Barbadoes 100 = 135 1 = 6s. 3d.</p>
                <p>Windward )</p>
                <p>isles, except ŗ 100 = 175 1 = 8s. 3d.</p>
                <p>Barbadoes... J</p>
                <p>Leeward isles 100 = <hi rend="italic">200</hi> 1 = 9s.</p>
                <p>The metallic currency of the island is estimated at L. 100,000. The paper
                    currency consists entirely of the island checks issued by the receiver-general,
                    under the orders of the board of accounts, and upon the security of the island
                    and its revenue. The coins in circulation in this island are chiefly Spanish.
                    There are also some Portuguese gold pieces, and guineas and sovereigns. The
                    Spanish gold coins are doubloons, value sixteen dollars; half doubloons,
                    pistoles, value four dollars; and half pistoles.</p>
                <p>In time of war the naval establishment of Jamaica is considerable, but the peace
                    establishment consists only of a few vessels. The military establishment of the
                    island generally includes the head-quarters of four European regiments of the
                    line, one West India regiment composed otCaffres orWestCoast African negroes,
                    and astrong detachment of artillery, making altogether an army of about 3000
                    men; and of colonial militia from 16,000 to 18,000 men at arms, infantry and
                    cavalry, distributed throughout the several counties. All white males from the
                    age of fifteen to sixty are obliged by law to provide themselves with suitable
                    clothing, and to enlist in either the cavalry or militia. Substitutes are not
                    allowed.</p>
                <p>The general post-office and packets next claim our attention. This department
                    comprises a deputy postmaster-general, a principal, and numerous other clerks,
                    in Kingston, and deputy-postmasters stationed at proper and convenient distances
                    along the post-roads in every direction. Mails for all parts of the island are
                    despatched every Saturday evening, and an extra one for Spanish Town every
                    Friday morning. Two packets are despatched monthly from Great Britain for this
                    island. The first touches at the Windward Islands, and arrives at Jamaica about
                    the 20th of every month. The second takes a more direct route, and arrives at
                    her destination about a week after the former.</p>
                <p>The press, education, and religion, being intimately blended with one another,
                    may be connected together. The press is unshackled by stamp-duties, and on the
                    increase. There are two daily and four weekly newspapers in the island, all
                    conducted with considerable talent, and with little display of party feeling or
                    faction. Education is rapidly spreading under the aid of the local government,
                    as well as by private means. In the budget of the island there is nearly
                    L.10,000 allotted for free schools. The Jamaica free school at Walton Penn, in
                    the parish of St Ann, has L.1620; Woolmer’s free school, in the parish of
                    Kingston, has L.1500; Vere free school, L.1120; the Titchfieldfree school about
                    a similar sum,andsoon. There may be about thirty public or free schools,
                    attended by nearly 4000 scholars. Besides these, there are a number of most
                    respectable schools, where classical as well as ordinary education may be
                    obtained. Great efforts have been made for the extension of religion, but
                    whether with a success commensurate to the exertions bestowed it is difficult to
                    say. The outlay by the colonial government for 1831 was nearly L.25,000, of
                    which the curates’ stipends amounted to L.8000; rectors’ditto, to L.11,718;
                    expenses of building of chapels, L.1400; annuities of widowsand orphans of the
                    clergy, L.2000; salaries of the registrar and appositar of the diocese, L.475;
                    Presbyterian institutions, <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944367"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4367-0505"/>L.301; support of kirk in Kingston, L.700;
                    Presbyterian charity schools, L.200. The bishop of Jamaica, whose see extends
                    over the Bahamas and Honduras, has L.4000, and the archdeacon L.2000, per annum.
                    There are fifty-seven clergymen of the established church, twenty-one of whom
                    are rectors; four of the Scotch Presbyterian church, twenty-four of the Wesleyan
                    Methodist persuasion, sixteen of the Baptist, and eight of the Moravian. The
                    crown livings are now in the gift of the bishop. The established clergy are paid
                    partly by stipend and partly by fees. With regard to the expenditure of Jamaica
                    for her ecclesiastical establishments, the Rev. Mr Bridges informs us, that of
                    late years it has not fallen far short of L.30,000 annually. Pluralities are not
                    permitted; and the negro apprentices, as they are now called, are entitled to
                    demand the gratuitous services of the clergy.</p>
                <p>Owing to some mistaken feelings, the census of Jamaica has not been taken, so
                    that it is impossible to state with accuracy the actual population of the
                    island. By some it is said to be half a million, which would give seventy-eight
                    persons to the square mile. The following is a summary for 1833, of the returns
                    of the number of slaves, now apprentices, in the island, the number of stock or
                    horned cattle, and the quantity of land in cultivation and pasture. The returns
                    are given in upon oath.</p>
                <p>Slaves. Stock. Acres of Land.</p>
                <p>Middlesex 121,194 65,416 1,026,486</p>
                <p>Surrey 74,286 16,455 390,386</p>
                <p>Cornwall 107,152 83,373 818,852</p>
                <p>302,632 165,244 2,235,724</p>
                <p>By some the number of whites is estimated at 35,000; and of maroons there are
                    about 1200 in Jamaica. The number of what are denominated free people of colour
                    has not been ascertained, but the total population of the island is not
                    over-estimated at between 400,000 and 500,000.</p>
                <p>Before concluding the account of Jamaica, it is necessary to refer to a
                    dependency called the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cayman Isles.</hi> These are three
                    small isles, in latitude 19. 20. north, and</p>
