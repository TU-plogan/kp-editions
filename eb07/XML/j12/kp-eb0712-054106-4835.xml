                    learned of all the Latin fathers, was the son of Eusebius, and was born at
                    Stridon, a city of the ancient Pannonia, about the year 340. He studied at Rome
                    under Donatus, the learned grammarian. After having received baptism, he
                    proceeded into Gaul, <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944848"

                    rend="italic">He</hi><hi rend="italic">Synodis.</hi> He then went into Aquilcia,
                    where he contracted a friendship with Heliodorus, who prevailed on him to travel
                    with him into Thrace, Pontus, Bithynia, Galatia, and Cappadocia. In 372 St
                    Jerome retired into a désert in Syria, where he was persecuted by the orthodox
                    of Melitius’s party tor being a Sabellian, because he made use of the word <hi
                    rend="italic">hypostasis,</hi> which had been employed by the council of Rome in
                    369. This obliged him to go to Jerusalem, where he applied himself to the study
                    of the Hebrew language, in order to acquire a more perfect know ledge of the
                    Holy Scriptures; and about this time he consented to be ordained, on condition
                    that he should not be confined to any particular church. In 381, he went to
                    Constantinople to hear Gregory Nazianzen, and the following year returned to
                    Rome, where he was made secretary to Pope Damasus. He then instructed many Roman
                    ladies in piety and the knowledge of the sciences, which exposed him to the
                    calumnies of those whom he zealously reproved for their irregularities; and Pope
                    Siricius not having all the esteem for him to which his learning and virtue
                    justly entitled him, this learned doctor left Rome, and returned to the
                    monastery of Bethlehem, where he employed himself in writing against those whom
                    he called heretics, especially Vigilantins and Jovinian. He had a quarrel with
                    John of Jerusalem and Rufinus about the Origenists. St Jerome was the first who
                    wrote against Pelagius. He died on the 30th of September 420, at about eighty
                    years of age. There have been several editions of his works; the last, which is
                    that of Verona, is in eleven vols. folio. His principal works are, 1. A Latin
                    version of the Holy Scriptures, distinguished by the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pulgate;</hi> 2. Commentaries on the Prophets, Ecclesiastes, St
                    Matthew’s Gospel, and the Epistles to the Galatians, Ephesians, Titus, and
                    Philemon; 3. Polemical treatises against Montanus, Helvidius, Jovinian,
                    Vigilantius, and Pelagius; 4. Letters; 5. A treatise on the lives and writings
                    of the ecclesiastical authors who had flourished before his time. The style of
                    St Jerome is lively and animated, sometimes rising to the sublime.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Jerome</hi><hi rend="italic">of Prague,</hi> so called from
                    the place of his birth in Bohemia. He was neither a monk nor a clergyman, but
                    had received a learned education. Having embraced the opinions of John Hnss, he
                    began to propagate them in the year 1480. In the mean time the council of Nice
                    kept a watchful eye over him, and, considering him as a dangerous person, cited
                    him to appear before them and give an account of his faith. In obedience to this
                    citation, he went to Constance; but on his arrival, in 1415, finding Huss in
                    prison, he set out for his own country. Being seized on the way, imprisoned, and
                    examined, however, he was so intimidated that he retracted, and pretended to
                    approve of the condemnation of the opinions of Wickliff and Huss. But he
                    recanted his retractation, which, on the 26th of May 1416, he condemned in these
                    terms: “I am not ashamed to confess here publicly my weakness. Yes, with horror
                    I confess my base cowardice. It was only the dread of the punishment by fire
                    which drew me to consent, against my conscience, to the condemnation of the
                    doctrine of Wickliff and Huss.” Accordingly sentence was passed on him, in
                    pursuance of which he was delivered to the secular arm, and burned, in 1416. He
                    was a person of great parts, learning, and elocution.</p>
