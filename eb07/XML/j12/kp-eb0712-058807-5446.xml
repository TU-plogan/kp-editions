                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">JOGUES, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Yugs</hi></label>, certain
                    ages, eras, or periods of extraordinary length in the fabulous chronology of the
                    Hindus. They are (see Halhed’s <hi rend="italic">Preface to the Code of Gentoo
                    Laws,</hi> p. xxxvi.) four in number, viz.</p>
                <p>1. The Suttee Yug, or age of purity, which is said to have lasted three millions
                    two hundred thousand years; and they hold that the life of man was extended in
                    that age to one hundred thousand years, and that his stature was twenty-one
                    cubits.</p>
                <p>2. The Tirtah Yug, in which one third of mankind was corrupted, they suppose to
                    have consisted of two millions four hundred thousand years, during which men
                    lived to the age of ten thousand years.</p>
                <p>3. The Dwapaar Yug, in which half of the human race became depraved, endured one
                    million six hundred thousand years, during which the life of man was reduced to
                    a thousand years.</p>
                <p>4. The Collee Yug, in which all mankind were corrupted, or rather lessened (for
                    that is the true meaning of the word <hi rend="italic">Colled),</hi> is the
                    present era, which they suppose ordained to subsist four hundred thousand years,
                    and of which nearly five thousand are already past. The life of man in this
                    period is limited to one hundred years.</p>
                <p>Some account has already been given of the Indian chronology (see articles <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Chronology</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Hindustan),</hi> and
                    it is therefore unnecessary to recur to the subject in this place. But we may
                    nevertheless subjoin Dr Robertson’s observations on the above periods, from the
                    Notes to his <hi rend="italic">Historical Disquisition concerning India.</hi>
                    “If,” says he, “we suppose the computation of time in the Indian chronology to
                    be made by solar, or even by lunar years, nothing can be more extravagant in
                    itself, or more repugnant to our mode of calculating the duration of the world,
                    founded on sacred and infallible authority. From one circumstance, however,
                    which merits attention, we may conclude that the information which we have
                    hitherto received concerning the chronology of the Blindas is very incorrect. We
                    have, as far as I know, only five original accounts of the different Jogues or
                    eras of the Hindus. The first is given by Μ. Rogers, who received it from the
                    Brahmins on the Coromandel coast. According to it, the Suttee Jogue is a period
                    of one million seven hundred and twenty-eight thousand years; the Tirtah Jogue
                    is one million two hundred and ninety-six thousand years; theDwapaar Jogue is
                    eight hundred and sixty-four thousand. The duration of the Collee Jogue he does
                    not specify <hi rend="italic">(Porte Ouverte,</hi> p. 179). The next is that of
                    Μ. Bernier, who received it from the Brahmins of Benares. According to him, the
                    duration of the Suttee Jogue was two millions five hundred thousand years; that
                    of the T'ir-tah Jogue, one million two hundred thousand years; that of the
                    Dwapaar Jogue is eight hundred and sixty-four thousand years. Concerning the
                    period of the Codec Jogue he is likewise silent (<hi rend="italic">Voyages,</hi>
                    tom. ii. p. 160). The third is that of Colonel Dow; according to which the
                    Sutrae Jogue is a period of fourteen millions of years, the Tirtah Jogue one
                    million and eighty thousand, the Dwapaar Jogue <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192945459" xml:id="kp-eb0712-5459-0589"/>seventy-two thousand, and the
                    Collee Jogue thirty-six thousand years <hi rend="italic">(Hist, of
                    fīindost.</hi> vol. i. p. 2). The fourth account is that of M. le Gentil, who
                    received it from the Brahmins of the Coromandel coast; and as his information
                    was acquired in the same part of India, and derived from the same source, with
                    that of Μ. Rogers, it agrees with his in every particular (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Mem. de l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Académie</hi><hi rend="italic">des Sciences
                    pour</hi> 1772, tom. ii. part i. p. 176). The fifth is the account of Mr Halhed,
                    which has been already given. From this discrepancy, not only of the total
                    numbers, but of many of the articles in the different accounts, it is manifest
                    that our information concerning Indian chronology is hitherto as uncertain as
                    the whole system of it is wild and fabulous. To me it appears highly probable,
                    that when we understand more thoroughly the principles upon which the factitious
                    eras or jogues of the Hindus have been formed, that we may be more able to
                    reconcile their chronology to the true mode of computing time, founded on the
                    authority of the Old Testament; and may likewise find reason to conclude, that
                    the account given by their astronomers, of the situation of the heavenly bodies
                    at the beginning of the Collee Jogue, is not established by actual observation,
                    but the result of a retrospective calculation.”</p>
