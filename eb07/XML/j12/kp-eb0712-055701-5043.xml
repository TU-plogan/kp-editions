                <p>JESUS, the Divine Author of the Christian religion, was born at Bethlehem, a city
                    of the tribe of Judah, about six miles south-east from Jerusalem. His mother was
                    a Jewish virgin named Mary, the betrothed wife of Joseph, both in the humblest
                    rank of life, though both of the royal race of David. The date of his birth is
                    not mentioned in the sacred record; and there has been a difference of opinion
                    among the learned who have engaged in the inquiry, respecting the precise period
                    when it took place. It is now, however, generally agreed upon, that it must be
                    fixed a few years earlier than is indicated by the epoch of our era, which,
                    according to the common computation, corresponds with <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    Luke, iii. 1 and 23, many have supposed that the nativity was in <hi

                    the conjecture of Kepler, that the conjunction between Jupiter and Saturn, which
                    took place in that year, was the star seen by the wise men; though it may be
                    justly questioned how far the principles of scriptural interpretation admit of
                    the supposition that the phenomenon referred to corresponds with the particulars

                    by night, is inconsistent with the idea that it could have been in December or
                    January, or during the heat of the summer months; as we know that in these
                    periods the herds were no longer left in the fields.<note anchored="true"

                    evangelists to determine whether it was in spring or in autumn that Jesus was

                    have been made to connect the birth of Jesus with the feast of the Passover and

                    vague and fanciful analogies, and do not rest on historical grounds. See Hales’

                <p>The chronological error in the vulgar era, and in the season for celebrating the
                    festival of Christmas, does not in any way affect the truth of the gospel
                    history; and cannot indeed appear strange, when it is considered that several
                    centuries elapsed before the method of computing time by the birth of Christ was
                    introduced, and that the festival of the nativity was not observed in the
                    primitive church. During the first three centuries, the Christians adopted the
                    ordinary modes of reckoning time, which prevailed among the heathen around them.
                    Different methods were afterwards employed; and it was not till the sixth
                    century that a Roman abbot named Dionysius the Less was induced, by motives of
                    religion, to have recourse to the expedient of determining dates by the number
                    of years from the period when the Son of God was born of a woman. The
                    commemoration of the day of the nativity was not generally observed throughout
                    the Christian world till the fourth century. At that time the western church
                    fixed upon the 25th of December, and their example was generally followed.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Clemens Alexandrinus mentions
                    (Strom, i.), that some celebrated the natvity on the 20th of May, others on the
                    20th of April. The 6th of January was celebrated by the Basilidian Gnostics as
                    the day of the nativity and of the baptism. This custom afterwards became
                    general for a time throughout the East. And when the birth-day was fixed by the
                    western church on 1he 25th of December, the 6th of January continued to be
                    observed as the Epiphany.</p></note> Different causes have been assigned for the
                    choice of this day. Sir Isaac Newton, in his work on Daniel, supposes that it
                    was agreeably to the principle by which the chief feasts were fixed at the
                    cardinal points, without regard to historical accuracy; as the annunciation at
                    the vernal equinox, and St John the Baptist’s day at the summer solstice.
                    Hospinian and others have been of opinion that the festivities connected with
                    the celebration of Christmas were intended to make up for the Saturnalia,
                    conformably to the practice which had been acted upon from an earlier period, of
                    smoothing the way for the conversion of the heathen, by <pb break="no"

                    ceremonies under a new form. And there is not wanting reason to suppose, that
                    from the winter solstice being observed as the birth-day of the sun, when that
                    luminary, returning from the south, seemed to be restored to the world, the
                    transition was suggested to the celebration of the birth of him who was the life

                <p>The circumstances connected with the birth of Jesus corresponded in a remarkable
                    degree with the predictions of the Jewish prophets respecting the Messias. He
                    belonged to the tribe of Judah, and was of the house of David. Events, over
                    which .his earthly kindred had no control, fixed his birth at Bethlehem, from
                    which place the promised Deliverer was to spring. The seventy prophetic weeks of
                    Daniel were approaching to their termination. And so determinate were these and
                    other predictions, that a general opinion prevailed, even in heathen countries,
                    that the tide of time was bringing our race to a mighty epoch, and that a prince
                    was to arise in the East who was to obtain the empire of the world.<note

                    shown in the appointed scene and season of the birth of Jesus. From the
                    geographical situation of Palestine, forming a part of Asia, touching upon
                    Africa, and connected by the Mediterranean with the whole of Europe, the Jews
                    enjoyed the best opportunities of diffusing the knowledge of their principles.
                    And the intercourse between remote nations, occasioned by the conquests of
                    Alexander and the progress of the Roman arms, afforded increased facilities for
                    propagating new opinions, while it forced upon men’s notice the different forms
                    of national worship, and led to an examination βf the great principles of
                    religious belief.</p>
                <p>Soon after the birth of Jesus, his parents fled with him to Egypt, to save him
                    from the fury of Herod, whose suspicions were awakened by the idea of a rival to
                    his throne.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Matt. ii∙
                    13.</p><p/></note> An uncertain tradition fixes the spot of the residence of the
                    holy family at Matarea, near the ancient Heliopolis; and one of the apocryphal
                    gospels contains various idle accounts of miracles which marked the presence of
                    a superior being. From such traditions the Jews took occasion to circulate many
                    ridiculous tales of magical arts learned by Jesus while in Egypt, which woere
                    frequently referred to by some of the early philosophic opponents of the
                    Christian faith. The malignant insinuations of Celsus, however, and the absurd
                    legends which long found currency among the Jews, are wholly inconsistent with
                    the authentic narrative of the return from Egypt upon the death of Herod, when
                    Jesus might still be said to be in infancy.</p>
                <p>Upon their arrival in Palestine, Joseph was led to take up his residence in
                    Nazareth, in Galilee. Here the opening character of Jesus engaged the love and
                    excited the admiration of all who knew him.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Luke, ii. 52.</p></note> And, even before his childhood was
                    ended, in his twelfth year, when his parents carried him up to one of the annual
                    Jewish feasts, we find him attracting the notice of the learned Rabbis, entering
                    into discussion with them, and filling them with astonishment at his
                    extraordinary knowledge and sagacity. It would appear that, according to the
                    custom of his”countrymen, he followed the trade of his foster-father. In Mark,
                    vi. 3, he is spoken of familiarly as “the carpenter.”<note anchored="true"

                    This passage seems to have been tampered with as early as the time of Origen,
                    probably from a wish to do away the prejudice that existed in many minds against
                    the idea of a Saviour in such a state of humiliation. There is another reading,

                <p>In this lowly situation, and in the midst of these servile employments, a
                    character was silently maturing, such as the world had never before witnessed;
                    and those lofty designs were conceived, the accomplishment of which was to give
                    a new impress to the condition of society, and to alter the destiny of our race.
                    Frequent attempts have been made to explain by the operation of natural causes,
                    how, in circumstances so unfavourable, a character like that of our Saviour’s
                    could have arisen; and various theories have been framed respecting the manner
                    in which the plan to which he devoted himself was suggested to his mind. The
                    insufficiency of these attempts we shall afterwards consider. In the mean time,
                    however, it may be remarked, that, though no explanation can be given, from
                    circumstances merely external, of the growth of such a mind as that of Jesus,
                    which must be sought only in the seed of the immortal plant itself, it is by no
                    means inconsistent with the highest ideas that can be entertained of the
                    divinity of his nature, to suppose a progression in the development of his
                    humanity. External influences must to a certain extent modify the character of
                    every man. We are told, accordingly, that “he <hi rend="italic">grew</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">wisdom'</hi> as weH as “stature.” And the commanding situation and
                    romantic beauty of the city of his dwelling, the instructions of his mother,
                    intercourse with the heathen, which, from the proximity of Nazareth to Galilee
                    of the Gentiles, must have been frequent, may have proved among the subordinate’
                    aids for awakening that sense of the loveliness and majesty of external nature
                    to which we find so many references in his discourses, and that susceptibility
                    of every tender emotion which his whole history manifested, and that enlarged
                    philanthropy which looked beyond the distinctions of Jew and Gentile, of sect
                    and class, of rank and station, and considered the whole human race as members
                    of one great family, as children of the same heavenly parent. Such influences,
                    however, are matter of conjecture rather than of positive knowledge; for no
                    reference is made to them by any of the Evangelists. The piety of his mother and
                    of Joseph renders it certain that he would from infancy be made acquainted with
                    the Old Testament Scriptures; and these not only contain the germ of all that is
                    pure and elevating in religious sentiment, but also are, more than any other
                    study, calculated to awaken the curiosity and stimulate the powers of the
                    opening mind. His conversation and discourses everywhere show that he must have
                    made a constant study of the sacred records. It appears that he never attended
                    any rabbinical school, nor did he receive a learned education.<note

                    find him among those who presented themselves to John upon the banks of the
                    Jordan to be baptized. The intervening period was no doubt employed in maturing
                    the plan for the arduous undertaking to which he was prompted by the stirrings
                    of the Divinity within him. The consciousness of his high vocation, however, to
                    a career that was to attract the notice of the world, did not interfere with the
                    pious observance of his filial duties, or the laborious discharge of the common
                    offices of his early situation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    consecration to his new office. The heavens were opened, the Holy Spirit <pb

                    him, and a voice was heard from heaven declaring him to be the Son of God, and
                    claiming for him the attention of mankind. Immediately after his initiation, he
                    was impelled to retire into the solitudes of a wilderness, with a view,
                    probably, of meditating on the work before him; and, by fasting and prayer,
                    after the example of former prophets, to prepare himself for his great
                    undertaking. A higher purpose was also accomplished during this retirement, an
                    opportunity being afforded him for proving the purity and sinlessness of his
                    nature, and establishing his fitness for the office upon which he had entered,
                    by baffling the temptations of Satan.</p>
                <p>After this mysterious conflict, Jesus returned to Bethabara, a place near to that
                    part of the river Jordan over which the Israelites had passed under Joshua. It
                    was here that disciples first began to gather around him; and few passages in
                    history are more interesting than that<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>John, i. 29, <hi rend="italic">ad fin.</hi></p></note> which
                    tells of the individuals who first attached themselves to his cause; of their
                    curiosity, their doubts, their conferences with him, the influence he gained
                    over their minds, and their eagerness to communicate to others the wondrous
                    tidings, that they had found the promised Messias in the person of Jesus of
                    Nazareth. The first two individuals who joined themselves to him were disciples
                    of John the Baptist, who pointed out Jesus when walking at a little distance, as
                    the “Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world.” Upon this they
                    introduced themselves to his notice, and on his invitation accompanied him to
                    the house where he lodged. What took place at this memorable interview, or how a
                    solitary and almost unknown stranger attached to his cause the first two
                    disciples, we are not informed; whether by some token of supernatural knowledge
                    or power, or by the natural influence of a superior mind; the conviction was
                    produced; and with it was imparted the spirit, which was at the foundation of
                    the indefinite extension of the new cause, viz. the desire of imparting their
                    own impressions of the new doctrines to others. One of the two individuals was
                    Andrew, brother of Simon, who afterwards became so eminent in the primitive
                    history of Christianity. “Andrew first findeth his own brother, and saith, we
                    have found the Messias; and <hi rend="italic">he brought him to Jesus?</hi>
                    These three were the converts of the first day; and in a short time, without any
                    advantages of birth or station, or human learning, without the aid of powerful
                    relations or influential patrons, he had a considerable number of attached
                    followers, who listened to his teaching, and accompanied him from place to
                    place. At the feast of the Passover, along with the rest of his countrymen,
                    Jesus went up to Jerusalem, where he increased the number of his disciples by
                    his doctrines and miracles. He seems to have continued in the land of Judea
                    about six or seven months; when the success of his preaching, exciting the
                    attention and envy of the Scribes and Pharisees, led him to withdraw into
                    Galilee, where the power of the Jewish Sanhedrim was less to be dreaded. In
                    passing through Samaria, where the political circumstances of the inhabitants
                    freed them from some of the prejudices of the Jews<note anchored="true"

                    Messias, he first openly and publicly proclaimed the great truth, that all
                    distinctions of Jews and Gentiles and Samaritans were to be at an end; and that,
                    without reference to time or place, or outward ceremony, the Deity was to be
                    worshipped in purity of spirit, and in faith on the promised Messias.<note

                    first year of our Saviour’s ministry is derived almost exclusively from John.
                    The other Evangelists confine themselves to his preaching in Galilee, with the
                    exception of what took place at Jerusalem immediately preceding the
                    crucifixion.</p></note> He then visited the whole of Galilee, everywhere
                    accompanying the instruction he gave, in synagogues, or in private houses, or in
                    the open fields, with miraculous proofs of his divine character and commission.
                    ln Nazareth he was first subjected to personal violence, his townsmen taking
                    offence at his lowly origin. To avoid their malice, he passed on to Capernaum,
                    which henceforth became the place of his general residence, and from which, as
                    from a centre, he visited the whole surrounding country. The first year of his
                    ministry seems to have been attended with almost universal success. He met with
                    no outward obstruction in his work, except in Nazareth; his approach was
                    everywhere welcomed, and increasing multitudes followed him in his progress.</p>
                <p>During the second year of his ministry, his followers became so numerous that he
                    chose twelve persons who might assist him in his work, and be prepared to
                    propagate his religion when he should leave the world. These he named Apostles,
                    an appellation which was appropriated at that time among the Jews to certain
                    public officers who were the ministers of the high priests, and who were
                    occasionally despatched on missions of importance to foreign parts.<note

                    number twelve had probably a reference to the twelve tribes, as the seventy whom
                    he afterwards chose might be from the number of the Jewish Sanhedrim. The
                    increasing success of Jesus raised up against him a host of enemies, and from
                    this time he was continually subjected to the cavilsof the Sadducees, and still
                    more of the Scribes and Pharisees, whose objections were of such a nature as
                    might be expected from unprincipled and hypocritical men, who witnessed with
                    jealousy any proceeding likely to diminish their influence among the people, and
                    who were inflamed with resentment at the exposure which was made of their true
                    character.</p>
                <p>It has already been observed that Galilee was the chief scene of our Saviour’s
                    ministerial labours. He did not, however, confine himself wholly to that
                    province, but occasionally visited other parts. We find him at one time on the
                    coasts of Tyre and Sidon; at another beyond Jordan; and at the passover he
                    uniformly went up to Jerusalem. As the Evangelists do not relate events in
                    chronological order, we are without any precise information as to the exact
                    degree of success that from this period attended his labours; it seems probable
                    that his followers continued to increase, and that a deep and general impression
                    was made upon the public mind. His proceedings at last excited the attention of
                    all classes in Judea. Herod Antipas was haunted with the idea that he must be
                    John the Baptist restored to life, and was desirous to have a personal interview
                    with him; and there is not wanting reason to suppose that he received the homage
                    of princes more remote. The eyes of the chief men of Judea were now upon him.
                    The subject of his miracles was discussed in the Sanhedrim, and frequent
                    attempts were made to seize and bring him before the council, though without any
                    settled purpose, perhaps, how they were to proceed against him. At last, after
                    the restoration of Lazarus to life, which led to the conversion <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> a multitude of the Jews, a meeting of the Pharisaic party
                    was held, when it was finally determined that he should be put to death. The
                    resuitis well known. In the dead of the night he was surprised in the midst of
                    his secret devotions, hurried before the Sanhedrim, and, after the mockery of a
                    trial, in which even his judgeacknowledged his entire innocence, he was adjudged
                    to suffer death. He was then carried to the usual place of execution, on a small
                    hill named Calvary, on the west of Jerusalem, a little without the walls, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192945082" xml:id="kp-eb0712-5082-0560"/> and there he was
                    crucified. This dreadful scene was accompanied with signs and wonders which
                    proclaimed the dignity of the sufferer. A supernatural darknessoverspread the
                    land of Judea, “and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain, and the
                    earth did quake, and the rocks rent, and the graves were opened.” After his
                    death his body was taken down from the cross, and laid in a tomb hewn out of a
                    rock, after the manner of the Jewish sepulchres. Every precaution was used to
                    prevent the removal of the body by the disciples. A great stone was rolled upon
                    the door of the tomb, and a watch of Roman soldiers, consisting of sixty men,
                    was appointed to guard it. This was on our Friday. The following day was the
                    Jewish Sabbath; the stone remained in its place fixed and secure, and the
                    soldiers continued their watch undisturbed. But on the morning of the third day,
                    amidst a display of supernatural agency that mocked the precautions of the
                    Jewish rulers, Jesus arose from the dead. After this he continued some time on
                    earth, affording the most indubitable evidence of his identity, and of the
                    reality of his resurrection from the dead, and instructing his disciples in the
                    nature of the doctrine they were to teach mankind. At last, at the end of forty
                    days, he led forth his disciples to Bethany, and there, while giving them bis
                    blessing, “he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.”<note

                <p>The year of our Saviour’s death cannot be exactly ascertained. Two extreme
                    points, however, can be mentioned, within which that event must have taken
                    place. The one is the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius,<note

                    which John the Baptist began his ministry, and the other, the year in which that
                    emperor died, when Pilate had left the province of Judea. As Jesus entered upon
                    his ministry soon after the public appearance of John,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>John, i. 19, 29, 35; ii. 1.</p></note> it
                    would bring us to a near approximation to the date sought for, could we say how
                    many pass-overs were celebrated by our Saviour. Even this, however, cannot be
                    determined with certainty. The most probable opinion seems that of those who fix
                    the number at three, and this would bring us to <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> u.
                    783. Irenaeus states that Jesus was forty or fifty years of age when he was put

                    5; John, viii. 57.</p></note> but it is generally agreed upon that his opinion

                <p>We have little authentic information respecting the character or history of Jesus
                    additional to what is contained in the New Testament. The name Chrestus is

                    been embodied in the preceding narrative. There is a passage in Josephus,<note

                    xviii. 3, 3.</p></note> where his life and character are referred to in the
                    following terms: “At that time lived Jesus, a wise man [if he may be called a
                    man], for he performed many wonderful works. He was a teacher of such men as
                    received the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him manv Jews and Gentiles.
                    [This was the Christ.] And when Pilate, at the instigation of the chief men
                    among us, had condemned him to the cross, they who before had conceived an
                    affection for him did not cease to adhere to him [for on the third day he
                    appeared to them alive again, the divine prophets having foretold these and many
                    wonderful things concerning him]. And the sect of the Christians, so called from
                    him, subsists to this time.” This remarkable passage is referred to by
                    Eusebius,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Hist. Eccles,</hi> i. ii.; <hi rend="italic">Demonstr.

                    question from his time till the sixteenth century, when Gifanius and Osiander
                    refused to receive it. Since that period it has afforded matter for much
                    controversy among the learned. In favour of the genuineness of the passage, it
                    has been argued, that we have the undisputed fact that it is found in all the
                    copies of the works of Josephus from the time of Eusebius. It also exists in a
                    Hebrew translation in the Vatican; and there is an Arabic version preserved by
                    the Maronites of Mount Libanus. In addition to this external evidence, it is
                    urged that the number of Christians in the time of Josephus was too great to
                    admit of the supposition that he should pass them over altogether unnoticed, an
                    improbability which is increased by the fact that he makes mention of John the
                    Baptist,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Antiq.</hi> xviii. 5.</p></note> and of the death of “James, the
                    brother of Jesus, called the Christ.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Antiq</hi> xx. 9, 1.</p></note> On the
                    other hand, it is certain that Josephus was not himself a Christian; and yet the
                    passage, as it stands in his writings, involves the profession of belief in the
                    divine mission of Jesus. It is farther to be remarked, that this testimony in
                    favour of Christ is not quoted by any of the apologists of Christianity who
                    preceded Eusebius; and in particular, Origen,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">C. Ceis.</hi></p></note>
                    while he refers to the allusion made by Josephus to the death of James, and to
                    his account of John the Baptist, passes over in silence the passage in question,
                    though it would have afforded a more decisive answer had it been contained in
                    the copies of the Jewish historian then in circulation. The arguments on both
                    sides appear plausible, and the difficulties upon either supposition cannot
                    perhaps be removed but by the conjecture, that Josephus did introduce into his
                    work a notice of Jesus, though without admitting him to be the Messias, and that
                    some over-zealous Christian about the time of Eusebius had inserted some
                    additional clauses. This opinion is now generally gone into by the continental
                    critics. Those parts which are usually looked upon as interpolations are marked

                <p>It was scarcely possible that the appearance of so remarkable a character as that
                    of our Saviour should not have induced many individuals, from various motives,
                    to commit an account of him to writing. Accordingly, it appears,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Luke, i. 1.</p></note> that
                    from the earliest period many histories of his life were in circulation. The
                    words of St Luke seem to imply that these narratives were.defective or
                    erroneous; but there is nothing to prevent us from supposing that some of them
                    might be the productions of men of good intentions, though deficient in the
                    talents or information requisite for so important an undertaking. It was
                    otherwise, however, in succeeding times. After the four gospels had been written
                    by the Evangelists, and had been generally received as of divine authority in
                    the Christian church, heretics and others, who departed from the true faith, had
                    recourse to the expedient of forging gospels, epistles, &amp;c. under the name
                    of some of the apostles, or that of our Lord himself, to which they might refer
                    in support of their tenets. These works were frequently formed out of the
                    genuine gospels, with such additions and omissions as the purposes of the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192945095" xml:id="kp-eb0712-5095-0561"/> writers required.
                    There were not wanting members of the true church who followed the same
                    practice, with the mistaken idea that the piety of the faithful might thus be
                    promoted, or that an answer might be afforded to some of the objections of Jews
                    and Heathens. In the second century, Irenaeus<note anchored="true"

                    and apoeryphal books; and in the following age they were greatly increased. The
                    greater part of these writings perished in the course of ages. Of such of them
                    as remained, a collection was published by Fabricius, about the beginning of
                    last century, in his <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    full account of them is given, with translations, in Jones’well-known work on
                    the Canon. Several of them were republished in London some years ago, in a work
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">The Apocryphal New Testament.</hi></p>
                <p>That these works are not to be received as genuine, may be proved by their vast
                    inferiority to the canonical gospels, and still more decidedly by the faet, that
                    they were not recognised by the Fathers. In <hi rend="italic">The Gospel of our
                    Saviour s Infancy,</hi> there arc some passages which are referred to by
                    Eusebius, Athanasius, and Chrysostom, as containing some trifling particulars of
                    true history connected with the life of Christ, but it is not ranked by them
                    among the inspired writings. It is worthy of remark, that it was from this
                    production, and from <hi rend="italic">The Gospel of the Birth of Mary,</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Protevangelion of St James,</hi> that Mahommed derived all
                    his knowledge of our Saviour’s life. Indeed he does not seem to have been at all
                    acquainted with the canonical gospels; and the legends of the East in general
                    concerning our Lord are all from apocryphal sources.<note anchored="true"

                    been sent by Agbarus, king of Edessa, who had heard of the miraeles of Jesus,
                    and who requested him to come and cure him of a malady with which he was
                    afflicted. It is added, that our Saviour wrote to him a letter, in which he
                    promised to send one of his disciples to heal him. A translation of this
                    correspondence from the Syriac original, contained in the archives of the church
                    of Edessa, is given by Eusebius. Additions were afterwards made to the story,—
                    as that Thaddeus, one of the seventy, was deputed by Thomas, after the
                    resurrection, to fulfil the promise of the Saviour; and Evagrius<note

                    Eva</hi> g. iv. 26.</p></note> mentions, that our Lord not only wrote a letter,
                    but that he sent a handkerchief also, with his picture drawn upon it. There can
                    be no doubt that the letters mentioned by Eusebius actually existed among the
                    records of Edessa, and that they were seen by that historian. But, in addition
                    to the external evidence from the letters themselves, the fact that they are
                    taken notice of by no preceding Christian writer affords demonstration that they
                    are forgeries, which owe their existence probably to the national vanity of some
                    of the early Christians of Edessa. We are not informed that our Saviour ever
                    committed anything to writing, and we may be assured that if he had, it would
                    not have passed unnoticed by his first followers.</p>
                <p>There is another statement contained in Eusebius, deserving of more attention. He
                    mentions that Pontius Pilate, after the crucifixion of our Lord, wrote such an
                    account of his character and miracles to the Emperor Tiberius, as induced that
                    prince to propose to the senate that a place should be assigned to Jesus among
                    the deities worshipped by the Romans, but that the senate opposed the wishes of
                    the emperor. It was certainly the custom of the governors of provinces to write
                    memoirs of the remarkable occurrences of the places where they presided; and
                    there is nothing improbable in the idea that Pilate, who was convinced of the
                    innocence of Christ, should send an account of him to Tiberius. It is certain
                    also that Justin Martyr,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Apol.</hi> i.</p></note> in his Apology for the
                    Christians, presented to the Emperor Antoninus Pius, refers to the acts of
                    Pilate, as containing an account of the circumstances connected with the
                    crucifixion; and Tertullian,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    towards the end of the century, appeals to the same records. Still, however, we
                    conceive that the evidence for the existence of these acts is defective; and the
                    proposal alluded to by Tiberius to the Roman senate, though mentioned by
                    Tertullian, and repeated by writers who succeeded him, is irreconcilable with
                    the character of Tiberius, and the state of the Roman empire at that period. At
                    a later period, a spurious work, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Acts of

                    Jesus; and it appears that acts of a contrary nature were fabricated by certain

                    his character, by representing him as a magician. It was believed among them
                    that there was a mystic word which enabled those who had learned it to direct at
                    will the current of events; and a foolish story was circulated as early as the

                    this potent sign. Upon this fable a life of Jesus was ultimately constructed,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Toldoth</hi><hi rend="italic">Jeschu.</hi> The
                    substance of this abominable fabrication is, that Jesus was born in adultery,
                    the particulars of which are detailed with revolting minuteness; that he
                    contrived to steal the sacred word, by pronouncing which he performed miraeles
                    at will, healed the sick, opened the eyes of the blind, raised the dead; by
                    means of such works he gained over many converts, and would have been still more
                    successful had not another Jew disabused the minds of his countrymen by learning
                    the same word, and disclosing to the people how the same miracles could be
                    performed. The work terminates with an account of the death of Jesus, and of his
                    body being stolen away by his disciples. It was published, with a Latin
                    translation and learned notes, by Wagenseil, in his <hi rend="italic">Tela Iynea

                    scarcely be believed that the more learned among the Jews gave credit to its
                    mendacious absurdities; though they long encouraged its circulation, to inspire
                    their brethren with a deeper contempt for Christianity and its followers.</p>
                <p>The determination of the questions relative to the person and character and
                    history of Jesus involves all the essential particulars connected with the <hi

                    Christian faith. But in an article like the present, we cannot enter fully upon
                    the consideration of any of these important subjects. We shall merely offer a
                    few remarks upon such particulars as depend upon elements of a historical
                    nature, leaving the discussion of matters of doctrine for other departments <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> this work.</p>
                <p>The existence of such a person as Jesus Christ has scarcely ever been seriously
                    denied; and the general tenor of the narrative of the Evangelists, with the
                    omission of the miraculous parts, has been received as substantially correct by
                    many who refuse to acknowledge the truth of our religion. The evidences for the
                    genuineness and authenticity of the four Gospels will be stated under the proper
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945108" xml:id="kp-eb0712-5108-0562"/>heads, from
                    which it will appear that no history whatever is supported by stronger external
                    proof; and that were it not from internal grounds as to the nature of the facts
                    recorded, and the consequences which flow from them, the truth of the narrative
                    would never have been called in question. Even the miracles were admitted by the
                    earliest opponents of Christianity, Celsus, Philostratus, and Hierocles. These
                    individuals did not deny the reality of the works performed by Jesus; they only,
                    upon internal evidence, objected to the idea that a person in circumstances so
                    lowly should be supposed to be divine, or explained away the supernatural
                    appearances by the supposition of the exercise of magical arts,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Celsus.</p></note> or
                    maintained that the few miracles which were performed did not warrant the idea
                    of a divine character.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Hierocles.</p></note></p>
                <p>Different ground has been taken up by infidels in modern times, who, while they
                    have been constrained to admit the truth of the general statements of the
                    Evangelists, have rejected altogether the supernatural machinery. In setting
                    aside the miraculous part of the gospel history, the chief difficulty has been
                    found in giving a consistent view of the character of Jesus. If the miracles
                    performed by Christ were not real, the conclusion seems irresistible that he
                    must have been either a deliberate impostor, or a self-dc-ceived enthusiast. By
                    some writers, accordingly, Jesus has been held up to ridicule and contempt, as
                    exhibiting many weaknesses, and even vices—as a pretended miracleworker and
                    false prophet. Several of the deistical writers of our own country took up this
                    position, and were followed by Voltaire and other French authors. The
                    anti-Christian views of Voltaire were adopted by Frederick the Great,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>trederick, while he treated
                    with contempt the doctrines of the Gospel, acknowledged the excellence of its
                    morality, which he considered (it is unnecessary to remark how erroneously) as
                    essentially the same with that of the Stoics.</p></note> whose example and
                    encouragement gave rise to the spirit which has unto Innately led so many of the
                    theologians of Germany to exclude from Christianity every trace of supernatural
                    agency.</p>
                <p>The notices of the English deists of the last century, respecting the miracles
                    and character of Jesus, in many instances at least, were little more than
                    incidental, and formed merely a part of their general argument against the truth
                    of our religion. In Germany the work has been more systematically pursued. With
                    the characteristic industry of that learned people, the writings of the
                    Evangelists have been considered in every possible form. Different theories have
                    been framed as to the secret views of Jesus, as to the real causes of his
                    success, and as to the true character of the alleged miracles which were
                    performed. Voltaire, after our English authors, had endeavoured to account for
                    the exalted morality taught by Jesus, by supposing that it was borrowed from the
                    self-denying tenets of the sect of the Essenes.<note anchored="true"

                    264.</p></note> The idea was followed out by various German authors; while the
                    lofty theology of the Alexandrian Pla-tunists, and the liberal spirit of
                    Sadduceism, were referred to by others as sufficient to originate in an
                    enthusiastic mind the system taught by Jesus. Some, like Edelmann, while they
                    have not disputed that a virtuous Jew named Jesus actually existed, have refused
                    to acknowledge the genuineness and authenticity of the Gospels. 1leimarus, in a

                    universally ascribed to Reimarus, well known as an able critic, and the author

                    He published nothing respecting his views as to the subject of revealed religion
                    during his life, but he left various manuscripts of an anti-christian character,
                    some of which falling into the hands of Lessing, who at that time had the
                    superintendence of the ducal library at Wolfenbiittel, were published by him in

                    by far the ablest was that by Reinhard, a celebrated German preacher, in a woik

                    object of Jcsus and his disciples, while he acknowledges the excellence of the
                    morals, and even of the doctrines, of the Gospel, accuses Jesus of not observing
                    the rules which he prescribed, and of making use of his system as a means for
                    promoting his political views; and while he does justice to many of the high
                    qualities of Jcsus, he represents him, upon the whole, as actuated by ambition,
                    and as aiming at the establishment of his own power under the character of the
                    triumphant conqueror to whom the Jews looked forward in their promised Messias.
                    His arguments are chiefly founded upon the acknowledged ideas of the Jewish
                    people respecting the Messias, upon the caution exhibited by Jesus in arrogating
                    that character, and upon his entering Jerusalem in royal state, when be
                    conceived that his cause was sufficiently advanced to insure his success; while
                    the grief he exhibited in the garden of Gethsemane, and his exclamation on the
                    cross, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me ?” are considered as tokens of
                    his disappointed hopes. This view has been taken by other writers, with various
                    minor modifications, and with different degrees of learning and presumption.
                    Others have represented Jesus as the dupe of his own imagination,—as one who, by
                    the dreams of a fond mother, and the workings of an unrestrained fancy, was led
                    to believe himself to be the Messias; and who, partly by his superior knowledge
                    of the occult qualities of matter, and partly by the sympathetic influence of a
                    highly-wrought enthusiasm, favoured occasionallyby accidental circumstances,
                    performed many works that seemed to exceed the limits of natural causes, which
                    were afterwards exaggerated into real miracles. Another class of the neologian
                    school describe Christ as a pure and exalted character, who was animated with
                    the desire of raising the condition of his degraded countrymen, and of promoting
                    the general interests of humanity; and who, in the lowly situation in which he
                    was placed, found no other means of accomplishing this end but by personating
                    the character of the Jewish Messias. As the Jews expected miracles to be
                    performed by their long-looked-for Saviour, Jesus accommodated himself to their
                    views in this respect. According to this class of writers, he is supposed
                    sometimes to have availed himself of fortunate contingencies, representing the
                    restoration from a faint as a resurrection from the dead, as in the case of the
                    daughter of Jairus, and of Lazarus, and sometimes to have succeeded, perhaps
                    beyond his own expectations, by the aids of animal magnetism.<note

                    to occasion death, though in a worn-out frame it might occasion a temporary
                    swoon, from which he might be restored by the myrrh and aloesand odoriferous
                    substances which his disciples brought to embalm him.<note anchored="true"

                    strengthened by an attempt to prove (which he has endeavoured to do in a
                    separate tract upon the subject) that only the hands of Jesus were nailed to the
                    cross, his feet being merely bound to it by a strong cord. But even supposing
                    this to have been the case, which we consider as by no means established, the
                    evidence of actual dissolution is decisive. AVe have in the first place the
                    testimony of the Evangelists, then the proceedings of the soldiers in general
                    (John, xix. 33), and then the wound inflicted by one of them with a spear,
                    which, from the account given of it, must have entered the heart itself (v.
                    34.)</p></note></p>
                <p>In regard to the theory which is founded on the idea that Jesus was actuated by
                    selfish or worldly or ambitious motives, it may safely be affirmed that it is
                    altogether inconsistent with the facts connected with every part of his history.
                    The whole tenor of his proceedings showed that his views were above this world.
                    He used none of the arts necessary for gaining a party among his countrymen. He
                    did not flatter one sect at the expense of another. He neither courted the
                    favour of his countrymen, by inflaming their prejudices against the Romans, on
                    the one hand; nor did he, on the other hand, artfully conciliate the favour of
                    the Romans to be employed as a means towards attaining the sovereignty of Judea.
                    He openly denounced the vices of the reigning sects; and though his benevolence
                    led him to such a course of conduct as could not but excite the admiration of
                    many among the lower orders, he made no attempt to render his popularity
                    subservient to his personal interests; he shunned the demonstrations of popular
                    favour, and unsparingly exposed the unworthy motives that led many to pay court
                    to him. Not a single instance can be mentioned in which he had recourse to any
                    means for establishing a temporal authority. His whole conduct showed that he
                    was animated with more exalted aims. From the commencement of his ministry he
                    asserted his divine commission, and spoke with undoubting confidence of the
                    success of his cause. But the success of which he spoke was not in schemes of
                    worldly greatness, but in the diffusion of truth and righteousness. He availed
                    himself of every suitable opportunity for correcting the erroneous impressions
                    that were entertained respecting the character of the Messias. And so far was he
                    from entertaining views of personal aggrandisement in the character he assumed,
                    that from the very first he intimated that the good he was to render to mankind
                    was to be procured by laying down his life for them. And the tenor of the
                    evangelical history proves, that in proportion to the increasing clearness with
                    which he communicated to his chosen followers the information as to his divine
                    character, was the expressness of his declaration that his death was at
                    hand.</p>
                <p>There is only a single instance that can be adduced in which there was any
                    appearance on the part of Jesus, of the assumption of temporal authority, viz.
                    in the case of his last entrance into Jerusalem. This has been represented by
                    Reimarus as an unsuccessful attempt made by him, counting upon the support of
                    the populace, to take possession of the temple and of the city. But such a view
                    is inconsistent, not only with the proceedings of Jesus upon former occasions,
                    but also with his conduct in Jerusalem at that very period. There was no concert
                    between the people and Jesus or his apostles. The city of Jerusalem was filled
                    with strangers from all parts, who had come up to attend the passover; the
                    report of the resurrection of Lazarus had been widely circulated; when Jesus
                    approached, curiosity assembled multitudes to behold him, and, in the enthusiasm
                    of the moment, they rendered homage to him as a king. But Jesus did not avail
                    himself of the feeling that was excited. He addressed to the multitude nothing
                    calculated to rouse their passions. The jealousy of the Roman governor,
                    sufficiently awake to the danger of an insurrection,<note anchored="true"

                    approach of the procession to the temple, and Pilate made no allusion to it when
                    Jesus was brought before his tribunal. The same day that Jesus entered into the
                    temple he voluntarily left it for Bethany, though it is obvious, that if he had
                    entertained the views ascribed to him, he would have availed himself of the
                    advantages it presented to him, as the citadel that commanded the whole of
                    Jerusalem.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Michaelis.</p></note> After this he openly returned to the temple on the
                    following days; he made no appeal to the passions of the people, but continued
                    to address to the chief priests such denunciations as could not fail to rouse
                    those vengeful feelings of which he had foretold that he was to be the
                    unresisting victim.</p>
                <p>The attempt to prove that Jesus was merely an ambitious adventurer is now
                    generally abandoned. But many, while they admit the excellence of the personal
                    character of Christ, endeavour to account for the supernatural parts of the
                    gospel history on what is called the principle of accommodation, supposing that
                    Jesus suited his proceedings to the expectations of the Jews respecting the
                    miraculous power of their Messias. But to act upon such a principle is surely
                    inconsistent with the simplicity and integrity of a spotless character. It is
                    admitted by the defenders of the hypothesis referred to, that we have in Jesus
                    Christ a character which stands single and alone in the history of mankind, free
                    from any defect, and combining every species of excellence. We have this same
                    Jesus, without advantage of education or outward condition, introducing a system
                    of religion and morals such as the world had never witnessed; the only system of
                    positive religion that does not bear on its face evidence of its falseness; a
                    system to which the most enlightened men in every age since its first
                    propagation have yielded their homage; and a system of nnorals so pure in its
                    nature, and so comprehensive in its requirements, that while the most
                    extraordinary progress has been made in every other subject, it might easily be
                    proved that all that ethical inquirers have attempted is an analysis of the
                    principles of our nature, on which the rules of the New Testament are founded,
                    or an application of these rules to the circumstances of mankind in new
                    conditions of society. If such a sjstem had been originated by an individual who
                    made no claim to supernatural assistance, we would have been presented with a
                    moral phenomenon altogether inexplicable. But this is not the state in which we
                    find the question. Jesus declares that he received from God all that he reveals
                    to man. Had he offered no proof of this assertion, his moral qualities, even
                    supposing him to have been in error, might have remained unimpeached, and he
                    might have moved our compassionate respect, as the self-deceived enthusiast of
                    virtue or religion. But our Saviour not only demands credence on his own
                    authority; he makes an appeal<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>John xiv. 11.</p></note> to the miracles which he wrought,
                    in proof of his divine mission. Now, the miracles which our Saviour refers to
                    are of such a nature, that either they must have been performed or he must have
                    lent himself to a deceit. There is no other alternative. He could not but know
                    whether they were actually wrought, or whether they <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192945134" xml:id="kp-eb0712-5134-0564"/>were only seeming and
                    illusory. And if the miracles were not truly performed, then we have the
                    individual whose moral character stands in all other respects higher than that
                    of any other of the children of men, and who was made the instrument of
                    conferring the greatest boon that ever was made to mankind,—we have that
                    individual guilty of an artful and criminal imposture.</p>
                <p>In regard to the theory that the apostles filled up the picture of the character
                    of Jesus from what they read in the Ohl Testament Scriptures respecting the
                    Messias, it may be remarked, that the conception of such a character in such
                    circumstances is a phenomenon as inexplicable upon ordinary principles as the
                    actual existence of the prototype. And that four different writers, or that even
                    two different writers, without having a common subject, should have given so
                    many points of resemblance of such an extraordinary natnre, and in so many
                    varied circumstances, is altogether incredible.</p>
                <p>Among those who admit the divine commission of Jesus, different opinions have
                    been entertained as to the rank he holds in the scale of being. The general
                    doctrine of the Christian church, as expressed in ancient creeds and in the
                    confessions of reformed churches, is, that Christ exhibited in his person a
                    union of the divine and human nature; that the second person in the Trinity was
                    united to the man Jesus, who was God and man in one person. To avoid the
                    difficulties which have been supposed to be involved in this mysterious
                    doctrine, it has been maintained by some that the Son is not equal with the
                    Father, and did not exist from eternity, but that the first created being, the
                    highest angelic nature, was made flesh and dwelt on earth. The essence of this
                    theory is, that the Son of God was a <hi rend="italic">creature,</hi> but that
                    he existed in a separate state previously to his manifestation in the form of
                    man. It is variously modified according to the higher or lower character that is
                    given to the Son of God; and is distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arianism,</hi> from the individual who in the early part of the fourth century
                    first brought the question into general discussion. According to a third class,
                    Jesus Christ was a mere man, distinguished from other men only by being employed
                    by God in making a revelation of his will to mankind, and superior in no respect
                    to the prophets who appeared among the Jewish people, except in superior virtue,
                    and in a more enlarged measure of divine countenance and assistance. This view,
                    in its essential features, was embraced by the Ebionites, and also by Artemon
                    and others during the second and third centuries; by Socinus in the sixteenth
                    century, from whose name those who adopt this opinion are frequently named <hi
                    rend="italic">Socinians,</hi> though they assume to themselves the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Unitarians</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a title which is sometimes
                    conceded by Trinitarians for the sake of distinction, though they equally hold
                    the doctrine of the unity of the Deity. In America the name Unitarian is applied
                    to all those who reject the doctrine of the Trinity. The differences of opinion
                    respecting the person of Christ are connected with different views as to the
                    object and nature of his commission. Trinitarians consider him as not only
                    teaching a purer system of morality than the world had before known, but also as
                    making an atonement for human guilt by his death; while Socinians and many
                    Arians deny the doctrine of the atonement, and look upon Jesus merely as a
                    teacher of religion and virtue.</p>
                <p>The character of Christ, as exhibited in the Gospels, presents to us the only
                    example, anywhere to be found of the perfection of humanity; and the
                    contemplation of it has ever been considered by his followers as one of the most
                    edifying and delightful exercises of piety.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A catalogue of some of the most important treatises upon
                    this subject in English is given by Bishop Newcombe, in the preface to bis work
                    on our Lord’s conduct and character.</p></note> A constant regard to the will of
                    God, and a delight in doing it, form the distinguishing features of his
                    character. With this was connected the absence of all sordid, or selfish, or
                    ambitious aims, and an enlarged and enlightened philanthropy. There is perhaps
                    nothing more remarkable in the life of Jesus than the apparently inconsistent
                    qualities which are blended together in one harmonious whole. We see in him the
                    most unbending constancy united with great tenderness of feeling—hatred of sin,
                    and compassion for the offender—a heart superior to all the allurements of
                    pleasure, with a condescending indulgence for the innocent relaxations of life—a
                    mind of universal philanthropy, alive to all the domestic charities·—views that
                    extended to the whole human race, and a generous compliance with national and
                    individual peculiarities. It is difficult to conceive that the portraiture
                    presented to us in the sacred history can be contemplated without benefit; but
                    the chief benefit will be lost if it is forgotten that he whose life was the
                    model of every virtue laid down that life for the sins of the world.</p>
                <p>Those who hold the highest ideas of the divinity of Christ, admit to the fullest
                    extent that he was also man; and the curiosity is not unnatural as to the
                    personal appearance assumed by the Son of God. Upon this subject no direct
                    information is given in the New Testament. From incidental notices, it has been
                    conjectured that he was of a robust frame, and that there was nothing
                    particularly marked in his appearance;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>John, XX. 15, and xxi.∙</p></note> but it may be doubted how
                    far the passages referred to bear out these conclusions. There is better
                    evidence that the mixture of divine benignity and commanding authority which he
                    everywhere displayed in his character, were conspicuous also in his voice and
                    aspect.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Jhn, xviii. 6;

                <p>The most judicious of the fathers agree that nothing was known of the personal
                    appearance of Christ, though inquiry upon the subject was not prohibited. During
                    the first ages of Christianity, the church, under persecution, required a model
                    of patient endurance; and the general opinion of the fathers<note

                    of Christ corresponded literally with the description in Isaiah, liii. 2, 3.
                    There was at the same time a prohibition, founded on the second commandment,
                    against attempting to frame any pictorial likeness of the Son of God. We read,
                    however, of pictures of Christ in the hands of one of the Gnostic sects.<note

                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>L. vii. c. 18.</p></note> At a somewhat later
                    period, when paintings began to be admitted into churches, the attempt to
                    present a likeness of Christ was no longer considered as unlawful; and full
                    scope being given to the imagination of the artist, attempts were made to embody
                    the purity, and elevation, and loveliness of the Saviour’s character, in
                    lineaments of extraordinary beauty. Certain theologians justified the attempt by
                    explaining the description in Psalm xlv. as literally applicable to Jesus. There
                    is a minute description of the personal appearance of Christ by the Greek
                    ecclesiastical historian Nicephorus, who flourished about the year 1330; and
                    another in a letter purporting to be addressed by Publius Lentulus, governor of
                    Judea, to the Roman senate. Both of these, <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945147"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-5147-0565"/>however, are altogether without value. As the <hi

                    time to time brought before the public in various forms, without any hint as to
                    its real origin, it may be proper to state, that there is most decisive evidence
                    of its being a mere fabrication. No trace of it is to be found before the
                    fourteenth century. No such person as Publius Lentulus was ever governor of
                    Judea. From the style, it is probable that it was written by some monk in the
                    middle ages.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There are
                    several manuscripts of this epistle, none of them, however, older than the
                    fourteenth century. One of these was brought forward about twenty years ago as
                    newly discovered in the library of the Vatican, and treated as a matter of much
                    importance. The subject was taken up in a work entitled “In <hi rend="italic"

                    fully discussed. An exposure of the fabrication is also to be found in the <hi

                <p>In regard to pictures which tradition has represented as having been made while
                    our Saviour was on earth, in addition to that already mentioned as having been
                    sent to the king of Edessa, there was another supposed to have been imprinted
                    upon a handkerchief belonging to Veronica. The legend is, that when Christ was
                    led to crucifixion, Veronica, who followed him, put a handkerchief to his face,
                    on which Christ impressed his likeness. This holy relic is still exhibited at
                    Rome on certain festivals.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    erected his own statue in its place. From the representations on some ancient
                    coins, it has been conjectured that the pillar referred to was originally
                    erected in honour of Hadrian.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of Christ by St Luke, and that there was an image of him cut out by Nicoemus in
                    cedar wood; but these traditions are without support from antiquity, and
                    inconsistent with many passages in the writings of the fathers. A general
                    resemblance is to be observed in all the pictures of the Saviour; but though
                    this has probably arisen from admiration of one traditional model, there is no
                    evidence whatever of its genuineness. After all our inquiries, while we are
                    warranted in supposing that the benignant majesty which distinguished his
                    character beamed forth in his countenance, yet, in regard to any thing more
                    definite, we must rest in the conclusion of St Austin, “qua fuerit ille facie
                    penitus ignoramus.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
