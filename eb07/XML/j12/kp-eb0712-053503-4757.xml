                <p><label type="entry">JEFFERSON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label>, one of
                    the founders of American independence, and president of the United States, was
                    born at Shadwell, in Albemarle county, Virginia, on the 2d of April 1743. His
                    ancestors had at an early period emigrated to that province, and his father had
                    been one of the commissioners for determining the boundary between Virginia and
                    North Carolina. Having completed his education at William-and-Mary College,
                    Williamsburg, he became a student of law under George Wythe, afterwards
                    chancellor of the state of Virginia; and upon coming of age, he was admitted to
                    the bar, appointed a justice of peace for the county in which he lived, and soon
                    afterwards returned as one of its representatives in the provincial
                    legislature.</p>
                <p>But the position of public affairs early led him to contemplate questions far
                    more comprehensive and important than any of those connected with the
                    administration of his native state. As early as the year 1763 a spirit of
                    opposition to the British government had manifested itself in the province, and
                    continued gradually to increase, until, in 1769, it assumed the shape of a
                    substantive determination not to import articles from the mother country. This
                    resolution Mr Jefferson not only signed, but used all his influence to promote.
                    In the beginning of 1773, a general system of resistance was first organized, by
                    the formation of committees of correspondence in the different provinces. This
                    plan, devised and matured by Jefferson, was eagerly adopted; and, when the
                    measures of the British governm ’ ent in 1774 showed the increased necessity of
                    opposing to them a united and resolute resistance, its benefits became
                    strikingly apparent. The passing of the Boston port act, and the bills which
                    immediately followed that measure, had, in the opinion of the colonists, filled
                    up the measure of oppression and insult. The breach with the mother country
                    daily became wider; and, as a crisis was evidently approaching, Jefferson’s plan
                    served not only to concentrate the general spirit of resistance, but also to
                    give it a suitable direction. About this time he published a Summary View of the
                    Rights of British Arne-rica, <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944770"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4770-0536"/>which he intended as an exposition, to be laid
                    before the sovereign, of the wrongs that country had suffered, and the sort of
                    redress she was prepared to demand. For this publication, Lord Dunmore, the
                    governor, threatened to prosecute him, on a charge of high treason, and also
                    dissolved the legislature, which by its resolutions had sanctioned similar
                    doctrines. In the following year, when the legislature was again assembled to
                    consider the conciliatory propositions which had been sent out by the British
                    ministry, Jefferson was appointed a member of the committee to whom these were
                    referred, and he drew up the reply which was presented by that body; a document
                    of great importance with reference to the history of the period to which it
                    refers. But he had scarcely completed this task when he was called to perform a
                    part on a wider field of action. The colonies having resolved to unite together,
                    and send delegates to a general congress, Mr Jefferson took his seat as a member
                    of that body, then assembled at Philadelphia, on the 21st of June 1775, and
                    immediately became one of its most prominent members. In the following summer,
                    when, from the tone of the debates in congress, and the general expression of
                    public opinion, it appeared that the time had arrived for an entire and final
                    separation from Great Britain, a committee was appointed to draw up a
                    declaration to that effect. Of this committee Mr Jefferson was chairman, and, in
                    conformity to the instructions of congress, he prepared the declaration of
                    independence, which, after a few alterations, was adopted on the 4th of July
                    1776. This is by far the most memorable event in his life.</p>
                <p>During the summer of this year, Mr Jefferson took an active part in the public
                    business; but being obliged in the autumn to return to Virginia, he was, in his
                    absence, appointed, in conjunction with Dr Franklin and Mr Deane, a commissioner
                    to the court of France, for the purpose of arranging with the government of that
                    country, treaties of alliance and commerce. Owing to ill health, and other
                    causes, however, he declined the appointment, and shortly afterwards resigned
                    his seat in congress; but being elected to the first legislature assembled under
                    the new constitution of Virginia, he applied himself to introduce various
                    changes and amendments into the laws and institutions of that state,
                    particularly enactments for preventing the importation of slaves, destroying
                    entails, abolishing the right of primogeniture, overthrowing the church
                    establishment, and remodelling the whole of the statutory law. In June 1779 he
                    was elected governor of Virginia, and reelected the following year. This was a
                    season of imminent peril. The state, invaded on the north and the south, was
                    ravaged by the troops of Tarleton and Arnold, and he himself was the object of
                    especial pursuit. But amidst all the difficulties with which he was surrounded,
                    Jefferson conducted the affairs of the state with so much prudence and energy,
                    that, after the expiration of his term of service, the legislature passed an
                    unanimous resolution, expressive at once of their gratitude, and of the high
                    sense they entertained of his prudence, ability, and integrity. In June 1783, Mr
                    Jefferson was again sent to congress as the delegate of Virginia, and, as a
                    leading member of that body, was intrusted with the preparation of the address
                    made by congress to General Washington, when he resigned his commission, and
                    withdrew from public life. In May 1784, congress having decided that, in
                    addition to Mr Adams and Dr Franklin, another minister plenipotentiary should be
                    appointed, for the purpose of negociating treaties of commerce with the French
                    government, Mr Jefferson was immediately elected to this office, and in the
                    month of July sailed for France, where he arrived on the 6th of August. He
                    remained in Europe until the 23d of November 1789, and, during his stay, visited
                    Holland, the north of Italy, and the principal sea ports on the southern and
                    western coasts of France. Healso crossed over to England, and, in concert with
                    Mr Adams, endeavoured to negociate a commercial treaty with the British
                    government; but their efforts were unavailing, and, after a fruitless visit of
                    seven weeks, he returned to Paris. W <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> hilst Mr
                    Jefferson resided in France, he was not only engaged in various diplomatic
                    negociations of importance to his own country, but was received with marked
                    kindness by men of letters, science, and political distinction. He was likewise
                    an eye-witness of the extraordinary occurrences in public affairs which took
                    place in rapid succession towards the close of his sojourn in the French
                    capital; he had become acquainted with many of the leading men of the national
                    assembly, who were disposed to seek his advice, and place confidence in his
                    opinions; and, as the representative of a free nation, he was an object of
                    interest and attention to the principal actors in the new scenes which had
                    opened upon France.</p>
                <p>But his stay was not protracted till that fatal period which was darkened by the
                    sanguinary excesses of popular frenzy; and the interest which he took in the
                    French revolution was consequently warmed by the hope that a great people were
                    about to shake off their fetters, and, by a peaceful but decisive effort, to
                    establish rational liberty upon the solid foundation of improved institutions.
                    In November 1789 he returned on leave of absence to the United States, and there
                    accepted the office of secretary of state offered him by General Washington,
                    instead of resuming his post as minister at the court of France. Whilst in the
                    department of the state, Mr Jefferson laid down those general maxims relative to
                    foreign intercourse, which have ever since been regarded with approbation by the
                    American people, and developed those principles which, in his estimation, ought
                    to govern the conduct of a neutral nation. He understood the true interests of
                    his country: he felt that she required time to consolidate her new institutions,
                    and to strengthen the foundations of the freedom she had conquered; and he
                    laboured assiduously to impress his convictions on the-minds of his countrymen.
                    In December 1793, Mr Jefferson resigned his office, and having retired to
                    private life, devoted himself to the education of his family, the cultivation of
                    his estate, and the pursuit of those studies which he had long abandoned, but
                    now resumed with fresh ardour. But he was not long permitted to enjoy the
                    tranquillity of retirement. In September 1796, General Washington having made
                    known to the people his wish not again to be a candidate for the presidency; and
                    the two parties which had gradually grown up in the republic finding it
                    impossible to unite, as in the case of Washington, in the choice of one
                    individual to whom the administration of public affairs might by common consent
                    be committed; Mr Adams was selected by the federalists, and Mr Jefferson by the
                    democratic party, as their respective candidates; and, upon counting the votes,
                    the former, in whose favour there appeared the higher number, was declared
                    president, and the latter vice-president. At the next election, however, when
                    again put forward as the popular candidate, he proved successful in his
                    opposition to Mr Adams; and, although an accidental equality of votes between
                    him and the person simultaneously chosen as vice-president raised a question
                    which had not been provided for by the constitution, and thus gave his opponents
                    an opportunity of contesting the validity of his election, yet, after a severe
                    struggle, he was declared duly elected, and, on the 4th of March 1801, entered
                    upon his first presidential term. The administration of Mr Jerlerson embraced a
                    long and interesting period in the history of the United States, and was
                    distinguished by important measures, which contributed, in no inconsiderable
                    degree, to promote the prosperity and increase the happiness of the free nation
                    at the head of which he was <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944783"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4783-0537"/>placed. Under it various aggressions were promptly
                    chastised; the attempt made by the agents of the Spanish government to obstruct
                    the free navigation of the Mississippi was repelled; and the vast territory of
                    Louisiana, affording an independent outlet for the western states, was
                    purchased, and placed under the republican institutions of America. During the
                    same period, the internal policy of the United States underwent important
                    changes. Measures were adopted for liquidating the public debt; the judicial
                    system was improved; a rigid economy controlled and regulated the public
                    expenditure; all useless offices were abolished; and the president himself set
                    the example of voluntarily relinquishing unnecessary power and patronage. The
                    public approbation formed the best reward of these sacrifices; and hence, when
                    Mr Jefferson’s term of service had expired, he was again elected by a majority
                    which had increased from eight votes to one hundred and forty-eight. In his
                    inaugural address, delivered on the 4th of March 1805, he declared his firm
                    determination to continue to act upon those principles on which he believed it
                    to be his duty to administer the affairs of the commonwealth, and which had
                    already been sanctioned by the unequivocal approbation of the country. But he
                    had scarcely entered upon office when an event occurred which seemed calculated
                    to disturb the domestic tranquillity of the United States, if not to endanger
                    the stability of the union itself. This was the conspiracy of Colonel Burr, a
                    man of an ardent and ambitious character, who, disappointed formerly in
                    attaining the first office of the government when it seemed within his grasp,
                    and afterwards superseded in the second by the election of Mr Clinton, now
                    sought, by desperate means, either to establish a new republic in the Spanish
                    provinces of the west, or to break up the federal union in his own country. But
                    his scheme was discovered, and although, when apprehended and brought to trial
                    on a charge of treason, he obtained a verdict of acquittal, yet enough came out
                    in evidence to show the government the extent of its danger, and to indicate the
                    measures necessary to prevent its recurrence. At this period, too, the foreign
                    relations of the United States became greatly embarrassed, in consequence of the
                    war which raged in Europe. Nearly' the whole of their revenue depended on
                    commerce; and on this serious aggressions had been made by both the belligerent
                    powers, France and Britain; whilst the right of search claimed by the latter was
                    resented, as at once contrary to the public law of nations, insulting to the
                    American flag, and inconsistent with free navigation. In this view, the natural
                    and obvious remedy was a declaration of war. But, as it was conceived that the
                    interests and situation of America required the previous trial and failure of
                    all other means of obtaining justice, an embargo was resorted to, and a measure
                    for establishing one passed congress on the 22d of December 1807, in consequence
                    of the recommendation of the president. After this embargo had existed a year,
                    however, overtures were made by the British government, indicating a disposition
                    to abate somewhat of its pretensions; and as these had been preceded by the
                    recall of some of those orders in council to which the Americans most strongly
                    objected, an accommodation was effected without difficulty, because in fact the
                    non-intercourse system had proved more prejudicial to the commercial interests
                    of the Lnited States than to those of Great Britain.</p>
                <p>Affairs were in this situation when, on the 3d of March 1809, Mr Jefferson’s
                    second term of office expired, and with it also terminated his political career.
                    He had now attained the sixty-fifth year of his age, and had for forty years
                    been almost without interruption engaged in the most arduous public duties. He
                    had passed with honour and credit through the various stations to which the
                    service of his country had called him, and he now resolved to quit the scene
                    where he had so long acted a prominent part, whilst yet unoppressed by the
                    infirmities of age, and to pass the evening of a busy life in the calmness of
                    domestic retirement. From this time until his death, which took place on the 4th
                    of July 1826, he resided chiefly at his favourite retreat, Monticello; sometimes
                    occupying his time with publications of his private correspondence, and at
                    others connecting himself with rising institutions formed to promote the
                    advancement of science, literature, or taste. He was sought out in his
                    retirement by strangers of all nations who visited America, and also by the
                    natives of every part of his own country, who regarded him as “their guide,
                    philosopher, and friend.” His residence was the abode of dignified ease and
                    unostentatious hospitality; in the calm enjoyments of Monticello, he forgot both
                    the toils and the dangers of his long political career; he took the deepest
                    interest in everything which seemed calculated to advance the improvement or
                    increase the happiness of mankind; at once practical and benevolent, he was
                    constantly studying the welfare of his fellow-creatures, and endeavouring to
                    promote every plan which tended to produce or increase it. Amongst his labours
                    of this kind, the most prominent consisted in the exertions he made for the
                    improvement of education in Virginia, by the establishment of an university at
                    Charlottesville, a town at the foot of the mountain where he resided. This
                    institution, commenced by his own private donations, and those which he
                    succeeded in obtaining from his friends, received the sanction of the
                    legislature; Air Jefferson’s plans, having for their object to combine elegant
                    learning with strictly useful knowledge, were approved of; he himself was
                    appointed rector of the new university; and from this time forward he devoted
                    himself to consolidate the establishment which he had founded. Indeed all his
                    thoughts and means were employed to insure its success.</p>
                <p>“Thus,” says an American biographer, “glided on the evening of Mr Jefferson’s
                    patriotic and benevolent life; as age wore gradually away the energies of his
                    body, his mind shone with intelligence undiminished; and his efforts and desires
                    for the progress of human happiness and knowledge knew no change. Years,
                    however, had crowded upon him; and when the increase of infirmities at length
                    prevented him leaving his chamber, he remarked to the physician who sought to
                    assist him by the aid of his art, that ‘ the machine had worn out, and could go
                    on no longer.’ During the spring of 1826, he had suffered from increasing
                    debility; but it was not until the 26th of June that he was obliged to confine
                    himself to his bed. The strength of his constitution, and freedom from bodily
                    pain, for a short time encouraged the hope that this confinement would be only
                    temporary; but his own conversation showed that he did not himself so regard it.
                    <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Do not imagine,’ he said to those around him, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> that I feel the smallest solicitude as to the result.
                    I do not indeed wish to die, but I do not fear to die.’ His temper retained all
                    its usual cheerfulness and equanimity; his only anxiety seemed to be for the
                    prosperity of the university, and he expressed strongly his hopes that the state
                    would not abandon it: he declared that if he could see that child of his old age
                    fairly flourishing, he was ready to depart, to say <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi> nunc dimittis domine,’ a favourite quotation with him. On the 2d of July
                    he appeared free from disease, but his weakness was such that his physicians
                    expressed a doubt whether his strength would prove sufficient to restore him.
                    Conscious himself that he could not recover, and without any bodily or
                    apparently mental pain, he calmly gave directions relative to his interment,
                    which he requested might be at Monticello, without parade or pomp; he then
                    called his family around him, and conversed separately with each of them; to his
                    beloved daughter, Mrs Randolph, he presented a small morocco case, which he re
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944796" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4796-0538"/>quested her
                    not to open till after his death. When the sad limitation had expired, it was
                    found to contain an affectionate poetical tribute to the virtues of her from
                    whom he was thus torn away. He desired, if any inscription were placed on his
                    tomb, he should be described only as ‘ the author of the declaration of
                    independence, of the statutes of .Virginia for religious freedom, and the father
                    of the university.’ On Monday, the following day, he inquired of those around
                    him with much solicitude what was the day of the month; they told him it was the
                    3d of July. He then eagerly expressed his desire that he might be permitted to
                    live to another day, to breathe the air of the fiftieth anniversary of the
                    declaration of independence. His wish was granted: the morning of the 4th of
                    July 1826 found him still living; and after declaring himself gratified by the
                    affectionate solicitude of his family and servants, and having distinctly
                    articulated these words, ‘ I resign myself to my God, and my child to my
                    country,’ he gradually expired without a murmur or a groan.”</p>
                <p>At the time of his death Mr Jefferson had just entered the eighty-fourth year of
                    his age. In person he was above six feet in height, and, though thin, erect and
                    well formed. His complexion was fair, his forehead broad, and his face of a
                    square form, with a thoughtful expression. His address was cordial, and his
                    manner simple, cheerful, and unassuming, yet mingled with a certain degree of
                    native dignity; in his disposition he was full of liberality and benevolence; in
                    his temper he displayed the greatest equanimity, never being known to give way
                    to passion, nor, even during the excitement of political contentions, to indulge
                    in angry or vindictive feelings. His attachment to his personal friends was warm
                    and stedfast; to them he communicated without reserve all that he thought or
                    felt; in regard to them he exercised no diplomatic caution,nor entertained any
                    ungenerous distrust; and he had his reward in that unflinching support which he
                    received from them on every emergency. His application was constant and severe;
                    and his habits were so exact, that in a cabinet abounding with papers, all were
                    arranged in such a manner that any one might be instantly found. Considered
                    intellectually, however, Mr Jefferson does not appear to ns to occupy the
                    distinguished rank which has been generally assigned to him by his countrymen,
                    particularly by his eloquent eulogist Mr Webster. On the contrary, he seems to
                    have been one of those men of plain, practical good sense, calm temperament,
                    methodical habits, and persevering application, who make the most of their
                    faculties, and are, upon the whole, much better fitted to excel in the conduct
                    of business than to obtain distinction in pursuits of a higher order, or to
                    stamp the impression of their genius upon the science, the literature, the
                    philosophy, or the legislation of their time. Jefferson was perhaps at the head
                    of the class to which he belonged, but that class was not a high one; and, in
                    truth, he had always been more remarkable for the share which he took in the
                    early formation of the American republic, than for any very predominant
                    superiority of understanding. <hi rend="italic">(American National Portrait
