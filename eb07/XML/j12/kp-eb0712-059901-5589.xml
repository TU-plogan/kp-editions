                    who was possessed of extensive estates, had a numerous family, six sons and
                    seven daughters having reached the age of maturity. Arthur was born at Caskieben
                    in the county of Aberdeen in the year 1587, but the day of his birth is not
                    mentioned. The first elements of classical learning he acquired at the
                    neighbouring town of Kintore, and he afterwards became a student in Marischal
                    College, Aberdeen. Caskieben, Kintore, Inverury, and Aberdeen are all
                    commemorated in his poems. Whether he resided in the university long enough to
                    take a degree in arts, we are not informed; but it is probable that he proceeded
                    to the continent at a very early age, for he took the degree of Μ. D. at Padua
                    on the 11th of June 1610. This university was long celebrated as a school of
                    physic as well as law; and Benson supposes that it may have afforded him a
                    favourable opportunity for the cultivation of his talents for Latin poetry.</p>
                <p>In an elegy addressed to Wedderburn, he has supplied us with some information
                    respecting his personal history.</p>
                <p>Quas ego non terras, quae non vagus aequora pressi, Haec licet ingenio sint minus

                    senem.</p>
                <p>From these verses we learn that he had twice crossed the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192945602" xml:id="kp-eb0712-5602-0600"/>Alps, and had twice visited
                    Rome; that he had travelled in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, and England;
                    that he had resided twenty years in France, and had there become a husband and a
                    father; and that two wives, who were of different nations, had born him thirteen
                    children. The fifth Olympiad restored him to his native country. The term <hi
                    rend="italic">Olympias</hi> more properly denotes a period of four years, but
                    here, as in other instances, it is evidently employed to denote a period of
                    five: for it appears that he had spent twenty years in France, and he mentions
                    his peregrinations in other countries. He must therefore have returned to
                    Scotland before the completion of the twentyfifth year. Sir Thomas Urquhart has
                    stated that “before he was full three and twenty yeers of age, he was laureated
                    poet at Paris, and that most deservedly.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Sedan,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>M‘Crie’s Life of
                    Melville, vol. ii. p. 443.</p></note> where his very learned countryman Andrew
                    Melville became a professor of divinity in the year 1611. With him and the other
                    divinity professor, Daniel Tilenus, he appears to have lived on intimate terms;
                    and the names of both are familiar to the readers of his poems. As he resided so
                    long in France, it has been supposed that he there followed the profession of a
                    physician. The names of his two wives are not mentioned; but one of them is
                    described as a woman of honourable birth. The one he married in France, and the
                    other belonged to the vicinity of Mechlin, a city in Brabant. In an elegy
                    addressed “Ad Senatum Mechlinien-sem, adversus Hamptaeum militem Bulloniensem,”
                    he speaks of her in the subsequent terms:</p>
                <p>Quid memorem lachrymas quas nunc, absente marito, Fundit in ignota flebilis uxor
                    humo?</p>
                <p>Per patriam rogat illa suam, patriosque penates, Quos dirimit vestra quartus ab
                    urbe lapis.</p>
                <p>He appears to have left her in Britain, and to have repaired to Mechlin for the
                    purpose of prosecuting against this rude soldier some claim which probably
                    accrued to him by marriage. After many delays and much anxiety, he obtained a
                    decision in his favour; and his feelings during the progress of this litigation
                    are elegantly recorded in various poems.</p>
                <p>Before his return to Britain, he had acquired considerable reputation by the
                    exercise of his poetical talents. Dr Eglisham, another Scotish physician, had
                    endeavoured to detract from the reputation of Buchanan, by publishing an
                    acrimonious criticism upon his version of the hundred and fourth psalm; but in
                    one respect he was a very fair critic, for he at the same time exhibited in
                    contrast a version of his own.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Cavillum in Aram Regiam, aliisque Epigrammatis. Lond. 1618, 4to—Among other
                    works, Eglisham published “Prodromus Vindictae in Ducem Buckinghamiae, pro
                    virulenta Caede potentissimi Magnae Britanniae Regis Jacobi; nec-non Marchionis
                    Hamiltonii, ac aliorum virorum principuιn. ’ Francofurti, 1626, 4to. Sir Henry
                    Wotton has stated that this work was “published and printed in divers
                    languages,” about the time of the king’s death. (Reliquiae Wottonianae, p. 554.)
                    There is an English edition of a more recent date. “The Fore-runner of Revenge:
                    being two Petitions,” &amp;c. Lond. 1642, 4to.</p></note> Instead of attempting
                    a serious refutation of his animadversions, Johnston wrote a very bitter, though
                    a very elegant satire, in which he treated his case as one of decided insanity.
                    This poem was speedily published under the title of “Consilium Collegii Medici
                    Parisiensis de Mania G. Eglishemii, quam prodidit scripto, cui titulus Duellum
                    Poeticum,” &amp;c. Edinburgi, excudebat Andreas Hart, 1619, 8vo. A Paris edition
                    of the same date is likewise mentioned. This publication is anonymous; and when
                    he inserted the poem in the collection of his <hi rend="italic">Parerga,</hi> he
                    suppressed the name of Eglisham, and substituted that of Hypermorus Medicaster.
                    Not satisfied with inflicting so signal a castigation, he assailed the
                    unfortunate rival of Buchanan in another poem, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Onopordus</hi><hi rend="italic">Furens.</hi> Paris. 1620, 8vo. During the same
                    year, Dr Barclay, another learned physician, refuted the captious criticisms of
                    Eglisham, and exposed the puerility of the version to which the author’s vanity
                    had assigned so conspicuous a place.</p>
                <p>Dr Johnston’s next publication bears the title of “Elegia in Obitum Jacobi
                    Pacifici, Magnae Britanniae, Francise, et Hiberniae Regis, Fideique Defensoris.”
                    Lond. 1625, 4tθ. Lauder has stated that he returned to his native country in
                    1632, and continued for some years to reside at Aberdeen; but Dempster,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dempsteri Historia
                    Ecclesiastica Gentis Scotorum, p. 393.</p></note> who died in 1625, mentions,
                    though with some degree of hesitation, that he had already returned at the
                    period when he himself wrote. Benson conjectures that he was appointed physician
                    to the king in the year 1633, but this conjecture is refuted by the title-page
                    of one of his publications. “Elegiae duae; una ad Episcopum Abre-donensem, de
                    Fratris Obitu; altera de Pace rupta inter Scotos et Gallos; autore Arturo
                    Jonstono, MedicoRegio.” Aberdoniae, 1628, 4to. After an interval of a few years,
                    he published “Parerga Arturi Jonstoni Scoti, Medici Regii.” Aberd. 1632, 8vo.
                    And at the same time appeared “Epigrammata Arturi Jonstoni Scoti, Medici Regii.”
                    Aberd. 1632, 8vo. The first of these collections he dedicated in verse to Sir
                    John Scot, and the second to the Earl of Lauderdale. He soon afterwards
                    published “Cantici Salomonis Paraphrasis poetica.” Lond. 1633, 8vo. This
                    paraphrase, which he dedicated to the king, is accompanied with a specimen of
                    his version of the psalms. The specimen includes the seven penitential, and the
                    seven consolatory psalms; the former being dedicated to Laud bishop of London,
                    and the latter to Lesley bishop of Raphoe. Dempster mentions his having
                    translated the psalms into very elegant elegiac verse; and it is therefore to be
                    presumed that Johnston long delayed the publication in order to give his version
                    all the advantage of a deliberate revisal. He next produced a collection of
                    short poems, entitled “Musae Aulicae.” Lond. 1635, 8vo. They are accompanied
                    with an English translation by Sir Francis Kinaston. This little work was
                    followed by his complete version of the psalms. “Paraphrasis poetica Psalmorum
                    Davidis, auctore Arturo Jonstono Scoto. Accesserunt ejusdem Cantica Evangelica,
                    Symbolum Apostolicum, Oratio Dominica, Decalogus.” Aberd. 1637, 8vo. It is
                    dedicated in elegant and panegyrical verse to the Countess Marischal. Benson
                    supposes the work to have been printed in London during the same year; but as it
                    was printed there in 1657, the one edition may have been confounded with the
                    other. About the same time he lent his aid to the publication of the “Delitiae
                    Poetarum Scotorum hujus aevi illustrium.” Amst. 1637, 2 tom. 12mo. These volumes
                    were neatly printed by Bleau, at the expense of Sir John Scot, who himself
                    appears in the list of contributors, and who doubtless retained the power of
                    admitting or rejecting. Johnston has frequently been considered as the editor,
                    from the circumstance of his having written the dedication to Scot, and prefixed
                    the “Musarum Elogia,” addressed to the same individual. His contributions are
                    more extensive than those of any other writer. The entire collection forms a
                    conspicuous monument of the scholarship, ingenuity, and taste of our countrymen;
                    and the poems of Johnston may safely be brought into competition with those of
                    any other writer whose name is to be found in the catalogue of contributors.</p>

                <p>On the 24th of June 1637, Johnston was elected rector of King’s College,
                    Aberdeen. The appointment is annual, and is considered as honourable. Dr

                    have been misled by his imperfect recollection of this academical office; nor is
                    this the only mistake into which he has fallen with respect to the same
                    university. Thus, for example, he makes the extraordinary statement that
                    “whoever is a master may, if he pleases, immediately become a doctor.” In this
                    city Johnston appears to have had many learned and distinguished friends, of
                    whom we find various memorials in his works. Among these was the worthy bishop
                    of the diocese, Patrick Forbes, who, like himself, was descended from the noble
                    family of that name; the bishop’s son, John Forbes, professor of divinity in
                    King’s College; William Forbes, principal of Marischal College, and afterwards
                    bishop of Edinburgh; Robert Baron, professor of divinity in the same college,
                    and afterwards bishop elect of Orkney; and David Wedderburn, professor of
                    humanity in King’s, and rector of the grammar school of Aberdeen.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Wedoerburn was likewise a
                    contributor to the <hi rend="superscript"> iς</hi> Delitiae Poetarum Scotorum.”
                    He published the following grammatical works. “A Short Introduction to Grammar.”
                    Aberd. 1632, 8vo. “Institutiones Grammaticae.” Aberd. 1634, 8vo. “Vocabula, cum
                    ahis Latinae Linguae Subsidiis:” commonly subjoined to Simson’s Rudimenta
                    Grammatices. See Ruddiman’s Bibliotheca Romana, p∙ 62. Vossius addresses
                    Wedderburn as “homo eruditissimus, beneque promerens de studiis juventutis.”
                    (Epistolae, p. 304. .Lond. 1690, fol.) His merit as a grammarian is highly
                    extolled in David Leitch’s “Philosophia illachrymans, hoc est, Querela
                    Philosophiae, et Philosophorum Scotorum (praesertim vero Borealium) oratorie
                    expressa.” Aberdoniae, 1637, 4to. His posthumous edition of Persius was
                    published by his brother Alexander. “Persius enucleatus: sive Commentarius
                    exactissimus et maxime perspicuus m Persium, poetarum omnium difficillimum,
                    studio Davidis Wedderburni, Scoti, Abredonensis. Opus posthumum.” Amst. 1664,
                    12mo.</p></note> This was indeed a brilliant era in the history of the
                    university. Dr Baron, a great adept in scholastic philosophy and theology, seems
                    to have enjoyed a large share of his esteem, and is highly extolled in his
                    verses. Wedderburn was the companion of his early youth, and, cultivating the
                    same elegant studies, continued to be the friend of his maturest years. Johnston
                    addressed to him a long elegy, in which he recounted some of the events of his
                    life, and Wedderburn replied in another elegy, expressive of the same unaltered

                    have chiefly resided in England after the date of his appointment as physician
                    to the king; for it is evident from some of his verses that this appointment was
                    not merely honorary, but required his attendance at court. In his native county
                    he appears to have acquired some real property: under the great seal, 12 June
                    1629, there is a charter of confirmation, in his favour, of the lands of New
                    Leslie in the parish of Alford. Soon after his return from the continent, he was
                    engaged in a lawsuit before the court of session; and of advocates and attomies
                    his experience seems to have led him to form no very favourable opinion. But his
                    career, which was sufficiently brilliant, was not destined to be long: at the
                    age of fifty-four, he died at Oxford in the year 1641, while on a visit to one
                    of his daughters, who was married to a clergyman of the established church. His
                    death was affectionately bewailed by his learned friend Wedderburn, whose <hi

                <p>Johnston possessed a masterly command of Latin diction; and to this attainment he
                    added great skill in the art of versification. He was likewise distinguished by
                    no mean portion of poetical feeling and fancy, united with an elegant and
                    classical taste. Although it cannot be affirmed that he never employs a word or
                    phrase which does not belong to the best age of Latinity, his diction generally
                    displays a great degree of purity;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>“Arturus Jonstonus,” says Morhof, “in psalmorum versione,
                    quemadmodum et in operibus ceteris, ubique purus et tersus est, ut ego quidem
                    nihil in illo desiderare possim.” (Polyhistor, toni. i. p. 1066.) Some
                    objectionable words and phrases, used by Johnston, are enumerated in Ruddiman’s
                    Vindication of Buchanan, p. 70∙</p></note> and his ear had attained to exquisite
                    nicety in the harmony of Roman numbers, particularly those of hexameter and
                    pentameter verse. Such was his predilection for this combined metre, that he
                    introduced it into almost all his compositions; and even his satires are written
                    in the elegiac measure. His poems are very numerous, and are sufficiently
                    miscellaneous. Some of them are obscure, not from the nature of the composition,
                    but from their abounding in allusions to persons and circumstances not easily
                    traced or recognized. Many of his epigrams are well turned; and his satirical
                    powers are conspicuously displayed in his poems against Eglisham, and in several
                    others. His version of the psalms has often received, and is evidently entitled
                    to very high commendation. After the brilliant success of Buchanan, such an
                    attempt might justly be considered as not a little hazardous; but it cannot be
                    asserted that Johnston had made a delusive estimate of his own powers, for if he
                    does not surpass or equal so great a master, he at least makes a near approach
                    to his poetic excellence. In this version, he has adhered almost uniformly to
                    his favourite elegiac verse: it is only in the hundred and nineteenth psalm that
                    his metre is varied, and there every part is exhibited in a new species of
                    verse. Buchanan’s plan of varying the measure according to the characteristics
                    of the poem, was evidently more eligible in a writer who possessed such
                    versatility of talent. The Latin paraphrases of the psalms amount to a very
                    large number; nor do we incur much hazard in averring that the two Scotish poets
                    have excelled all their competitors.</p>
                <p>Dr Beattie, who has passed a general condemnation on poetical paraphrases of the
                    psalms, is by no means disposed to exempt those of Buchanan and Johnston from
                    this sentence. “If we look into Buchanan, what can we say, but that the learned
                    author, with great command of Latin expression, has no true relish for the
                    emphatick conciseness, and unadorned simplicity, of the inspired poets? Arthur
                    Johnston· is not so verbose, and has of course more vigour: but his choice of a
                    couplet, which keeps the reader always in mind of the puerile epistles of Ovid,
                    was singularly injudicious. As psalms may, in prose, as easily as in verse, be
                    adapted to musick, why should we seek to force those divine strains into the
                    measures of Roman or of modern song? He who transformed Livy into iambicks, and
                    Virgil into monkish rhime, did not in my opinion act more absurdly. In fact,
                    sentiments of devotion are rather depressed than elevated by the arts of the
                    European versifier.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    somewhat hypercritical, nor do we feel entirely disposed to acquiesce in any of
                    the dogmas which he has thus delivered. The charge of verbosity seems to be very
                    unadvisedly brought against Buchanan; for, to adopt the words of Ruddiman, we
                    know of no modern poet who has “better preserved that masculine and elegant
                    simplicity, which we so much admire in the ancient writers, and whose stile is
                    farther removed from all gaudiness and affectation.”</p>

                <p>Soon after his death, a collection of his poems was published under the
                    superintendence of William Spang, minister of the Scotish church at Campvere,
                    whose name is well known to the readers of Baillie’s Letters. “Artnri Jonstoni
                    Scoti, Medici Regii, Poemata omnia.” Middelb. Zeland. 1642, 16to. This
                    collection, which is printed in a very diminutive form, includes his version of
                    the psalms, and the various works which have already been enumerated, together
                    with some shorter poems published for the first time. It was followed by “Arturi
                    Jonstoni Scoti Psalmorum Davidis Paraphrasis poetica, nunc demum castigatius
                    edita.” Amst. 1706, 12mo. The editor was David Hoogstratan, well-known for his
                    edition of Phaedrus; and the volume is inscribed to Janus Broukhusius, an
                    eminent scholar, at whose suggestion the edition was undertaken. After a short
                    interval, Ruddiman published “Cantici Solomonis Paraphrasis poetica, Arthuro
                    Jonstono Scoto, MedicoRegio, auctore: editio nova, summo studio recognita, ac
                    notis illustrata.” Edinb. 1709, 4to. Edinb. 1717, 8vo. Johnston found a more
                    zealous admirer in William Lauder, who inserted his sacred poems in a collection
                    entitled “Poetarum Scotorum Musae Sacrae: sive quatuor Sacri Codicis Scriptorum,
                    Davidis et Solemonis, Jobi et Jcremiae, Poetici Libri, per totidem Scotos, Arct.

                    Sacra.” Edinb. 1739, 2 tom. 8vo. The first volume contains a life of Johnston,
                    together with the testimonies of various learned writers.<note anchored="true"

                    testimony of Olaus Borrichius, a learned Dane, which is highly favourable, and
                    which commences thus: “In Arturo Jonstono Scoto, medico regio, redivivum
                    agnoscimus Buchananum, ita non modo divinum Psalten nova et speciosa veste

                    His paraphrase was also published separately; and the editor obtained from the
                    general assembly a recommendation that it should be taught in the lower forms of
                    grammar schools, as a precursor to that of Buchanan. An elegant edition of the
                    latter, “cum notis variorum,” had been published in 1737 by Robert Hunter and
                    John Love, the one'professor of Greek at Edinburgh, and the other master of
                    Dalkeith school. Love now thought it incumbent upon him to extol Buchanan, and
                    to censure Johnston; Lauder was far from being satisfied with his criticisms,
                    and an acrimonious controversy ensued between them. Johnston’s cause was
                    espoused with great warmth by Mr Benson, who began his operations by publishing
                    “A Prefatory Discourse to a new Edition of the Psalms of David, translated into
                    Latin verse by Dr Arthur Johnston, Physician to King Charles the First: to which
                    is added, a Supplement, containing a Comparison betwixt Johnston and Buchanan.”
                    Lend. 1741, 8vo. This precursor was speedily followed by “Arturi Jonstoni Psalmi
                    Davidici, interpretatione, argumentis, notisque illustrati, in usum Serenissimi
                    Principis.” Lond. 1741, 4to. &amp; 8vo. Each of these editions is elegantly
                    printed, and contains a portrait of Johnston, engraved by G. Vertue. The life of
                    the poet, we are informed, was translated into Latin by Dr Ward, professor of
                    rhetoric in Gresham College;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Aprilis, 1742.” 'The editor has added a single note, which relates to Buchanan’s

                    who was roused to some degree of indignation by his disparaging animadversions
                    on Buchanan, prepared an elaborate volume, consisting of nearly four hundred
                    pages, and bearing the following copious title: “A Vindication of Mr George
                    Buchanan’s Paraphrase of the Book of Psalms, from the Objections rais’d against
                    it by William Benson, Esq. Auditor in Exchequer, in the Supplement and
                    Conclusion he has annex’d to his Prefatory Discourse to his new Edition of Dr
                    Arthur Johnston’s Version of that sacred book: in which also, upon a comparison
                    of the performances of those two poets, the superiority is demonstrated to
                    belong to Buchanan: wherein likewise several passages of the original are
                    occasionally illustrated: together with some useful observations concerning the
                    Latin Poetry and Arts of Versification: in a Letter to that learned Gentleman.”
                    Edinb. 1745, 8vo. This volume, which displays a masterly knowledge of the Latin
                    language and literature, may still be read for the valuable information which it
                    contains. Although he gives a decided preference to Buchanan, he is far from
                    being insensible to the eminent merit of Johnston, on whom he here bestows no
                    mean commendation. “I have as high an opinion of Dr Johnston’s extraordinary
                    genius as most men have, at least as I think it ought to have; and am satisfied
                    that, for the elegancy and purity of his diction, the sweetness and smoothness
                    of his verse, in short all the other ingredients that are required to the
                    composition of a great and masterly poet, he was inferior to none, and superior
                    to most of the age he lived in. Nay, I will allow farther that, in my judgment,
                    he deserves the preference to the far greater part of those that have lived
                    since or before him.” And in the last work which he gave to the public, he
                    speaks of him in terms of warm and discriminating praise. “The other I shall
                    name is Dr Arthur Johnston, physician to King Charles I., whom I will not be so
                    foolish as, with Mr Auditor Benson, to exalt above the poets of the Augustan
                    age, or even to prefer him to Buchanan, but this I can and will say, that tho’
                    some few of them may have more of pomp and grandeur, of force and energy in
                    their poetry, yet for the sweetness and smoothness, the delicacy and
                    harmoniousness of his numbers, he is not to be equalled in any nation since

                    “Inscriptiones Historicae Regum Scotorum, continuata annorum serie a Fer-gusio
                    primo regni conditore ad nostra tempora; Job. Joi)stono Abredonense Scoto

                    Melvini.” Amst. 1602, 4to. “Heroes ex omni Historia Scotica lectissimi, auctore
                    Johan. Jonstono Abredonense Scoto.” Lugd. Bat. 1603, 4to. Both works consist of
                    short inscriptions, written in elegiac verse, and exhibiting a vein of ancient
                    simplicity. Besides a prose work, entitled <hi rend="italic">Consolatio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Christiana,</hi> he is likewise the author of some sacred poems,
                    printed at Saumur in 1611.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>John Johnston, Μ. D. must not be confounded with the professor of divinity. He
                    was born at Sambter in Poland, on the 3d of September 1603, but was descended of
                    Scotish ancestors; who, according to his continental biographers, were of “the
                    illustrious family of Johnston of Crogborn,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    meaning perhaps Craigsburn. His native country was formerly replenished with
                    Scotish emigrants; and during the seventeenth century, as we are assured by
                    Lithgow, it contained no fewer than thirty thousand Scotish families.<note

                    he afterwards prosecuted his studies in several other universities. On returning
                    to Poland in 1632, he was engaged to accompany two young gentlemen on their
                    travels; and, during a period of four years and a half, they visited France,
                    Italy, and various other countries. He took his doctor’s degree at Leyden, and
                    was admitted <hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">cundem</hi> at
                    Cambridge. The unsettled state of his own country induced him to seek another
                    place of abode; and he withdrew to the duchy of Lignitz in lower Silesia, where
                    he purchased the estate of Ziebendorf, and united the practice of physic with a
                    variety of learned pursuits. By his writings he acquired so much reputation,
                    that he was successively offered a medical chair in the university of Frankfort
                    and in that of Leyden; but. preferring a more retired mode of life, he continued
                    to reside at his own seat till the period of his death, which took place on the
                    8th of June 1675. His remains were interred at Lessno in Poland on the 30th of
                    September. Johnston was twice married, and by his second wife had several
                    children. The most elaborate of his works bears the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historia Naturalis,</hi> and is divided into five volumes folio. His other
                    publications, which amount to a very considerable number, chiefly relate to
                    natural history and medicine. He published a short compendium of civil history,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Polyhistor,</hi> and a treatise “De Festis Hebraeorum
                    et Graecorum.” (x.)</p>
