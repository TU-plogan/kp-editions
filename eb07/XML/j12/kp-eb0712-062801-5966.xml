                    of animals.</p>
                <p>The juices of several plants are expressed to obtain their essential salts, and
                    for several medicinal purposes, with intention either to be used without further
                    preparation, or to be made into syrups and extracts. The general method of
                    extracting these juices is, by pounding the plant in a marble mortar, and then
                    by putting it into a press. In this way is obtained a muddy and green liquor,
                    which generally requires to be clarified. The juices of all plants are not
                    extracted with equal case. Some plants, even when fresh, contain so little
                    juice, that water must be added whilst they are pounded, otherwise scarcely any
                    juice could be obtained by expression. Other plants, which contain a
                    considerable quantity of juice, furnish by expression but a small quantity of
                    it, because they contain also much mucilage, which renders the juice so viscid
                    that it cannot flow. Water must also be added to these plants to obtain their
                    juice. The juices thus obtained from vegetables by a mechanical method arc not,
                    properly speaking, one of their principles, but rather a collection of all the
                    proximate principles of plants which are soluble in water; such is the
                    saponaceous extractive matter, the mucilage, the odoriferous principle, and the
                    saline and saccharine substances; all of which are dissolved in the water of the
                    vegetation of the plants. Besides these matters, the juice contains some part of
                    the resinous substance, and the green colouring matter, which in almost all
                    vegetables is of a resinous nature. These two latter substances not being
                    soluble in water, are only interposed between the parts of the other principles
                    which are dissolved in the juice, and consequently disturb its transparency.
                    They nevertheless adhere together in a certain degree, and so strongly in most
                    juices, that they cannot be separated by filtration alone. When therefore these
                    juices are to be clarified, some previous preparations must be used by which the
                    filtration may be facilitated. Juices which are acid, and not very mucilaginous,
                    are spontaneously clarified by rest and gentle heat. The juices of most
                    antiscorbutic plants abounding in saline volatile principles, may be disposed to
                    filtration merely by immersion in boiling water; and as they may be contained in
                    close bottles, whilst they are thus heated in a water bath, their saline
                    volatile part, in which their medicinal qualities chiefly consist, may thus be
                    preserved. Fermentation is also an effectual method of clarifying juices which
                    are susceptible of it; for all liquors which have fermented clarify
                    spontaneously after fermentation. But this method is not used to clarify juices,
                    because many of them are susceptible of only an imperfect fermentation, and
                    because the qualities of most of them are injured by that process. The method of
                    clarification most generally used, and indispensably necessary for those juices
                    which contain much mucilage, is boiling with the white of an egg. This matter,
                    which has the property of coagulating in boiling water, and of uniting with
                    mucilage, does accordingly, when added to the juice of plants, unite with and
                    coagulate their mucilage, and separates it from the juice in form of scum,
                    together with-the greatest part of the resinous and earthy matters which disturb
                    its transparency. And as any of these resinous matters which may remain in the
                    liquor, after this boiling with the whites of eggs, are no longer retained by
                    the mucilage, they may be easily separated by filtration.</p>
                <p>The juices, especially before they are clarified, contain almost all the same
                    principles as the plant itself; because, in the operation by which they are
                    extracted, no decomposition happens, but every thing remains, as to its nature,
                    in the same state as in the plant. The principles contained in the juice are
                    only separated from the grosser oily, earthy, and resinous parts, which compose
                    the solid matter that remains under the press. These juices, when well prepared,
                    have therefore the same medicinal qualities as the plants from which they are
                    obtained. They must evidently differ from each other as to the nature and
                    proportions of the principles with which they are impregnated, as much as the
                    plants from which they are extracted differ from each other in those
                    respects.</p>
                <p>Most vegetable juices coagulate when they are exposed to the air, whether they
                    are drawn out of the plant by wounds, or naturally run out; though what is
                    called naturally running out is generally the effect of a wound in the plant,
                    from a sort of canker, or some other internal cause. Different parts of the same
                    plant yield different juices. The same veins, in their course through the
                    different parts of the plant, yield juices of a different appearance. Thus the
                    juice in the root of the cow-parsnip is of a brimstone colour, but in the stalk
                    it is white.</p>
                <p>Amongst those juices of vegetables which are clammy and readily coagulate, there
                    are some which readily break with a whey. The great wild lettuce, with the smell
                    of opium, yields the greatest plenty of milky juice of any known British plant.
                    When the stalk is wounded with a knife, the juice flows out readily like a thick
                    cream, and is white and ropy; but if these wounds are made at the top of the
                    stalks, the juice that flows out of them is dashed with a purple tinge, as if
                    cream had been sprinkled over with a few drops of red wine. Some little time
                    after letting this out, it becomes much more purple, and thickens; and finally,
                    the thicker part of it separates, and the thin whey swims at the top. The whey
                    or thin part of this separated matter is easily pressed out from the curd by
                    squeezing between the fingers, and the curd will then remain white; and on
                    washing with water it becomes like rags. The purple whey (for in this is
                    contained all the colour) soon dries into a purple cake, and may be crumbled
                    between the fingers into a powder of the same colour. The white curd being dried
                    and kept for some time, becomes bard and brittle. It breaks with a shining
                    surface like resin, and is inflammable, taking fire at a candle, and burning all
                    away with a strong flame. The same thick part being held over a gentle heat,
                    will draw out into tough, long threads, melting like wax. The purple cake made
                    from the whey is quite different from this; and when held to a candle scarce
                    flames at all, but burns to a black coal. The whole virtue of the plant seems
                    also to consist in this thin part of its juice; for the coagulum or curd, though
                    looking like wax or resin, has no taste at all; whereas the purple cake made
                    from the serum is extremely bitter, and of a taste somewhat resembling that of
                    opium.</p>
                <p>Of the same kind with the wild lettuce arc the throatwort, spurge, and many other
                    plants. These are all replete with a milky juice which separates into curds and
                    whey like that already described. But this, though a common law of nature, is
                    not universal; for there are many plants which yield the like milky juices
                    without any separation ensuing upon their extravasation. The white juice of the
                    sonchus never separates, but dries into an uniform cake; the common red wild
                    poppy bleeds freely with a milky juice; and the heads or capsules of seed bleed
                    not less freely than the rest of the plant, even after the flower is fallen. The
                    juice, on being received into a shell or other small vessel, soon changes its
                    white to a deep yellow colour, and dries into a cake which seems resinous and
                    oily, but no whey separates from it. The tragopogon, or goat’s beard, when
                    wounded, exudes freely a milky juice; it is at first white, but becomes
                    immediately yellow, and then more and more red, till at length it is wholly <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> a <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945979"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-5979-0629"/>dusky red. It never separates, but dries together
                    into one cake; and is oily and resinous, but of an insipid taste. The great
                    bindweed also exudes freely a white juice; the flowers, as well as the stalks
                    and leaves, affording this liquor. It is of a sharp taste; and, as many of the
                    purging plants are of this class, it would be worth trying whether this milk is
                    not purgative.</p>
                <p>These juices, as well as the generality of others which bleed from plants, are
                    white like milk; but there are some of other colours. The juice of the great
                    celandine is of a fine yellow colour; it flows from the plant of the thickness
                    of cream, and soon dries into a bard cake, without any whey separating from it.
                    Another yellow juice is yielded by the seed-vessels of the yellow centaury in
                    the month of July, when the seeds are full grown. This is very clammy; it soon
                    hardens altogether into a cake without any whey separating from it. It sticks to
                    the fingers like bird-lime, is of the colour of pale amber, and will never
                    become harder than soft wax if dried in the shade; but if laid in the sun it
                    immediately becomes hard like resin. These cakes burn like wax, and emit a very
                    pleasant smell. The great angelica also yields a yellowish juice on being
                    wounded; and this will not harden at all, but if kept several years will still
                    be soft and clammy, drawing out into threads or half-melted resin.</p>
                <p>Other kinds of juices very different from all these are those of a gummy nature.
                    Some of these remain liquid a long time, and are not to be dried without the
                    assistance of heat; and others very quickly harden of themselves, and are not
                    inflammable. The gum of the juice of rhubarb leaves soon hardens, and is
                    afterwards soluble in commonwater, and sparkles when put into the flame of a
                    candle. The clusters of the common honeysuckle are full of a liquid gum. This
                    they frequently throw out, and it falls upon the leaves, where it retains its
                    own form. The red hairs of the <hi rend="italic">ros solis</hi> are all
                    terminated by large bladders of a thin, watery fluid. This is also a liquid gum;
                    it sticks to the fingers, draws out into long threads, and stands the force of
                    the sun all day. In the centre of each of these dew-drops there is a small red
                    bladder, which stands immediately on the summit of the red hair, and contains a
                    purple juice which may be squeezed out of it. The pinguicula, or butterwort, has
                    also a gummy matter on its leaves, in much greater quantity than the <hi
                    rend="italic">ros solis.</hi></p>
                <p>Some plants yield juices which are manifestly of an oily nature. These, when
                    rubbed, are not at all of a clammy nature, but make the fingers glib and
                    slippery, and do not at all harden on being exposed to the air. If the stalk of
                    elecampane be wounded, there flows out an oily juice swimming upon a wate’ry
                    one. The stalks of the hemlock also afford a similar oily liquor swimming upon
                    the other; and in like manner the white mullein, the berries of ivy, the bay,
                    juniper, dogberry tree, and the fruit of the olive, when wounded, show their oil
                    floating on the watery juice. Some of these oily juices, however, harden into a
                    kind of resin. Our ivy yields such a juice very abundantly; and the juice of the
                    small purple-berried juniper is of the same kind, being hard and fat, and not
                    very gummy. If the bark of the common ivy is wounded in March, there will ooze
                    out a tough and greasy matter <hi rend="italic">of a</hi> yellowish colour,
                    which, taken up between the fingers, feels not at all gummy or sticking, but
                    melts in handling into a sort of oil, which in process of time hardens and
                    crusts upon the wounds, and looks like brown sugar. It burns with a lasting
                    flame, and smells very strong. The tops of the wild lettuce, and the leaves
                    growing near the tops, if examined with a magnifying glass, show a great number
                    of small bladders or drops of an oily juice of a brownish colour, hardening into
                    a kind of resin; they are easily wiped off when of any size, and are truly an
                    oily juice a little hardened. It is probable, also, that the fine blue flour or
                    powder called the <hi rend="italic">bloom,</hi> upon the surface of our common
                    plums, is no other than such an oily juice exudating from their pores in small
                    particles, and hardening into a sort of resin.</p>
