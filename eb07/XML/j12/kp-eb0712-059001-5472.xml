                    Gulf of St Lawrence, within the longitudes of 62° and 65° W., and the latitudes
                    of 46° and 47° 10' N. It is 140 miles in length, and its greatest breadth is
                    thirty-four miles. From Nova Scotia it is separated by Northumberland Strait,
                    which is nine miles broad between Cape Traverse and Cape Tormentine. Cape Breton
                    lies within twenty-seven miles of the east point; and Cape Ray, the nearest part
                    of Newfoundland, is one hundred and twenty miles distant.</p>
                <p>This island was discovered by Cabot on the 24th of June 1497, being∣ St John’s
                    day, and hence derived its name. The English, however, neglected to avail
                    themselves of this right of possession; and the French, who appear at first to
                    have entertained more correct views of its importance, took possession of it,
                    when they made the conquest of Canada, apparently without any remonstrance on
                    the pait of Britain. For a period of two hundred and thirty-five years it
                    continued attached to the crown of France; and although it cannot be said to
                    have advanced in prosperity with an average degree of celerity, considering the
                    value at which such a possession ought to have been rated, yet the ιesouιces of
                    the island had not been overlooked, and would probably have been called into
                    activity, had it not been surrendered to Great Britain in 1758. At that time the
                    population in the various settlements appears not to have amounted to more than
                    6000. At the peace of 1763 this colony and Cape Breton were annexed to the
                    government of Nova Scotia; and a plan of settlement was agreed to, by which the
                    island was divided into sixty-seven townships, of about 20,000 acres each,
                    granted to individuals ho were considered as having claims on the government,
                    and who were to pay a small sum as quit-rent. A reservation was set apart for
                    his majesty, and also for the purposes of religion and education; and the
                    grantees were bound to settle each township within a stipulated period, by a
                    given number of individuals. The plan, however, was unsuccessful, and many of
                    the proprietors disposed of their lands to others who had either not the will or
                    not the power to proceed with the colonization of the island, according to the
                    principle originally fixed upon. In 1768, St John’s was erected into a separate
                    government from that of Nova Scotia, at the request of a majority of the
                    proprietors; and a governor was appointed, who set vigorously about settling the
                    island in a proper manner, and who did more in this respect than any other
                    proprietor at that time. The colony obtained a complete constitution in 1773,
                    when the first house of assembly met. During the American war, it continued true
                    to the interests of the mother country, and was resorted to by ships of war, as
                    well as converted into a military station. About the year 1790, two provincial
                    corps were raised for the protection of the island, and three troops of
                    volunteer cavalry were likewise formed. As a mark of respect for the Duke of
                    Kent, commander of the British army in America in 1799, the island was then
                    named Prince Edward Island; a very uncalled-for change from St John’s, its most
                    appropriate designation. Since that period no event has occurred of such moment
                    as to require particular mention here.</p>
                <p>This island, without being mountainous, or possessed of romantic scenery, is
                    agreeably diversified by hill and dale; but the level is, in general, never so
                    far deviated from as to interfere with the purposes of agriculture. There are no
                    mountains, properly so called; but a chain of hills intersects the island
                    breadthwise, about its middle. It abounds with streams, and springs of the
                    purest water; and numerous arms of the sea penetrate so far inland that no part
                    of the country is more than eight miles removed from the flux and reflux of the
                    tide. When first seen, it presents the aspect of a flat country, covered with
                    trees to the margin of the ocean; but, on a nearer approach, the more inviting
                    prospect discloses itself, of villages and farms situated in valleys or on green
                    and gentle declivities, with the other smiling features which result from
                    agricultural industry or spontaneous fertility. Almost every part presents
                    beautiful landscape views, especially in summer and autumn, when the forests
                    exhibit an exuberance of rich and splendid foliage. Unlike Cape Breton,
                    Newfoundland, and other contiguous islands, St John’s is very rarely visited by
                    fogs; and although the winter be equally severe, the transitions from one
                    extreme to another are less violent. The season of cold is likewise less
                    protracted than it is in Lower Canada, whilst the frost is not so intense, nor
                    the snows so deep. Altogether the climate is very salubrious, and there are few
                    countries where health is enjoyed with less interruption.</p>
                <p>The soil consists of a thin layer of black or brown mould, composed of decayed
                    vegetables, superimposed uponŉ light loam, occasionally of a sandy, and at other
                    times of a clayey character. This extends about one foot downwards, and then a
                    stiff clay, resting upon sand-stone, predominates. The latter rock is the base
                    of the island, and it appears to extend under the bed of Northumberland Strait,
                    into the contiguous islands, and also into the continent. A solitary block of
                    granite occasionally presents itself; but neither limestone, gypsum, nor coal,
                    have been discovered, although their presence was to have been expected from the
                    occurrence of the sandstone formation. Iron has not yet been found, although the
                    soil and the springs are impregnated with it. Red clay, of a superior quality,
                    for bricks, abounds in all parts; and white clay, for potters’ use, is found in
                    limited quantities. The soil is fertile, and its quality can be readily
                    ascertained by the nature of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945485"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-5485-0591"/>wood which grows upon it; the richest being that
                    where the maple, beech, black birch, and a mixture of other trees, grow; and the
                    less fertile being that where the varieties of the fir tribe are most abundant.
                    There are some unproductive bogs, swamps, and other tracts called barrens; but
                    they bear but a small proportion to the whole surface of the island, and may, by
                    judicious management, be brought under cultivation. The marshes, which are
                    overflowed by the tide, rear a strong, nutritious grass, and, when dyked, yield
                    heavy crops of wheat or hay. Those swamps also which have been drained form
                    excellent meadows. A very considerable proportion of the island must have
                    formerly been covered with pine forests, and some tracts, from which these have
                    disappeared, partake of the character of barrens. Many of these plantations of
                    wood have been destroyed by fires, which have at different periods raged over
                    the island; and in these places white birches, spruce-firs, poplars, and wild
                    cherry-trees, have sprung up. The poplars grow to an immense size, and are very
                    plentiful. There are many other kinds of trees besides, such as beech, maple,
                    dog-wood, alder, Indian pear tree; and most of the shrubs, wild fruits, herbs,
                    and grasses, common to other parts of British North America. Sarsaparilla,
                    ginseng, and probably many other medicinal plants, are plentiful in all parts of
                    the island. Amongst the wild fruits, rasp-berries, straw-berries, cran-berries,
                    which are very large, blueberries, and whortle-berries, are exceedingly
                    abundant.</p>
                <p>Amongst the quadrupeds native to the island may be mentioned bears, once very
                    numerous and destructive, but now much reduced; loup-cerviers, a deadly enemy of
                    sheep; foxes and hares, which are both numerous; otters, martens, and musk-rats,
                    now rarely met with, from having been long hunted for their skins; varieties of
                    the squirrel in great abundance; and a few weasels and ermines. During spring,
                    summer, and autumn, seals frequent the shores; and walrusses were at one time
                    annual visitants, but they have now entirely disappeared. Partridges and wild
                    pigeons are plentiful, and, as well as hares, are free for any person to kill,
                    no game-laws existing. In spring and autumn, wild geese, ducks, and other
                    water-fowl, are abundant. The&gt; reptiles and insects do not require particular
                    notice. The rivers abound with excellent fish, such as trout, eel, mackerel,
                    flounders, oysters, lobsters, the two latter being very large and very fine; and
                    the coast with cod-fish and herrings in great abundance.</p>
                <p>Prince Edward Island is essentially an agricultural colony, for which its
                    climate, soil, and the configuration of its surface, admirably adapt it. All
                    kinds of grain and vegetables raised in England arrive at perfection. Crop after
                    crop of wheat springs up without manuring; the barley is excellent, and the oats
                    much superior to any other of American growth. The potatoes and turnips cannot
                    be anywhere excelled in quality, and peas and beans are equally good. Cabbage,
                    carrots, parsnips, and, indeed, all culinary vegetables, thrive as well here as
                    in English gardens. Various fruits are also cultivated, such as cherries, plums,
                    damsons, and the like. Flax, of excellent quality, is raised and wrought into
                    fabrics by private individuals. Hemp grows, but not to such perfection as in
                    other places. The climate is particularly favourable to sheep, and they are
                    exempt from those diseases common to the animal in this country. Black cattle
                    are good, but small; swine thrive well, as also do horses and milk-cows. The
                    breed of useful animals generally has been much improved of late years; and
                    agriculture, by the fostering care of the governor, has recently made decided
                    advances. Such being the natural resources and advantages of this colony, it
                    appears to be admirably adapted for industrious emigrants with small capitals.
                    Before adverting to the trade of the island, it will be necessary to speak of
                    the principal settlements, and its division into three counties, viz. Queen’s,
                    King’s, and Prince’s Counties. These are again divided into parishes, the whole
                    being subdivided into sixty-seven townships, containing about 20,000 acres each.
                    The ground for a town, containing about 400 building lots,«with the same number
                    of pasture lots, are reserved in each county. These are, George Town in King’s
                    County, Charlotte Town in Queen’s County, and Prince Town in Prince’s
                    County.</p>
                <p>Queen’s County contains five parishes, namely, Grenville, Charlotte, Bedford,
                    Hillsborough, and St John’s, and comprehends an area of 486,400 acres in the
                    centre of the island. The north coast of this county possesses few harbours,
                    except for smaller vessels; but it is extremely picturesque. On the south shore
                    is Hillsborough Bay, at the bottom of which, and at the confluence of the three
                    rivers Hillsborough, York, and Elliott, Charlotte Town, the capital of the
                    island, and the seat of government, is situated. Its harbour is considered as
                    one of the best and most secure in the Gulf of St Lawrence, though not more than
                    half a mile wide at the entrance. Within this point it widens into a spacious
                    basin, and then branches into three beautiful and navigable rivers. The harbour
                    is protected by several batteries, and it could easily be put into such a state
                    of defence as to secure the town from any attack from the seaward. The town is
                    advantageously situated on ground which rises gradually to a moderate height
                    above the level of the sea. It is regularly laid out, the streets being broad,
                    and intersecting each other at right angles, five or six vacancies being left
                    for squares. There are about three hundred and fifty dwelling-houses, many of
                    them handsomely finished. The public buildings are, the courthouse, in which the
                    court of chancery, as well as the court of judicature, are held, and in which
                    the legislative assembly likewise sit; the Episcopal church, the new Scotch
                    church, and the Catholic and the Methodist chapels. The barracks are pleasantly
                    situated near the water, and a neat parade or square occupies the space between
                    those of the officers and privates. On the west side of the harbour lies the
                    Fort or Warren Farm, the most beautiful situation on the island. No place could
                    have been more judiciously selected as a site for the metropolis, than that
                    which has been chosen for Charlotte Town. It is situated almost in the centre of
                    the county, and of easy access, either by water, or by the different roads
                    leading to it from the various other settlements. Indeed there is a maritime
                    communication with a considerable portion of the island by means of the three
                    rivers near the confluence of which it stands. The population amounts to about
                    3400. Twenty miles west of Charlotte Town, and nearly opposite to <hi
                    rend="italic">Bai de Verts,</hi> or Green Bay, in Nova Scotia, stands Tryon
                    village, one of the most populous and pleasant places in the island. A
                    serpentine river winds through it, on the banks of which are well-cultivated
                    farms. The tide flows up about two miles; but, from a dangerous bar at its
                    mouth, the harbour will only admit small vessels. On the north coast of this
                    county is New London, in the district of Grenville Bay. The harbour of New
                    London, though safe and convenient, will not admit vessels drawing more than
                    twelve feet of water. The bar is sheltered during northwesterly winds by Cape
                    Tryon, three miles to the north. The lands on the west side of this harbour have
                    long been cultivated; and there was formerly an extensive fishing establishment
                    erected here, but circumstances occurred to interrupt its prosperity.
                    Harrington, or Grand RusticoBay, has two entrances, and a harbour for small
                    brigs and schooners. Here are two villages inhabited by Acadian French. The
                    surrounding parts of the bay have been populously settled, chiefly by emigrants
                    from Scotland. To the east of Grand Rustico are Brackly, and Little Rustico or
                    Stanhope Cove, esteemed two of the finest settlements on the island. Still
                    further east is Bedford, or Tracady Bay, at which there is a small harbour for
                    schooners and <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945498" xml:id="kp-eb0712-5498-0592"
                    />. small brigs. On the opposite side of the island is Belfast district, which
                    includes the villages of Great and Little Belfast, Orwell, and Point Prince,
                    together with various settlements. The soil here is excellent, and heavy crops
                    are raised, the surplus of which is exported.</p>
                <p>King’s County, on the east side of the island, is divided into four parishes,
                    viz. East, St Patrick, St George’s, and St Andrew’s, the whole comprising
                    412,000 acres. The first, as its name signifies, occupies the whole eastern
                    point of the island, and is destitute of a harbour on its north shore, which is
                    called the District of the Capes. The inhabitants are principally from the west
                    of Scotland and the Hebrides, and they have chiefly applied themselves to
                    agriculture. Owing to the abundant supplies of sea-weed which they possess, they
                    manure the land well, and raise valuable crops, particularly of barley and
                    wheat. Colville, Rollo, Fortune, and Broughton Bays, are small harbours with
                    thriving settlements. St Patrick’s parish has a good bay for small vessels on
                    the north shore, called St Peter’s, about nine miles long. The settlements on
                    each side are in a flourishing and rapidly improving condition. St Andrew’s
                    parish has Murray Harbour and river in it. The former is well sheltered, but of
                    difficult access. Ship-building is carried on here to some extent, and the
                    surrounding country is rapidly improving. George Town, or Three Rivers, is
                    situated in the parish of St George’s, on the south-east part of the island. It
                    possesses an excellent and safe harbour, at the junction of three fine rivers,
                    and is well calculated for being the centre of any trade carried on within the
                    Gulf of St Lawrence. Excellent fishing-grounds lie in its vicinity; and at
                    certain seasons of the year herrings enter it in large shoals. The contiguous
                    settlements are rapidly improving, the settlers turning their attention more to
                    agriculture than formerly. Ship-building is carried on here, and a considerable
                    quantity of timber has been exported within the last five-and-twenty years.</p>
                <p>Prince’s County contains five parishes, namely, North, Egmont, Halifax, Richmond,
                    and St David’s, and comprises an area of 467,000 acres. This county possesses
                    several very fine harbours, particularly on the north side, that of Richmond Bay
                    being the largest. This bay is ten miles in depth and nine miles in breadth; and
                    although the centre part is unsheltered, there are several inlets perfectly safe
                    from all winds, with from three to four fathoms of good anchorage.</p>
                <p>Six beautiful islands lie within or across the bay, three of which have an area
                    of 500 acres of good land. Lennox Island is the principal rendezvous of the
                    Miemac Indians, once a powerful people, but, like the other aboriginal tribes of
                    the west, now reduced to a mere handful by the arts and the arms of their white
                    subjugators. They profess the Roman Catholic faith, and have here a
                    burying-ground and chapel, where they assemble for a few weeks in summer. A
                    number of townships abut on Richmond Bay, which has a highly advantageous water
                    communication along the coast. It is well situated for cod and herring
                    fisheries, and has afforded several cargoes of timber, as well as vessels built
                    upon the spot, for the English market. The settlers here are principally Scotch,
                    and are, generally speaking, a moral and orderly class of people. To the west of
                    Richmond Bay is Holland Harbour, or Cascumpec, a safe and convenient place of
                    anchorage. The lands around it are well adapted for agriculture; and this place
                    also, by its advantageous situation, is well calculated for extensive fishing
                    establishments. It is the most convenient port in the island for loading timber,
                    where there is a very large quantity; it has also a saw-mill for cutting plank
                    or board.</p>
                <p>The population consists of Acadian French and some English families. From Holland
                    Bay to the north-west point (in 47° 7' north latitude) of the island, a distance
                    of twenty-four miles, the coast is low and sandy, as is likewise the case from
                    North Cape, down towards the West Cape, on the south coast, which forms the
                    western entrance of Egmont Bay. This bay is sixteen miles broad, from the west
                    point to Cape Egmont, and about ten deep. There is no harbour for large vessels
                    within it, and it is by no means very inviting for strange vessels. The
                    inhabitants in this part are chiefly Acadian French, who live in three small
                    thriving villages on the east side of the bay. Farther to the east lies Halifax,
                    or Befieque Bay, which has a well-sheltered harbour. The shores are populously
                    settled, and there are two or three ship-building establishments here.</p>
                <p>When this island was in possession of the French, little commerce was carried on
                    by the inhabitants; but when it came into the hands of the British, a small
                    trade commenced in the articles offish, oil, sea-cow skins, and sealskins, which
                    were exported to various parts of the North American continent. Since that
                    period the trade has very materially increased. The following tables show the
                    present state of the commercial and shipping interests of the island.</p>

                <p>There is also a respectable trade in ship-building carried on in the colony.
                    During the year 1833 there were thirty-two vessels launched and registered,
                    having in the <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> gg <hi rend="superscript"> re</hi>

                    facs="nls:192945511" xml:id="kp-eb0712-5511-0593"/>employed in the foreign and
                    coasting trade belonging to the island in the same year was, foreign, five
                    vessels, of 1169 tons burden, carrying forty-five men; coasting, 124 vessels, of
                    6346 tons burden, carrying 359 men. During the year ending December 1832, there
                    were transferred from the island to other ports, thirty-two vessels, of 3202
                    tons burden in the aggregate. As the best fishing banks within the Gulf of St
                    Lawrence are situated in the neighbourhood of this island, it is surprising that
                    fisheries have not been more attended to. The herring fishery is the most
                    important; immense shoals of these fish arrive on the coast early in spring, and
                    can be taken in any quantity. Cod, mackerel, and other fish, may likewise be
                    caught in abundance. In short, were more attention paid to the fisheries, they
                    would add much to the value of property on the island. Agriculture, however, is
                    not neglected, as will be seen by the following table, showing the quantity

                <p>The returns for 1834 show a decided increase in trade, especially that which is
                    dependent upon the cultivation of the soil. But of course the commerce of the
                    island is as yet in its infancy. The following is a statistical view of the
                    island, according to a return made under the authority of the act Will. IV. cap.

                <p>The constitution of this island, like that of the other islands in this quarter,
                    is similar to the government of Britain, and in all civil matters is independent
                    of any jurisdiction in America. The king is represented by a
                    lieutenant-governor, who is also chancellor of the court of chancery. There is a
                    council, consisting generally of twelve members elected by the king’s mandamus,
                    and which acts in an executive as well as legislative capacity; and a house of
                    assembly of eighteen members elected by the people, and who manage their affairs
                    after the manner of the British House of Commons. The chief-justice and
                    attorney-general are appointed by the king, and the local government annually
                    nominate the high sheriff. All <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945524"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-5524-0594"/>criminal and civil matters of importance are tried
                    in the supreme court of judicature, by a jury of twelve men. Magistrates and
                    justices of peace take cognizance of smaller matters. The laws by which justice
                    and good government are dispensed and secured are the same as those of
                    England.</p>
                <p>In financial matters the island is thus situated. When the soil was originally
                    granted by government to various proprietors, the conditions of the settlement
                    were, that a certain sum should be paid as quit-rent, amounting on an average to
                    about four shillings and sixpence for each hundred acres. But this sum not being
                    regularly paid, government agreed to accept of a composition; and this
                    arrangement, by freeing the land from heavy claims, imparted a new stimulus to
                    the island. In 1833 it was agreed upon by the house of assembly to address his
                    majesty, offering to provide the whole civil expenses of the island, and asking
                    in return that the crown would resign its claim to the quit-rents, and accept of
                    a substitute of 4s. 6d. for every hundred acres in a township. At the same time
                    it was stipulated that a civil list should be granted to the crown, so as to
                    render the governor, judge, and other functionaries, independent of the annual
                    votes of the house. The fate of this proposal is as yet undecided. St John’s is
                    one of those colonial islands which, from their native resources not having been
                    sufficiently called forth, is at present of equivocal value to the mother
                    country, in as far as revenue is concerned. The revenue has not always kept pace
                    with the expenditure, as in 1833,-when the former amounted to L.7684, and the
                    latter to L.13,759; yet the deficit is to be accounted for by additional outlays
                    for erecting public edifices, and for other useful or necessary purposes.
                    Besides, there was a considerable balance, the remainder of former years; and an
                    issue of treasury notes was made to meet the exigency, a redemption of these
                    being anticipated from the new act levying an assessment upon land. Various
                    causes have contributed to occasion a reduction in the amount of impost duty,
                    such as the failure of crops, and the advanced prices of foreign articles; but
                    such interruptions to prosperity are not likely to remain permanent. With
                    respect to the monetary system, the weights and measures are the same as in
                    England. The dollar is estimated at four shillings and sixpence, and thus
                    becomes five shillings currency; the guinea is L.l. 3s. 4d.; and the other coins
                    are in proportion. The paper currency at present in circulation is supposed to
                    be about L.20,000. There is no banking establishment in the island, which is a
                    material drawback to its prosperity.</p>
                <p>The established religion of the colony is the Episcopalian, but the members of
                    the church of Scotland and of that of Rome are supposed to be the most numerous.
                    There are several missionary establishments, and the inhabitants generally are
                    very much awake to the interests of religion, as is shown by the efforts which
                    they have made for its dissemination, as well as that of its powerful auxiliary,
                    education. There is at Charlotte Town a very respectable grammar-school, another
                    on the Madras system, and there are others in most of the settlements for
                    elementary instruction, government devoting a sum for their support. In all,
                    there are seventy-four schools, attended by 2276 scholars. There are two
                    well-conducted newspapers, one of which is published in Charlotte Town, where
                    there is also a public subscription-library on a respectable footing.</p>
                <p>We have no data by which to form a correct estimate of the progressive increase
                    of the population. When taken from the French, the island, as we have seen, was
                    supposed to contain about 6000 Acadians. By the census of 1833, the males were
                    in number 15,129, and the females 13,795, making a total population of 28,925;
                    which is an increase since 1827 of 8274. Natives of Scotland constitute more
                    than one half of the whole population; those from the Hebrides are best suited
                    to the island. The Acadian French are estimated at about 5000; but of the Miemac
                    or native Indians, once so numerous, there remain probably not more than thirty
                    families on the island.</p>
