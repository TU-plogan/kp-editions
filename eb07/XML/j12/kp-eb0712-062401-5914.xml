                <p><label type="entry">JUBILEE</label>, amongst the Jews, denotes every fiftieth
                    year, being 'that following the revolution of seven weeks of years, at which
                    time all the slaves were made free, and all lands reverted to their ancient
                    owners. But the jubilees were disregarded after the Babylonian captivity. The
                    word, according to some authors, comes from the Hebrew, <hi rend="italic"
                    >jobel,</hi> which signifies <hi rend="italic">fifty</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but this must be a mistake, for the Hebrew, <hi rend="italic"
                    >jobel,</hi> does not signify fifty, neither do its letters, taken as ciphers,
                    or according to their numerical powers, make up that number, these being 10, 6,
                    2, and 30, or in all 48. Others say, thatjoM signifies a <hi rend="italic"
                    >ram,</hi> and that the jubilee was so called, because proclaimed with a ram’s
                    horn, in memory of the ram which appeared to Abraham in the thicket. Masius
                    chooses to derive the word from <hi rend="italic">Jubal,</hi> the first inventor
                    of musical instruments, which for that reason were called by his name; and hence
                    the words <hi rend="italic">jο-bel</hi> and <hi rend="italic">jubilee</hi> came
                    to signify the year of deliverance and remission, because proclaimed with the
                    sound of one of those instruments, which at first was no other than the horn of
                    a ram. Others derive <hi rend="italic">jobel</hi> from q□', <hi rend="italic"
                    >jabal,</hi> in hiphil, ⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> Ξrτ, <hi rend="italic"
                    >hobil,</hi> which signifies to recall or return; because this year restored all
                    slaves to their liberty, and recalled exiles to their native land. The
                    institution of this festival is to be found in Leviticus (chap. xxv. v.
                    8-17).</p>
                <p>The learned are divided about the year of jubilee; some maintaining that it
                    occurred every forty-ninth, and others that it took place every fiftieth year.
                    The ground of the former opinion is chiefly this, that the forty-ninth year
                    being of course a sabbatical year, if the jubilee had been observed on the
                    fiftieth, the land must have had two sabbaths, or have lain fallow two years,
                    which, without a miracle, would have produced a scarcity. On the other hand, it
                    is alleged, that the Scripture expressly declares for the fiftieth year (Levit,
                    xxv. 10, 11): and, besides, if the jubilee and sabbatical year had been the
                    same, there would have been no need for a prohibition against sowing or reaping,
                    because this kind of labour was prohibited by the law of the sabbatical year
                    (Levit, xxv. 4, 5). The authors of the Universal History (book i. chap. 7, note
                    R) endeavour to reconcile these opinions, by observing, that as the jubilee
                    began in the first month of the civil year, which was the seventh of the
                    ecclesiastical, it might be said to be either the forty-ninth or fiftieth,
                    according as one or other of these computations was followed. The political
                    design of the law of the jubilee was to prevent the oppression of the poor, as
                    well as to obviate their being liable to perpetual slavery. By this means a kind
                    of equality was preserved amongst all the families of Israel, and the
                    distinction of tribes was also preserved, that they might be able, when there
                    was occasion, on the jubilee year, to prove their right to the inheritance of
                    their ancestors. It served also, like the <hi rend="italic">olympiads</hi> of
                    the Greeks, and the <hi rend="italic">lustra</hi> of the Romans, for the
                    computation of time. The jubilee has likewise been supposed to be typical of the
                    gospel state and dispensation, described by Isaiah (lxi. ver. 1, 2, in reference
                    to this period) as the “acceptable year of the Lord.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Jubilee,</hi> in a more modern sense, denotes a grand
                    solemnity or ceremony, celebrated at Rome, in which the pope grants a plenary
                    indulgence, at least to as many as visit the churches of St Peter and St
                    Paul.</p>
                <p>The jubilee was first established by Boniface VII. in the year 1300, in favour of
                    those who should proceed <hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">limina
                    apostolorum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and it was only to return every hundred
                    years. But the first celebration brought in such store of wealth to Rome, that
                    the Germans called this the <hi rend="italic">golden</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >year</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a circumstance which induced Clement VI. in
                    1343, to reduce the period of the jubilee to fifty years. Urban VI. in 1389
                    appointed it to be held every thirty-five years, that being the age of our
                    Saviour; and Paul II. and Sixtus IV. in 1475 brought it down to every
                    twenty-five years, that all persons might have the benefit of it once in their
                    lifetime. Boniface IX. granted the privilege of holding jubilees to several
                    princes and monasteries; for instance, to the monks of Canterbury, who had a
                    jubilee every fifty years, when people flocked from all parts to visit the tomb
                    of St Thomas-a-Becket. Jubilees are now become more frequent, and the pope
                    grants them as often as the church or himself has occasion for them. There is
                    usually one at the inauguration of a new pope. To be entitled to the privileges
                    of the jubilee, the bull enjoins fastings, alms, and prayers. It gives the
                    priests full power to absolve in all cases, even those otherwise reserved to the
                    pope, to make commutations of vows, and to perform other functions, in which it
                    differs from a plenary indulgence. During the time of jubilee all other
                    indulgences are suspended.</p>
                <p>One of our kings, Edward HL, caused his birth-day to be observed in the manner of
                    a jubilee when he became fifty years of age, in 1362, but never before nor
                    after; and this he did by releasing prisoners, pardoning all offences except
                    treason, making good laws, and granting many privileges to the people.</p>
                <p>There are particular jubilees in certain cities, when several of their feasts
                    fall upon the same day; at Puy-en-Velay, for instance, when the feast of the
                    Annunciation happens on Good Friday; and at Lyons, when the feast of St John
                    Baptist concurs with the feast of Corpus Christi. The Jesuits celebrated a
                    solemn jubilee at Rome in 1640, that being the centenary or hundredth year from
                    their institution; and the same ceremony was observed in all their houses
                    throughout the world.</p>
