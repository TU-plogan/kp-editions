                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">JUSTICE</label>, in a moral sense, is one of the four
                    cardinal virtues, which consists in giving every person his due.</p>
                <p>Civilians distinguish justice into two kinds, <hi rend="italic"
                    >communicative</hi> and <hi rend="italic">distributive.</hi> The former
                    establishes fair dealing in the mutual commerce between man and man, and
                    includes sincerity in our discourse, as well as integrity in our dealings. <hi
                    rend="italic">Distributive</hi> justice is that by which the differences of
                    mankind are decided according to the rules of equity. The former is the justice
                    of private individuals, the latter* that of princes and magistrates.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Justice</hi> is also an appellation given to a person
                    deputed by the king to administer justice to his subjects, and whose authority
                    arises from his deputation, and not by right of magistracy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Justice-Clerk of Scotland,</hi> the vice-president of the
                    Court of Justiciary, in absence of the lord-justice-general. This officer was
                    originally no other than the clerk to the Justiciar or Justice Court of
                    Scotland, as the name indeed imports; and bis progress from the table to the
                    bench is singular, and not a little curious.</p>
                <p>In early times there were two justice-clerks, as there were likewise two
                    justiciars, one on either side of the Forth; and as the jurisdiction of the
                    Justice Court was then nearly universal in respect of the matters cognisable
                    there, and very high in degree, the office of clerk was of considerable
                    importance, and enjoyed by persons of station in society. Thus we find that Adam
                    Forrester of Corstorphine, justice-clerk benorth Forth <hi rend="italic"
                    >(temp.</hi> Dav. II.), was in 1373 provost, or, as that officer was then
                    called’ alderman, of the town of Edinburgh, and in 1382 sheriff of the shire;
                    and in 19 Rob. II., he was keeper of the great seal, in the absence of the
                    chancellor, who had gone abroad.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the fifteenth century, the justiceclerks began also to act as
                    public prosecutors before the justiciars, the latter being previously, it would
                    seem, themselves the prosecutors, as the sheriffs were in their countycourts
                    before the institution of procurators-fiscal; and, in the beginning of the next
                    century, as the office of justiciar came into the hands of a single individual,
                    so likewise did that of justice-clerk. The offices of justice-clerk and king’s
                    advocate (an officer of whom we have little account previously to the end of the
                    fifteenth century) appear to have had at this time so many duties in common,
                    that Henryson of Fordel, and Lawson of Hierigs, succeeded each other in them
                    respectively; and the two offices having become vacant by the fall of those
                    individuals at the fatal field of Flodden, Wischeart of Pittarrow was thereupon
                    appointed to both places; but in his time a deputy began to be appointed to
                    officiate as clerk to the Justice Court, Wischeart probably directing his chief
                    attention to his duty as public prosecutor. On his death the offices of
                    justiceclerk and king’s advocate were again separated; and to the former
                    Crawfurd of Oxengangs was appointed. On the institution of the present Court of
                    Session, Crawfurd, then justice-clerk, was advanced, as were likewise the king’s
                    advocate, treasurer, and clerk-register, upon reasons of public policy; the
                    deliberations of the court being at that time, and till the revolution, in
                    secret with shut doors, agreeably to the practice of the papal tribunals, the
                    principles of which, the court, as may be supposed from its ecclesiastical
                    constitution, had very largely imbibed. The justice-clerk continued in this
                    threefold character of clerk of the Justice Court (but discharging the duties by
                    deputy), lord of Session, and public prosecutor, for some time, when he was at
                    length superseded in the last capacity altogether by the lord-advocate; and in
                    the degree in which he was so superseded he appears to have been appointed an
                    assessor to the lord-justice∙general, equally with the other lords of Session.
                    In the time of the excellent Sir Robert Murray, who was appointed to the office
                    in 1651, he began to be styled “lord-justice-clerk.” In 1663, Sir John Home was
                    appointed, and, the same year, declared by act of Privy Council a constituent
                    judge of the Justice Court; and in 1672, a statute passed, constituting the
                    lord-justice-clerk vice-president of the court, to preside in absence of the
                    lord-justice-general.</p>
                <p>In the Court of Session the justice-clerk had no preeminence, till the time of
                    that distinguished lawyer, Miller of Barskimming, who, on his appointment, took
                    his seat by desire of the court, on the right of the lord president; and on the
                    division of the Court of Session into two chambers in 18] 1, the
                    lord-justice-clerk was made <hi rend="italic">ex∙οfficio</hi> president of the
                    Second Division, though he is not necessarily a lord of Session. (u. u. u.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Justices</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Peace,</hi>
                    are persons of interest and credit appointed by the king’s commission, to keep
                    the peace of the county where they live.</p>
