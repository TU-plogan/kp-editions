                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">MADRID</label>, the metropolis of the Spanish empire, and
                    also the capital of a province of the same name, in the centre of Spain, being
                    about 300 miles from the sea in each direction. The province includes the city,
                    and about two hundred villages that surround it. The ground on which these
                    several villages are built is so uneven in its surface, and has so many valleys
                    and hills, that scarcely more than three or four of them are visible from the
                    same point. The extent of the province is 110 square leagues, and the number of
                    inhabitants is 228,520, including 168,000 who reside within the city.</p>
                <p>The city of Madrid is of modern erection, and is consequently not so Gothic in
                    appearance as the other cities of the Peninsula. Though the ground on which it
                    stands is irregular, the streets are laid out with great judgment, well paved,
                    and have convenient footpaths, with broad stones. The city is well supplied with
                    water from several public fountains, and, having been filtered by passing seven
                    or eight leagues over beds of gravel or sand, it is remarkable for its great
                    purity. The principal square, a pile distinguished by its extent and its beauty,
                    is in north latitude 40. 25. 7. In this square and in the other markets,
                    notwithstanding the natural sterility of the province, an abundant supply is at
                    all times to be seen of excellent bread, of fruits, of horticultural vegetables,
                    of fish, of poultry, and of butcher-meat.</p>
                <p>Madrid, though deemed a cold situation by the natives of the other towns of
                    Spain, does in reality enjoy an equable and temperate climate. With the
                    exception of a short period, when the dry winds from the north blow cold, and a
                    few days in the very midst of summer, when it is intensely hot, a great degree
                    of equality of temperature prevails. In the greatest heat the centigrade
                    thermometer is seen at 40°, and in the cold weather it is 8° 5′. The medium heat
                    of the year is 14° 0' 35" above zero. The medium height of the barometer is
                    thirty inches and a third. Its height above the level of the sea, according to
                    the formula of Laplace, by observations of the medium height of the barometer
                    and thermometer at Madrid and on the coast, is 2170 English feet. It may be
                    said, that all the circumstances which contribute to communicate salubrity to a
                    city are found in Madrid, and hence the inhabitants enjoy as much health and
                    longevity as are experienced by the people of any large city in Europe; nor has
                    it ever been visited by contagious fevers.</p>
                <p>The roads in the vicinity of Madrid are generally in a bad state; those called
                    <hi rend="italic">caminas</hi><hi rend="italic">reales</hi> are good, but they
                    lead only in a few directions, and the other roads arc miserably neglected. The
                    way from the north is over some prodigious mountains, which must be passed
                    before reaching the capital. One of the highest points of the mountains of
                    Guadarama is 4580 feet above the level of the sea, and the extensive plains of
                    New Castille may be seen from its summit, to the greatest extent of the powers
                    of vision.</p>
                <p>The whole of the city is on the left bank of the Manzanares, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193210198" xml:id="kp-eb0713-0198-0675"/>a river whose waters are in
                    general far from copious, but over which two magnificent bridges have been
                    constructed. On its banks there are some large trees; and its waters irrigate
                    some gardens, which are fruitful, and adjoin a royal residence, or rather
                    retreat, called Casa de Campo. Around the city, near the river, wheat and barley
                    are cultivated, with the assistance that the manure of a large town yields. The
                    produce of wheat is from nine to twelve for one, and of barley from fourteen to
                    sixteen for one, on the quantity sown. The soil is better adapted for vines,
                    though but few are cultivated, and these rather for the table than for making
                    wines.</p>
                <p>There is no episcopal church in Madrid; and the other churches, though, like all
                    in Spain, they are costly and large, do not rise so high above the common level
                    as to attract any very particular notice. They are seventy-seven in number, and
                    there are also seventy-five monasteries. The most magnificent pile of building
                    in Madrid is the royal palace, built after the destruction of the former by fire
                    in 1734. The ceilings of the palace are painted by the most eminent artists of
                    the period, Mengs, Corrado, and Tiepolo. The richest marbles, all from Spanish
                    quarries, are used in the floors, the cornices, and the door and window frames.
                    The great chamber of audience is remarkably splendid, the walls are covered with
                    beautiful marbles, hung with plate-glasses of the largest size. The ceiling,
                    painted with allegorical history, and the cornices with figures of the different
                    people under the Spanish crown, is admirably executed. This palace is, or rather
                    was before the French entered it, adorned with a fine collection of pictures
                    from the hands of the first masters. Some of the best productions of Titian,
                    Reubens, Vandyke, Murillo, Velasquez, Spagnoletti, Mengs, and other masters,
                    decorated this edifice. With all its magnificence, this palace is in a bad
                    situation, and has never been the favourite residence of any of the monarchs
                    except the original founder. Few places of equal extent have so small a number
                    of objects to attract the notice of casual strangers as the city of Madrid.
                    Though many of the public buildings are grand, there are none of them of such
                    superiority as to draw great admiration from observers. The public walks are
                    handsome and much frequented, and the gardens of the royal residence, called
                    Buen-Retiro, are opened for the public recreations, and are highly delightful.
                    The Puerto de Sol, and some of the other entrances, have gates that display
                    taste in architecture, and excite admiration in travellers. There is but little
                    commerce in Madrid, and few manufactories.; the establishments by the government
                    for making saltpetre, porcelain, brandy, cards, and tapestry, have never
                    flourished, and are now very much reduced. As the nobility of Spain seldom
                    reside on their domains, but attach themselves to the court, a considerable
                    number of them are collected here, and spend their revenues: this class, with
                    the officers of government, the members of the different boards of
                    administration, the members of the profession of the law, the clergy, and the
                    military, with their dependents and tradesmen, compose the great mass of the
                    population of Madrid.</p>
                <p>The king of Spain is an absolute monarch, and issues his orders to the different
                    boards of administration, who put them in execution. They are, the council of
                    Castille, the council of the Indies, the junta for the administration of justice
                    and political affairs, the tribunal of revenues, the council of war and naval
                    affairs, the inquisition formatters of faith, and the junta for the final
                    decision of controversies in ecclesiastical affairs. The tribunals of justice
                    are in Madrid; but the high tribunals in the provincial capitals decide on
                    almost every case, without appeal being made to the court in Madrid. There are
                    several literary institutions, which, though not of extensive influence beyond
                    the capital, are both useful and respectable. There are four academies, one for
                    the Spanish language, one for history, one for the arts and sciences, and one
                    for medicine and natural history. There is a very respectable learned body, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Sociedad Economica,</hi> which has corresponding branches in
                    sixty-one towns of the kingdom, established with the intention of diffusing the
                    knowledge of political economy, and promoting the advancement of the useful
                    arts. The royal library, always open to public inspection and use, contains
                    upwards of 130,000 volumes of printed books, besides manuscripts, and a rich
                    collection of medals. See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Libraries.</hi></p>
                <p>There is a seminary established by the government for the education of the
                    nobility, just without the city, which is a most splendid and capacious
                    building, and liberally, if not learnedly, supported. There are in the city no
                    less than nineteen hospitals, and several infirmaries, to which the sick of all
                    classes and of every country are freely admitted. The autumnal season is, of all
                    others, that in which Madrid is, if not the most healthy, yet, on the whole, the
                    most agreeable residence. This city was the birthplace of the poet Lopez de la
                    Vega, in 1635; of Francisco de Quevedo Villegas, in 1647; and of Monso de
                    Erzilla, in 1590.</p>
