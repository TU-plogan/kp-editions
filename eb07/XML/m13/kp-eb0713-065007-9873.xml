                    learned writer and eminent lawyer of Scotland, was the grandson of Kenneth,
                    first Lord Mackenzie of Kintail, and the nephew of Colin and George, first and
                    second Earls of Seaforth. He was born at Dundee in 1636; and after passing
                    through the usual course of education in his own country, he was sent to the
                    university of Bourges, at that time denominated the Athens of lawyers, where he
                    remained three years. Young Scotchmen intended for the bar, having no sufficient
                    means of instruction in the Roman law at home, were then accustomed to frequent
                    the university of Bourges, as in later times they repaired to those of Utrecht
                    and Leyden. He was called to the bar in the year 1656, and had risen into
                    considerable practice before the Restoration. In a sketch of an eminent advocate
                    of that day, he has recorded his contempt for the <pb break="no"

                    prevailed in the courts of law, and to which even the most learned advocates,
                    whatever their own inclinations might have been, were obliged to conform.<note

                    Immediately after the Restoration he was appointed one of the justices-depute,
                    criminal judges who exercised that jurisdiction which was soon afterwards vested
                    in five lords of sessions, under the denomination of commissioners of
                    justiciary; and, in 1661, he and his colleagues were ordained by the parliament
                    “to repair, once in the week at least, to Musselburgh and Dalkeith, and to try
                    and judge such persons as are ther or therabouts delate of witchcraft ;” so much
                    more urgent did they deem the punishment of that imaginary offence than of any
                    other crime, however aggravated.</p>
                <p>Mackenzie’s name appears in the parliamentary proceedings as counsel in almost
                    every cause of importance; and his connection in that character with the Marquis
                    of Argyll gives no small weight to a passage in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs,</hi> respecting a circumstance in the trial of that nobleman, which
                    has been the subject of much historical controversy. Between the years 1663 and
                    1667 he was knighted. He represented the county of Ross during the four sessions
                    of the parliament which was called in 1669. In 1667, he had been appointed lord
                    advocate in the room of Sir John Nisbet, whom he describes, in one place, as “a
                    person of deep and universal learning,” and of whom, in another, he says, that
                    “in the conduct of causes he displayed the greatest learning and consummate
                    eloquence.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    character, implicated in all the worst acts of the Scotch administration of
                    Charles II.; a system of misgovernment which has only had one parallel in the
                    European portion of the British dominions. Having betrayed some repugnance,
                    however, to concur in those measures which openly and directly led to the
                    re-establishment of popery, he was removed from his office in 1686, and (which
                    is not a little remarkable) reinstated in 1688, when such measures were still
                    more avowedly pursued.</p>
                <p>At the Revolution he adhered to the fortunes of his royal master. Being elected a
                    member of the convention, he supported the pretensions of King James with
                    courage and ability, against Sir John Dalrymple and Sir James Montgomery, who
                    were the most considerable speakers of the Revolution party; and remaining in
                    his place even after the imprisonment of Balcarras and the escape of Dundee, he
                    was one of the minority of five in the memorable division respecting the
                    forfeiture of the crown.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Balcarras <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> in MS.</p></note> King William had
                    been solicited, by some eager partisans, to declare Mackenzie and a few others
                    incapable of holding any public office; but he refused to accede to the
                    proposal, in conformity to the maxims of that wise policy, which uniformly
                    induced him not to concur in those measures, even of just retribution, which, at
                    <hi rend="subscript"> ¼</hi> moments of violent internal change, are so apt to
                    degenerate into proscription and revenge. At this critical juncture, when the
                    crown, which one king was declared to have forfeited, 'was placed on the head of
                    another, and when his own fortunes were in jeopardy, Sir George Mackenzie
                    composed and delivered his inaugural address on the foundation of the library of
                    the Faculty of Advocates; a circumstance evincing no inconsiderable degree of
                    firmness and intrepidity. When the death of Dundee destroyed the hopes of his
                    party in Scotland, he took refuge in Oxford, the natural asylum of so learned
                    and inveterate a Tory. But, under the tolerant government of King William, he
                    appears to have enjoyed, in perfect security, his ample fortune, the fruit of
                    his professional labours. In Evelyn’s Diary (9th March 1690), we have an account
                    of the freedom which he indulged in conversation at the table of a prelate who
                    was a zealous supporter of the new government, “I dined,” says he, “at the
                    Bishop of St Asaph’s, almoner to the new queen, with the famous lawyer Sir G.
                    Mackenzie (late lord advocate of Scotland), against whom both the bishop and
                    myself had written and published books, both now most friendly reconciled. He
                    related to us many particulars of Scotland, the present sad condition of it, the
                    inveterate hatred which the presbyterians show to the family of the Stewarts,
                    and the exceeding tyranny of those bigots, who acknowledge no superior on earth
                    in civil or divine matters, maintaining that the people only have the right of
                    government, their implacable hatred to the Episcopal order and the Church of
                    England. He observed, that the first presbyter dissents from our discipline were
                    introduced by the Jesuits about the twentieth of Elizabeth; a famous Jesuit
                    among them feigning himself a Protestant, and who was the first who began to
                    pray extempory, and brought in that which they since called, and are still so
                    fond of, praying by the Spirit.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    absurd fictions, so gravely reported in the above extract, seem to countenance
                    the supposition that Sir George Mackenzie, knowing his men, had been making an
                    experiment on their credulity, and hoaxing both the bishop and Evelyn. It is
                    wonderful indeed that he did not represent John Knox as a disguised
                    jesuit.</p></note></p>
                <p>In the spring of 1691, Sir George Mackenzie went to London, where he contracted a
                    disorder which carried him off. He died in St James’s Street, on the 2d of May
                    1691; andjiís death is mentioned as that of an extraordinary person, by several
                    of those who recorded the events of their time. His body was conveyed by land to
                    Scotland, and interred with great pomp and splendour in Edinburgh; a
                    circumstance which shows how little the administration of William was disposed
                    to discourage the funeral honours paid to its most inflexible opponents. It may
                    also be mentioned, to the honour of the government, that, whilst the censorship
                    of the press still subsisted, he was allowed to publish his Vindication of the
                    Government of Scotland under Charles II.; a very inadequate defence, it must be
                    owned, but one, nevertheless, which a new prince, opposed by a powerful party in
                    the state, had some reason to dread.</p>
                <p>The writings of Sir George Mackenzie are literary, legal, and political. His
                    Miscellaneous Essays, both in prose and verse, may now be dispensed with, or
                    laid aside, without difficulty. They have not vigour enough for long life; but,
                    considered as the elegant amusements of a statesman and lawyer, they afford
                    evidence of the refinement of his taste and the variety of his accomplishments.
                    In several of his moral essays, both the subject and the manner betray an
                    imitation of Cowley, who was at that moment commencing the reformation of
                    English style. Like his master, he wrote in praise of solitude; and Evelyn, in a
                    confidential letter to Cowley, highly commends his merits as a writer. Nor would
                    it be just to the memory of Mackenzie to refrain from mentioning the
                    extraordinary praise bestowed on him by Dryden, the successor, but scarcely the
                    superior, of Cowley, in English prose.</p>
                <p>Sir George Mackenzie is one of the few British advocates who have published their
                    speeches delivered at the bar. In Scotland these are often called “pleadings,”
                    and in England “arguments,” when addressed to the judges on matters of law; but
                    they retain the general name of“speeches” when addressed to a jury, or to any
                    other popular body.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193209899" xml:id="kp-eb0713-9899-0652"/>
                <p>Mackenzie’s speeches evince considerable knowledge, ingenuity, and address, and
                    are never very defective except in those passages which aim at eloquence. In the
                    speech before the parliament for the Marquis of Argyll, the question, whether
                    passive compliance in public rebellion be punishable as treason, is treated with
                    no small ability.</p>
                <p>His work on the Laws and Customs jįf Scotland in Matters Criminal was published
                    in 1678, and is dedicated to the Duke of Lauderdale, to whom the author says,
                    “You are yourself the greatest statesman in Europe who is a scholar, and the
                    greatest scholar who is a statesman. You are the man who spends the one half of
                    the day studying what is just, and the other half in practising what is so !” At
                    that time the government of Scotland had no reason to complain of the want of
                    base compliance in juries, not one of which, during the eighteen years that had
                    elapsed since the Restoration, had ventured to rescue a single victim, however
                    innocent, from the clutches of power. But, even in the midst of this apparent
                    security, the acuteness of the Lord Advocate discovered the possibility that
                    independent juries might one day arise; he augured integrity at a distance,
                    scenting the approach of liberty in every refreshing gale; and hence, in the
                    work just named, he openly proposes the abolition of juries in criminal
                    causes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Part ii. title
                    23, of Assizes.</p></note> His reasonings are ingenious and plausible. He tells
                    us, that “now, when law is formed into a science, and that judges are presumed
                    to be learned and assizers not, it seems reasonable they should be supprest, as
                    well in criminal cases as they already are in civil.” The great and paramount
                    benefit of juries in criminal cases, namely, their power of shielding innocent
                    and virtuous men against the vengeance of power, is kept entirely out of view,
                    though doubtless it formed the sole motive for the project.</p>
                <p>The works of Sir George Mackenzie were published at Edinburgh in two volumes
                    folio, in 1716 and 1722. In the second volume there appears the following
                    advertisement: “Whereas in the list of the author’s manuscripts there is mention
                    made of an History of the Affairs of Scotland from the Restauration of King
                    Charles II. 1660, to the Eyear] 1691, which subscribers might have readily
                    looked for in this second volume; but that manuscript being in the hands of some
                    of the author’s relations, who think it not ready for the press until it be
                    carefully revised, they have reckoned it more proper to have it printed by way
                    of Appendix to this second volume, how soon they have it revised and transcribed
                    by a good hand.” For many years the History thus announced was supposed either
                    to have perished or to have been intentionally destroyed. The second Earl of
                    Bute, who supported the government of the House of Hanover, and had married the
                    sister of John duke of Argyll, the leader of the Whig party in Scotland,
                    enjoyed, in the year 1722, and probably possessed, his papers. It was not
                    unnatural, therefore, that he should be suspected, at that juncture, of
                    suppressing such a manuscript, more especially as his family, by conforming to
                    the Revolution, and accepting a title from Queen Anne, had rendered themselves
                    peculiarly obnoxious to the adherents of the House of Stuart. But, however
                    plausible these conjectures may have appeared, they have, in part at least, been
                    proved to be groundless. In the year 1817, a large mass of papers was sold to a
                    shopkeeper in Edinburgh. From these his curiosity led him to select a manuscript
                    volume which appeared to him to be something of an historical nature; and, by
                    another fortunate accident, he communicated it to the late Dr M‘Crie, who, on
                    examination, discovered that it was the composition of Sir George Mackenzie, and
                    formed part of that history of his own times which had so long been a
                    desideratum in Scottish literature. Of this the evidence was both obvious and
                    complete; for the manuscript, though written by one of the ordinary transcribers
                    of that age, was decisively identified by numerous corrections and additions in
                    the well-known handwriting of Sir George Mackenzie himself. The curious fragment
                    of Scottish history, thus happily recovered, was published at Edinburgh in 1821,
                    4to, under the editorial superintendence of Mr Thomas Thomson, who, in an able
                    and well-written preface, has related the singular circumstances in which the
                    manuscript was rescued from destruction. It is to be regretted, however, that
                    the portion thus published ends at the very time when the author’s means of
                    information became more ample. For many reasons, it would be highly desirable to
                    possess the sequel of these Memoirs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Essays; his mother was the eldest daughter of Mr Rose of Kilravock, of an

                    there, his talents induced a friend to solicit his remaining in London to
                    qualify himself for the English bar; but the wishes of his family, and the
                    moderation of his own unambitious mind, decided his return to Edinburgh; and
                    there he became, first partner of, and afterwards successor to, Mr Inglis, in
                    the office of attorney for the crown. When in London, he sketched some part of

                    which was published anonymously in 1771. The great popularity of this volume
                    gave occasion to a remarkable fraud on the part of a Mr Eccles of Bath, who,
                    taking advantage of the book being anonymous, laid claim to the authorship,
                    transcribed the whole in his own hand, with interlineations and corrections, and
                    maintained his right with such plausible pertinacity, that Messrs Cadell and
                    Strahan, Mr Mackenzie’s publishers, found it necessary to undeceive the public
                    by a formal contradiction. The <hi rend="italic">Man of the World</hi> was
                    published a few years after the <hi rend="italic">Man of Feeling,</hi> and
                    breathes the same tone of exquisite sensibility. In his first publication he
                    imagined a hero constantly obedient to every emotion of his moral sense. In the
                    <hi rend="italic">Man of the World</hi> he exhibited, on the contrary, a person
                    rushing headlong into vice and ruin, and spreading misery all around him, by
                    grasping at happiness in defiance of the moral sense. His next production was
                    <hi rend="italic">Julia de Roubigne,</hi> a novel in a series of letters. The
                    fable is very interesting, and the letters are written with great elegance and
                    propriety of style. In 1777 or 1778, a society of gentlemen in Edinburgh, mostly
                    lawyers, projected the publication of a series of papers on morals, manners,
                    taste, and literature, similar to those of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator-</hi>
                    This society, originally designated The Tabernacle, but afterwards The Mirror
                    Club, consisted of Mr Mackenzie, Mr Craig, Mr Cullen, Mr Bannatyne, Mr Macleod,
                    Mr Abercrombie, Mr Solicitor-General Blair, Mr George Home, and Mr George
                    Ogilvie, several of whom afterwards became judges in the Supreme Courts of
                    Scotland. Their scheme was speedily carried into effect, and the papers, under
                    the title of the <hi rend="italic">Mirror,</hi> of which Mr Mackenzie was the
                    editor, were published in weekly numbers, at the price of threepence per folio
                    sheet. The sale never <pb break="no" facs="nls:193209912"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-9912-0653"/>reached beyond three or four hundred in single
                    papers; but the whole, with the names of the respective authors, were
                    republished in three duodecimo volumes. From the price of the copyright, the
                    writers presented a donation of L.100 to the Orphan Hospital, and purchased a
                    hogshead of claret for the use of the club. To the <hi rend="italic">Mirror</hi>
                    succeeded the <hi rend="italic">Lounger·,</hi> a periodical of a similar
                    character, and equally successful. Mr Mackenzie was the most valuable
                    contributor to both these works. His papers are distinguished from all the rest
                    by that sweetness and beauty of style, and tenderness of feeling, which form the
                    peculiar character of his writings. In the <hi rend="italic">Lounger</hi> Mr
                    Mackenzie was the first to appreciate the genius of Burns, in a review of his
                    poems, then recently published, which at once drew the unknown poet from
                    obscurity into the full blaze of a fame that will never die. On the institution
                    of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Mr Mackenzie became one of its members; and
                    amongst the papers with which he enriched the volumes of its Transactions are,
                    an elegant tribute to the memory of his friend Judge Abercrombie, and a memoir
                    on German Tragedy, the latter of which bestows high praise on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Emilia Galotti</hi> of Lessing, and on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Robbers</hi> by Schiller. Whilst prosecuting his study of German literature, he
                    was induced to publish, in the year 1791, a small volume containing translations
                    of the Set of Horses by Lessing, and of two or three other dramatic pieces. Mr
                    Mackenzie was one of the original members of the Highland Society, and wrote the
                    accounts of the institution and principal proceedings of the society which
                    appear in their Transactions. In the Transactions of the same society he
                    published a view of the controversy respecting the poems of Ossian, in which he
                    attempted to vindicate their authenticity; and in the same paper gave a spirited
                    and interesting account of Gaelic poetry. In 1793 he wrote the Life of Dr
                    Blacklock, prefixed to the quarto edition of the works of the blind poet. In
                    1812 he read to the Royal Society a memoir of John Home, in which he gives a
                    sketch of the literary society of Edinburgh during the latter part of the last
                    century, with the great ornaments of which he lived in habits of friendly
                    intercourse.</p>
                <p>Mr Mackenzie was not so fortunate as a writer of dramas. Several of his plays
                    were brought out at different theatres, but, though possessed of considerable
                    merit as literary productions, they were not successful on the stage. He wrote
                    several political tracts, which procured him the countenance and respect of Mr
                    Pitt, and other illustrious statesmen of his time. Mr Mackenzie was not more
                    distinguished by the wit with which he enlivened a numerous circle of attached
                    friends, than the benevolence and wisdom with which he counselled and assisted
                    them. This ornament of his native city died at Edinburgh, at an advanced age,
                    rather from the decay of nature than from disease, on the 14th of January
                    1831.</p>
                <p>A complete edition of his works was published at Edinburgh, in eight volumes 8vo,
                    in 1808.</p>
