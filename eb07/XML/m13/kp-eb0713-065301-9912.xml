                <p><label type="entry">MACKINTOSH, <hi rend="smallcaps">the Right Honourable Sir
                    James</hi></label>, one of the most distinguished men of his time, and who
                    attained to great eminence in literature, philosophy, history, and politics, was
                    born at Aldourie, on the banks of Loch Ness, Scotland, on the 24th of October
                    1765. His father, Captain John Mackintosh, was the representative of a family
                    which had for above two centuries possessed a small estate called Kellachie, in
                    Inverness-shire. He had served long in the army, which he entered very young,
                    and had been severely wounded at the battle of Feling-hausen, in the Seven
                    Years’ War. His mother was Marjory Macgillivray, daughter of Mr Alexander
                    Macgillivray by Anne Fraser, sister of Brigadier-General Fraser, who was killed
                    in General Burgoyne’s army in 1777. His father joined his regiment at Antigua
                    sôon after his birth, and remained in that island and in Dublin for eight or
                    nine years. He was reared with great care and tenderness by his mother,
                    notwithstanding the anxiety and discomfort incident to the condition of one who
                    had no available resources of her own. His father, a subaltern and younger
                    brother, found his pay not too much for his own expenses; and all the kindness
                    of his mother’s family could not relieve the mind of that lady from the painful,
                    not to say humiliating, sense of dependence. This probably contributed to the
                    extreme affection which she cherished for her child. He depended upon her alone;
                    and as there is nothing which so much lightens the burden of receiving benefits
                    as the pleasure of conferring them, she loved him “with that fondness which we
                    are naturally disposed to cherish for the companion of our poverty.”</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1775, young Mackintosh was sefit to school at the town of
                    Fortrose, where he was placed under a master of the name of Smith. In a short
                    memoir of this early period of his life, he says, “I have little recollection of
                    the first two years at school but he had scarcely learned to read when he
                    evinced that predilection for abstract speculation which afterwards formed so
                    prominent a feature of his intellectual character. A gentleman of the name of
                    Mackenzie having· lent him Burnet’s Commentary on the Thirty-nine Articles, he
                    perused it with great avidity; “and I have now,” says he, writing many years
                    afterwards, “a distinct recollection of the great impression which it made.” But
                    the part which struck him most forcibly, and which he read with peculiar
                    eagerness and pleasure, was the commentary on the seventeenth article, which
                    relates to predestination; a strange subject to engage the attention and
                    interest the understanding of a mere boy. “I remember,” says he, “Mr Mackenzie
                    pointing out to me, that though the bishop abstained from giving his own opinion
                    on that subject in the commentary, he had intimated that opinion not obscurely
                    in the preface, when he says that ‘ he was of the opinion of the Greek church,
                    from which St Austin departed.’” He was of course profoundly ignorant of what
                    the Greek church was, and knew nothing of St Austin’s deviations; but the
                    mysterious magnificence of this phrase had an extraordinary effect upon his
                    imagination. His mind appears to have revolted at the doctrine of eternal
                    decrees of election and reprobation; though surrounded by orthodox Calvinists,
                    he became a warm advocate for free will; and before he had completed his
                    fourteenth year, he was probably the boldest heretic in the county. About the
                    same time he read the old translation of Plutarch’s Lives, and Echard’s Roman
                    History, which led him into “a ridiculous habit,” which afterwards clung to him,
                    of building castles in the air. During his vacations, which he spent at his
                    grandmother’s house, he read such books as fell in his way, and amongst these
                    the works of Pope and Swift. His first poetical attempt was a pastoral or elegy
                    on the death of his uncle Brigadier-General Fraser, who fell on the 7th of
                    October 1777; butin 1779 and 1780 his muse was exceedingly prolific, and he even
                    commenced an epic poem on the defence of Cyprus by Evagoras, king of Salamis,
                    against the Persian army.</p>
                <p>In October 1780 he went to college at Aberdeen, where he remained during that and
                    the three .following sessions. On entering King’s College, he was admitted into
                    the Greek class, then taught by Mr Leslie, who, however, did not attempt to do
                    more than teach the first rudiments of the language. The second winter,
                    according to the scheme of education then pursued, he fell under the tuition of
                    Mr Dunbar,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Author of <hi
                    rend="italic">Essays on the History of Mankind.</hi></p></note> and remained
                    under the care of this gentleman until he left college. At Aberdeen he was by
                    common <pb break="no" facs="nls:193209925" xml:id="kp-eb0713-9925-0654"/>consent

                    whilst his courteous demeanour, refined manners, playful fancy, and easy flow of
                    elocution, rendered him a general favourite amongst his companions. His chief
                    associate at King’s College was the late Reverend Robert Hall, whom the
                    exclusive system of the English universities had forced to seek, in this
                    northern seminary, for Aat academical education which was denied to him, as a
                    dissenter, in his own country. Like Castor and Pollux, these young men were
                    assimilated in the minds of all who knew them, by reason of the equal splendour
                    of their talents, although in other respects they were extremely unlike. They
                    were of the same intellectual stature, but differently moulded; the one being
                    remarkable for gracefulness of manners and symmetry of powers, with much
                    elegance and refinement; the other plainer, and withal less polished, but
                    distinguished for perfect sincerity, ardent piety, and undeviating love of
                    truth. The society and conversation of Hall had great influence on Mackintosh’s
                    mind. Their controversies were almost unceasing. Even at this early period, Hall
                    “displayed the same acuteness and brilliancy, the same extraordinary vigour both
                    of understanding and imagination, which have since distinguished him, and which
                    would have secured to him much more of the admiration of the learned and the
                    elegant, if he had not consecrated his genius to the far nobler office of
                    instructing and reforming the poor.”</p>
                <p>, In the spring of 1784, having previously taken his degree of master of arts, he
                    finally quitted King’s College, “with,” he says, “but little regular and exact
                    knowledge, but with considerable activity of mind, and boundless literary
                    ambition and in the October following he set out for Edinburgh to commence the
                    study of physic, which he had made choice of as a profession. His arrival in
                    that city opened a new world to his mind. Edinburgh was then the residence of
                    many eminent men; of Adam Smith, Dr Black, John Home, Henry Mackenzie, Dr
                    Cullen, Principal Robertson, Dr Ferguson, Dr Hutton, Professor Robison, Mr
                    Dugald Stewart, and others; and although his age did not allow him to be much
                    acquainted with these celebrated persons, yet accident furnished him with
                    opportunities of access to some of them, whilst the concentration of so much
                    genius and talent produced a powerful impression on his ardent and susceptible
                    nature. His speculative turn of mind, however, soon betrayed itself. Within a
                    few weeks after his arrival in Edinburgh, he became a zealous partisan of Brown,
                    who had just become a teacher of medicine, and the founder of a new medical
                    system; and having been elected a member of the Medical Society, he, in a few
                    months, “before he could have distinguished bark from James’s powder, or a
                    pleurisy from a dropsy in the chamber of a sick patient,” discussed with the
                    utmost fluency and confidence the most difficult questions in the science of
                    medicine. But he had soon an opportunity of displaying his peculiar talents on a
                    theatre better fitted for the exercise of his powers. He was admitted a member
                    of the Speculative Society, which had been established about twenty years
                    before, and, during that period, numbered amongst its members all the
                    distinguished youth in Scotland, besides many foreigners attracted to Edinburgh
                    by the fame of its medical school. In this society, which had general literature
                    and science for its objects, he found some congenial spirits, of whom he has
                    left very graphic sketches, particularly Malcolm Laing the historian, John
                    Wilde, afterwards professor of the civil law in the university of Edinburgh,
                    Benjamin Constant, Adam Gillies, now Lord Gillies, and several other young men,
                    who afterwards rose to eminence or attained distinction in different pursuits.
                    In this exciting atmosphere, speculation rather than study engrossed his
                    attention. Youth, the season of humble diligence and laborious application, was
                    wasted, as he himself complains, in vast, vain, and fruitless projects.
                    Speculators indeed are seldom submissive learners. Those who will make
                    proficieney in useful knowledge, must for a time trust to their teachers, and
                    believe in their superiority; but those who too early think for themselves must
                    sometimes imagine themselves wiser than their masters; and hence docility is
                    often extinguished when the work of education is scarcely commenced. After three
                    years spent in irregular application, he became a candidate for a degree; and
                    having obtained his diploma, he quitted Edinburgh in the month of September
                    1787, with a large stock of miscellaneous information, acquired by habitual
                    though desultory reading, but without having concentrated his powers upon any
                    one pursuit, or given to professional subjects that systematic and methodical
                    attention which is indispensable to the attainment of professional eminence.</p>
                <p>Early in 1788, he set out for London, accompanied by one of his college friends,
                    and arrived on that great theatre of action at a moment sufficiently distracting
                    for one of more advanced age and more settled pursuits. An ardent enthusiast for
                    political amelioration, he came in contact with society when it was already
                    heaving with the first throes of that great convulsion which was soon to
                    overturn all the institutions of a neighbouring country, and to shake those of
                    every other to their lowest foundations. To a young man like Mr Mackintosh, a
                    period of such excitement had irresistible allurements. He had cultivated habits
                    of public speaking, both at Aberdeen and at Edinburgh; he was fond of moral and
                    political controversy, rather perhaps as an exercise of the reasoning powers
                    than with any view to the formation of settled opinions; he found, on the
                    subject of politics, the boldest speculations in which his mind had been
                    engaged, about to receive a practical application; and he longed to mingle in
                    the discussions, if not to take part in the scenes, which distinguished that
                    memorable time. Still his views were, in the first instance at least, directed
                    to the medical profession; and he was led from circumstances to contemplate a
                    medical appointment in Russia. But this project, in which he was supported by Mr
                    Dugald Stewart, did not take effect; and it is probable that he felt but little
                    regret at the failure of a scheme which would have removed him from such a scene
                    of interest and enjoyment as London then presented. In the same year, his
                    father’s death freed him from the little control which a soldier of careless and
                    social habits had attempted to exercise over a studious youth; and, as the
                    succession to <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> his paternal estate of Kellachie
                    brought with it but little advantage to his means, his habitual profusion in
                    money matters soon involved him in pecuniary difficulties. His next step was one
                    which seemed but little calculated to diminish them. On the 18th of February
                    1789, he was privately married to Miss Catharine Stuart, a young lady of a
                    respectable Scotch family; and at the age of twenty-four he found himself with
                    no prospect of any immediate professional settlement, his little fortune rapidly
                    diminishing, and a wife to provide for.</p>
                <p>The struggle regarding the regency that followed the announcement of the malady
                    with which the king had been attacked in the autumn of 1788, was the occasion of
                    a pamphlet by Mr Mackintosh, in support of the analogy which Mr Fox endeavoured
                    to establish between the actual state of his majesty and a natural demise of the
                    crown. This seems to have been his first public appearance in the field of
                    politics, for which his mind had now taken a decided turn. About the same time
                    he made the acquaintance of Horne Tooke, whose cause he warmly espoused at the
                    election for Westminster, and in whose rich and lively but sarcastic
                    conversation, he always took great delight. Another effort to establish himself
                    in practice as <pb break="no" facs="nls:193209938" xml:id="kp-eb0713-9938-0655"
                    />a physician proved unavailing, probably from his distaste for his profession,
                    and his unwillingness to leave London, which he considered as the grand theatre
                    for talent and ambition. In the autumn of 1789, he made a tour, in company with
                    his wife, through the Low Countries to Brussels; and, upon his return to London,
                    contributed a number of articles on Belgium and France to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oracle</hi> newspaper, with which he appears to have been for some time
                    connected. To the same date must be referred his resolution to devote himself to
                    the study of the law. Hitherto the exercise of his powers had been almost
                    exclusively confined to the columns of a newspaper; but although the most
                    successful efforts of ability are often passed unheeded, or make but a feeble
                    and transitory impression where such are neither looked for nor expected, yet
                    this preliminary training was not without its advantage, and the time now
                    approached when he was to appear before the world in a higher and more
                    independent character.</p>
                <p>The extraordinary impression produced by the publica tion of Mr Burke’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Refiections on the French Revolution,</hi> the admiration excited
                    by the work in some quarters, and the vehement indignation with which it was
                    greeted in others, are matters of universal notoriety. By some it was regarded
                    as the most marvellous union of wisdom and genius that had ever appeared in the
                    world, whilst to others it seemed inconsistent with the former life and opinions
                    of the author, notwithstanding that an abhorrence for abstract politics, a
                    predilection for aristocracy, and a dread of innovation, had always been
                    articles of his political creed. The former magnified the sense of public duty
                    which prompted, first the sacrifice of the long-cherished friendship of Mr Fox,
                    ’ and then the publication of what they considered as the earnest admonitions of
                    matured wisdom. The latter, mistaking the real principles of the author, imputed
                    to him an inconsistency with which he was not really chargeable; and, whilst
                    they endeavoured to refute his reasonings and deride his prognostications,
                    branded him as a deserter of the principles he had once professed. The number of
                    antagonists who hurried to break a lance against the champion of existing
                    institutions proved the estimation in which he was held; a multitude of
                    pamphlets appeared, and each shade of opinion was warmly defended against the
                    common enemy of all change. The great majority of these productions, however,
                    soon fell into oblivion. But Paine’s <hi rend="italic">Rights of Man</hi> was
                    not destined to perish so speedily. His strong sense, bold dogmatism, and coarse
                    but vigorous sarcasm, conveyed in a style instinctively popular, made him a
                    dangerous enemy at all times, but more especially at a period when the new
                    principles of liberty had found favour with the people, and when the great
                    masses of the middle and lower orders were to be appealed to in defence of them.
                    But whilst Mr Burke was sustaining the attack of the man who had been his
                    fellow-combatant in the American contest for freedom, “a bolt was shot from
                    amongst the undistinguished crowd, but with a force which showed the vigour of
                    no common arm.” The <hi rend="italic">Vindiciae Gallicae</hi> was published in
                    April 1791. It had been finished in a great hurry, but, with all its
                    imperfections and defects, it at once placed the author in the first rank of the
                    party in this country who were upholding the cause of France. He was courted and
                    caressed on all hands, his company was eagerly sought for, and, as he himself
                    expressed it, he was for a few months the lion of the place. In the mean time,
                    the sale of the book exceeded his most sanguine expectations; three editions
                    followed one another with great rapidity; it was quoted in the debates in
                    parliament, eulogised by Mr Fox, and even commended by Mr Burke, for whose
                    genius Mr Mackintosh entertained a chivalrous admiration. In a word, the
                    execution of the work answered every expectation which had been formed of the
                    author; and though he saw occasion afterwards to modify some, if not many, of
                    the opinions expressed in it, yet it is impossible not to acknowledge that it
                    deserved the favour and applause with which it was received by the friends of
                    popular liberty.</p>
                <p>In Michaelmas term 1795, Mr Mackintosh was called to the bar, and attached
                    himself to the home circuit. Having thus entered upon a path which, when pursued
                    by the patient steps of genius and industry, so often leads to wealth and
                    distinction, he evidently enjoyed the satisfaction which arises from having in
                    view a constant and honourable occupation. But a severe affliction awaited him
                    in the death of his wife, which took place early in 1797; whilst slowly
                    recovering from the birth of a child, Mrs Mackintosh was attacked by a fever, to
                    which she soon fell a victim, leaving three daughters. In 1799 Mr Mackintosh
                    formed the plan of giving lectures upon the law of nature and of nations. The
                    benchers of Lincoln’s Inn granted him the use of their hall, and he commenced
                    his course by an exposition of the general aim and scope of the undertaking, as
                    well as of the views and feelings which had led him to embark in it. In the
                    introductory lecture, after an eloquent vindication of the term “law of nature,”
                    and a review of the works of the different masters of the science, exhibiting
                    its progress (in which the character of Grotius is delineated in a manner worthy
                    of his great learning and genius), the subject is marked out into six great
                    divisions, viz. <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> an analysis of the nature and
                    operations of the human mind; <hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi> the relative
                    duties of private life; <hi rend="italic">thirdly,</hi> the relations of subject
                    and sovereign, citizen and magistrate, the foundation of political liberty and
                    political rights; <hi rend="italic">fourthly,</hi> the municipal law, civil and
                    criminal, exemplified by the progress of the codes of Rome and of England; <hi
                    rend="italic">fifthly,</hi> the law of nations strictly so called, or the
                    science which regulates the application of the sanctions of private morality to
                    the great commonwealth of nations; and, <hi rend="italic">lastly,</hi> a survey
                    of the diplomatic and conventional law of Europe. This discourse, which the
                    lecturer was induced to publish, had no sooner issued from the press than
                    commendations poured in upon him from every quarter. Mr Pitt, Lord Loughborough,
                    Dr Parr, and others, united their suffrages in its praise; and it must be
                    confessed, that if Mackintosh had published nothing else than this discourse, he
                    would have left a striking monument of his intellectual strength and symmetry.
                    His political opinions, indeed, had undergone a considerable change, and as the
                    tone of these lectures differed materially from that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vindiciae Gallicae,</hi> and of the <hi rend="italic">Letter to</hi><hi
                    rend="italic underline"> Mr</hi><hi rend="italic">Pitt,</hi> this circumstance,
                    together with the support ostentatiously given to them by the ministers of the
                    day and their connections, served to alienate from him several of his old
                    political friends, and to beget suspicions for which there existed no solid
                    foundation. At the same time, it may be conjectured that the friendship and
                    correspondence of Mr Burke, and the warm commendations of Mr Pitt, may have
                    unconsciously had some influence on his mind; and that the change to which we
                    have alluded, and which he himself was too honest not to acknowledge, may not be
                    altogether imputable to horror at the excesses which disgraced the cause of
                    liberty in France, and disappointment at not seeing it established so speedily
                    and purely as he had anticipated.</p>
                <p>We come now to an event of great importance in the life of Mr Mackintosh; we mean
                    the trial of Μ. Peltier, an emigrant royalist, for a libel on the First Consul
                    of France. The circumstances which led to this memorable trial, the extreme
                    novelty or rather singularity of the case, its immediate connection with the
                    state of political feeling which then prevailed, and the importance which was
                    generally attached to the result, are too well known to require any
                    specification in this place. It is sufficient to observe, that the address
                    delivered by Mr Mackintosh, as counsel for the accused, formed one of the most
                    splendid displays of eloquence ever exhibited in a court of justice<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193209951" xml:id="kp-eb0713-9951-0656"/>, and that it
                    will, beyond all doubt, maintain its place amongst the few efforts of forensic
                    oratory which have survived the occasions that produced them, and are preserved
                    as models for future artists in the same line. <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">I</hi> perfectly approve of the verdict,” said Mr, afterwards Lord
                    Erskine; “but the manner in which you opposed it, I shall always consider as one
                    of the most splendid monuments of genius, learning, and eloquence.” Similar
                    testimonies of applause were bestowed by other distinguished persons; and it was
                    admitted on all hands, that, by this single effort, Mr Mackintosh had suddenly
                    raised himself to the very highest rank amongst forensic orators. This trial
                    took place on the 21 st of February 1803, and, some months afterwards, Mr
                    Mackintosh was appointed to the office of recorder of Bombay, vacant by the
                    death of Sir William Syer. Mr Addington, the first minister of the crown, had
                    been previously made acquainted with Mr Mackintosh’s wishes in relation to an
                    appointment in India; and these were now seconded by the friendly zeal of Mr
                    Canning and Mr (afterwards Lord Chief Commissioner) Adam, to whose exertions the
                    appointment must in a great measure be attributed. In taking this step, he was
                    probably influenced by two considerations; first, the comparative ease which it
                    would immediately secure to him; and, secondly, the amount of the salary, which,
                    he believed, might in a few years enable him (as it would if prudence had been
                    amongst the number of his virtues) to accumulate a sum which, in addition to the
                    retired allowance, would render him independent, give him the entire command of
                    his time, and enable him to pursue the course of life best suited to his
                    inclinations. But the hopes of men are often as vain as their calculations are
                    sanguine, and outrun even the consciousness of their own failings. Upon his
                    appointment, he received the customary honour of knighthood, and, early in 1804,
                    sailed with his family for India.</p>
                <p>For an account of his life during the eight years which he spent in India, it is
                    only necessary to refer the reader to the Memoirs of his Life, published by his
                    son; a work which, independently of the interest attaching to the principal
                    subject, will be read with instruction and delight on account of the infinite
                    variety of original thoughtsand fine observations with which it abounds. His
                    time, indeed, appears to have been divided between the discharge of his judicial
                    duties, literary occupations somewhat irregularly pursued, correspondence with
                    his numerous friends in Europe, and occasional excursions into different parts
                    of the country. The experiment, however, was not successful, in as far as
                    regarded the views which had induced him to solicit the appointment. For,
                    although we now know that his mind was in a state of great vigour and activity
                    during the whole of his residence in India, yet he was not enabled to
                    accomplish, indeed scarcely to commence, any of the great works he had
                    contemplated; whilst his habitual inattention to economy prevented any great
                    improvement in the state of his worldly affairs. The consequence was, that he
                    returned to England in 1812, with broken health and spirits, uncertain
                    prospects, and vast materials for works which were never to be completed.</p>
                <p>Mr Percival was now at the head of the government, and, almost immediately on his
                    arrival, endeavoured to secure the support of Sir James, by offering him a seat
                    in parliament, and an early promotion to the head of the Board of Control. These
                    tempting offers, however, he declined, as inconsistent with those principles of
                    liberty “which were then higher in his mind than twenty years before.” But he
                    was almost immediately returned on the Whig interest, as member for the county
                    of Nairn. After this, his life scarcely admits of any detailed abstract. He
                    continued in parliament, and true to liberal principles, for the remainder of
                    his days. In 1818, he was appointed professor of law at Hayleybury, and resigned
                    that situation in 1827. He had contemplated a similar appointment at Edinburgh,
                    which, unhappily for the fame of the metropolitan university of Scotland, did
                    not take place. He contributed articles of great value to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edinburgh Review</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in a Preliminary Discourse to
                    this work, being the second in order, furnished by far the best history of
                    ethical philosophy that has ever been given to the world, and which has been
                    reprinted in an octavo size, with a valuable preface by Professor Whewell of
                    Cambridge. To Sir Samuel Romilly, in his exertions for the improvement of the
                    criminal law, he gave the most efficient and zealous support; and, after the
                    death of that virtuous lawyer, became the leader in that most necessary and
                    unexceptionable branch of reform. After printing several volumes of a popular
                    and abridged History of England, which contains more thought and more lessons of
                    wisdom than any other history with which we are acquainted, he left, at his
                    death, the invaluable fragment of the History of the Revolution of 1688, of
                    which a very masterly account will be found in the sixty-second volume of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review.</hi> Under Lord Grey’s administration, in
                    1830, he was appointed to a seat at the Board of Control, and cordially
                    co-operated in all the great measures of reform which were then brought forward,
                    and carried after a severe struggle. He died in 1832, regretted with more
                    sincerity, and admired with less envy, than any man of his age. In him, perhaps
                    more than in any man of his time, was exemplified that <hi rend="italic">mitis
                    sapientia,</hi> which formed the distinguishing attribute of the illustrious
                    friend of Cicero, and which wins its way into the heart, whilst it at once
                    enlightens and satisfies the understanding.</p>
                <p>With regard to the intellectual character of Sir James Mackintosh, we cannot do
                    better than quote the words in which the able writer who reviewed the Memoirs of
                    his Life by his son, in that journal to which he was so valuable a contributor,
                    has described, or rather pourtrayed it. “His intellectual character cannot be
                    unknown to any one acquainted with his works, or who has even read many pages of
                    the Memoirs now before us; and it is needless, therefore, to speak here of his
                    great knowledge, the singular union of ingenuity and soundness in his
                    speculations—his perfect candour and temper in discussion—the pure and lofty
                    morality to which he strove to elevate the minds of others, and in his own
                    conduct to conform, or the wise and humane allowance which he was ready, in
                    every case but his own, to make for the infirmities which must always draw down
                    so many from the higher paths of their duty. These merits, we believe, will no
                    longer be denied by any who have heard of his name or looked at his writings.
                    But there were other traits of his intellect, which could only be known to those
                    who were of his acquaintance, and which it is still desirable that the readers
                    of these Memoirs should bear in mind. One of these was that ready and prodigious
                    memory, by which all that he learned seemed to be at once engraved on the proper
                    compartment of his mind, and to present itself at the moment it was required;
                    another, still more remarkable, was the singular maturity and completeness of
                    all his views and opinions, even upon the most abstruse and complicated
                    questions, though raised, without design or preparation, in the casual course of
                    conversation. In this way it happened that the sentiments he delivered had
                    generally the air of recollections—and that few of those with whom he most
                    associated in mature life could recollect of ever catching him in the act of
                    making up his mind in the course of the discussions in which it was his delight
                    to engage them. His conclusions, and the grounds of them, seemed always to have
                    been previously considered and digested; and though he willingly developed his
                    reasons, to secure the assent of his hearers, he uniformly seemed to have been
                    perfectly ready, before the cause was called on, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193209964" xml:id="kp-eb0713-9964-0657"/>to have delivered the opinion
                    of the court, with a full summary of the arguments and evidence on both sides.
                    In the work before us, we have more pceps into the preparatory deliberations of
                    his great intellect—that scrupulous estimate of the grounds of decision, and
                    that jealous questioning of first impressions, which necessarily precede the
                    formation of all firm and wise opinions,—than could probably be collected from
                    the recollections of all those who had most familiar access to him in society.
                    It was owing perhaps to this vigour and rapidity of intellectual digestion that,
                    though all his life a great talker, there never was a man that talked half so
                    much, who said so little that was either foolish or frivolous; nor any one
                    perhaps who knew so well how to give as much liveliness and poignancy to the
                    most just and even profound observations as others could ever impart to
                    startling extravagance and ludicrous exaggeration. The vast extent of his
                    information, and the natural gaiety of his temper, made him independent of such
                    devices for producing effect, and, joined to the inherent kindness and
                    gentleness of his disposition, made his conversation at once the most
                    instructive and the most generally pleasing that could be imagined.”</p>
                <p>We cannot deny ourselves the satisfaction of adorning this meagre notice with
                    another citation from the same admirable article, in which the writer replies to
                    and exposes the depreciatory judgment of Mr Coleridge. The passage is severe,
                    but not more so than the occasion and the aggression seemed to require. “In the
                    <hi rend="italic">Table Talk</hi> of the late Mr Coleridge, we find these words,
                    ‘1 doubt if Mackintosh ever heartily appreciated an eminently original man.
                    After all his fluency and brilliant erudition, you can rarely carry off anything
                    worth preserving. You might not improperly write upon his forehead, Warchouse to
                    let.’ W <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> e wish to speak tenderly of a man of
                    genius, and, we believe, of amiable dispositions, who has been so
                    recentlyrerhoved from his friends and admirers. But so portentous a misjudgment
                    as this, and coming from such a quarter, cannot be passed over without notice.
                    If Sir James Mackintosh had any talent more conspicuous and indisputable than
                    another, it was that of appreciating the merits of eminent and original men. His
                    great learning and singular soundness of judgment enabled him to do this truly;
                    while his kindness of nature, his zeal for human happiness, and his perfect
                    freedom from prejudice and vanity, prompted him, above most other men, to do it
                    heartily. As a proof, we would merely refer our readers to his admirable
                    character of Lord Bacon <hi rend="italic">{Edinburgh Review,</hi> No. 53, vol.
                    xxvii.). And then, as to his being a person from whose conversation little could
                    be carried away, why, the most characteristic and remarkable thing about it was,
                    that the whole of it might be carried away—it was so lucid, precise, and
                    brilliantly perspicuous. The joke of the ‘ Warchouse to let’ is not, we confess,
                    quite level to our capacities. It can scarcely mean (though that is the most
                    obvious sense) that the head was empty, as that is inconsistent with the rest
                    even of this splenetic delineation. If it was intended to insinuate that it was
                    ready for the indiscriminate reception of anything which any one might choose to
                    put into it, there could not be a more gross misconception, as we have, no doubt
                    Mr Coleridge must often have sufficiently experienced. And by whom is this
                    discovery, that Mackintosh’s conversation presented nothing that could be
                    carried away, thus confidently announced? Why, by the very individual against
                    whose own oracular and interminable talk the same complaint has been made, by
                    friends and by foes, and with an unanimity unprecedented, for the last forty
                    years. The admiring, or rather idolizing, nephew, who has lately put forth this
                    hopeful specimen of his relics, has recorded in the preface, that ‘ his
                    conversation at all times required attention; and that the demand on the
                    intellect of the hearer was often very great; and that when he got into his
                    “huge circuit” and large illustrations, most people had lost him, and naturally
                    enough supposed that he had lost himself.’ Nay, speaking to this very point, of
                    the ease or difficulty of carrying away any definite notions from what· he said,
                    the partial kinsman is pleased to inform us, that, with all his familiarity with
                    the style of his relative, he himself has often gone away, after listening to
                    him for several delightful hours, with divers masses of reasoning in his head,
                    but without being able to perceive what connection they had with each other. ‘
                    In such eases,’ he adds, ‘ I have mused, <hi rend="italic">sometimes even for
                    days afterwards,</hi> upon the words, till at length, spontaneously as it were,
                    the fire would kindle,’ &amp;c. And this is the person who is pleased to
                    denounce Sir James Mackintosh as an ordinary man; and especially to object to
                    his conversation, that, though brilliant and fluent, there was rarely anything
                    in it which could be carried away.</p>
                <p>“An attack so unjust and so arrogant leads naturally to comparisons which it
                    would be easy to follow out, to the signal discomfiture of the party attacking.
                    But without going beyond what is thus forced upon our notice, we shall only say,
                    that nothing could possibly set the work before us in so favourable a point of
                    view as a comparison between it and the volumes of <hi rend="italic">Table
                    Talk,</hi> to which we have already made reference—unless, perhaps, it were the
                    contrast of the two minds which are respectively pourtrayed in these
                    publications.</p>
                <p>“In these memorials of Sir James Mackintosh, we trace throughout, the workings of
                    a powerful and unclouded intellect, nourished by wholesome learning, raised and
                    instructed by fearless though reverent questionings of the sages of other times
                    (which is the permitted necromancy of the wise), exercised by free discussion
                    with the most distinguished among the living, and made acquainted with its own
                    strength and weakness, not only by a constant intercourse with other powerful
                    minds, but by mixing, with energy and deliberation, in practical business and
                    affairs; and here pouring itself out in a delightful miscellany of elegant
                    criticism, original speculation, and profound practical suggestions on politics,
                    religion, history, and all the greater and the lesser duties, the arts and the
                    elegancies of life—all expressed with a beautiful clearness and tempered
                    dignity—breathing the purest spirit of goodwill to mankind—and brightened not
                    merely by an ardent hope, but an assured faith in their constant advancement in
                    freedom, intelligence, and virtue.</p>
                <p>“On all these points, the <hi rend="italic">Table Talkoĩ</hi> his poetical
                    contemporary appears to us to present a most mortifying contrast; and to render
                    back merely the image of a moody mind, incapable of mastering its own
                    imaginings, and constantly seduced by them, or by a misdirected ambition, to
                    attempt impracticable things—naturally attracted by dim paradoxes rather than
                    lucid truth, and preferring, for the most part, the obscure and neglected parts
                    of learning to those that are useful and clear—marching, in short, at all times,
                    under the exclusive guidance of the Pillar of Smoke —and, like the body of its
                    original followers, wandering all his days in the desert, without ever coming in
                    sight of the promised land.” <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
