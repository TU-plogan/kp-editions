                    eminent biographer and divine, was born at Dunse, in North Britain, in the month
                    of November 1772. His parents belonged to the class of Seceders known in
                    Scotland as Antiburghers, and he was educated with a view to the ministry in
                    that persuasion. After passing through the ordinary course of education afforded
                    in a country town, he came to Edinburgh, and enrolled himself as a student in
                    the university, in the winter of 1788.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Matriculation books of the University—At this time he wrote
                    his name M ’ Crie; and in strict arrangement this article belonged to a former
                    sheet.</p></note> During that and the two following sessions he pursued the
                    course of literary and philosophical study prescribed to students intending to
                    devote themselves to the ministry; and in 1791, he entered the theological class
                    at Whitburn, under the Rev. Archibald Bruce, the teacher or professor of
                    divinity to the Associate Antiburgher Synod. As the attendance upon this course
                    was only for a limited period each year, it was usual for the students, whose
                    means were generally very scanty, to employ the intervals in teaching. In this
                    way Mr M‘Crie, in the autumn of 1791, proceeded to Brechin, and opened a school
                    in connection with the Associate Antiburgher congregation in that town; and he
                    continued there, excepting the time annually required at Whitburn in the three
                    following sessions (1792 to 1794) for completing the regular course of
                    theological study.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of 1795, Mr M‘Crie was licensed to preach by the presbytery of
                    Kelso. In the beginning of the next year, he received a call from the Second
                    associate congregation of Antiburghers in Edinburgh; and some scruples having
                    been obviated by an act of the Associate <pb break="no" facs="nls:193210003"

                    charge on the 26th of that month.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    meeting-house in the Potterrow was erected in 1792; but they enjoyed the
                    advantage of a settled minister only when Mr M‘Crie was ordained. The sermon and
                    address at his ordination, 26th May 1796, form part of a volume (pp. 164-202) of
                    “Sermons preached on different occasions, by Robert Chalmers, minister of the
                    Gospel at Haddington.” Edinburgh, 1798, 12mo, pp. 440.</p></note> In this
                    pastoral relationship he continued for upwards of ten years, evidently with the
                    sincere attachment of his people.</p>
                <p>At this period, Mr M‘Crie, by diligent and assiduous study, was acquiring that
                    profound theological knowledge, and that fund of literary and ecclesiastical
                    information, for which, in after life, he was so distinguished. The proceedings
                    of the religious body with whom he was connected may also have had some effect
                    in directing his pursuits towards subjects connected with the history,
                    constitution, and polity of the reformed church. Yet, excepting a missionary
                    sermon, which was published in 1797, at the special request of his
                    congregation,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“The Duty

                    articles, of an earlier date, in a periodical work entitled “The Christian
                    Magazine, or Evangelical Repository,” may have proceeded from his pen.<note

                    editors, the Reverend George Whytock, Dalkeith, having died about the end of
                    1805, Mr M <hi rend="superscript"> ς</hi> Crie became the sole editor of the
                    volume for 1806; but a variety of circumstances led to its discontinuance, and a
                    new series was commenced in January 1807, chiefly under the auspices of his
                    brethren from whom he had separated, as stated above.</p></note> To this

                    1803, “The History of the New Testament confirmed and illustrated by passages of
                    Josephus, the Jewish historian;” “Memoir of Mr John Murray, minister of

                    England and Foreign Parts, during the sixteenth century.”</p>
                <p>We have been particular in enumerating the titles of the above articles, as they
                    show very distinctly the peculiar bent of Mr M‘Crie’s mind, at this early
                    period, towards subjects illustrative of the history and progress of the
                    Reformation throughout Europe, and of the biography of eminent martyrs and
                    reformers; in fact, containing the germs of most of his subsequent
                    publications.</p>
                <p>We have now arrived at a point in Mr M‘Crie’s history, which makes it necessary
                    to advert to the proceedings of the Associate Synod. But to enter into such
                    minute details as might render the subject sufficiently intelligible to a
                    general reader, would not only occupy too much space, but might seem to be
                    misplaced in this work. Yet it would be false delicacy, even in a sketch of his
                    literary life like the present, to pass in silence the results of such
                    proceedings; and the more so, as his conduct, in the painful situation in which
                    he was placed, displayed no small degree of Christian resignation and fortitude,
                    and evinced that he was sustained by a sense of duty and high-minded principle.
                    Suffice it then to say, that Mr M‘Crie was one of five ministers<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The other members were, the
                    Rev. Archibald Bruce, Whitburn; Rev. George Whytock, Dalkeith; Rev. James
                    Aitken, Kirrymuir; and the Rev. James Hog, Kelso. Mr Whytock died in October
                    1805, nearly twelve months before the Synod proceeded to extremities. The other
                    protestors were afterwards joined by the Rev. Robert Chalmers,
                    Haddington.</p></note> who felt themselves constrained to resist and protest
                    against what they considered to be a spirit of innovation on the part of the
                    Synod, while engaged in the révisai and enlargement of the Judicial Act and
                    Testimony, which had hitherto served as the bond of ministerial and religious
                    communion, in order, as it was expressed, to adapt it “more to the circumstances
                    of the present time.” It need only be stated, that the chief points of
                    difference related to the apparent abandonment by the Synod of some important
                    principles of the Judicial Act and Testimony,—more especially the received
                    doctrine on the connection between church and state, the power of the civil
                    magistrate in matters of religion, and the lawfulness and perpetual obligation
                    of our national covenants,—points which had hitherto been maintained by the
                    members of Secession. In this révisai the Synod continued at their half-yearly
                    meetings, until it was completed in April 1804, and published under the title of
                    “Narrative and Testimony agreed upon and enacted by the General Associate
                    Synod,” &amp;c. This contained, first, “A Narrative of the State of Religion in
                    Britain and Ireland, from the period of the Reformation to the present time,”
                    including a history of the Secession Church, and a view “Of the progressive
                    Defections of the Established Church of Scotland and, secondly, the Testimony,
                    or Declaration, under several heads, of the doctrinal sentiments professed by
                    the Associate Synod, along with a Formula, which should hereafter be “the term
                    of admission for those who shall apply for joining in communion with us.”</p>
                <p>The case of the four surviving protestors who had disclaimed the power of the
                    Associate Synod, either to alter their original Testimony, or to impose new
                    terms of communion for their body, was before the meeting of the Synod at
                    Glasgow, at the end of August 1806, and, by a formal resolution, was postponed
                    till the ensuing meeting in April next. It happened, however, that whilst the
                    subject was under discussion, Mr M <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> Crie and other
                    two of the protestors met at Whitburn to assist Mr Bruce upon a sacramental
                    occasion; and these four, after serious deliberation, constituted themselves
                    into a separate presbytery or jurisdiction. Information of this having reached
                    Edinburgh, Mr M‘Crie was interrogated by some members of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193210016" xml:id="kp-eb0713-0016-0661"/>his session, when he admitted
                    the fact; immediately upon which a communication was transmitted to the Synod at
                    Glasgow; and as it was considered that, “with regard to Mr M‘Crie, forbearance
                    could no longer be tolerated,” it was moved, and a sentence passed (2d of
                    September), deposing him from the office of the holy ministry.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See “Letters on the late
                    Transactions of the General Associate Synod at Glasgow,” in the New Series of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Christian Magazine,</hi> vol. i. pp. 24-35, G1-72. The
                    anonymous writer of these Letters asserts that the Protestors had all along been
                    treated by the Synod with great lenity and forbearance.</p></note> The other
                    protesting ministers were afterwards deposed in as peremptory a manner. It may
                    be said that the Synod could not act otherwise in regard to their brethren who
                    had set themselves in such direct opposition, by disclaiming the jurisdiction of
                    that court. But, to say nothing of the precipitate manner of passing such a
                    sentence, it was at least a harsh, if not unjustifiable proceeding, to subject
                    to the summary punishment of deposition and excommunication, persons against
                    whom calumny had never surmised the slightest charge, either as to moral conduct
                    or error in doctrine; and while, by so doing, dissensions were raised in
                    congregations, it was somewhat strange to find the very men who repudiated the
                    doctrine of interference of the civil magistrate in matters of religion, calling
                    in such aid to exclude from their own congregations ministers who had been
                    regularly ordained, and who maintained all the obligations imposed upon them at
                    ordination. Yet all this was done, according to Mr Bruce’s statement, “under
                    high pretensions to lenity and moderation, of promoting universal liberty of
                    conscience, and of greatly detesting and condemning all impositions and
                    compulsion ;” and, as he elsewhere remarks, that “to dissolve a pastoral
                    relation duly established, and while mutually acknowledged, by mere church
                    authority, without relevant reasons, is as really oppression, and a robbing the
                    people of their sacred privileges, as to intrude a minister upon a congregation
                    without their consent, which was one of the chief and primary grounds of the
                    Secession.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“A Review of

                <p>The Synod having appointed one of their number to proceed to Edinburgh, to
                    intimate, on the next Sabbath (7th September), the sentence of Mr M‘Crie’s
                    deposition, from his own pulpit, we must next briefly advert to the proceedings
                    of his congregation. It appears that the leaven of the new-light doctrines had
                    lately infected several of the leading members; yet, as it was found that the
                    trustees and seatholders, both in point of number, and the amount paid for
                    sittings, were nearly equal, the question arose, to whom the property of the
                    meeting-house in the Potterrow belonged. Such disunion was the occasion of a
                    tedious litigation in the Court of Session, during which time he was interdicted
                    access to his pulpit on the afternoon of every Sabbath. The Court of Session
                    having declined entering upon the question as to which party was chargeable with
                    schism, at length pronounced a decision, 24th February 1809, in favour of the
                    new-light members, as “forming a congregation of Christians in communion with,
                    and subject to the ecclesiastical discipline of, a body of dissenting
                    Protestants, calling themselves the Associate Presbytery and General Associate
                    Synod of Antiburgher Seccders.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Faculty Decisions, 1808-1809, p. 221.</p></note> After this,
                    Mr M&lt;Crie’s congregation assembled in the meeting-house in Carrubber’s Close,
                    till their new chapel in Davie Street, Richmond Place, was erected, and in which
                    he continued to officiate till the close of his life.</p>
                <p>In the meanwhile, the small party of “Old-Light Antiburghers,” as the protestors
                    were commonly called, assumed the name of the “Constitutional Associate
                    Presbytery ;” and, finding themselves placed in such peculiar circumstances, and
                    their sentiments and conduct liable to misrepresentation, they resolved to
                    publish “a fuller statement and explanation of the principal heads of
                    controversy between the Synod and them.” For this purpose, the task was devolved
                    upon Mr M‘Crie, as clerk of the presbytery; and, from papers partly written and
                    wholly revised by him, there appeared, in 1807, under his name, a “Statement of
                    the Difference between the profession of the Reformed Church of Scotland, as
                    adopted by Seceders, and the profession contained in the New Testimony and other
                    Acts, lately adopted by the General Associate Synod; particularly on the power
                    of Civil Magistrates respecting Religion, National Reformation, National
                    Churches, and National Covenants. To which are added, Reasons by the Ministers
                    who Protested against the above Acts of Synod, for constituting themselves into
                    a separate Presbytery, with the deed of Constitution,” &amp;c. 8vo, pp. 234.
                    Although of a controversial nature, respecting differences which attracted no
                    very great share of public notice at the time, this Statement is also applicable
                    to discussions which have recently been much more widely agitated by the
                    voluntary question; and it may be appealed to by the friends of the established
                    church, as explaining and enforcing the true grounds of connection between the
                    church and state, and as an able and elaborate argument of the obligation on
                    civil rulers to make suitable provision for the religious interests of the
                    community. Yet it was generally conceived that the protestors had displayed
                    unnecessary zeal and obstinacy in stedfastly opposing the measures of the Synod,
                    as if they had been contending for mere abstract theoretical points of no
                    practical importance.</p>
                <p>In the comparatively obscure and humble situation in which Mr M ’ Crie was now
                    placed, he was enabled to devote his leisure hours to his favourite literary
                    pursuits. His intention was to have published a life of Alexander Henderson, the
                    eminent Scottish divine, of which a sketch had appeared in the Christian
                    Magazine. In the view of giving an introductory account of the state of the
                    reformed church, he found that the materials were amply sufficient for a
                    separate work; and abandoning his original design, as one that might be resumed
                    at some future time, he undertook a Life of John Knox, and in this form sought
                    to illustrate the earlier history of the Protestant church in Scotland. The
                    subject was felicitously chosen, not only as possessed of historical importance
                    and of national interest, but as one which required, and which was capable of
                    being placed in a new point of light. “The Life of John Knox, containing
                    Illustrations of the History of the reformation in Scotland,” appeared in the
                    beginning of 1812, in one volume 8vo, pp. 580. Such was the effect produced by
                    this work, that although, even in Edinburgh, the author’s name was quite unknown
                    in the literary circles, it placed him at once in the first rank of
                    ecclesiastical biographers, and established his reputation as an historical
                    writer, both at home and abroad. The character of the great reformer had
                    hitherto been much calumniated and mistaken. Knox, indeed, was one of the most
                    marked characters in Scottish history, admirably suited to the circumstances in
                    which he was placed. He had, however, been too often represented as a fierce and
                    sullen bigot, equally opposed to learning, liberal principles, and sound policy;
                    coarse in manners, intolerant in conduct, and actuated by sordid and ambitious
                    views. It remained to reverse the picture, and to show the reformer in a juster
                    light; influenced by the purest and noblest principles; filled with apostolical
                    zeal, and a total disregard of worldly rank and power; stern and uncompromising
                    only <pb break="no" facs="nls:193210029" xml:id="kp-eb0713-0029-0662"/>in the
                    cause of truth, and in reproving vice and error; distinguished for profound
                    learning and true piety; and with that incorruptible integrity and heroic
                    courage required for carrying on the work of reformation. All this was
                    accomplished in Mr M‘Crie’s work, which possessed the rare quality of uniting
                    history with biography; and it was noticed in terms of high commendation in most
                    of the leading journals of the time. As, in fact, the “Life of Knox” must be
                    held to be the author’s principal production, we cannot resist the opportunity
                    of giving a quotation from an article in the Edinburgh Review for July 1812,
                    usually ascribed to the distinguished editor.</p>
                <p>“How unfair, and how marvellously incorrect, these representations (of Knox’s
                    character) are, may be learned from the book before us; a work which has
                    afforded us more amusement and more instruction than any thing we ever read upon
                    the subject; <hi rend="italic">and which,</hi> independent of its theological
                    merits, <hi rend="italic">we do not hesitate to pronounce by far the best piece
                    of history which has appeared since the commencement of our critical
                    career.</hi> It is extremely accurate, learned, and concise, and at the same
                    time very full of spirit and animation; exhibiting, as it appears to us, a rare
                    union of the patient research and sober judgment which characterise the more
                    laborious class of historians, with the boldness of thinking, and force of
                    imagination, which is sometimes substituted in their place. It affords us very
                    great pleasure to bear this public testimony to the merits of a writer who has
                    been hitherto unknown, we believe, to the literary world, either of this or the
                    neighbouring country; of whom, or of whose existence at least, though residing
                    in the same city with ourselves, it never was our fortune to have heard till his
                    volume was put into our hands; and who, in his first emergence from the humble
                    obscurity in which he has pursued the studies and performed the duties of his
                    profession, has presented the world with a work which may put so many of his
                    contemporaries to the blush, for the big promises they have broken, and the vast
                    opportunities they have neglected.”</p>
                <p>Such a favourable award had the effect of directing attention to the work, and of
                    calling for a new edition, which appeared in an enlarged and corrected form in
                    1813.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The fifth edition,
                    carefully revised by the author, and containing his last corrections, was
                    published in 1831. This, as well as the second, third, and fourth editions, is
                    in two volumes 8vo.</p></note> In preparing this edition, the author not only
                    made corrections, both as to style and matter, but, as the reformer’s name is so
                    inseparably connected with the history of public events, he introduced greater
                    detail of public transactions, tending to vindicate the proceedings of the early
                    reformers, and to throw light on the character and motives of the other
                    prominent actors of the time.</p>
                <p>Before this edition was published, the Senatus of the University of Edinburgh, on
                    the 3d of February 1813, conferred on Mr M*Crie the honorary degree of Doctor of
                    Divinity; a compliment alike deserved by the author of the Life of Knox, and
                    honourable to his Alma Mater, our metropolitan university. This act was the more
                    honourable, as it was one of the first instances of such a title having been
                    conferred on a person, though holding the same professions, not strictly
                    belonging to the established church.</p>
                <p>Thus encouraged to pursue his literary career, the next subject in which Dr
                    M‘Crie engaged was a Life of Andrew Melville, the able and intrepid assertor of
                    Presbytery; which might serve as a continuation to his former work, by giving an
                    account of ecclesiastical transactions in Scotland during the latter part of the
                    sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth century. It was not till the end of
                    1819 that the work was published, in two volumes 8vo.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The title is, “The Life of Andrew Melville;
                    containing Illustrations of the Ecclesiastical and Literary History of Scotland
                    during the latter part of the Sixteenth and beginning of the Seventeenth
                    Century. With an Appendix, consisting of original pa, pers.” A second edition,
                    revised, was published in 1824, also in 2 vols. 8vo.</p></note> It presented the
                    results of long-continued, minute, and discriminating research into the literary
                    as well as the ecclesiastical history of the period. The exertions of Melville
                    in behalf of our national church well merited the labours of such a biographer;
                    and as he was successively at the head of two of our principal colleges, Glasgow
                    and St Andrews, an opportunity was also afforded of entering fully into the
                    state of education and the progress of literature at that time. Although in no
                    respect less valuable and important, it was not so successful as its precursor;
                    as, in fact, the mass of literary information it conveys was not of a kind to
                    attract public regard and secure popularity. Melville’s influence in church
                    courts far surpassed that of any of his contemporaries, but it was not so
                    powerfully felt, like that of Knox, in public events. Yet his character is
                    highly interesting, and stands out in bold relief, finely contrasted with the
                    milder dispositions of his nephew James Melville (whose Diary presents so many
                    minute and affectionate notices of his uncle, whilst his own letters, written in
                    exile, breathe a kindred spirit of sympathy and love), as an elegant and
                    accomplished scholar, a profound divine, kind and affectionate in all the
                    private relations of life, and at the same time undaunted and uncompromising in
                    asserting and vindicating the rights and liberties of the presbyterian party.
                    The period to which Dr M‘Crie’s work relates is not less important, as it
                    embraces the contests between the church and the court, the establishment on its
                    present basis of the presbyterian polity, and its temporary overthrow after a
                    long and arduous struggle.</p>
                <p>Having in the life of Melville traced the progress of ecclesiastical affairs till
                    near the close of the reign of James I., it was natural to think that Dr M‘Crie
                    would have resumed his first intention, by publishing a Life of Alexander
                    Henderson. But the state of his health, and the fear of engaging in such
                    laborious and protracted researches as he had just terminated, deterred him from
                    commencing, or at least induced him to postpone, such a task. Strong
                    inducements, moreover, were held out to him, first to become the editor of a new
                    edition of Wodrow’s History, and afterwards to write a new work on the same
                    period, or a history of the religious persecutions in Scotland; but neither of
                    these was undertaken, and he remained for a length of time undetermined in what
                    work he should next engage. Besides Henderson’s life, he thought of Wickliffe
                    and the precursors of Luther,—of Calvin,—and of a history of the progress of the
                    Reformation throughout Europe. Various obstacles intervened to his successfully
                    embarking in either of these undertakings, and therefore it is the more deeply
                    to be regretted that any circumstances should have prevented him from pursuing
                    his primary intention, which might for a time have happily limited his
                    researches to his own country, and to events with which he was so conversant. We
                    happen to know, that when Dr M‘Crie was urged to this, all his old predilections
                    would revive, and he would admit his anxious desire to continue the period of
                    his biographies to the Restoration. He would say, however, that a life of
                    Henderson, who died in 1646, would leave such a work incomplete, and he should
                    feel some difficulty in fixing on any person of sufficient importance, and whose
                    principles and conduct he approved, to connect with Henderson for the subsequent
                    events. As his own views led him to approve of the party named “Protestors,” he
                    no doubt would, had he actually set about such a work, <pb break="no"

                    James Guthrie, minister of Stirling, who suffered as a martyr for his principles
                    upon the restoration of Charles II. Besides the advantage of thus presenting, in
                    the form of biographical narrative, a continuous history of what has been called
                    the Second, as well as of the First Reformation, it was a subject calculated to
                    excite very general interest; and the whole tenor of Dr M‘Crie’s pursuits
                    eminently fitted him to render it attractive. But it was destined to be left to
                    other hands.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A History
                    of the Life and Times of Henderson has lately been published by the Rev. Dr

                    in the publication of his miscellaneous writings, which have been announced, a
                    conspicuous place may be assigned to his admirable sketch of Henderson’s life,
                    which appeared in the Christian Magazine for 1806.</p>
                <p>Whilst engaged in the life of Melville, Dr M <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> Crie
                    became an occasional, if not a stated contributor, to the “Edinburgh Christian
                    Instructor,” a well-known monthly publication, edited by the late Reverend Dr
                    Andrew Thomson, with whom he continued on terms of cordial intimacy and
                    friendship till the close of his highly useful career. He also lent occasional
                    aid to other periodicals; but as we have no means of exactly ascertaining his
                    communications,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the
                    Edinburgh Review for April 1830, there is an article by Dr M ’ Crie, on the

                    from an original manuscript.</p></note> we shall merely allude to one article in
                    the Instructor which excited considerable attention at the time. This was a
                    review, in 1817, of the first series of the “Tales of my Landlord,” which
                    appeared in three successive numbers of that magazine, and contained an
                    elaborate defence of the persecuted covenanters, who made such a noble struggle
                    for civil as well as religious freedom, against the unprincipled and tyrannical
                    measures of the government of Charles II., whilst it exposed the erroneous and
                    exaggerated representation of their manners and principles given in the tale of
                    “Old Mortality.” But the most singular circumstance connected with this review
                    was, that Sir Walter Scott, who had not then stood forth as the acknowledged
                    author of the Waverley Novels, was prevailed upon, by the editor of the
                    “Quarterly Review,” to become the reviewer of his own work; and thus he took an
                    opportunity, whilst vindicating the statements contained in his novel, tacitly
                    to answer the article in the Instructor.</p>
                <p>In February 1816, the Reverend Archibald Bruce, Antiburgher minister at Whitburn,
                    who for upwards of thirty years had filled the office of professor of divinity,
                    died full of years and honour, and Dr M‘Crie was naturally looked to as the
                    fittest person in their body for his successor. The number of students was not
                    considerable; but the duties of the professorship must have occupied much of his
                    time during the ordinary terms of session. He commenced his lectures on the 1st
                    of October 1817, with a suitable and feeling allusion to the loss the church at
                    large had sustained by the death of his venerable friend and instructor. Two

                    worth and talents of this learned and worthy divine, who was distinguished by a
                    congeniality of mind and fondness of literary research. Dr M‘Crie filled the
                    professor’s chair until 1827, when he resigned it in consequence of an event
                    which may be adverted to in a few words. In 1820, a union of the two largest
                    bodies of dissenters in Scotland took place, under the title of the “United
                    Associate Synod of the Secession Church.” Several members of the Antiburgher
                    Synod having protested against the basis of union, and declined participating in
                    it, formed themselves into a separate court, still retaining the name of the
                    “Associate (Antiburgher)</p>
                <p>Synod.” From their similarity of sentiment and profession with the
                    “Constitutional Associate Presbytery,” a proposal for re-uniting was afterwards
                    brought forward, when Dr M‘Crie on the one side, and Professor Paxton on the
                    other, were appointed to draw up the “Articles agreed upon, &amp;c. with a view
                    to Union,” and the “Overtures of a Testimony.” This union was effected in May
                    1827, under the designation of the “Associate Synod of Original Seceders ;” and
                    it was on this occasion that Dr M&lt;Crie resigned the divinity chair to the
                    Rev. George (now Dr) Paxton, the learned author of “Illustrations of the Holy
                    Scriptures.” The “Testimony” then published, as agreed upon by the Synod, it is
                    understood was the composition, in the historical part, of Dr M‘Crie, and in the
                    doctrinal part, of Dr Stevenson, Ayr. Here it may be remarked, that the Church
                    of Scotland owes no ordinary debt of gratitude to the Original Seceders, for
                    their constant adherence to the same principles, and even for their continued
                    testimony against error in the administration of church affairs. As to Dr M‘Crie
                    individually, although he saw no prospect of being able conscientiously to join
                    the establishment, he was ever warmly attached to the church, and felt a deep
                    interest in her prosperity. Such attachment is manifested in all his writings,
                    and remained unimpaired till the day of his death. A few words on this head may
                    be quoted from a sermon on the aspect of the times, delivered in May 1834.
                    Addressing the members of his own congregation, he says, “After long
                    examination, I am fully convinced that, by the good hand of God, you have been
                    led, in respect of profession and communion, to take up your ground in the safe
                    medium between the conflicting parties in the great controversy of the day,
                    while you continue to testify against the corruptions of the churches
                    established by law in our native land, and at the same time keep aloof from
                    those who condemn all recognition of Christianity by public authority, and seek
                    to withdraw the provision which has been made by the nation for religious
                    purposes. I cannot (he adds) flatter you with the prospect of the speedy removal
                    of those defects in the national settlement of religion, or those practical
                    abuses in ecclesiastical administration, which the body we are connected with
                    have so long condemned, and which have excluded us from fellowship with the
                    national church in Scotland... Nothing on earth would give more joy to my heart,
                    than to see sure and decided symptoms of reformation in the national church of
                    Scotland...I would go seven times to the top of her highest mountain to look out
                    for the harbinger of her relief, though each time I should have to return with
                    the message, <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> There is nothing,’ provided at last
                    I could hail the appearance of <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> the little cloud
                    out of the sea, like a man’s hand,’ the sure prelude of the plentiful rain which
                    shall refresh the weary inheritance, make her wilderness an Eden, and her desert
                    as the garden of the Lord.”</p>
                <p>But, to resume the series of Dr M‘Crie’s literary labours (of which the want of
                    space will prevent us offering little more than a brief enumeration): In 1821 he
                    published a little volume containing “Two Discourses on the Unity of the Church,
                    her Divisions, and their removal. To which is subjoined, A short View of the
                    plan of Religious Reformation originally adopted in the Secession.” 12mo, pp.
                    174.</p>
                <p>This was followed in 1825 by a volume entitled “Memoirs of Mr William Veitch and
                    George Bryson, written by themselves: with other narratives illustrative of the
                    History of Scotland, from the Restoration to the Revolution: to which are added,
                    Biographical Sketches and Notes, by Thomas M‘Crie, D. D.” 8vo, pp. 540. In the
                    preface <pb break="no" facs="nls:193210055" xml:id="kp-eb0713-0055-0664"/>the
                    editor observes, “that, with a little more labour, a connected history of the
                    period might have been produced; but I am persuaded that no account which I
                    could draw up would present so graphic a picture of the men and measures of that
                    time, as is exhibited in the following historical pieces.” These are indeed
                    highly graphic and interesting, but the volume might be instanced as a proof of
                    what Dr M‘Crie confesses, that the time and labour bestowed upon it would have
                    gone far to produce an original work of greater importance. In reviewing this
                    volume, the editor of the Edinburgh Christian Instructor sums up with saying,
                    “in Dr M‘Crie we see all we could wish for in the historian of the presbyterian
                    church; and if he would add to his former labours a history of that church from
                    the beginning of Charles the First’s reign to the Revolution, we are sure the
                    public would receive it with feelings of the highest satisfaction.”</p>
                <p>This hint, however, was not taken, as the next subject of his investigation led
                    to the publication, in 1827, of a “History of the Progress and Suppression of
                    the Reformation in Italy in the Sixteenth Century, including a Sketch of the
                    Reformation in the Grisons,” 8vo, pp. 434 (of which a second edition appeared in
                    1828). Also, in 1829, as a sequel to that work, a “History of the Progress and
                    Suppression of the Reformation in Spain in the Sixteenth Century,” 8vo, pp. 424.
                    These volumes undoubtedly form a valuable accession to the history of the
                    Reformation throughout Europe, although the author laboured under great
                    disadvantages in having but limited access to original sources of information,
                    compared to what was within his reach in matters of our own ecclesiastical
                    history; and it was felt, that they tended rather to excite a desire for
                    information than fully to gratify it, and that the materials were not equal to
                    the skill and industry displayed. It is clear that the state of public opinion
                    had prepared the way for a reformation even in Italy, the stronghold of the
                    Roman Catholic church, and the progress that great cause made was indeed
                    remarkable and extensive; but nothing could withstand the systematic, unceasing,
                    and exterminating measures employed to arrest the progress of reformed opinions;
                    and the more so as these were not counteracted by any opposing interests of the
                    civil and ecclesiastical authorities either in Spain or Italy, whilst the
                    strength of the reformers, having no unity of purpose, was wasted by unhappy
                    divisions among themselves. Both volumes, however, present very interesting and
                    affecting particulars of the sufferings of those who were doomed to exile,
                    imprisonment, or death, for religious liberty and for the truth.</p>
                <p>Dr M‘Cric was at length induced to undertake a more arduous task, which had been
                    looked for from his hand, and which he himself had long contemplated. This was a
                    Life of John Calvin the reformer. To do justice to such a work, he considered a
                    lengthened residence at Geneva, where the most importantoriginal documents are
                    preserved, to be quite essential; but a due attention to his ordinary
                    ministerial functions precluded him from the chance of ever being able to leave
                    home for so long a period. The prospect of his son, Mr John M‘Crie, going
                    abroad, and remaining several months at Geneva, in some measure obviated this
                    difficulty, as he could not only trust to his accuracy in transcribing Calvin’s
                    original letters, but, by regular communication, hope to obtain all the
                    requisite information from other sources, and in as satisfactory a manner as if
                    he himself were on the spot to direct such researches. His son accordingly set
                    about the task most assiduously, and, with a zeal, knowledge, and perseverance
                    worthy of all praise, transmitted such a mass of materials as could not have
                    failed, in Dr M‘Crie’s hands, to have rendered his work one of the highest
                    importance in ecclesiastical biography. He had in fact made considerable
                    progress in writing the earlier portion, and was intently engaged upon it (in
                    the midst of the constant interruptions to which he was subjected), at the time
                    when all his earthly labours were brought unexpectedly to a close. It is
                    understood that one of his sons has the intention, from the materials already
                    collected, to complete a Life of Calvin; otherwise, even as a fragment, the
                    portion actually written should not be withheld from the public.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It may be noticed, that Dr
                    M‘Crie, in May 1834, visited London to give his evidence before the Committee of
                    the House of Commons on Church Patronage. His evidence forms part of the
                    voluminous Report on that question, pp. 355-374, and 383-393.</p></note></p>
                <p>Dr M‘Crie’s sedentary habits and application to study were not favourable to
                    health, if he ever could be said to have been very robust. In the summer of 1835
                    he had been confined for a time through indisposition, but there was no apparent
                    change to indicate the suddenness of his decease. In fact, a short absence in
                    the country seemed to have re-established his health, and he was so far
                    recovered, that, on Sabbath the 2d of August, he preached as usual, both in the
                    forenoon and afternoon, and walked out on the following Tuesday to visit a
                    neighbour; but on the afternoon of that day, about five o’clock, he was taken
                    alarmingly ill, and between ten and eleven at night he fell into a stupor, from
                    which medical aid failed in recovering him. In this state he remained till
                    half-past twelve next forenoon (Wednesday the 5th of August), when he breathed
                    his last. His death, thus unexpected, at a time when it was hoped his life might
                    have been spared for several years of increasing usefulness, and when his mental
                    faculties were in full vigour, could not fail to excite a very deep interest;
                    and many appropriate expressions of public regard were called forth, both in the
                    pulpit and through the press.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    General Assembly was held on the day of the funeral (the 12th), and, on the
                    motion of the Reverend Dr Cook of St Andrews, a deputation, consisting of the
                    moderator and several of the leading members, attended, as a suitable mark of
                    respect due from the church to which he had been so zealously and consistently
                    attached, and for which he had done so much by his writings. He was interred in
                    the New Greyfriars burying-ground.</p>
                <p>Dr M ’ Crie was twice married. By his first wife (Mrs Janet Dickson), who died
                    1st June 1821, he left four sons and one daughter. His eldest son, Thomas, who
                    has been for several years in the ministry, has recently been elected by the
                    congregation as his father’s successor; and has also, upon Dr Paxton’s
                    resignation, been appointed by the Synod professor of divinity. By his second
                    wife (the daughter of his old friend and associate, the Reverend Robert
                    Chalmers, Haddington), who survives him, he left no issue. A half-length
                    portrait, from a picture by Mr Watson Gordon, S. A. to be engraved in
                    mezzotinto, is in the course of publication, and cannot fail, as it is an
                    admirable likeness, to be an acceptable memorial to his friends and admirers. A
                    bust, also, by Alexander Ritchie, was in the last exhibition of the Scottish
                    Academy. In this year (1836) a posthumous volume of “Sermons,” by Dr M‘Crie,
                    edited by his son, has appeared, 8vo, pp. 393. A collection of his miscellaneous
                    writings, with memoirs of his life by the Rev. Thomas M‘Crie, have likewise been
                    announced for publication.</p>
                <p>It is not necessary to enlarge upon Dr M‘Crie’s general character. In private
                    life he was kind, affable, and free <pb break="no" facs="nls:193210068"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-0068-0665"/>from every thing like display or desire of
                    notoriety; being remarkable for his cordiality of manners, cheerfulness of
                    temper and conversation, and his unaffected simplicity. As a preacher, his style
                    of address was rather unprepossessing, partly from want of action, and partly
                    from his slow, monotonous, and somewhat constrained delivery, as if afraid to
                    speak out in the natural tone of his voice. But any deficiency of artificial
                    eloquence was amply compensated for by his profound and luminous expositions of
                    Scripture, expressed in clear and energetic language; and his discourses were
                    uniformly of a practical nature, and breathed a strain of great piety. In his
                    literary character, by which he will be known in after times, it will be
                    acknowledged that his mind was of no ordinary cast. With extensive erudition,
                    and habits of indefatigable research, he combined sound judgment, and a singular
                    acuteness and sagacity of intellect. Could he have remained satisfied with the
                    researches of previous writers, he might have produced a greater number, and
                    perhaps more popular works, but they would not have borne the peculiar impress
                    resulting from his own minute, accurate, and extensive inquiries, and therefore
                    there is no occasion for regret that he should have devoted much of his time in
                    exploring the original sources of information. His learning was both profound
                    and extensive, as he was not only skilled in what are called the learned
                    languages, but was conversant with most of those of modern Europe. Still, with
                    all his natural love of literary pursuits, he kept such employment in
                    subservience to his duty as a diligent and faithful minister of Christ. For
                    nearly forty years he laboured with the most affectionate solicitude for the
                    spiritual interests of his flock, and much of his time was devoted to them in
                    his week-day ministrations. It was chiefly a consideration of the paramount
                    importance of such a charge, we imagine, that caused him to decline the prospect
                    of a chair in the University of Edinburgh, when a vacancy occurred in the
                    professorship of Church History. There is every reason also to believe, that had
                    his life been spared a few months longer, the honorary office of Historiographer
                    Royal for Scotland would have been conferred, unsolicited, upon him, as a public
                    testimony due to him. To conclude, the fame of Dr M‘Crie as a literary writer
                    has extended widely beyond the limits of his own country; and his name will
                    probably be an object of greater regard in future times than even at present,
                    though all his personal virtues are fresh in recollection. The profound
                    research, the masculine vigour, and philosophic wisdom displayed in all his
                    writings, added to the permanent interest of the subjects upon which the powers
                    of his mind were usually employed, stamp them as works which will remain as
                    landmarks in historical literature. (c. c. c.)</p>
