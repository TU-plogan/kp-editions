                    Magi, or wise men of Persia.</p>
                <p>The origin of magic and the magi is ascribed to Zoroaster. Salmasius derives the
                    very name from Zoroaster, who, he says, was surnamed <hi rend="italic">Mag,</hi>
                    whence Magus. But others, instead of making him the author of the Persian
                    philosophy, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193210263" xml:id="kp-eb0713-0263-0680"
                    />represent him only as the restorer and improver thereof, alleging, that many
                    of the Persian rites in use amongst the Magi were borrowed from the Zabii or
                    Chaldaeans, who agreed in many things with the Magi of the Persians; and hence
                    some make the name <hi rend="italic">Magus</hi> common both to the Chaldaeans
                    and Persians. Thus Plutarch mentions, that Zoroaster instituted Magi amongst the
                    Chaldaeans, in imitation of which the Persians had also theirs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Magic,</hi> in a more modern sense, is a science which
                    teaches to perform wonderful and surprising feats, or to produce unexpected
                    effects.</p>
                <p>The word <hi rend="italic">magic</hi> originally carried with it a very innocent,
                    nay, laudable meaning, being used purely to signify the study of wisdom, and the
                    more sublime parts of knowledge; but as the ancient Magi engaged themselves in
                    astrology, divination, sorcery, and the like, the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >magic</hi> became in time odious, and was only used to signify an unlawful and
                    diabolical kind of science, depending on the assistance of the devil and
                    departed souls.</p>
                <p>If any wonder how so vain and deceitful a science should ever have gained credit
                    and authority over men’s minds, Pliny solves the mystery. It is, says he,
                    because it has possessed itself of three sciences in the most esteem amongst
                    men, taking from each all that is great and marvellous in it. Nobody doubts but
                    it had its origin in medicine; and that it insinuated itself into the minds of
                    the people, under pretence of affording extraordinary remedies. To these fine
                    promises it added every thing in religion that is pompous and splendid, and that
                    appears calculated to blind and captivate mankind. Lastly, it mingled with the
                    rest judicial astrology, persuading people, curious of futurity, that it saw
                    every thing to come in the heavens. Agrippa divides magic into three kinds;
                    natural, celestial, and ceremonial or superstitious.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Natural</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Magic</hi> is no more
                    than the application of natural active causes to passive subjects, by means of
                    which many surprising, but yet natural, effects are produced.</p>
                <p>In this way many of our experiments in natural philosophy, especially those of
                    electricity, optics, and magnetism, have a kind of magical appearance, and
                    amongst the ignorant and credulous might easily pass for miracles. Such, without
                    doubt, have been some of those miracles wrought by ancient magicians, whose
                    knowledge of the various powers of nature, there is reason to believe, was much
                    greater than modern vanity will sometimes allow.</p>
                <p>Baptista Porta wrote a treatise of natural magic, or secrets for performing
                    extraordinary things by natural causes. The natural magic of the Chaldaeans was
                    nothing but the knowledge of the powers of simples and minerals. The magic which
                    they called <hi rend="italic">theurgia</hi> consisted wholly in the knowledge of
                    the ceremonies to be observed in the worship of the gods, in order to be
                    acceptable. By virtue of these ceremonies they believed they could converse with
                    spiritual beings, and cure diseases.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Celestial</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Magic</hi> borders
                    nearly on judicial astrology. It attributes to spirits a kind of rule or
                    dominion over the planets, and to planets a dominion over men; and on these
                    principles builds a ridiculous kind of system.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Superstitious</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Magic</hi>
                    consists in the invocation of devils. Its effects are usually evil and wicked,
                    though very strange, and seemingly surpassing the powers of nature, being
                    supposed to be produced by virtue of some compact, either tacit or express, with
                    evil spirits; but the truth is, these have not all the power which is usually
                    imagined, nor do they produce those effects which are ordinarily ascribed to
                    them.</p>
                <p>This species of magic, there is every reason to believe, had its .origin in
                    Egypt, the native country of paganism. The first magicians mentioned in history
                    were Egyptians; and that people, so famed for early wisdom, believed not only in
                    the existence of demons, the great agents in magic, but also that different
                    orders of those spirits presided over the elements of earth, air, fire, and
                    water, as well as over the persons and affairs of men. Hence they ascribed every
                    disease with which they were afflicted to the immediate agency of some evil
                    demon. When a person was seized with a fever, for instance, they did not think
                    it necessary to search for any natural cause of the disease; it was immediately
                    attributed to some demon which had taken possession of the body of the patient,
                    and which could not be ejected but by charms and incantations.</p>
                <p>These superstitions notions having spread from Egypt over all the East, the Jews
                    imbibed them during their captivity in Babylon. Hence we find them in the
                    writings of the New Testament attributing almost every disease to which they
                    were incident to the immediate agency of devils. Many of the same·impious
                    superstitions were brought from Egypt and Chaldaea by Pythagoras, and
                    transmitted by him and his followers to the Platonists in Greece. This is
                    apparent from the writers of the life of Pythagoras. Jamblicus, speaking of the
                    followers of that philosopher, says expressly that they cured certain diseases
                    by incantations; and Porphyry adds, that they cured diseases both of the mind
                    and of the body by songs and incantations. This was exactly the practice of the
                    Egyptian priests, who were all supposed to keep up a constant intercourse with
                    demons, and to have the power of controlling them by magical charms and sacred
                    songs. Agreeably to this practice of his masters, we are told that Pythagoras
                    directed that certain diseases of the mind, doubtless those which he attributed
                    to the agency of demons, should be cured partly by <hi rend="italic"
                    >incantations,</hi> partly by <hi rend="italic">magical hymns,</hi> and partly
                    by <hi rend="italic">music.</hi></p>
                <p>It was the universal belief of the ancient nations, says the learned Mosheim, and
                    especially of the orientals, that certain sounds and words, for the most part
                    barbarous, were highly grateful, and that others were equally disagreeable, to
                    these spirits. Hence, when they wished to render a demon propitious, and to
                    employ him on any particular office, the magicians composed their sacred songs
                    of the words which were believed to be agreeable to him; and when it was their
                    intention to drive him from themselves or others, they sung in a strain which
                    they fancied a demon could not hear but with horror. From the same persuasion
                    arose the custom of suspending from the neck of a sick person, whose disease was
                    supposed to be inflicted by a demon, an amulet, sometimes made of gold and
                    sometimes of parchment, on which was written one or more of those words which
                    demons could not bear either to hear or to see; and in a didactic poem on the
                    healing art, still extant, we are taught by Serenus Sammonicus, that the word
                    <hi rend="italic">Abracadabra</hi> is an infallible remedy for a semitertian
                    fever or ague; and to banish grief of heart, Marcellin us thinks nothing more
                    effectual than the word %αg∕- ayaωμ. In more modern times, as we are informed by
                    Agrippa, the words employed by those in compact with the devil, to invoke him,
                    and to succeed in what they undertake, are, <hi rend="italic">Dies, mies,
                    jesquet, benedoefet, douvima, enite-maus.</hi> There are a hundred other
                    formulas of words composed at pleasure, or gathered from several different
                    languages, or patched from the Hebrew, or formed in imitation of that language.
                    And amongst the primitive Christians there was a superstitious custom, of which
                    we suspect some remains may yet be found amongst the illiterate vulgar in
                    different countries, of fastening to the neck of a sick person, or to the bed
                    upon which he lay, some text from the New Testament, and especially the first
                    two or three verses of the Gospel of St John, as a charm undoubtedly efficacious
                    to banish the disease.</p>
                <p>The revival of learning, and the success with which the laws of nature have been
                    investigated, have long ago banished this species of superstition from all the
                    enlightened nations of Europe.</p>

                <p>One would imagine that these magic squares had that name given them because this
                    property of all their ranks, which, taken any way, make always the same sum,
                    appeared extremely surprising, especially in certain ignorant ages, when

                    that these squares merited their name still further, by the superstitious
                    operations they were employed in, as the construction of talismans, and the
                    like; for, according to the childish philosophy of those days, which attributed
                    virtues to numbers, what virtue might not be expected from numbers which
                    appeared so wonderful?</p>
                <p>However, what was at first the vain practice of makers of talismans and
                    conjurers, has since become the subject of serious research amongst
                    mathematicians; not that they imagine it will lead them to any thing of solid
                    use or advantage (magic squares savour too much of their original to be of any
                    great use), but only as it is a kind of play, where the difficulty makes the
                    merit, and it may chance to produce some new views of numbers, which
                    mathematicians will not lose the occasion of discovering.</p>
                <p>Moschopulus, a Greek author of no great antiquity, is the first who appears to
                    have spoken of magic squares; and, by the age in which he lived, there is reason
                    to imagine he did not look on them merely as a mathematician. However, he has
                    left us some rules for their construction. In the treatise of Cornelius Agrippa,
                    so much accused of magic, we find the squares of seven numbers, viz. from three
                    to nine inclusive, disposed magically; and it must not be supposed that these
                    seven numbers were preferred to all the others without some very good reason. In
                    effect, it is because their squares, according to the system pf Agrippa and his
                    followers, are planetary. The square pf 3, for instance, belongs to Saturn; that
                    of 4 to Jupiter; that of 5 to Mars; that of 6 to the Sun; that of 7 to Veius;
                    that of 8 to Mercury; and that of 9 to the Moon. Bachet applied himself to the
                    study of magic squares, on he hint which he had taken from the planetary squares
                    of ⅜grippa, as being unacquainted with the work of Moschopulus, which is only in
                    manuscript in the French king’s library; and, without the assistance of any
                    author, he found out a new method for those squares whose root is uneven, for
                    instance twenty-five, forty-nine, &amp;c. but he could not make any thing of
                    those whose root is even.</p>
                <p>After him came Frenicle, who took the same subject in hand. A certain great
                    algebraist was of opinion, that whereas the sixteen numbers which compose the
                    square might be disposed 20922789888000 different ways in a natural square (as
                    from the rules of combination it is certain they may), they could not be
                    disposed in a magic square above sixteen different ways; but Frenicle showed
                    that they might be thus disposed 878 different ways; and hence it appears how
                    much his method exceeds the former, which only yielded the fifty-fifth part of
                    magic squares of that of Frenicle.</p>
                <p>To this inquiry he thought fit to add a difficulty that had not yet been
                    considered. The magic square of 7, for instance, being constructed, and its
                    forty-nine cells filled, if the two horizontal ranks of cells, and, at the same
                    time, the two vertical ones, the most remote from the middle, be retrenched,
                    that is, if the whole border or circumference of the square be taken away, there
                    will remain a square whose root will be 5, and which will only consist of
                    twenty-five cells. Now it is not at all surprising that the square should be no
                    longer magical, because the ranks of the large ones were not intended to make
                    the same sum, excepting when taken entire with all the seven numbers that fill
                    their seven cells; so that being mutilated each of two cells, and having lost
                    two of their numbers, it may be well expected that their remainders will not any
                    longer make the same sum. But Frenicle would not be satisfied, unless, when the
                    circumference or border of the magic square was taken away, and even any
                    circumferences at pleasure, or, in fine, several circumferences at once, the
                    remaining square was still magical; which last condition, no doubt, made these
                    squares vastly more magical than ever.</p>
                <p>Again, he inverted that condition, and required that any circumference taken at
                    pleasure, or even several circumferences, should be inseparable from the square;
                    that is, that it should cease to be magical when they were removed, and yet
                    continue magical after the removal of any of the rest. Frenicle, however, gives
                    no general demonstration of his methods, and frequently seems to have no other
                    guide but chance. It is true, his book was not published by himself, nor did it
                    appear till after his death, viz. in 1693.</p>
                <p>In 1703, Poignard, a canon of Brussels, published a treatise of sublime magic
                    squares. Before him there had been no magic squares constructed but for series
                    of natural numbers that formed a square; but Poignard made two very considerable
                    improvements. Instead of taking all the numbers that fill a square, for
                    instance, the thirty-six successive numbers, which would fill all the cells of a
                    natural square whose side is 6, he only takes as many successive numbers as
                    there are units in the side of the square, which, in this case, are six; and
                    these six numbers alone he disposes in such manner in the thirty-six cells, that
                    none of them are repeated twice in the same rank, whether it be horizontal,
                    vertical, or diagonal; whence it follows, that all the ranks, taken all the ways
                    possible, must always make the same sum, which Poignard calls repeated
                    progression. Instead of being confined to take these numbers according to the
                    series and succession of the natural numbers, that is, in an arithmetical
                    progression, he takes them likewise in a geometrical progression, and even in an
                    harmonical progression. But with these two last progressions the magic must
                    necessarily be different from what it was. In the squares filled with numbers in
                    geometrical progression, it consists in this, that the products of all the ranks
                    are equal; and in the harmonical progression, the numbers of all the ranks
                    continually follow that progression. He makes squares of each of these three
                    progressions repeated.</p>
                <p>The book of Poignard gave occasion to Μ. de la Hire to turn his thoughts the same
                    way, which he did with such success that he seems to have well nigh completed
                    the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193210289" xml:id="kp-eb0713-0289-0682"/>theory of
                    magic squares. He first considers uneven squares, all his predecessors on the
                    subject having found the construction of even ones by much the most difficult,
                    for which reason Μ. de la Hire reserves these for the last. This excess of
                    difficulty may arise partly from this, that the numbers are taken in
                    arithmetical progression. Now in that progression, if the number of terms be
                    uneven, that in the middle has some properties which may be of service; for
                    instance, being multiplied by the number of terms in the progression, the
                    product is equal to the sum of all the terms.</p>
                <p>Μ. de la Hire proposes a general method for uneven squares, which has some
                    similitude to the theory of compound motions, so useful and fertile in
                    mechanics. As that consists in decomposing motions, and resolving them into
                    others more simple; so does Μ. de la Hire’s method consist in resolving the
                    square that is to be constructed, into two simple and primitive squares. It must
                    be owned, however, it is not quite so easy to conceive these two simple and
                    primitive squares in the compound or perfect square, as in an oblique motion to
                    imagine a parallel and perpendicular one.</p>
                <p>Suppose a square of cells, whose root is uneven, for instance 7; and that its
                    forty-nine cells are to be filled magically with numbers, for instance the first
                    7; Μ. de la Hire, on the one side, takes the first seven numbers, beginning with
                    unity, and ending with the root 7, and on the other, 7, and all its multiples to
                    forty-nine exclusively; and as these only make six numbers, he adds 0, which
                    makes this an arithmetical progression of seven terms as well as the other, viz.
                    0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42. This done, with the first progression repeated, he
                    fills the square of the root magically. In order to this, he writes in the first
                    seven cells of the first horizontal rank the seven numbers proposed, in what
                    order he pleases, for that is absolutely indifferent; and it is proper to
                    observe here, that these seven numbers may be ranged in 5040 different manners
                    in the same rank. The order in which they are placed in the first horizontal
                    rank, be it what it will, is that which determines their order in all the rest.
                    For the second horizontal rank, he places in its first cell, either the third,
                    the fourth, the fifth, or the sixth number, from the first number of the first
                    rank; and after that he writes the six others in order as they follow. For the
                    third horizontal rank, he observes the same method with regard to the second
                    that he observed in the second with regard to the first, and so of the rest. For
                    instance, suppose the first horizontal rank filled with the seven numbers in
                    their natural order, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, the second horizontal rank may either
                    commence with 3, with 4, with 5, or with 6; but in this instance it commences
                    with 3; the third rank therefore must commence with 5, the fourth with 7, the
                    fifth with 2, the sixth with 4, and the seventh with 6. The commencement of the
                    ranks which follow the first being thus determined, the other numbers, as we
                    have already observed, must be written down in the order in which they stand in
                    the first, going on to 5, 6, and 7, and returning to 1, 2, &amp;c. till every
                    number in the first rank be found in every rank underneath, according to the
                    order arbitrarily pitched upon at first. By this means it is evident that no
                    number whatever can be repeated twice in the same rank; and by consequence, that
                    the seven numbers 1, 2,3, 4, 5, 6, 7, being in each rank, must of necessity make
                    the same sum.</p>

                <p>The order of the numbers in the first rank being determined; if, in beginning
                    with the second rank, the second number 2, or the last number 7, should be
                    pitched upon in one of these cases, and repeated; and in the other case, the
                    other diagonal would be false unless the number repeated seven times should
                    happen to be 4; for four times seven is equal to the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7:
                    and in general, in every square consisting of an unequal number of terms, in
                    arithmetical progression, one of the diagonal* would be false according to these
                    two constructions, unless the term always repeated in that diagonal were the
                    middle term of the progression. It is not, however, at all necessary to take the
                    terms in an arithmetical progression; for, according to this method, one may
                    construct a magic square of any numbers at pleasure, whether they be according
                    to any certain progression or not. If they be in an arithmetical progression, it
                    will be proper, out of the general method, to except those two constructions
                    which produce a continual repetition of the same term in one of the two
                    diagonals, and only to take in the case in which that repetition would prevent
                    the diagonal from being just; which case being absolutely disregarded when we
                    computed that the square of 7 might have 20,160 different constructions, it is
                    evident, that by taking that case in, it must have vastly more.</p>
                <p>To begin the second rank with any other number besides the second and the last,
                    must not, however, be looked on as an universal rule. It holds good for the
                    square of 7; but if the square of 9, for instance, were to be constructed, and
                    the fourth figure of the first horizontal rank were pitched on for the first of
                    the second, the consequence would be, that the fifth and eighth horizontal ranks
                    would likewise commence with the same number, which would therefore be repeated
                    three times in the same vertical rank, and occasion other repetitions in all the
                    rest. The general rule, therefore, must be conceived thus: Let the number in the
                    first rank pitched on for the commencement of the second, have such an exponent
                    for its quota; that is, let the order of its place be such that, if an unit be
                    taken from it, the remainder will not be any just quota part of the root of the
                    square, that is, cannot divide it equally. If, for example, in the square of 7,
                    the third number of the first horizontal, rank be pitched on for the first of
                    the second, such construction will be just; because the exponent of the place of
                    that number, viz. 3, subtracting 1, that is, 2, cannot divide 7. Thus also might
                    the fourth number of the same first rank be chosen, because 4 —1, or 3, cannot
                    divide 7; and, for the same reason, the fifth or sixth number might be taken;
                    but in the square of 9, the fourth number of the’first rank must not be taken,
                    because 4 —1, or 3, does divide 9. The reason of this rule will appear very
                    evident, by considering in what manner the returns of the same numbers do or do
                    not happen, taking them always in the same manner in any given series. And hence
                    it follows, that the fewer divisions the root of any square to be constructed
                    has, the more numerous are the different modes of constructing it; and that the
                    prime numbers, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> those which have no divisions, as 5,
                    7, 11, 13, &amp;c. are those whose squares will admit of the most variations in
                    proportion to their quantities.</p>

                <p>The squares constructed according to this method have some particular properties
                    not required in the problem; for the numbers that compose any rank parallel to
                    one of the two diagonals, are ranged in the same order with the numbers that
                    compose the diagonal to which they are parallel. And as any rank parallel to a
                    diagonal must necessarily be shorter, and have fewer cells, than the diagonal
                    itself, by adding to it the corresponding parallel, which has the number of
                    cells by which the other alls short of the diagonal, the numbers of these two
                    parallels, placed as it were end to end, still follow the same order with those
                    of the diagonal; besides that their sums are likewise equal, so that they are
                    magical on another account. Instead of the squares which we have hitherto formed
                    by horizontal ranks, one might also form them by vertical ones; the case is the
                    same in both.</p>

                <p>All that we have hitherto said regards only the first primitive square, whose
                    numbers, in the proposed example, were , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; there still remains
                    the second primitive, whose numbers are 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42. Μ. de la Hire
                    proceeds in he same manner here as in the former case; and this may likewise be
                    constructed in 20,160 different nodes, as containing the same number of terms
                    with the first. Its construction being made, and of consequence all its ranks
                    making the same sum, it is evident, that if we bring the two into one, by adding
                    together the numbers of the two corresponding cells of the two squares, that is,
                    the two numbers of the first of each, the two numbers of the second, of the
                    third, &amp;c. and dispose them in the forty-nine corresponding cells of a third
                    square, it will likewise be magical in regard to its rank, formed by the
                    addition of equal sums to equal sums, which must of necessity be equal amongst
                    themselves. All that remains in doubt is, whether or no, by the addition of the
                    corresponding cells of the two first squares, all the cells of the third will be
                    filled in such a manner that each not only contains one of the numbers of the
                    progression from 1 to 49, but also that this number be different from any of the
                    rest, which is the end and design of the whole operation.</p>

                <p>As to this it must be observed, that if, in the construction of the second
                    primitive square, care has been taken, in the commencement of the second
                    horizontal rank, to observe an order with regard to the first, different from
                    what was observed in the construction of the first square; for instance, if the
                    second rank of the first square began with the third term of the first rank, and
                    the second rank of the second square commence with the fourth of the first rank,
                    as in the example it aerially does; each number of the first square may be
                    combined once, and only once, by addition with all the numbers of the second.
                    And as the numbers of the first are here 1 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and those of the
                    second, 0, 7, 14, 21, 18, 35, 42; by combining them in this manner we have all
                    the numbers in the progression from 1 to 49, without having any of them
                    repeated; which the perfect magic square proposed.</p>

                <p>The necessity of constructing the two primitive squares in a different manner
                    does not at all prevent each of the 20,160 constructions of the one from being
                    combined with all the 20,160 constructions of the other; of consequence,
                    therefore, 20,160 multiplied by itself, which makes 406,425,600, is the number
                    of different constructions that may be made of the perfect square, which here
                    consists of the forty-nine numbers of the natural progression. But as we have
                    already observed that a primitive square of seven numbers repeated may have
                    above 20,160 several constructions, the number 406,425,600 must come vastly
                    short of expressing all the possible constructions of a perfect magic square of
                    the forty-nine first numbers.</p>
                <p>As to the even squares, Μ. de la Hire constructs them, like the uneven ones, by
                    two primitive squares; but the construction of primitives is different in
                    general, and may be so a great number of ways; and those general differences
                    admit of a great number of particular variations, which give as many different
                    constructions of the same even square. It seems scarcely possible to determine
                    exactly, either how many general differences there may be between the
                    construction of the primitive squares of an even square and an uneven one, or
                    how many particular variations each general difference may admit of; and, of
                    consequence, we are still far from being able to determine the number of
                    different constructions of all those that may be made by the primitive
                    squares.</p>
                <p>Dr Franklin seems to have carried this curious speculation farther than any of
                    his predecessors in the same way. He has constructed not only a magic square of
                    squares, but likewise a magic circle of circles. The details are not, however,
                    of such importance as to require particular notice in this place.</p>
