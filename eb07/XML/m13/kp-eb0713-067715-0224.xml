                <p><hi rend="italic">Powder</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Magazine</hi> is that
                    place where gunpowder is kept in large quantities. The first powder magazines
                    were made with Gothic arches; but Vauban finding them too weak, constructed them
                    in a semicircular form. Their usual dimensions are sixty feet long within, and
                    twenty-five broad; the foundations are eight or nine feet thick, and eight feet
                    high from the foundation to the spring of the arch; and the floor is two feet
                    from the ground, which secures it from dampness.</p>

                    battery, towards the parallels, and at least three feet under ground, to contain

                    built in the fore or after part of the hold, to contain the gunpowder used in
                    battle. This apartment is strongly secured against fire, and no person is
                    allowed to enter it with a lamp or candle; it is therefore lighted, as occasion
                    requires, by means of the candles or lamps in the <hi rend="italic"

                    something of an epocha in the literary history of this country. The periodical
                    performances before that time were almost wholly confined to political
                    transactions, and to foreign and domestic occurrences; but the monthly magazines
                    have opened a way for every kind of inquiry and information. The intelligence
                    and discussion contained in them are very extensive and various; and they have
                    been the means of diffusing a general habit of reading through the nation,
                    which, in a certain degree, hath enlarged the public understanding. Many young
                    authors, who have afterwards risen to considerable eminence in the literary
                    world, have here made their first attempts in composition. Here too are
                    preserved a multitude of curious and useful hints, observations, and facts,
                    which otherwise might have never appeared; or, if they had appeared in a more
                    evanescent form, would have incurred the danger of being lost.”</p>
