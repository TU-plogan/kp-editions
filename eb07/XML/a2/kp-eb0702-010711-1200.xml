                <p><label type="entry">ACOSTA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph d’</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated Spanish author, was born at Medina del Campo about the year 1539. In
                    1571, he went to Peru as a Provincial of the Jesuits, having entered into that
                    society in his fourteenth year. After a residence in America of seventeen years,
                    he returned to his native country, and became in succession visitor for his
                    order of Arragon and Andalusia, superior of Valladolid, and rector of Salamanca;
                    in which city he died in February 1600.</p>
                <p>About ten years before his death, he published at Seville, in one volume quarto,
                    his valuable work entitled <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Natural</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">Moral de las Indias.</hi>
                    The first two books of this history were written during his residence in Peru,
                    and were published separately after his return to Spain, in the Latin language,
                    with this title; <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Natura</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Novi</hi><hi rend="italic">Orbis, libri</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >duo.</hi> He afterwards translated them into Spanish, and added to them other
                    five books, the whole composing a connected work, under the first mentioned
                    title. This work, which has been translated into all the principal languages of
                    Europe, is written on a regular and comprehensive plan. The first five books are
                    employed upon the physical geography and natural history of that portion of
                    America which had been conquered or discovered by the Spaniards; the fifth and
                    sixth, upon the manners, religion, and civil institutions of the inhabitants;
                    and the last, upon the history of the Mexicans, from their origin till the
                    period of their subjugation. Dr Robertson pronounces Acosta “an accurate and
                    well-informed writer.” Among other things, he treats the subject of climate in a
                    more philosophical manner than could have been expected in a writer of that age,
                    and of his order. “He was the first philosopher,” says the eminent author just
                    quoted, “who endeavoured to account for the different degrees of heat in the old
                    and new continents, by the agency of the winds which blow in each —a theory
                    which was afterwards adopted by Buffon, and supported with his usual powers of
                    copious and eloquent illustration. In the course of these discussions, Acosta
                    frequently comments upon the opinion of Aristotle and other ancient
                    philosophers, that the middle zone of the earth <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193031213" xml:id="kp-eb0702-1213-0108"/>was so much scorched by the
                    rays of the sun as to be destitute of moisture and verdure, and totally
                    uninhabitable. This notion seems to have held its ground in the Schools, even
                    after the discovery of South America had disclosed the magnificent scenery and
                    stupendous rivers of the tropical regions. It appears to have been thought a
                    sort of impiety to question a dogma of such ancient date, and sanctioned by the
                    assent of all the school divines. We learn, from a curious passage in Osborne’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Miscellany of Essays, Paradoxes, and Letters,</hi> that the
                    exposing of this ancient error in geography was one of the circumstances which
                    brought upon the famous Sir Walter Raleigh the charge of general scepticism and
                    atheism. Acosta mentions, that, when he went to America, his mind was deeply
                    imbued with frightful notions of this supposed burning zone, and that his
                    surprise was great when he beheld it so different from what it had been
                    represented in the “ancient and received philosophy.” “What could I do then,”
                    says he, “but laugh at Aristotle’s meteors and his philosophy ?”</p>
                <p>Having said thus much in regard to one of the most curious and valuable of the
                    earlier accounts of the new world, it may be proper to add,, that, in speaking
                    of the conduct of his countrymen, and the propagation of their faith, Acosta is
                    in no respect superior to the other prejudiced and fanatical writers of his
                    country and age. Though he acknowledges that the career of Spanish conquest was
                    marked by the most savage cruelty and oppression, he yet represents this people
                    as the chosen instruments of the Deity for spreading the truths of the gospel
                    among the nations of America. He accordingly recounts a variety of miracles, as
                    a proof of the constant interposition of Heaven, in favour of these merciless
                    and rapacious invaders. It will appear from the following curious passage, that
                    he even makes the great enemy of mankind himself a co-operator in that scheme of
                    conversion for which he represents the Spaniards to have been predestined.
                    “That,” says he, “which is difficult in our law to believe, has been made easy
                    among the Indians; because the <hi rend="italic">Devil</hi> had made them
                    comprehend even the self-same things which he had stolen from our evangelical
                    law,—as their manner of confession, their adoration of three in one, and such
                    like; the which, against the will of the enemy, have holpen for the easy
                    receiving of the truth.”</p>
                <p>Besides his History, Acosta wrote the following works: 1. De Promulgatione
                    Evangelii apud Barbaros. 2. De Christo Revelato. 3. De Temporibus Novissimis,
                    ĩibri vi. 4. Concionum tomi iii. All of these works were, in their day,
                    frequently reprinted; but it is only by his History that his name is now known
                    in the literary world. The English translation, from which we have taken the
                    preceding extracts, was published at London in quarto m the year 1604, and is
                    now rather a scarce book.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Acosta,</hi><hi rend="italic">Uriel,</hi> a Portuguese, born
                    at Oporto towards the close of the sixteenth century. He was educated in the
                    Romish religion, which his father also professed, though descended from one of
                    those Jewish families who had been in a manner forced to receive baptism. Uriel
                    had a liberal education. He was instructed in several sciences, and at last he
                    studied law. He had by nature a good temper and mild disposition; and religion
                    had made so deep an impression on his mind, that he ardently desired to conform
                    to all the precepts of the church, to avoid eternal death, which he dreaded. He
                    applied with great assiduity to reading the Scriptures and other religious
                    books, carefully consulting also the creed of the confessors; but the more he
                    studied, the more difficulties occurred, which perplexed him at length to such a
                    degree, that, being unable to solve them, he fell into the most terrible agonies
                    of mind. He thought it impossible to fulfil his duty with regard to the
                    conditions required for' absolution; so that he despaired of salvation, if he
                    could find no other means of attaining it; and it proved difficult to abandon a
                    religion in which he had been bred up from his infancy, and which had been
                    deeply rooted in his mind. However, he began to inquire whether several
                    particulars mentioned about the other life were agreeable to reason; and, upon
                    inquiry and deliberation, he imagined that reason suggested many arguments
                    against them. Acosta was about two and twenty when he was thus perplexed with
                    doubts; and the result of his reflections was, that he could not be saved by the
                    religion which he had imbibed in his infancy. Nevertheless he prosecuted his
                    studies in the law, and at the age of five and twenty was made treasurer in a
                    collegiate church. Being naturally of a religious disposition, and now made
                    uneasy by the popish doctrines, he began to study Moses and the prophets; where
                    he thought he found more satisfaction than in the gospel, and at length became
                    convinced that Judaism was the true religion: and, as he could not profess it in
                    Portugal, he resolved to leave the country. He accordingly resigned his place,
                    and embarked for Amsterdam with his mother and brothers, whom he had ventured to
                    instruct in the principles of the Jewish religion, even when in Portugal. Soon
                    after their arrival in Amsterdam they became members of the synagogue, were
                    circumcised according to custom, and he changed his name of Gabriel for that of
                    Uriel. A little time was sufficient to show him, that the Jews did not, either
                    in their rites or morals, conform to the law of Moses, of which he could not but
                    declare his disapprobation: but the chiefs of the synagogue gave him to
                    understand, that he must exactly observe their tenets and customs, and that he
                    would be excommunicated if he deviated in the least from them. This threat,
                    however, had no effect; for he thought it would be a most mean behaviour in him,
                    who had left the sweets of his native country purely for liberty of conscience,
                    to submit to a set of Rabbis without any proper jurisdiction; and that it would
                    show both want of courage and piety if he should stifle his sentiments on this
                    occasion. He therefore persisted in his invectives, and in consequence was
                    excommunicated; the effect of which was such, that his own brothers durst not
                    speak to him, nor salute him when they met him in the streets. Finding himself
                    thus situated, he wrote a book in his justification, wherein he endeavours to
                    show that the rites and traditions of the Pharisees are contrary to the writings
                    of Moses; and soon after adopted the opinion of the Sadducees, for he had worked
                    himself up to a belief that the rewards and punishments of the old law relate
                    only to this life, and this because Moses nowhere mentions the joys of heaven or
                    the torments of hell. His adversaries were overjoyed at his embracing this
                    tenet, foreseeing that it would tend greatly to justify, in the sight of
                    Christians, the proceedings of the synagogues against him. Before his book was
                    printed, there appeared a piece upon the immortality of the soul, written by a
                    physician, who omitted nothing he could suggest to make Acosta pass for an
                    atheist. The very children were encouraged to insult him in the streets, and to
                    batter his house with stones; all which, however, did not prevent him from
                    writing a treatise against the physician, wherein he endeavoured to confute the
                    doctrine of the soul’s immortality. The Jews now made application to the
                    magistrates of Amsterdam, and informed against him, as one who wanted to
                    undermine the foundation of both Jewish and Christian religions. He was thrown
                    into prison, but bailed out within a week or ten days after; however, all the
                    copies of his works were <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031226"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-1226-0109"/> seized, and he himself fined in 300 florins.
                    Nevertheless, he proceeded still farther in his scepticism. He now bergan to
                    examine whether the law of Moses came from God; and he supposed he had at length
                    found reasons to convince him that it was only a political invention. Yet
                    instead of drawing from thence this inference, “I ought not to return to the
                    Jewish communion,” he thus argued with himself: “Why should I continue all my
                    life cut off from the communion, exposed to so many inconveniences, especially
                    as I am in a country where I am a stranger, and unacquainted with the language?
                    Had I not better play the ape among apes ?” He accordingly returned to the
                    Jewish church, after he had been excommunicated fifteen years; and, after having
                    made a recantation of what he had written, subscribed every thing as they
                    directed. A few days after, he was accused by a nephew, who lived in his house,
                    that he did not, as to his eating and many other points, conform to the laws of
                    the synagogue. This accusation was attended with very bad consequences; for a
                    relation of Acosta, who had got him reconciled to the synagogue, thought he was
                    in honour bound to persecute him with the utmost violence. The Rabbis and the
                    rest of the Jews were animated with the same spirit, especially when .they found
                    that Acosta had dissuaded two Christians, who had come from London to Amsterdam,
                    from turning Jews. He was summoned before the grand council of the synagogue;
                    when it was declared to him, that he must again be excommunicated, if he did not
                    give suĉh satisfaction as should be required. He found the terms so hard that he
                    could not comply. The Jews thereupon again expelled him from their communion;
                    and he afterwards suffered various hardships and great persecutions, even from
                    his own relations. After remaining seven years in a most wretched situation, he
                    at length declared he was willing to submit to the sentence of the synagogue,
                    having been told that he might easily accommodate matters; for that the judges,
                    being satisfied with his submission, would soften the severity of the
                    discipline. Acosta, however, was caught in a snare; for they made him undergo
                    the most rigorous penance. These particulars relating-to the life, of Acosta are
                    taken from his work entitled <hi rend="italic">Exemplar Humanae Vitae,</hi>
                    published and refuted by Limborch. It is supposed that he composed it a few days
                    before his death, after having determined to lay violent hands on himself. He
                    executed this horrid resolution a little after he had failed in his attempt to
                    kill his principal enemy; for the pistol with which he intended to shoot him as
                    he passed his house having missed fire, he immediately shut the door, and shot
                    himself with another pistol. This happened at Amsterdam, but in what year is not
                    exactly known.</p>
