                    over a syllable to direct the stress of its pronunciation. We generally reckon
                    three grammatical accents in ordinary use, all borrowed from the Greeks, viz.
                    the <hi rend="italic">acute accent ('),</hi> which shows when the tone of the
                    voice is to be raised; the <hi rend="italic">grave accent</hi> ('), when the
                    note or tone of the voice is to be depressed; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >circumflex accent (</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> a</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >),</hi> which is composed of both the acute and the grave, and points out a
                    kind of undulation of the voice. The Latins have made the same use as the Greeks
                    of these three accents.</p>
                <p>The Hebrews have a grammatical, a rhetorical, and a musical accent; though the
                    first and last seem, in effect, to be the same, both being comprised under the
                    general name of <hi rend="italic">tonic accents,</hi> because they give the
                    proper tones to syllables; as the rhetorical accents are said to be euphonic,
                    because they tend to make the pronunciation more sweet and agreeable. There are
                    four euphonic accents, and twenty-five tonic: of these some are placed above,
                    and others below the syllables; the Hebrew accents serving not only to regulate
                    the risings and fallings of the voice, but also to distinguish the sections,
                    periods, and members of periods, in a discourse, and to answer the same purposes
                    with the points in other languages. Their accents are divided into <hi
                    rend="italic">emperors, kings, dukes,</hi> &amp;c. each bearing a title
                    answerable to the importance of the distinction it makes. Their emperor rules
                    over a whole phrase, and terminates the sense completely; answering to our
                    point. Their king answers to our colon; and their duke to our comma. The king,
                    however, occasionally becomes a duke, and the duke a king, as the phrases are
                    more or less short. It must be noted, by the way, that the management and
                    combination of these accents in Hebrew poetry differ from their management and
                    combination in prose. The use of the tonic or grammatical accents has been much
                    controverted; some holding that they distinguish the sense, while others
                    maintain that they are only intended to regulate the music or singing, alleging
                    that the Jews sing rather than read the Scriptures in their synagogues.<note

                    >Dorn. Mosaic. Clav.</hi> p. 31.</p></note> Be this, however, as it will, it is
                    certain the ancient Hebrews were not acquainted with these accents. The opinion
                    which prevails amongst the learned is, that they were invented about the sixth
                    century, by the Jewish doctors of the school of Tiberias, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Massorets.</hi></p>
                <p>As to the Greek accents, now seen both in manuscripts and printed books, there
                    has been no less dispute about their antiquity and use than about those of the
                    Hebrews. Isaac Vossius endeavours to prove them of modern invention; asserting,
                    that anciently they had nothing of this kind, but only a few notes in their
                    poetry, which were invented by Aristophanes the grammarian, about the time of
                    Ptolemy Philopater; and that these were of musical rather than grammatical use,
                    serving as aids in the singing of their poems, and being very different from
                    those afterwards introduced. He also shows, from several ancient grammarians,
                    that the manner of writing the Greek accents in those days was quite different
                    from that which appears in our books. The author of <hi rend="italic">Lα
                    Methode</hi><hi rend="italic">Grecque,</hi> p.546, observes, that the right
                    pronunciation of the Greek language being natural to the Greeks, it was needless
                    for them to mark it by accents in their writings; so that, according to all
                    appearance, they only began to make use of them about the time when the Romans,
                    wishing to learn the Greek tongue, sent their children to study at Athens,
                    thinking thereby to fix the pronunciation, and to facilitate it to strangers;
                    which happened, as the same author observes, a little before Cicero’s time.
                    Wetstein, Greek professor at Basil, in a learned dissertation, endeavours to
                    prove the Greek accents of an older standing. He owns that they were not always
                    formed in the same manner by the ancients, but he thinks that difference owing
                    to the different pronunciation which obtained' in the different parts of Greece.
                    He also brings several reasons, <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> for the use of
                    accents, even in the earliest days: as, that all writing being then in capital
                    letters equidistant from each other, without any distinction either of Words or
                    phrases, it could scarcely have been rendered intelligible without accents; and
                    that accents were necessary to distinguish ambiguous words, and to point out
                    their proper meaning, as appears from a dispute in regard to a passage of Homer,
                    mentioned by Aristotle in his <hi rend="italic">Poetics,</hi> qhap. V.
                    Accordingly, he observes that the Syrians, who have tonic, but not distinctive
                    accents, have yet invented certain points, placed either below or above the
                    words, to show their mood, tense, person, or sense.</p>
                <p>Mr Browne of Trinity College, Dublin, has entered more deeply into this
                    investigation; and as he had an opportunity of conversing with the crew of a
                    Greek ship from Patras, a town situated not far distant from the ancient
                    Corinth, which had been driven by stress of weather into the port of Dingle in
                    Ireland, the result of his inquiries was, that the practice of the modern Greeks
                    is different from any of the theories that have been delivered in books. “It is
                    true,” he observes, “they have not two pronunciations for prose and for verse,
                    and in both they read by accent; but they make accent the cause of quantity,
                    they make it govern and control quantity, they make the syllable long on which
                    the acute accent falls, and they allow the acute accent to change the real
                    quantity. They always read poetry as well as prose by accent. Whether any
                    inference can hence be drawn as to the pronunciation of the ancients, I must
                    leave, after what I have premised above, to men of more learning; but I think it
                    at least so probable as to make it worth while to mention the instances which
                    occurred in proof of this assertion more particularly. Of the two first persons
                    whom I met, one, the steward of the ship, an inhabitant of the island of
                    Cephalonia, had had a school education: he read Euripides, and translated some
                    easier passages, without much difficulty. By a stay in this country of near two
                    years, he was able to speak English very tolerably, as could also the captain
                    and several of the crew; and almost all of them spoke Italian fluently. The
                    companion, however, of the steward· could speak only modern Greek, in which I
                    could discover that he was giving a description of the distress in which the
                    ship had been; and though not able to understand the context, I could plainly
                    distinguish many words, such as <hi rend="italic">δενδξα, ξυλοv,</hi> and among
                    the rest the sound of <hi rend="italic">Aν6ξωττος</hi> pronounced short. This
                    awoke my curiosity, which was still more heightened when I observed that he said
                    <hi rend="italic">Av0gωπων</hi> long, with the same attention to the alteration
                    of the accent with the variety of case, which a boy would be taught to pay at a
                    school in England. Watching therefore more closely, and asking the other to read
                    some ancient Greek, I found that they both uniformly pronounced according to
                    accent, without any attention to long or short syllables where accent came in
                    the way; and on their departure, one of them having bid me good day, by saying
                    <hi rend="italic">^Kαλημεgα,</hi> to which I answered <hi rend="italic"
                    >^Kαλημεgα,</hi> he with strong marks of reprobation set me right, and repeated
                    <hi rend="italic">^Kαλημεgα</hi>; and with like censure did the captain upon
                    another occasion observe upon my saying Socrates instead of Socrates.</p>
                <p>“I now had a strong wish to know whether they observed the distinction in this
                    respect usually between verse and prose; but from the little scholarship of the
                    two men with whom I had conversed, from the ignorance of a third whom I
                    afterwards met, (who however read Lucian with ease, though he did not seem ever
                    to have heard of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193030914"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-0914-0085"/>the book,) and on account of my imperfect mode of
                    conversing with them all, I had little hopes of satisfaction on the point-; nor
                    was I clear that they perfectly knew the difference between verse and prose. At
                    length, having met with the commander of the ship, and his clerk Athanasius <hi
                    rend="italic">Kονομος,</hi> and finding that the latter had been a schoolmaster
                    in the Morea, and had here learnt to speak English fluently, I put the question
                    to them in the presence of a very learned college friend, and at another time,
                    to avoid any error, with the aid of a gentleman who is perfectly master of the
                    Italian language. Both the Greeks repeatedly assured us that verse as well as
                    prose was read by accent, and not by quantity; and exemplified it by reading
                    several lines of Homer, with whose name they seemed perfectly well
                    acquainted.</p>
                <p>“I shall give an instance or two of their mode of reading:</p>

                </lg>
                <p>They made the ε in αzεwv, <hi rend="italic">πgοσε&lt;pη,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">εgετctς,</hi> long. But when they read</p>

                <p>they made the second syllable of the first word <hi rend="italic">~Kλυ0ι</hi>
                    short, notwithstanding the acute accent: on my asking why, they desired me to
                    look back on the circumflex on the first syllable, and said it thence
                    necessarily followed; for it is impossible to pronounce the first syllable with
                    the great length which the circumflex denotes, and not to shorten the second.
                    The testimony of the schoolmaster might be vitiated; but what could be stronger
                    than that of these ignorant mariners as to the vulgar common practice of modern
                    Greece? and it is remarkable that this confirms the opinion of Bishop Horsley,
                    that the tones of words in connection are not always the same with the tones of
                    solitary words, though in those of more than one syllable the accentual marks do
                    not change their position. I must here add, that these men confirmed an
                    observation which I have heard made, that we are much mistaken in our idea of
                    the supposed lofty sound of <hi rend="italic">πολv&lt;pλοισζοιο</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">i}αλασσης</hi>; that the
                    borderers on the coast of the Archipelago take their ideas from the gentle
                    laving of the shore by a summer wave, and not from the roaring of a winter
                    ocean; and they accordingly pronounced it <hi rend="italic">polyphlisveo
                    thalasses.</hi></p>
                <p>“I own that the observations made by me on the pronunciation of these modern
                    Greeks brought a perfectly new train of ideas into my mind. I propose them, with
                    humility, for the consideration of the learned; but they have made a strong
                    impression upon me, and approached, when compared with other admitted facts,
                    nearly to conviction. In short, I am strongly inclined to believe, that what the
                    famous treatise so often mentioned on the prosodies of the Greek and Latin
                    languages mentions as the peculiarity of the English, that we always prolong the
                    sound of the syllable on which the acute accent falls, is true, and has been
                    true of every nation upon earth. We know it is true of the modern Italians: they
                    read Latin in that respect just as we do, and say, <hi rend="italic">Arma
                    virumque cano,</hi> and, <hi rend="italic">In nova fert animus,</hi> as much as
                    we. And when we find the modern Greeks following the same practice, surely we
                    have some cause to suppose that the ancients did the same. In the English
                    language, indeed, quantity is not affected, because accent and quantity always
                    agree. Bishop Horsley endeavoured to prove that they did so in Greek, but this
                    is on the bold supposition that the accent doth not fall where the mark is
                    placed. The objection to this hypothesis, which seems to have been admitted by
                    all writers, and considered as decisive by some as to prose, by all as to verse,
                    is, that such a mode of pronunciation or reading must destroy metre, or <hi
                    rend="italic">rhythmus.</hi> From this position, however universal, or however
                    it may have been taken for granted, I totally dissent. That it will oppose the
                    metre or quantity I readily agree; but that it will destroy the rhythmus, (by
                    which, whatever learned descriptions there may have been of its meaning, I
                    understand nothing more than the melody or smooth flowing of the verses, or
                    their harmony, if you please, if harmony be properly applied to successive and
                    not synchronal sounds,) I can by no means admit. On the contrary, nothing can be
                    more disagreeable or unmelodious than the reading verse by quantity, or scanning
                    of it, as it is vulgarly called. Let us try the line so often quoted—</p>

                    arrangement, and disposition of the letters and syllables such as to be grating
                    and unmelodious to the ear. In like manner the feet of the verse may be exact,
                    but the stress laid upon particular syllables of it which follows the quantity
                    may totally destroy the melody: in short, the radical error seems to be the
                    confusion of quantity with melody, and the supposition that whatever is at war
                    with quantity and metre must be at war with melody.</p>
                <p>“It will be asked, then, what is the use of metre or measure in verse, if we are
                    not to read by it; and here is the grand difficulty; and I own with candour I
                    cannot answer it with perfect satisfaction to my own mind: to those, indeed, who
                    say we are to read by accent in prose, it may be equally asked, what is the use
                    of long or short syllables in prose, if we are not to attend to them when,
                    accent comes in the way; but to those who think otherwise, I can only answer,
                    that in the first place accent doth not always interfere, and then quantity is
                    our guide, and accent often accords with quantity. Secondly, metre determines
                    the number of feet or measures in each verse, and thereby produces a general
                    analogy and harmony through the whole; and it is to be observed, that, as I
                    apprehend, accent doth not change the number of feet, though it doth the nature
                    or species of them. Thus when we read</p>
                <l part="N"><hi rend="italic">Arma virumque cano, Trojae</hi><hi rend="italic">qui
                    primus ab</hi><hi rend="italic">oris,</hi></l>
                <p>we do not make more feet than when we scan the line, nor employ more time than in
                    pronouncing the next line, in which the accent happens to accord with the
                    quantity, viz.</p>
                <l part="N"><hi rend="italic">Italiam fato</hi><hi rend="italic">profiigus,
                    Lavinaque</hi><hi rend="italic">venit.</hi></l>
                <p>Thirdly, the poet in measuring his verse certainly must be confined to some
                    certain number and order of long and short syllables, in order to produce a
                    concordance through the whole, and even to regulate the position of accent,
                    which, though not subdued by quantity, will certainly have some relation to it,
                    <hi rend="italic">euphoniae gratia</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but surely the
                    length or shortness of a syllable cannot determine where emphasis shall be
                    placed—that must depend on the meaning and the thought; and it would be most
                    absurd for the poet to say to the reader, you shall not rest upon this emphatic
                    and significative word because its syllables are short, and wherever there is a
                    rest, there must be length and intonation.” <hi rend="italic">(Irish Trans,</hi>
                    vol. vii.)</p>
                <p>The use of accents to prevent ambiguities is most remarkably perceived in some
                    eastern languages, particularly the Siamese and Chinese. Among the people of
                    China, every <pb break="no" facs="nls:193030927" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0927-0086"
                    />word, or, which is the same thing, every syllable, admits of five accents,
                    according as it is spoken more acutely or remissly; and thus stands for many
                    different things. The same sound <hi rend="italic">ya,</hi> according to the
                    accent affixed to it, signifies <hi rend="italic">God, a wall, excellent,
                    stupidity,</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">goose.</hi> The Chinese have but 330
                    spoken words in their language; but these being multiplied by the different
                    accents or tones which’ affect the vowels, furnish a language tolerably copious.
                    By means of accents, their 330 simple sounds come to denote 1650 things; but
                    this being hardly sufficient, they are increased further by aspirates added to
                    each word, to double the number. The Chinese only reckon four <hi rend="italic"
                    >accents,</hi> for which the missionaries use the following marks, <hi
                    rend="italic">aa, a, à, a</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> to which they have added
                    a fifth, thus <hi rend="italic">α.</hi> They make a kind of modulation, wherein,
                    prolonging the duration of the sound of the vowel, they vary the tone, raising
                    and sinking it by a certain pitch of voice; so that their talking is a sort of
                    music or singing. Attempts have been made to determine the quantity of the rise
                    or fall on each accent by means of musical notes; but this is hard to effect, as
                    being different in different persons. Hence the great difficulty of the language
                    to foreigners, who are forced to sing most scrupulously; for if they deviate
                    ever so little from the accent, they say quite a different thing from what was
                    intended. Thus, meaning to compliment the person you are talking of with the
                    title <hi rend="italic">Sir,</hi> you call him a beast with the same word, only
                    a little varied in the tone. Magalhon, however, makes the language easier to
                    learn on this account. The Siamese are also observed to sing rather than to
                    talk. Their alphabet begins with six characters, all only equivalent to a K, but
                    differently accented. For though in the pronunciation the accents are naturally
                    on the vowels, yet they have some to diversify such of their consonants as are
                    in other respects the same.</p>
