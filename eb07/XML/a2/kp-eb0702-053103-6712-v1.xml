                    previously consulting the stars, or, in other words, their almanacks, or some of
                    the makers of them. From these people, by their vicinity to Europe, this art, no
                    less useful in one sense than trifling and ridiculous in another, has passed
                    over hither; and those astronomical compositions have still everywhere not only
                    retained their old Arabic name, but were, like theirs, for a long while, and
                    still are among many European nations, interspersed with a great number of
                    astrological rules for planting, sowing, bleeding, purging, &amp;c. down to the
                    cutting of the hair and paring of the nails. Regiomontanus appears to have been
                    the first in Europe, however, who reduced almanacks into their present form and
                    method, gave the characters of each year and month, foretold the eclipses and
                    other phases, calculated the motions of the planets, &amp;c. His first almanack
                    was published in 1474.</p>
                <p>The essential part of an almanack is the calendar of months and days, with the
                    risings and settings of the sun, age of the moon, &amp;c. To these are added
                    lists of posts, offices, dignities, public institutions, with many other
                    articles, political as well as local, and differing in different countries.</p>
                <p>England has abounded in almanacks, some of them of no very creditable
                    description, though widely circulated among the people for a long period of
                    years. Such, in particular, were <hi rend="italic">Moore's</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Almanach,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Poor Robins Almanack,</hi> now happily,
                    with several others of the same class, either extinct or about to become so.
                    This change has been mainly owing to the publication of an entirely new almanack
                    by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. The following statement is
                    extracted from a curious article upon <hi rend="italic">English Almanacks,</hi>
                    in the <hi rend="italic">London Magazine,</hi> third series, vol. ii. p. 591.
                    “For a century and a half, the two-universities and the Stationers’ Company held
                    the monopoly of them, by letters patent of James I. During this period,
                    according to the condition of the patent, almanacks received the imprimatur of
                    the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishops of London; and yet it would be
                    difficult to find, in so small a compass, an equal quantity of ignorance,
                    profligacy, and imposture, as was condensed into these publications. By the
                    persevering exertions of one individual, the monopoly was overthrown about 1779;
                    and the parties claiming the patentright then applied to parliament for an act
                    to confirm it. That bill was introduced by the minister of the day; but Erskine,
                    then first coming into repute, appeared at the bar to oppose it,—and the
                    monopoly was destroyed for ever, by a solemn vote of the House of Commons. From
                    that time the Stationers’ Company proceeded upon a different course. They
                    secured their monopoly by buying up all rival almanacks; and they rendered the
                    attempts of individuals to oppose them perfectly hopeless, by those arts of
                    trade which a powerful corporation knew how to exercise. For the last fifty
                    years they have rioted, as of old, in every abomination that could delude the
                    vulgar to the purchase of their commodity. On a sudden a new almanack started
                    up, under the superintendence and authority of a society distinguished for its
                    great and successful labours to improve’ the intellectual condition of the
                    people. For the first time in the memory of man, an almanack at once rational
                    and popular was produced. 'From that hour the empire of astrology was at an end.
                    The public press, infinitely to their honour, took up the cause. The blasphemy
                    of Francis Moore, and the obscenity of Poor Robin, were denounced and ridiculed
                    through all quarters of the kingdom. In one little year the obscene book was
                    discontinued, the blasphemous book retreated into pure stupidity, and the
                    publishers of the blasphemy and the obscenity applied themselves, in imitation
                    of the first powerful rival they had ever encountered, to make a rational and
                    useful almanack.” The almanack of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful
                    Knowledge is entitled the <hi rend="italic">British Almanack;</hi> the improved
                    one, published in imitation of it by the Stationers’ Company, is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Englishmans Almanack.</hi></p>
                <p>The French <hi rend="italic">Almanack Royal</hi> is one of the most extern sive
                    publications of this class, the volume for 1829 extending to nearly a thousand
                    octavo pages.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">ALMANACK,</hi><hi rend="italic">Nautical.</hi> This, which in
                    some respects is a national almanack, is published under the sanction of the
                    Board of Longitude, and is designed chiefly to facilitate the use of Mayer’s
                    Lunar Tables, by superseding the necessity of making calculations to determine
                    the longitude at sea. It commenced with the year 1767, and has ever since been
                    continued annually, but two or three years in advance. The late Dr Maskelyne was
                    the originator of this very valuable publication. It is now published under the
                    immediate superintendence of the secretary to the Board. Similar to this
                    almanack is the French publication entitled <hi rend="italic">Connoissance des
                    Terns,</hi> directed by the <hi rend="italic">Bureau, de Longitude,</hi> and
                    which commenced so early as the year 1698.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Almanacks,</hi> among <hi rend="italic">Antiquaries,</hi> is
                    also the name given to a kind of instrument, usually of wood, inscribed with
                    various figures and Runic characters, and representing the order of the feasts,
                    dominical letters, days of the week, and golden number, with other matters
                    necessary to be known throughout the year; used by the ancient northern nations
                    in their computations of time, both civil and ecclesiastical. Almanacks of this
                    kind are known by various names among the different nations in which they have
                    been used, as rimstocks, primstaries, runstocks, runstaffs, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scipiones Runici, Bacculi</hi><hi rend="italic">Annales,</hi> clogs, &amp;c.
                    They appear to have been used only by the Swedes, Danes, and Norwegians. From
                    the second of these people their use was introduced into England, whence divers
                    remains of them in the counties. Dr Plot has given the description and figure of
                    one of these clogs, found in Staffordshire, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Perpetual Staffordshire Almanack.</hi> The external figure and matter of
                    these calendars appear to have been various. Sometimes they were cut on one or
                    more wooden leaves, bound together after the manner of books; sometimes on the
                    scabbards of swords, or even daggers; sometimes on tools and implements, as
                    portable steelyards, hammers, the helves of hatchets, flails, &amp;c. Sometimes
                    they were made of brass or horn; sometimes of the skins of eels, which being
                    drawn over a stick properly inscribed, retained the impressions of it But the
                    most usual form was that of walking staves, or sticks, which they carried about
                    with them to church, market, &amp;c. Each of these staves is divided into three
                    regions; whereof the first indicates the signs, the second the days of the week
                    and year, and the third the golden number. The characters engraven on them are,
                    in some, the ancient Runic; in others, the latter Gothic characters of Ulfilas.
                    The saints’ days are expressed in hieroglyphics, significative either of some
                    endowment of the saint, the manner of his martyrdom, or the like. Thus, against
                    the notch for the first of March, or St David’s day, is represented a harp;
                    against the 25th of October, or Crispin s day, a pair of shoes; against the 10th
                    of August, or ðt Lawrence’s day, a gridiron; and, lastly, against New-year’s
                    day, a horn, the symbol of liberal potations, which our ancestors indulged in at
                    that period.</p>
