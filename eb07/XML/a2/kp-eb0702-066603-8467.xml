                <p><label type="entry">AMPHIBIA</label>, a term in <hi rend="italic">Zoology</hi>
                    bestowed on different groups of animals, and with a considerable variety of
                    signification. When rigorously interpreted, it applies to very few animals, as,
                    with rare exceptions, naturalists know of no species which are strictly
                    amphibious; that is to say, possessed of the power of performing the vital act
                    of respiration either in air or water. When intended, however, merely to express
                    the habit of existing alternately for a time in either of these elements, the
                    term <hi rend="italic">amphibious</hi> applies to various groups, which have
                    little in common with each other. Hence the artificial mode of arrangement
                    adopted by Gesner and the older naturalists, who, taking into consideration
                    chiefly the habitations of animals, bestowed the name of amphibia on beavers,
                    otters, frogs, and other incongruous genera. Linnaeus applied the name, in his
                    earlier works, to a class composed of reptiles and chondropterygeous fishes; but
                    he afterwards restricted it to reptiles alone possessed of cold red blood and a
                    simple circulation. The amphibia of Baron Cuvier, again, are such of the
                    mammalia or mammiferous quadrupeds as are enabled by their motive organs to
                    dwell in water as well as on the land; for example, seals, sea lions, the
                    walrus, &amp;c. In his system they occupy an intermediate station between the
                    feline and marsupial or pouched animals.· They pass the greater portion of their
                    time at sea, and seldom come ashore except to suckle their young, or dry their
                    moistened furs by exposure to sun and air. Their power of sustaining without
                    injury a long-continued submersion does not, however, result from a continuance
                    of <hi rend="italic">the foramen ovale,</hi> by which it was supposed that the
                    blood of these creatures passed from one chamber of the heart to another,
                    without the necessity of being propelled through the lungs. Seals do not differ
                    in that respect from other animals.</p>
                <p>Buffon was of opinion that the newly born young of all mammiferous quadrupeds
                    might be submerged in a nourishing fluid without depriving them of life, because
                    their circulation at that early period was supposed to resemble that of
                    amphibious reptiles. Experiments, however, on this subject would no doubt have
                    accorded perfectly with those of Le Gallois, instituted with a view to ascertain
                    the possibility of dividing the spinal marrow without the production of death.
                    It is singular that Daubenton, his skilful and laborious coadjutor, did not
                    remind Buffon that the foetus, while suspended in the liquid of the amnios,
                    receives oxygenated blood from the mother, whilst after birth a necessity ensues
                    for the vital act of respiration being performed by the individual itself. It is
                    also known that the <hi rend="italic">foramen ovale</hi> does not exist at the
                    period of birth, except in such species as are destined to enjoy a continuance
                    of that peculiarity of structure; from which we may infer that a primordial
                    disposition of organs is of greater importance, and less easily alterable, than
                    many modern physiologists are accustomed to suppose.</p>
                <p>The principal characteristic of reptiles in general consists in this, that only a
                    portion of the blood is transmitted through the lungs, the remainder being
                    projected by the heart directly to the other parts of the body, without being
                    specially subjected to the influence of the respiratory organs; whereas in the
                    higher classes, such as man, the rest of the mammalia, and birds, the whole of
                    the blood must pass by the lungs before it is retransmitted to the more distant
                    parts of the circulating system. The respiration of animals, or the process by
                    which the blood is oxygenated, becomes weaker and less frequent in proportion to
                    the diminution which takes place in the quantity of blood transmitted to the
                    lungs, compared with that which passes directly from the heart; and as it is
                    respiration which warms the blood, and produces in the fibres their
                    susceptibility of nervous irritation, it follows, as observed by Cuvier, that
                    the blood of reptiles is cold, and their muscular strength much less than that
                    of birds or quadrupeds. The seat of their sensations is also much less
                    centralized than in the last named classes; and hence many of them exhibit life
                    and motion long after their heads have been severed from their bodies.</p>
                <p>A truly amphibious animal, according to the proper meaning of the term, ought to
                    possess the power of breathing under water like a fish, and of respiring the
                    atmospheric air like a land animal. According to this interpretation, neither
                    seals nor beavers, nor even whales, are truly amphibious; for they cannot
                    sustain their existence under water except by aid of a certain portion of air
                    which they have inspired at the surface. In like manner, neither the frog nor
                    the tadpole is amphibious (unless it may be for a short time at a certain
                    intermediate period of life); for the former only seeks the water as a place of
                    temporary resort, in which, however, it cannot breathe; and the latter is
                    entirely aquatic, being unprovided with lungs, and consequently unable to
                    respire, except through the medium of water. A frog can therefore only be said
                    to be amphibious in as far as it possesses, at two distinct periods of its life,
                    the faculty of living first in the water and then on the land; but its habit of
                    life is by no means optional, and the change of structure, both in the
                    respiratory and digestive system, as it passes from the immature to the adult
                    state, is among the most extraordinary in the whole range of the animal economy.
                    Born with gills, and destitute of external members, its form and functions are
                    rather those of a fish than of a reptile; but as it advances in growth, the four
                    limbs become developed, the tail decreases, and finally disappears, the jaws are
                    formed, the gills are absorbed, and their uses are supplied by lungs. It can no
                    longer breathe under water.</p>
                <p>Among the many wonderful anomalies with which the kingdom of nature presents us,
                    there exist, however, certain truly amphibious animals, classed under the genera
                    <hi rend="italic">oĩ Proteus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Siren,</hi> both of
                    which are provided at one and the same time with the gills of a fish and the
                    lungs of a terrestrial creature; but their habits and propensities<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193038480" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8480-0667"/> are decidedly aquatic. The
                    former inhabit the subterranean waters of Carniola; the latter (of which there
                    are several species) occur among the marshes and ricefields of South Carolina.
