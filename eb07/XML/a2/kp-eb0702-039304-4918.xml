                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    bishop of Shireburn in the time of the Saxon Heptarchy. He is said to have been
                    the son of Kenred, brother to Ina, king of the West Saxons; but in the opinion
                    of William of Malmesbury, his father was no more than a distant relation to the
                    king. Having received the first part of his education in the school which one
                    Maldulph, a learned Scot, had set up in the place where Malmesbury now stands,
                    he travelled into France and Italy for his improvement. At his return home he
                    studied some time under Adrian, abbot of St Augustin’s, in Canterbury, the most
                    learned professor of the sciences who had ever been in England. In these
                    different seminaries he acquired a very uncommon stock of knowledge, and became
                    famous for his learning, not only in England, but in foreign countries; whence
                    several learned men sent him their writings for his perusal and correction;
                    particularly Prince Arcivil, a son of the king of Scotland, who wrote many
                    pieces, which he sent to Aldhelm, “entreating him to give them the last polish,
                    by rubbing off their Scotch rust.” He was the first Englishman who wrote in the
                    Latin language, both in prose and verse, and composed a book for the instruction
                    of his countrymen in the prosody of that language. Besides this, he wrote
                    several other treatises on various subjects, some of which are lost, and others
                    published by Martin Delrio and Canisius. Venerable Bede, who flourished in the
                    end of this and the beginning of the next century, gives the following character
                    of Aldhelm: “He was a man of universal erudition, having an elegant style, and
                    being wonderfully well acquainted with books, both on philosophical and
                    religious subjects.” In fact, considering the cloud of ignorance by which he was
                    surrounded, and the great difficulty of acquiring knowledge without prpper
                    instruction, Aldhelm was a very extraordinary man. From one of his letters to
                    Hedda, bishop of Winchester, concerning the nature of his studies whilst at
                    Canterbury, he appears to have been indefatigably determined to acquire every
                    species of learning in his power. For a copy of this curious epistle, see
                    Henry’s <hi rend="italic">History,</hi> vol. ii. p. 320. King Alfred the Great
                    declared that Aidhelm was the best of all the Saxon poets; and that a favourite
                    song, which was universally sung in his time,near 200 years after its author’s
                    death, was of his composition. When he was abbot of Malmesbury, having a fine
                    voice, and great skill in music as well as poetry, and observing the
                    backwardness of his barbarous countrymen to listen to grave instructions, he
                    composed a number of little poems, which he sung to them after mass in the
                    sweetest manner, by which they were gradually instructed and civilized. After
                    this excellent person had governed the monastery of Malmesbury, of which he was
                    the founder, about 30 years, he was made bishop of Shirebum, where he died A.
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">d.</hi> 709.—He wrote, 1. De octo Vitiis principalibus.
                    This treatise is extant in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Patrum</hi> of
                    Canisius. 2. Aenigmatum versus mille. This, with several others of his poems,
                    was published by Martin Delrio at Mentz, 1601, 8vo. 3. A book addressed to a
                    certain king of Northumberland, named Alfrid, on various subjects. 4. De Vita
                    Monachorum. 5. De Laude Sanctorum. 6. De Arithmetica. 7. De Astrologia. 8. A
                    book against the mistake of the Britons concerning the celebration of Easter;
                    printed by Sonius, 1576. 9. De Laude Virginitatis; manuscript, in Bennet
                    College, Cambridge; published among Bede’s <hi rend="italic">Opuscula.</hi>
                    Besides many sonnets, epistles, and homilies in the Saxon language.</p>
