                <p><label type="entry">ALLEYN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Edward</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated English actor in the reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James, and
                    founder of the college of Dulwich in Surrey, was born at London, in the parish
                    of St Botolph, on the 1st of September 1566, as appears from a memorandum of his
                    own writing. Dr Füller says that he was bred a stage-player, and that his father
                    would have given him a liberal education, but that he was not turned for a
                    serious course of life. He was, however, a youth of an excellent capacity, a
                    cheerful temper, a tenacious memory, a sweet elocution, and in his person of a
                    stately port and aspect; all which advantages might well induce a young man to
                    take to the theatrical profession. By several authorities we find he must have
                    been on the stage some time before 1592; for at that time he was in high favour
                    with the town, and greatly applauded by the best judges, particularly by Ben
                    Jonson.</p>
                <p>Haywood, in his prologue to Marlow’s <hi rend="italic">Jew of Malta,</hi> calls
                    him Proteus for shapes, and Roseius for a tongue. He usually played the capital
                    parts, and was one of the original actors in Shakspeare’s plays; in some of Ben
                    Jonson’s he was also a principal performer: but what characters he personated in
                    any of their plays, it is difficult now to determine. This is owing to the
                    inaccuracy of their editors,, who did not print the names of the players
                    opposite to, the characters they performed, as the modern custom is; but gave
                    one general list of actors to the whole set of plays, as in the old folio
                    edition of Shakspeare; or divided one from the other, setting the dramatis
                    personae before the plays, and the catalogue of performers after them, as in
                    Jonson’s.</p>
                <p>It may appear surprising how one of Mr Alleyn’s profession should be enabled to
                    erect such an edifice as Dulwich College, and liberally endow it for the
                    maintenance of so many persons. But it must be observed that he had some
                    paternal fortune, which, though small, might lay a foundation for his future
                    affluence; and it is to be presumed, that the profits he received from acting,
                    to one of his provident and managing disposition, and one who by his excellence
                    in playing drew after him such crowds of spectators, must have considerably
                    improved his fortune: besides, he was not only actor, but master of a playhouse
                    built at his own expense, by which he is said to have amassed considerable
                    wealth. He was also keeper of the king’s wild beasts, or master of the. royal
                    bear-garden, which was frequented by vast crowds of spectators; and the profits
                    arising from these sports are said to have amounted to L.500 per annum. He was
                    thrice married; and the portions of his first two wives, they leaving him no
                    issue to inherit, might probably contribute to this benefaction. Such donations
                    have been frequently thought to proceed more from vanity and ostentation than
                    real piety; but this of Mr Alleyn has been ascribed to a very singular cause,
                    for the devil has been said to be the first promoter of it. Mr Aubrey mentions a
                    tradition, that Mr Alleyn playing a demon, with six others, in one of
                    Shakspeare’s plays, was in the midst of the play surprised by an apparition of
                    the devil; which so worked on his fancy, that he made a vow, which he performed
                    by building Dulwich College. He began the foundation of this college, under, the
                    direction of Inigo Jones, in 1614; and the buildings, gardens, &amp;c. were
                    finished in 1617, in which he is said to have expended about L.10,000. After the
                    college was built, he met with some difficulty in obtaining a charter for
                    settling his lands in mortmain; for he proposed to endow it with L.800 per
                    annum, for the maintenance of one master, one warden, and four fellows, three
                    whereof were to be clergymen, and the fourth a skilful organist; also six poor
                    men and as many women, besides twelve poor boys to be educated till the age of
                    fourteen or sixteen, and then put out to some trade or calling. The obstruction
                    he met with arose from the lord chancellor Baeon, who wished King James to
                    settle part of those lands for support of two academical lectures; and he wrote
                    a letter to the marquis of Buckingham, dated August 18, 1618, entreating him to
                    use his interest with his majesty for that purpose. Mr Alleyn’s solicitation
                    was, however, at last complied with, and he obtained the royal licence, giving
                    him full power to lay his foundation, by his majesty’s letters patent, bearing
                    date the 21st of June 1619; by virtue whereof he did, in the chapel at the said
                    new hospital at Dulwich, called <hi rend="italic">The College of God’s
                    Gift,</hi> on the 13th of September following, pubicll read and publish a
                    quadripartite writing in parchment, whereby he created and established the said
                    college; he then subscribed it with his name, and fixed his seal to several
                    parts thereof, in presence of several honourable persons, and ordered copies of
                    the writings to four different parishes. He was himself the first master of his
                    college; so that, to make use of the words of Mr Haywood, one of his
                    contemporaries, ‘ He was so mingled with humility and charity, that he became
                    his own pensioner, humbly submitting himself to that proportion of diet and
                    clothes which he had bestowed on others.’ We have no reason to think he ever
                    repented of this distribution of his substance; but, on the contrary, that he
                    was entirely satisfied, as appears from the following memorial in his own
                    writing, found amongst his papers.—‘ May 26, 1620. My wife and I acknowledged
                    the fine at the common pleas bar, of all our lands to the college: blessed be
                    God that he hath given us life to do it.’” His wife died in the year 1623; and
                    about two years afterwards he married Constance Kinehtoe, who survived him, and
                    received remarkable proofs of his affection, if at least we may judge of it by
                    his will, in which he left her considerable property. He died on the 25th of
                    November 1626, in the 61st year of his age, and was buried in the chapel of his
                    new college, where there is a tomb-stone over his grave, with an inscription.
                    His original diary is also there preserved.</p>
                <p>The subjoining anecdote is entertaining in itself, and shows the high esteem in
                    which Mr Alleyn was held as an actor :—“Edward Alleyn, the Garrick of
                    Shakspeare’s time, had been on the most friendly footing with our poet, as well
                    as Ben Jonson. They used frequently to spend their evenings together at the sign
                    of the Globe, somewhere near Blackfriars, where the playhouse then was. The
                    world need not be told, that the convivial hours of such a triumvirate must be
                    pleasing as well as profitable, and may be said to be such pleasures as might
                    bear the reflections of the morning. In consequence of one of these meetings,
                    the following letter was written by G. Peele, a student of Christ Church
                    College, Oxford, and a dramatic poet, who belonged to the Club, to one Marle, an
                    intimate of his <pb break="no" facs="nls:193036647" xml:id="kp-eb0702-6647-0526"
                    />‘ Friend Marle,</p>
                <p>‘ I must desyr that my syster hyr watch, and the cookerie book you promysed, may
                    be sente bye the man. I never longed for thy company more than last night: we
                    were all very merrye at the Globe, when Ned Alleyn did not scruple to affyrme
                    pleasauntly to thy Friende Will, that he had stolen his speech about thee
                    Qualityes of art actor’s excellencye in Hamlet hys Tragedye, from conversations
                    manyfold which had passed betweene them, and opinyons given by Alleyn touching
                    the subjecte. Shakspeare did not take this talke in good sorte; but Janson put
                    an ende to the strife with wittylye remarkinge, <hi rend="italic">This affaire
