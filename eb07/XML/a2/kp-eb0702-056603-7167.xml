                <p><label type="entry">ALTAR</label>, a place upon which sacrifices were anciently
                    offered to some deity. The heathens at first made their altars only of turf;
                    afterwards they were made of stone, of marble, of wood, and even of horn, as
                    that of Apollo in Delos. Altars differed in figure as well as in materials: some
                    were round, others square, and others triangular. All of them were turned
                    towards the east, and stood lower than the statues of the gods; and they were
                    generally adorned with sculpture, representing either the gods to whom they were
                    erected, or their symbols. The height of altars also differed according to the
                    different gods to whom they sacrificed. According to Servius, those altars set
                    apart for the honour of the celestial gods, and gods of the higher class, were
                    placed on some pretty tall pile of building, and for that reason were called <hi
                    rend="italic">altaria,</hi> from the words <hi rend="italic">alta</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ara,</hi> a high elevated altar. Those appointed for the
                    terrestrial gods were laid on the surface of the earth, and called <hi
                    rend="italic">arce.</hi> And, on the contrary, they dug into the earth and
                    opened a pit for those of the infernal gods, which they called <hi rend="italic"
                    >ßoôgo/, λα×xοι,</hi><hi rend="italic">scrobiculi.</hi> But this distinction is
                    not everywhere observed: the best authors frequently use <hi rend="italic"
                    >ara</hi> as a general word, under which are included the altars of the
                    celestial and infernal, as well as those of the terrestrial gods. The Greeks
                    also distinguished two sorts of altars: that whereon they sacrificed to the gods
                    was called <hi rend="italic">βωμος,</hi> and was a real altar, different from
                    the other whereon they sacrificed to the heroes, which was smaller, and called
                    <hi rend="italic">ιdχ</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> ι</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >αξα,</hi> Pollux makes this distinction of altars in his Onomastico: he adds,
                    however, that some poets used the word <hi rend="italic">ε&lt;%οοξa</hi> for the
                    altar whereon sacrifice was offered to the gods. The Septuagint version does
                    sometimes also use the word i&lt;; ’ χαgα for a sort of little low altar, which
                    may be expressed in Latin by <hi rend="italic">craticula,</hi> being a hearth
                    rather than an altar.</p>
                <p>Before temples were in use, altars were erected sometimes in groves, sometimes in
                    the highways, and sometimes on the tops of mountains; and it was a custom to
                    engrave upon them the name, ensign, or character of the deity to whom they were
                    consecrated.</p>
                <p>In the great temples of ancient Rome there were generally three altars: the first
                    was placed in the sanctuary, at the foot of the statue of the divinity, upon
                    which incense was burnt and libations offered; the second was before the gate of
                    the temple, and upon it they sacrificed the victims; and the third was a
                    portable altar, upon which were placed the offering and the sacred vessels.
                    Besides these uses of altars, the ancients swore upon them and swore by them, in
                    making alliances, confirming treaties of peace, and on other solemn occasions.
                    Altars also served as places of refuge for all those who fled to them.</p>
                <p>Altars are doubtless as ancient as sacrifices themselves; consequently their
                    origin is not much later than that of the world. (Gen. chap, iv.) Some attribute
                    their origin to the Egyptians, others to the Jews, others to the patriarchs
                    before the flood. Some carry them as far back as Adam, whose altar is much
                    spoken of by Jewish, and even Christian writers; others are contented to make
                    the patriarch Enoch the first who consecrated a public altar. Be this as it may,
                    the earliest altars of which we find any express testimony are those erected by
                    Abraham.</p>
                <p>Altars, in the patriarchal times, were very rude. The altar which Jacob set up at
                    Bethel was nothing but a stone, which served him instead of a bolster; that of
                    Gideon, a stone before his house: and the first which God commanded Moses to
                    erect was probably of earth or unpolished stones, without any iron; for if any
                    use was made of that metal, the altar was declared impure.</p>
                <p>The principal altars of the Jews were, the altar of <hi rend="italic"
                    >incense,</hi> that of <hi rend="italic">burnt-offering,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">altar</hi> or <hi rend="italic">table for the show-bread.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">altar of incense</hi> was a small table of shittim wood,
                    covered with plates of gold, of one cubit in length, another in width, and two
                    in height. At the four comers were four kinds of horns, and all round a little
                    border or crown over it. This was the altar hidden by Jeremiah before the
                    captivity; and upon it the officiating priest every morning and evening offered
                    incense of a particular composition.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">altar of burnt-offerings</hi> was made of shittim wood, and
                    carried upon the shoulders of the priests by means of staves of the same wood
                    overlaid with brass. In the time of Moses this altar was five cubits square and
                    three high; but in Solomon’s temple it was much larger, being twenty cubits
                    square and ten in height. It was covered with brass; and at each corner was a
                    horn or spire, wrought out of the same wood with the altar, to which the
                    sacrifices were tied. Within the hollow was a grate of brass, in which the fire
                    was placed; through it fell the ashes, which were received in a pan below. At
                    the four comers of the grate were four rings and four chains, which kept it up
                    at the horns. This altar was placed in the open air, that the smoke of the
                    burnt-offerings might not sully the inside of the tabernacle.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">altar</hi> or <hi rend="italic">table</hi> for the <hi
                    rend="italic">show-bread</hi> was likewise of shittim wood, covered with plates
                    of gold, having a little border round it adorned with sculpture. It was two
                    cubits long, one wide, and one and a half in height. Upon this table, which
                    stood in the holy of holies, were put, every Sabbath day, twelve loaves, with
                    salt and incense.</p>
                <p>After the return of the Jews from the captivity, and the building of the second
                    temple, their altars were in some respects different from those described above.
                    That of burnt-offerings was a large pile, built of unhewn stone, 32 cubits
                    square at the bottom, and 24 square at the top. The ascent was by a gentle
                    rising, 32 cubits in length and 16 in breadth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Altar</hi> is also used among Christians for the
                    communion-table. In the primitive church the altars were only of wood, it being
                    frequently necessary to remove them from place to place; but the council of
                    Paris in 509 decreed that no altar should be built but of stone. At <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193037180" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7180-0567"/> first there was
                    but one altar in each church, but the number soon increased; and from the
                    writings of Gregory the ,Great, who lived in the sixth century, we learn that
                    there were sometimes in the same church twelve or thirteen. In the cathedral of
                    Magdeburg there are no less than 49 altars.</p>
                <p>The altar is sometimes sustained on a single column, as in the subterraneous
                    chapels of St Cecilia at Rome, &amp;c.; and sometimes on four columns, as the
                    altar of St Sebastian of Crypta Arenaria; but the customary form is, a massive
                    frame of stone-work sustaining the altar table. These altars bear a resemblance
                    to tombs: consequently we read in ecclesiastical history that the primitive
                    Christians chiefly held their meetings at the tombs of the martyrs, and
                    celebrated the mysteries of religion upon them; for which reason it is a
                    standing rule to this day in the church of Rome, never to build an altar without
                    inclosing the relics of some saint in it.</p>
