                <p><label type="entry">ALLIGATION</label>, the name of a method of solving all
                    questions that relate to the mixture of one ingredient with another. Though
                    writers on arithmetic generally make alligation a branch of that science, yet,
                    as it is plainly nothing more than an application of the common properties of
                    numbers^ in order to solve a few questions that occur in particular branches of
                    business, we choose rather to keep it distinct from the science of
                    arithmetic.</p>
                <p>Alligation is generally divided into <hi rend="italic">medial</hi> and <hi

                    quantities of the simples.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rules.</hi> I. Place the rate of the mixture on the left side
                    of a brace, as the root; and on the right side of the brace set the rates of the
                    several simples, under one another, as the branches. II. Link or alligate the
                    branches, so as one greater and another less than the root may be linked or
                    yoked together. III. Set the difference between the root and the several
                    branches right against their respective yoke-fellows. These alternate
                    differences are the quantities required. <hi rend="italic">Note</hi> 1. If any
                    branch happen to have two or more yoke-fellows, the difference between the root
                    and these yoke-fellows must be placed right against the said branch, one after
                    another, and added into one sum. 2. In some questions the branches may be
                    alligated more ways than one; and a question will always admit of so many
                    answers as there are different ways of linking the branches.</p>
                <p>Alligation alternate admits of three varieties, viz.</p>
                <p>1. The question may be unlimited, with respect both to the quantity of the
                    simples and that of the mixture.</p>
                <p>2. The question may be limited to a certain quantity of one or more of the
                    simples. 3. The question may be limited to a certain quantity of the
                    mixture.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Variety</hi> I. When the question is unlimited, with respect
                    both to the quantity of the simples and that of the mixture, this is called <hi
                    rend="italic">Alligation Simple.</hi><hi rend="italic">Example.</hi> A grocer
                    would mix sugars at 5d∙, 7d., and 10d. per lb., so as to sell the mixture or

                <p>Here the rate of the mixture 8 is placed on the left side of the brace as the
                    root; and on the right side of the same brace are set the rates of the several
                    simples, viz. 5, 7,10, under one another, as the branches; according to Rule
                    I.</p>
                <p>The branch 10 being greater than the root, is alligated or linked with 7 and 5,
                    both these being less than the root, as directed in Rule II.</p>
                <p>The difference between the root 8 and the branch 5, viz. 3, is set right against
                    this branch’s yoke-fellow 10; the difference between 8 and 7 is likewise set
                    right against the yoke-fellow 10; and the difference between 8 and 10, viz. 2,
                    is set right against the two yoke-fellows 7 and 5, as prescribed by Rule
                    III.</p>
                <p>As the branch 10 has two differences on the right, viz. 3 and 1, they are added;
                    and the answer to the question <pb break="no" facs="nls:193036660"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-6660-0527"/>is, that 2 lb. at 5d., 2 lb. at 7d., and 4 lb. at
                    10d., will make 'the mixture required.</p>
                <p>The truth and reason of the rules will appear by considering, that whatever is
                    lost upon any one branch is gained upon its yoke-fellow. Thus, in the above
                    example, by selling 4 lb. of 10d. sugar at 8d. per lb. there is 8d. lost: but
                    the like sum is gained upon its two yoke-fellows; for by selling 2 lb. of 5d.
                    sugar at 8d. per lb. there is 6d. gained; and by selling 2 lb. of 7d. sugar at
                    8d. there is 2d. gained; and 6d. and 2d. make 8d.</p>
                <p>Hence it follows, that the rate of the mixture must always be mean or middle with
                    respect to the rates of the simples; that is, it must be less than the greatest,
                    and greater than the least; otherwise a solution would be impossible. And the
                    price of the total quantity mixed, computed at the rate of the mixture, will
                    always be equal to the sum of the prices of the several quantities cast up at
                    the respective rates of the simples.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Variety</hi> II. When the question is limited to a certain
                    quantity of one or more of the simples, this is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alligation Partial.</hi></p>
                <p>If the quantity of one of the simples only bo limited, alligate the branches, and
                    take their differences, as if there had been no such limitation; and then work
                    by the following proportion :—</p>
                <p>As the difference right against the rate of the simple whose quantity is
