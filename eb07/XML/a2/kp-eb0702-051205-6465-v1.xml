                <p><label type="entry">ALHAMBRA</label>, the ancient fortress and residence of the
                    Moorish monarchs of Granada. It derives its name from the red colour of the
                    materials with which it was originally built, Alhambra signifying a red house.
                    It appears to a traveller a huge heap of as ugly buildings as can well be seen,
                    all huddled together, seemingly without the least intention of forming <hi
                    rend="italic">one</hi> habitation out of them. The walls are entirely
                    unornamented, all gravel and pebbles, daubed over with plaster by a very coarse
                    hand; yet this is the palace of the Moorish-kings of Granada, indisputably the
                    most curious place within that exists in Spain, perhaps in the world. In many
                    countries may be seen excellent modern as well as ancient architecture, both
                    entire and in ruins; but nothing to be met with anywhere else can convey an idea
                    of this edifice, except the decorations of an opera, or the tales of the
                    genii.</p>
                <p>Passing round the corner of the emperor’s palace, one is admitted at a plain,
                    unornamented door in a corner. On my first visit, says Mr Swinburne (<hi
                    rend="italic">Travels in Spain),</hi> I confess I wąs struck with amazement, as
                    I stept over the threshold, to find myself on a sudden transported into a
                    species of fairy land. The first place you come to is the court called the <hi
                    rend="italic">commwna</hi> or <hi rend="italic">del mesucar,</hi> that is, the
                    <hi rend="italic">common baths</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> an oblong square,
                    with a deep basin of clear water in the middle; two flights of marble steps
                    leading down to the bottom; on each side a parterre of flowers, and a row of
                    orange trees. Round the court runs a peristyle paved with marble; the arches
                    bear upon very slight pillars, in proportions and style different from all the
                    regular orders of architecture. The ceilings and walls are in-crustated with
                    fretwork in stucco, so minute and intricate that the most patient draughtsman
                    would find it difficult to follow it, unless he made himself master of the
                    general plan. This would facilitate the operation exceedingly; for all this work
                    is frequently and regularly repeated at certain distances, and has been executed
                    by means of square moulds applied successively, and the parts joined together
                    with the utmost nicety. In every division are Arabic sentences of different
                    lengths, most of them expressive of the following meanings: “There is no
                    conqueror but God;” or, “Obedience and honour to our lord Abouab-doulah.” The
                    ceilings are gilt or painted, and time has caused no diminution in the freshness
                    of their colours, though constantly exposed to the air. The lower part of the
                    walls is Mosaic, disposed in fantastic knots and festoons. A work so novel, so
                    exquisitely finished, and so different from all that he has ever seen, must
                    afford a stranger the most agreeable sensations while he treads this magic
                    ground. The porches at the ends are more like grotto-work than any thing else to
                    which they can be compared. That on the right hand opens into an octagon vault,
                    under the emperor’s palace, and forms a perfect whispering gallery, meant to be
                    a communication between the offices of both houses.</p>
                <p>Opposite to the door of the communa through which you enter, is another leading
                    into the <hi rend="italic">quarto de lοs leones,</hi> or apartment of the lions,
                    which is an oblong court, 100 feet in length and 50 in breadth, environed with a
                    colonnade seven feet broad on the sides and 10 at the end. Two porticoes or
                    cabinets, about 15 feet square, project into the court at the two extremities.
                    The square is paved with coloured tiles, the colonnade with white marble. The
                    walls are covered five feet up from the ground with blue and yellow tiles,
                    disposed chequerwise. Above and below is a border of small escutcheons,
                    enamelled blue and gold, with an Arabic motto on a bend, signifying, “No
                    conqueror but God.” The columns that support the roof and gallery are of white
                    marble, very slender, and fantastically adorned. They are nine feet high,
                    including base and capital, and eight inches and a half in diameter. They are
                    very irregularly placed; sometimes singly, at others in groups of three, but
                    more frequently two together. The width of the horse-shoe arches above them is
                    four feet two inches for the large ones, and three for the smaller. The ceiling
                    of the portico is finished in a much finer and more complicated manner than that
                    of the communa, and the stucco laid on the walls with inimitable delicacy; in
                    the ceiling it is so artfully frosted and handled as to exceed belief. The
                    capitals are of various designs, though each design is repeated several times in
                    the circumference of the court, but not the least attention has been paid to
                    placing them regularly or opposite to each other. Not the smallest
                    representation of animal life can be discovered amidst the varieties of
                    foliages, grotesques, and strange ornaments. About each arch is a large square
                    of arabesques, surrounded with a rim of characters, tha are generally quotations
                    from the Koran. Over the pillars is another square of delightful filligree work,
                    up is a wooden rim, or kind of corniçe, as much ennche <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193036478?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-6478-0513"/> with carving
                    as the stucco that covers the part underneath. Over this projects a roof of red
                    tiles, the only thing that disfigures this beautiful square. This ugly covering
                    is a modern addition made by a late prime minister, who a few years ago gave the
                    Alhambra a thorough repair. In Moorish times the building was covered with large
                    painted and glazed tiles, of which a few are still to be seen In the centre of
                    the court are twelve ill-made lions muzzled, their fore parts smooth, their hind
                    parts rough, which bear upon their backs an enormous basin, out of which a
                    lesser rises. While the pipes were kept in good order, a great volume of water
                    was thrown up, that, falling down into the basins, passed through the beasts,
                    and issued out of their mouths into a large reservoir, where it communicated by
                    channels with the <hi rend="italic">jets ďeau</hi> in the apartments. This
                    fountain is of white marble, embellished with many festoons and Arabic
                    distiches.</p>
                <p>Passing along the colonnade, and keeping on the south side, you come to a
                    circular room occupied by the men as a place for drinking coffee, &amp;c. A
                    fountain in the middle refreshed the apartment in summer. The form of this hall,
                    the elegance of its cupola, the cheerful distribution of light from above, and
                    the exquisite manner in which the stucco is designed, painted, and finished,
                    exceed all power of description. Every thing in it inspires the most pleasing,
                    voluptuous ideas; yet in this sweet retreat they pretend that Abouabdoulah
                    assembled the Abencerrages, and caused their heads to be struck off into the
                    fountain. Continuing your walk round, you are next brought to a couple of rooms
                    at the head of the court, which are supposed to have been tribunals, or
                    audience-chambers.</p>
                <p>Opposite to the <hi rend="italic">sala</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">los</hi><hi rend="italic">Abencerrages</hi> is the entrance into
                    the <hi rend="italic">torre</hi><hi rend="italic">de las dos hermanas,</hi> or
                    the tower of the two sisters; so named from two very beautiful pieces of marble,
                    laid as flags in the pavement. This gate exceeds all the rest in profusion of
                    ornaments, and in beauty of prospect which it affords through a range of
                    apartments, where a multitude of arches terminate in a large window open to the
                    country. In a gleam of sunshine, the variety of tints and lights thrown upon
                    this enfilade are uncommonly rich. The first hall is the concert room, where the
                    women sat; the musicians played above in four balconies. In the middle is ay⅛
                    <hi rend="italic">ďeau.</hi> The marble pavement is equal to the finest
                    existing, for the size of the flags and evenness of the colour. The two sisters,
                    which give name to the room, are slabs that measure 15 feet by seven and a half,
                    without flaw or stain. The walls, up to a certain height, are mosaic, and above
                    are divided into very neat compartments of stucco, all of one design, which is
                    also followed in many of the adjacent halls and galleries. The ceiling is a
                    fretted cove. To preserve this vaulted roof, as well as some of the other
                    principal cupolas, the outward walls of the towers are raised ten feet above the
                    top of the dome, and support another roof over all, by which means no danger can
                    ever be caused by wet weather or excessive heat and cold. From this hall you
                    pass round the little myrtle garden of Lindaraxa, into an additional building
                    made to the east end by Charles V. The rooms are small and low. His dear motto,
                    <hi rend="italic">Plus outre,</hi> appears on every beam. This leads to a little
                    tower projecting from the line of the north wall, called <hi rend="italic">el
                    tocador,</hi> or the dressing-room of the sultana, ļt is a small square cabinet,
                    in the middle of an open gallery, from which it receives light by a door and
                    three windows. The look-out is charming. In one corner is a large marble flag,
                    drilled full of holes, through which the smoke of perfumes ascended from
                    furnaces below; and here, it is presumed, the Moorish queen was wont to sit to
                    fumigate and sweeten her person. The emperor caused this pretty room to be
                    painted with representations of his wars, and a great variety of grotesques,
                    which appear to be copies, or at least imitations, of those in the loggie of the
                    Vatican. From hence you go through a long passage to the hall of ambassadors,
                    which is magnificently decorated with innumerable varieties of mosaics, and the
                    mottoes of all the kings of Granada. This long narrow anti-chamber opens into
                    the communa on the left hand, and on the right into the great audience-hall in
                    the tower of Comares; a noble apartment, 36 feet square, 36 high up to the
                    cornice, and 18 from thence to the centre of the cupola. The walls on three
                    sides are 15 feet thick, on the other nine; the lower range of windows 13 feet
                    high. The whole wall is inlaid with mosaic of many colours, disposed in
                    intricate knots, stars, and other figures. In every part various Arabic
                    sentences are repeated.</p>
                <p>Having thus completed the tour of the upper apartments, which are upon a level
                    with the offices of the new palace, you descend to the lower floor, which
                    consisted of bed-chambers and summer-rooms: the back stairs and passages, that
                    facilitated the intercourse between them, are without number. The most
                    remarkable room below is the king’s bed-chamber, which communicated by means of
                    a gallery with the upper story. The beds were placed in two alcoves, upon a
                    raised pavement of blue and white tiles; but as it was repaired by Philip V. who
                    passed some time here, it cannot be said how it mđy have been in former times. A
                    fountain played in the middle, to refresh the apartment in hot weather. Behind
                    the alcoves are small doors, that conduct you to the royal baths. These consist
                    of one small closet with marble cisterns for washing children, two rooms for
                    grown up persons, and vaults for boilers and furnaces that supplied the baths
                    with water and the stoves with vapours. The troughs are formed of large slabs of
                    white marble; the walls are beautiful with party-coloured earthen ware: light is
                    admitted by holes in the coved ceiling.</p>
                <p>Fiard by is a whispering gallery, and a kind of labyrinth, said to have been made
                    for the diversion of the women and children. One of the passages of
                    communication is fenced off with a strong iron grate, and called <hi
                    rend="italic">the prison of the Sultana</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but it
                    seems more probable that it was put up to prevent any body from climbing into
                    the division allotted to the women.</p>
                <p>Under the council-room is a long slip, called <hi rend="italic">the hings
                    study</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and adjoining to it are several vaults, said
                    to be the place of burial of the royal family. In the year 1574 four sepulchres
                    were opened; but as they contained nothing but bones and ashes, they were
                    immediately closed again.</p>
                <p>This description of the Alhambra may be finished by observing how admirably every
                    thing was planned and calculated for rendering this palace the most voluptuous
                    of all retirements; what plentiful supplies of water were brought to refresh it
                    in the hot months of summer; what a free circulation of air was contrived, by
                    the judicious disposition of doors and windows; what shady gardens of aromatic
                    trees; what noble views over the beautiful hills and fertile plains. No Wonder
                    the Moors regretted Granada! no wonder that they still offer up prayers to God
                    every Friday for the recovery of this city, which they regard as a terrestrial
                    paradise!</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alhambra,</hi> a town of 4000 inhabitants, in the department
                    of Infantes, and province of La Mancha, in Spain.</p>
