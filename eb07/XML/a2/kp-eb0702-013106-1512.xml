                <p><label type="entry">ACTIO</label>, in Roman antiquities, an action at law in a
                    court of justice. The formalities used by the Romans, in judicial actions, were
                    these: If the difference failed to be made up by friends, the injured person
                    proceeded <hi rend="italic">in jus reum vocare,</hi> to summon the offending
                    party to the court, who was obliged to go, or give bond for his appearance.</p>
                <p>The offending party might be summoned into court <hi rend="italic">viva
                    voce,</hi> by the plantiff himself meeting the defendant, declaring his
                    intention to him, and commanding him to go before the magistrate and make his
                    defence. If he would not go willingly, he might drag and force him along, unless
                    he gave security for his appearance on some appointed day. If he failed to
                    appear on the day agreed on, then the plaintiff, whensoever he met him, might
                    take him along with him by force, calling any by-standers to bear witness, by
                    asking them <hi rend="italic">visne</hi><hi rend="italic">antestari</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">?</hi> The by-standers upon this turned their ear toward him in
                    token of their consent. To this Horace alludes in his satire against the
                    impertinent, lib. i. sat. 9.</p>
                <p>Both parties being met before the pretor, or other supreme magistrate presiding
                    in the court, the plaintiff proposed the action to the defendant, in which he
                    designed to prosecute him. This they termed <hi rend="italic">edere</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">actionem;</hi> and was commonly performed by writing it in a
                    tablet, and offering it to the defendant, that he might see whether he had
                    better stand the suit or compound.</p>
                <p>In the next place came the <hi rend="italic">postulatio actionis,</hi> or the
                    plaintiff’s petition to the pretor for leave to prosecute the defendant in such
                    an action. The petition was granted by writing at the bottom of it <hi
                    rend="italic">octionem do,</hi> or refused by writing in the same manner <hi
                    rend="italic">actionem non do.</hi></p>
                <p>The petition being granted, the plaintiff <hi rend="italic">vadabatur reum,
                    i.</hi><hi rend="italic">e.</hi> obliged him to give sureties for his appearance
                    on such a day in the court; and this was all that was done in public before the
                    day fixed upon for the trial.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the difference was often made up either <hi rend="italic"
                    >transactione,</hi> by letting the cause fall as dubious; or <hi rend="italic"
                    >pactione,</hi> by composition for damages amongst friends.</p>
                <p>On the day appointed for hearing, the pretor ordered the several bills to be
                    read, and the parties summoned by an <hi rend="italic">accensus,</hi> or
                    beadle.</p>
                <p>Upon the non-appearance of either party, the defaulter lost his cause: if they
                    both appeared, they were said <hi rend="italic">se</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >stetisse;</hi> and then the plaintiff proceeded <hi rend="italic">litem sive
                    actionem</hi><hi rend="italic">intendere, i.</hi><hi rend="italic">e.</hi> to
                    prefer his suit; which was done in a set form of words, varying according to the
                    difference of the actions. After this the plaintiff desired judgment of the
                    pretor, that is, to be allowed a <hi rend="italic">judex</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">arbiter,</hi> else the <hi rend="italic">recuperatores</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">centumviri.</hi> These he requested for the hearing and deciding
                    the business: but none of them could be desired but by the consent of both
                    parties.</p>
                <p>The pretor, having assigned them their judges, defined and determined the number
                    of witnesses to be admitted, to hinder the protracting of the suit; and then the
                    parties proceeded to give their caution, that the judgment, whatever it was,
                    should stand and be performed on both sides. The judges took a solemn oath to be
                    impartial; and the parties took the <hi rend="italic">juramentum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">calumniae.</hi> Then the trial began with the assistance of
                    witnesses, writings, &amp;c. which was called <hi rend="italic"
                    >disceptatio</hi><hi rend="italic">causae.</hi></p>
