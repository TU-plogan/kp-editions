                <p><label type="entry">ABACUS</label>, among the ancients, was a kind of cupboard or
                    buffet. Livy, describing the luxury into which the Romans degenerated after the
                    conquest of Asia, says they had their <hi rend="italic">abaci,</hi> beds,
                    &amp;c. plated over with gold.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Abacus,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Abaciscus,</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">Architecture,</hi> signifies the superior part or member of the
                    capital of a column, and serves as a kind of crowning to both. Vitruvius tells
                    us the abacus was originally intended to represent a square tile laid over an
                    urn, or rather over a basket. The form of the abacus is not the same in all
                    orders: in the Tuscan, Doric, and Ionic, it is generally square; but in the
                    Corinthian and Composite, its four sides are arched inwards, and embellished in
                    the middle with some ornament, as a rose or other flower. Scammozzi uses <hi
                    rend="italic">abacus</hi> for a concave moulding on the capital of the Tuscan
                    pedestal; and Palladio calls the plinth above the echinus, or boultin, in the
                    Tuscan and Doric orders, by the same name.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Abacus</hi> is also the name of an ancient instrument for
                    facilitating operations in arithmetic. The exhibition of numbers by counters
                    appears happily fitted for unfolding the principles of calculation. In the
                    schools of ancient Greece, the boys acquired the elements of knowledge by
                    working on a smooth board with a narrow rim,—the <hi rend="italic">Abax</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> so named, evidently, from the combination of A, B, Γ, the
                    first letters of their alphabet, resembling, except perhaps in size, the tablet
                    likewise called A, B, C, on which the children with us used to begin to learn
                    the art of reading. The pupils, in those distant ages, were instructed to
                    compute, by forming progressive rows of counters, which, according to the wealth
                    or fancy of the individual, consisted of small pebbles, of round bits of bone or
                    ivory, or even of silver coins. From <hi rend="italic">fynφος,</hi> the Greek
                    word for a <hi rend="italic">pebble,</hi> comes the verb <hi rend="italic"
                    >ψη&lt;ριζειν,</hi> to <hi rend="italic">compute.</hi> But the same board served
                    also for teaching the rudiments of writing and the principles of Geometry. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Abax</hi> being strewed with green sand, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pulvis eruditus</hi> of classic authors, it was easy, with a <hi rend="italic"
                    >radius</hi> or small rod, to trace letters, draw lines, construct triangles, or
                    describe circles.—Besides the original word A, Sαξ, the Greeks had the
                    diminutive <hi rend="italic">Αβαχιον∙,</hi> and it seems very probable, that
                    this smaller board was commonly used for calculations, while the larger one was
                    reserved among them for the purpose of tracing geometrical diagrams.</p>
                <p>To their calculating board the ancients make frequent allusions. It appears, from
                    the relation of Diogenes Laertius, that the practice of bestowing on pebbles an
                    artificial value, according to the rank or place which they occupied, remounts
                    higher than the age of Solon, the great reformer and legislator of the Athenian
                    commonwealth. This sagacious observer and disinterested statesman, who was,
                    however, no admirer of regal government, used to "compare the passive ministers
                    of kings or tyrants to the counters or pebbles of arithmeticians, which are
                    sometimes most important, and at other times quite insignificant.<note

                    employs further the verb <hi rend="italic">οοντανελειν,</hi> which means <hi
                    rend="italic">to take up as many counters as were laid down.</hi> It is evident,
                    therefore, that the ancients, in keeping their accounts, did not separately draw
                    together the credits and the debts, but set down pebbles for the former, and
                    took up pebbles for the latter. As soon as the board became cleared, the
                    opposite claims were exactly balanced. We may observe, that the phrase <hi
                    rend="italic">to clear ones scores or accounts,</hi> meaning to settle or adjust
                    them, is still preserved in the popular language of Europe, being suggested by
                    the same practice of reckoning with counters, which prevailed indeed until a
                    comparatively late period.</p>
                <p>The Romans borrowed their <hi rend="italic">Abacus</hi> from the Greeks, and
                    never aspired higher in the pursuit of science. To each pebble or counter
                    required for that board they gave the name of <hi rend="italic">calculus,</hi> a
                    diminutive formed from <hi rend="italic">calx, a stone</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and applied the verb <hi rend="italic">calculare,</hi> to signify the
                    operation of combining or separating such pebbles or counters. Hence innumerable
                    allusions by the Latin authors. <hi rend="italic">Ponere calculum</hi><hi

                    were used instead of pebbles, and small silver coins came to supply the place of
                    counters. Under the emperors, every patrician living in a spacious mansion, and
                    indulging in all the pomp and splendour of eastern princes, generally
                    entertained, for various functions, a nu- ' merous train of foreign slaves or

                <p>To facilitate the working by counters, the construction of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >abacus</hi> was afterwards improved. Instead of the perpendicular lines or
                    bars, the board had its surface divided by sets of parallel grooves, by
                    stretched wires, or even by successive rows of holes. It was easy to move small
                    counters in the grooves, to slide perforated beads along the wires, or to stick
                    large nobs or round-headed nails in the different holes. To diminish the number
                    of marks required, every column was surmounted by a shorter one, wherein each
                    counter had the same value as five of the ordinary kind, being half the index of
                    the Denary Seale. The <hi rend="italic">abacus,</hi> instead of wood, was often,
                    for the sake of convenience and durability, made of metal, frequently brass, and
                    sometimes silver. In the Plate entitled <hi rend="smallcaps">Arithmetic,</hi> we
                    have copied, from the third volume of the Supplement added by Polenus to the
                    immense Thesaurus of Graevius, two varieties of this instrument, as used by the
                    Romans. They both rest on good authorities, having been delineated from antique
                    monuments,—the first kind by Ursinus, and the second by Marcus Velserus. In the
                    one, the numbers are represented by flattish perforated beads, ranged on
                    parallel wires; and, in the other, they are signified by small round counters
                    moving in parallel grooves. These instruments contain each seven capital bars,
                    expressing in order <hi rend="italic">units, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten
                    thousands, hundred thousands,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">millions</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and above them are shorter bars following the same
                    progression, but having five times the relative value. With <hi rend="italic"
                    >four</hi> beads on each of the long wires, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193029900" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9900-0007"/><hi rend="italic">one</hi>
                    bead on every corresponding short wire, it is evident <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    that any number could be expressed, as far as <hi rend="italic">ten
                    millions.</hi></p>
                <p>In all these, the <hi rend="italic">Denary Scale</hi> is followed uniformly; but
                    there is, besides, a small appendage to the arrangement founded on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Duodenary System.</hi> Immediately below the place of units is
                    added a bar, with its corresponding branch, both marked Θ, being designed to
                    signify <hi rend="italic">ounces,</hi> or the twelfth parts of a pound. <hi
                    rend="italic">Five</hi> beads on the long wire, and <hi rend="italic">one</hi>
                    bead on the short wire, equivalent now to <hi rend="italic">six,</hi> would
                    therefore denote <hi rend="italic">eleven</hi> ounces. To express the simpler
                    fractions of an ounce, three very short bars are annexed behind the rest; a bead
                    on the one marked S or 5, the contraction for <hi rend="italic">Semissis,</hi>
                    denoting <hi rend="italic">half an ounce</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a bead on
                    the other, which is marked by the inverted Q, the contraction for <hi
                    rend="italic">Sicilicum,</hi> signifying the <hi rend="italic">quarter of an
                    ounce</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and a bead on the last very short bar, marked
                    2, a contraction for the symbol + or <hi rend="italic">Dinae Sextulae,</hi>
                    intimating a <hi rend="italic">duella</hi> or <hi rend="italic">two-sixths,</hi>
                    that is, <hi rend="italic">the third part of an ounce.</hi> The second form of
                    the <hi rend="italic">abacus</hi> differs in no essential respect from the
                    first, the grooves only supplying the place of parallel wires.</p>
                <p>We should observe that the Romans applied the same word <hi rend="italic"
                    >abacus,</hi> to signify an article of luxurious furniture, resembling in shape
                    the arithmetical board, but often highly ornamental, and destined for a very
                    different purpose,—the relaxation and the amusement of the opulent. It was used
                    in a game apparently similar to that of chess, which displayed a lively image of
                    the struggles and vicissitudes of war. The infamous and abandoned Nero took
                    particular delight in this sort of play, and drove along the surface of the
                    abacus with a beautiful <hi rend="italic">quadriga,</hi> or chariot of
                    ivory.</p>
                <p>The civil arts of Rome were communicated to other nations by the tide of victory,
                    and maintained through the vigour and firmness of her imperial sway. But the
                    simpler and more useful improvements survived the wreck of empire, among the
                    various people again restored by fortune to their barbarous independence. In all
                    transactions wherein money was concerned, it was found convenient to follow the
                    procedure of the Abacus, in representing numbers by counters placed in parallel
                    rows. During the middle ages, it became the usual practice over Europe for
                    merchants, auditors of accounts, or judges appointed to decide in matters of
                    revenue, to appear on a covered <hi rend="italic">bank</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >bench,</hi> so called, from an old Saxon or Franconian word, signifying a <hi
                    rend="italic">seat.</hi> Hence those terms were afterwards appropriated to
                    offices for receiving pledges, chambers for the accommodation of money-dealers,
                    or courts for. the trying of questions respecting property or the claims of the
                    Crown. Hence also the word <hi rend="italic">bankrupt,</hi> which occurs in all
                    the dialects of Europe. The term <hi rend="italic">scaccarium,</hi> from which
                    was derived the French, and thence the English name for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Exchequer,</hi> anciently signified merely a <hi rend="italic"
                    >chess-board,</hi> being formed from <hi rend="italic">scaccum,</hi> denoting
                    one of the movable pieces in that intricate game. The. reason of this
                    application of the term is sufficiently obvious. The table for accounts was, to
                    facilitate the calculations, always covered with a cloth, resembling the surface
                    of the <hi rend="italic">scaccariwm</hi> or <hi rend="italic">abacus,</hi> and
                    distinguished by perpendicular and <hi rend="italic">chequered</hi> lines. The
                    learned Skene was therefore mistaken in supposing that the Exchequer derived its
                    name from the play of chess, because its suitors appear to fight a keen and
                    dubious battle.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Because

                <p>The Court of Exchequer, which takes cognizance of all questions of revenue, was
                    introduced into England by the Norman conquest. Richard Fitznigel, in a treatise
                    or dialogue on the subject, written about the middle of the twelfth century,
                    says that the <hi rend="italic">scaccarium</hi> was a quadrangular table about
                    ten feet long and five feet broad, with a ledge or border about four inches
                    high, to prevent any thing from rolling over, and was surrounded on all sides by
                    seats for the judges, the tellers, and other officers. It was covered every
                    year, after the term of Easter, with fresh black cloth, divided by perpendicular
                    white lines, or distinctures, at intervals of about a foot or a palm, and again
                    parted by similar transverse lines. In reckoning, they proceeded, he says,
                    according to the rules of arithmetic,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>He calls it <hi rend="italic">Arisrnciica:</hi> In the <hi

                    exhibited <hi rend="italic">pence,</hi> the one above it <hi rend="italic"
                    >shillings,</hi> the next <hi rend="italic">pounds</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and the higher bars denoted successively <hi rend="italic">tens, twenties,
                    hundreds, thousands,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ten thousands</hi> of pounds;
                    though, in those early times of penury and severe economy, it very seldom
                    happened that so large a sum as the last ever came to be reckoned. The first
                    bar, therefore, advanced by <hi rend="italic">dozens,</hi> the second and third
                    by <hi rend="italic">scores,</hi> and the rest of the stock of bars by the
                    multiples of <hi rend="italic">ten.</hi> The teller sat about the middle of the
                    table; on his right hand <hi rend="italic">eleven</hi> pennies were heaped on
                    the first bar, and a pile of <hi rend="italic">nineteen</hi> shillings on the
                    second; while a quantity of pounds was collected opposite to him, on the third
                    bar. For the sake of expedition, he might employ a different mark to represent
                    half the value of any bar, a silver penny for ten shillings, and a gold penny
                    for ten pounds.</p>
                <p>In early times, a chequered board, the emblem of calculation, was hung out, to
                    indicate an office for changing money. It was afterwards adopted as the sign of
                    an inn or <hi rend="italic">hostelry,</hi> where victuals were sold, or
                    strangers lodged and entertained. We may perceive traces of that ancient
                    practice existing even at present. It is customary in London, and in some
                    provincial towns, to have a chequer, diced with red and white, painted against
                    the sides of the door of a chop-house.</p>
                <p>The use of the smaller <hi rend="italic">abacus</hi> in assisting numerical
                    computation was not unknown during the middle ages. In England, however, it
                    appears to have scarcely entered into actual practice, being mostly confined to
                    those “slender clerks” who, in such a benighted period, passed for men of
                    science and learning. The calculator was styled, in correct Latinity, <hi
                    rend="italic">abacista</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but, in the Italian dialect,
                    <hi rend="italic">abbachista,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">abbachiere.</hi> A
                    different name came afterwards to be imposed. The Arabians, who, under the
                    appellation of Saracens or Moors, conquered Spain, and enriched that insulated
                    country by commendable industry and skill, had likewise introduced their
                    mathematical science. Having adopted a most refined species of numeration, to
                    which they gave the barbarous name of <hi rend="italic">algaris-mus,
                    algorismus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">algorithmus,</hi> from the definite
                    article <hi rend="italic">al,</hi> and the Greek word <hi rend="italic"
                    >αζι6μος,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">number,</hi> this compound term was adopted
                    by the Christians of the West, in their admiration of superior skill, to signify
                    calculation in general, long before the peculiar mode had become known and
                    practised among them. The term <hi rend="italic">algarism</hi> was corrupted in
                    English into <hi rend="italic">augrim</hi> or <hi rend="italic">awgrym,</hi> as
                    printed by Wynkyn <pb break="no" facs="nls:193029913"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-9913-0008"/>de Worde, at the end of the fifteenth century; and
                    applied even to the pebbles or counters used in ordinary calculation. In
                    confirmation of this remark, we shall not scruple to quote a passage from our
                    ancient poet Chaucer, who flourished about a century before, and whose verses,
                    however rude, are sometimes highly graphic.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">abacus,</hi> with its store of counters, wanted the
                    valuable property of being portable, and was at all times evidently a clumsy and
                    most incommodious implement of calculation. In many cases, it became quite
                    indispensable to adopt some sure and ready method of expressing at least the
                    lower numbers. The ancients employed the variously combined inflections of the
                    fingers on both hands to signify the numerical series, and on this narrow basis
                    they framed a system of considerable extent. In allusion to the very ancient
                    practice of numbering by the arbitrary play of the fingers, Orontes, the
                    son-in-law of Artaxerxes, having incurred the weighty displeasure of that
                    monarch, is reported by Plutarch to have exclaimed in terms exactly of the same
                    import as those before ascribed to Solon, that “the favourites of kings resemble
                    the fingers of the arithmetician, being sometimes at the top and sometimes at
                    the bottom of the scale, and are equivalent at one time to ten thousand, and at
                    another to mere units.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Among the Romans likewise, the, allusions to the mode of expressing numbers by
                    the varied inflection of the fingers, are very frequent. Hence the classical
                    expressions, <hi rend="italic">computare digitis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >numerare</hi><hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic">digitos</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and hence the line of Ausonius,</p>
                <p>In this play of the fingers great dexterity was acquired; and hence the phrase
                    which so frequently occurs in the Classics— <hi rend="italic">micare
                    digitis.</hi> It was customary to begin with the left hand, and thence proceed
                    to the right hand, on which the different combined inflections indicated exactly
                    one hundred times more. Hence the peculiar force of this passage from
                    Juvenal:</p>

                <p>Many such allusions to the mode of indicating numbers by the varied position of
                    the fingers or the hands, occur in the writings of Cicero and Quintilian. The
                    ancients, indeed, for want of better instruments, were tempted to push that
                    curious art to a very great extent. By a single inflection of the fingers of the
                    left hand, they proceeded as far as ten; and by combining another inflection
                    with it, they could advance to an hundred. The same signs on the right hand,
                    being augmented, as we have seen, an hundredfold, carried them as far as ten
                    thousand; and by a further combination, those signs, being referred successively
                    to different parts of the body, were again multiplied an hundred times, and
                    therefore extended to a <hi rend="italic">million.</hi> This kind of pantomime
                    outlived the subversion of the Roman empire, and was particularly fitted for the
                    slothful religious orders who fattened on its ruins, and, relinquishing every
                    manly pursuit, recommended silence as a virtue, or enjoined it as an obligation.
                    Our venerable Bede has explained the practice of manual numeration at some
                    length; and we have given (see Plate <hi rend="smallcaps">Arithmetic)</hi> a
                    small specimen of such inflections and digital signs.</p>
                <p>These signs were merely fugitive, and it became necessary to adopt other marks,
                    of a permanent nature, for the purpose of recording numbers. But of all the
                    contrivances adopted with this view, the rudest undoubtedly is the method of
                    registering by <hi rend="italic">tallies,</hi> introduced into England along
                    with the Court of Exchequer, as another badge of the Norman conquest. These
                    consist of straight well-seasoned sticks, of hazel or willow, so called from the
                    French verb <hi rend="italic">tailler,</hi> to <hi rend="italic">cut,</hi>
                    because they are squared at each end. The sum of money was marked on the side
                    with notches, by the cutter of tallies, and likewise inscribed on both sides in
                    Roman characters, by the writer of the tallies. The smallest notch signified a
                    penny, a larger one a shilling, and one still larger a pound; but other notches,
                    increasing successively in breadth, were made to denote ten, a hundred, and a
                    thousand. The stick was then cleft through the middle by the
                    deputy-chamberlains, with a knife and a mallet; the one portion being called the
                    <hi rend="italic">tally,</hi> or sometimes the <hi rend="italic">scachia,
                    stipes,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">kancia</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the
                    other portion named the <hi rend="italic">countertally,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">folium.</hi></p>
                <p>After the union with Scotland had been concluded in 1707, a store of hazel rods
                    for tallies was sent down to Edinburgh, being intended, no doubt, as a mighty
                    refinement on the Scottish mode of keeping accounts. Their advantages, however,
                    were not perceived or acknowledged, and they have since been suffered, we
                    believe, to lie as so much useless lumber. But the case is very different in
                    England, where a blind am⅛slavish attachment to ancient forms, however
                    ridiculous they may through time have become, is almost constantly opposed to
                    the general progress of society. Were a sensible traveller from India or China
                    to visit our metropolis, and report, on his return home, that a nation highly
                    polished, enlightened, and opulent, yet keep their accounts of the public
                    revenue, surpassing annually many millions of pounds, by means of notches cut on
                    willow rods,—he would certainly not be credited, but supposed to use the licence
                    of substituting a description of the practice of the most savage tribes of the
                    American Continent.</p>
                <p>The Chinese have, from the remotest ages, used in all their calculations, an
                    instrument called the <hi rend="italic">Swan-Pan,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Computing Table,</hi> similar in its shape and construction to the <hi
                    rend="italic">abacus</hi> of the Romans, but more complete and uniform. It
                    consists of a small oblong board surrounded by a high ledge, and parted
                    lengthwise near the top by another ledge. It is then divided vertically by ten
                    smooth and slender rods of bamboo, on which are strung two <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193029926" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9926-0009"/>small balls of ivory or bone
                    in the upper compartment, and five such balls in the lower and larger
                    compartment; each of the latter on the several bars denoting unit, and each of
                    the former, for the sake of abbreviation, expressing five. See Plate <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Arithmetic),</hi> where the balls are actually set to signify
                    the numbers annexed.</p>
                <p>The system of measures, weights, and coins, which prevails throughout the Chinese
                    empire, being entirely founded on the decimal subdivision, the swan-pan was
                    admirably suited for representing it. The calculator could begin at any
                    particular bar, and reckon with the same facility either upwards or downwards.
                    This advantage of treating fractions exactly like integers was, in practice, of
                    the utmost consequence. Accordingly, those arithmetical machines, but of very
                    different sizes, are constantly used in all the shops and booths of Canton and
                    other cities, and are said to be handled by the native traders with such
                    rapidity and address as quite astonish the European factors.</p>
                <p>But the Chinese have also contrived a very neat and simple kind of digital signs
                    for denoting numbers, greatly superior, both in precision and extent, to the
                    method practised by the Romans. Since every finger has three joints, let the
                    thumb-nail of the other hand touch those joints in succession, passing up the
                    one side of the finger, down the middle, and again up the other side, and it
                    will give nine different marks, applicable to the <hi rend="italic">Denary
                    Scale</hi> of arrangement. On the little finger those marks signify units, on
                    the next finger tens, on the mid-finger hundreds, on the index thousands, and on
                    the thumb hundred thousands. With the combined positions of the joints of the
                    one hand, therefore, it was easy to advance by signs as far as <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> million. To illustrate more fully this ingenious practice, we have,
                    immediately below the <hi rend="italic">koua</hi> of the Emperor Fou-hi, copied
                    (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate),</hi> from a Chinese elementary treatise of
                    education, the figure of a hand, noted at the several joints of each finger, by
                    characters along the inside, corresponding to <hi rend="italic">one, two,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">three,</hi> down the middle by those answering to <hi
                    rend="italic">four, five,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">six,</hi> and again up the
                    outside by characters expressing <hi rend="italic">seven, eight,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">nine.</hi> It is said that the merchants in China are accustomed
                    to conclude bargains with each other by help of those signs; and that often,
                    from selfish or fraudulent views, they conceal the pantomime from the knowledge
                    of by-standers, by only seeming to seize the hand with a hearty grasp. „ <hi
