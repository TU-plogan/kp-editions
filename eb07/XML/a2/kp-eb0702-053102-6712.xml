                <p><label type="entry">ALMAMON, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Mamon</hi></label>, also
                    named <hi rend="italic">Abdallah,</hi> caliph of Bagdad, was born A. n. 785. His
                    elder brother Al Amin succeeded to the caliphate on the death of his father, and
                    Almamon at that time was governor of Chorasan. As by the will of the father it
                    was provided that his three sons should succeed to the caliphate in order,
                    Almamon ordered his elder brother to be proclaimed caliph throughout his
                    government; but his brother repaid his friendship and attachment to his interest
                    with open expressions of hatred, and unjust attempts to exclude him from the
                    destined succession. Almamon was thus forced to consult measures for his own
                    safety and promotion, by causing himself to be proclaimed caliph. After various
                    struggles, his general, Thaher, in the year 813, took possession of Bagdad,
                    pursued Al Amin to his retreat, and caused him to be assassinated, so that
                    Almamon remained without a competitor. Various rebellions disturbed the
                    tranquillity of the first years of his reign; but, by his prudent administration
                    and vigorous exertions, these were at length extinguished. Instigated by the
                    advice of his vizier, he soon after raised greater commotions, and exposed his
                    dignity to greater dangers, by countenancing the sect of Ali. He invited to
                    court Iman Rizza, gave him his daughter in marriage, and even declared him his
                    successor in the empire. He assumed the green turban, the colour of the house of
                    Ali, and obliged his courtiers and soldiers to imitate his example. Alarmed at
                    these proceedings, the orthodox Mussulmans, and the house of Abbas, excited a
                    great revolt in Bagdad, and proclaimed Ibrahim, Almamon’s uncle, caliph. A civil
                    war was just about to commence, when Fadel the vizier was assassinated, and
                    Rizza died. The people of Bagdad then deposed Ibrahim, and returned to their
                    former allegiance. Taking the advantage of Almamon’s absence, Thaher seized upon
                    the government of Chorasan, where he founded a dynasty which existed during a
                    period of sixteen years.</p>
                <p>Almamon employed the period of tranquillity that followed, in introducing
                    literature into his dominions, and in its improvement; which constitutes the
                    greatest glory of his reign. During the days of his father he discovered an
                    ardent thirst after knowledge, by forming a college in Chorasan, adorned with
                    the most eminent men of various countries; and appointed Mesue, a famous
                    Christian physician of Damascus, for their president. When his father
                    remonstrated against conferring such an honour upon a Christian, he reminded him
                    that the most learned men and the most skilful artists in his dominions were
                    Jews and Christians; and added, that he had chosen Mesue as a preceptor in
                    science and useful arts, and not as a teacher of religion. Under his auspices
                    Bagdad became the seat of literature, of private and academical instruction, and
                    the habitation of men of eminence from all quarters. Many valuable books in the
                    Greek, Persian, Chaldean, and Coptic languages, among which were the works of
                    Aristotle and Galen, were translated into the Arabic at his own expense. This
                    caliph himself deemed it an honour to set an example to others of the becoming
                    respect due to mental cultivation, by visiting the schools, and treating the
                    professors with great regard. In mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy, he made
                    a rapid and extensive progress. He was the author of astronomical tables, which,
                    on account of their accuracy, have been much admired. By these various exertions
                    the character of the Saracens was suddenly changed from a rude and ferocious to
                    a polite and civilized people, while the most powerful and extensive of the
                    European states were involved in ignorance and barbarism. Literature has
                    sustained some irreparable losses from his too great partiality to the Arabic
                    writers, which induced him to destroy the originals of the translated
                    manuscripts. He is represented by the Sonnites, or orthodox Mahometans, as
                    little better than an infidel, because of his attention to philosophy and
                    letters. His conduct, however, shows that he was not sufficiently careful to
                    preserve a philosophical mean between the different religious parties during the
                    time of his administration, as he openly manifested a predilection to the
                    doctrines of the Motazeli, who asserted the freewill of man, and denied the
                    eternity of the Koran. Some allege that, on account of the murmurs which arose
                    against him, he was induced to exhibit too great a zeal, by establishing a kind
                    of inquisition, to compel all his subjects to profess Islamism. The experiment,
                    however, soon terminated in the better and juster expedient of universal
                    toleration; and it is abundantly evident that the Christians in his dominions
                    never felt the power of his inquisition.</p>
                <p>The public transactions of his reign are in themselves important. In the year 822
                    he sent a body of his troops to the assistance of Thomas, a Greek, who made war
                    on Michael the Stammerer, the emperor of Constantinople, and besieged his
                    capital. This expedition, which on the part of the caliph seems to have been
                    founded in justice, proved unsuccessful; Thomas was taken prisoner, and suffered
                    death. In the years 829 and 830 he commenced hostilities upon the Greeks,
                    rendered himself master of many places, and carried devastation into their
                    territories. He was successful in suppressing a revolt in Egypt in the year 831.
                    In this country he was led to discover a treasure buried under two columns by
                    Merwan, the last caliph of the house of Ommijah. In repairing a decayed <hi
                    rend="italic">mihias</hi> or measuring pillar, and erecting a new one for
                    determining the gradation of the increase of the Nile, Almamon displayed his
                    love of science. In the year 833 he again visited Egypt: on his return he
                    penetrated into the territories of the Greek emperor, even into Cilicia.
                    Returning home, he encamped on the banks of a river, and, èxcited by thirst,
                    drank too freely of the water, and at the same time indulged himself
                    immoderately in eating a particular kind of dates, which brought on a complaint
                    in his stomach, and reduced him to the most imminent danger. Sensible of his
                    approaching dissolution, he sent letters into all the provinces, announcing his
                    brother Motassem his successor, and then patiently awaited the event. After a
                    tedious struggle under the pressure of his disease, and while uttering this
                    ejaculation, “0 thou who never diest, have mercy on me, a dying man !” he
                    expired at the age of 48 or 49 years. He reigned 27 years and some months, and
                    was buried at Tarsus, which some religious zealots interpreted as a mark of
                    reprobation.</p>
