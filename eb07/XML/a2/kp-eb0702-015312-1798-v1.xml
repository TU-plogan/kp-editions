                    government of a navy, and the hearing of all maritime causes.</p>
                <p>Authors are divided with regard to the origin and denomination of this important
                    officer. Sir Henry Spelman thinks that both the name and dignity were derived
                    from the Saraeens, and, by reason of the holy wars, brought amongst us; for <hi
                    rend="italic">admiral,</hi> in the Arabian language, signifies a prinee, or
                    ehief ruler, and was the ordinary title of the governors of eities, provinces,
                    &amp;e.; and therefore they called the commander of the navy by that name, as a
                    name of dignity and honour. Dueange assures us that the Sicilians were the
                    first, and the Genoese the next, who gave the denomination of <hi rend="italic"
                    >admiral</hi> to the commanders of their naval armaments; and that they took it
                    from the Saracen or Arabie <hi rend="italic">emir,</hi> a general name for every
                    commanding officer. As for the exact time when the word was introduced among us,
                    it is uncertain. Some think it was in the reign of Edward I. Sir Henry Spelman
                    is of opinion that it was first used in the reign of Henry III. because neither
                    the laws of Oleron, made in 1266, nor Braeton, who wrote about that time, make
                    any mention of it. In the latter part of that reign, not only the historians,
                    but the charters themselves, very frequently use the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >admiral.</hi></p>
                <p>Anciently there were generally three or four admirals appointed for the English
                    seas, all of them holding the office <hi rend="italic">durante,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">beneplacito,</hi> and eaeh of them having particular limits under
                    his charge and government; as admirals of the fleet of ships from the mouth of
                    the Thames, northward, southward, or westward. Besides these, there were
                    admirals of the Cinque Ports. We sometimes find that one person had been admiral
                    of the fleets to the southward, northward, and westward; but the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Admiratis</hi><hi rend="italic">Angliae</hi> was not frequent till
                    the reign of Henry IV. when the king’s brother had that title given him, whieh
                    in all commissions afterwards was granted to the succeeding admirais. It may be
                    observed, that there was a title above that of admiral of England, whieh was,
                    <hi rend="italic">locum</hi><hi rend="italic">tenens regis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >super mare,</hi> the king’s lieutenant-general of the sea: this title we find
                    mentioned in the reign of Richard II. Before the use of the word <hi
                    rend="italic">admiral</hi> was known, the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >custos</hi><hi rend="italic">maris</hi> was made use of.</p>
                <p>Of the rank of admiral there are three degrees; admiral, viee-admiral,
                    rear-admiral. Eaeh of these degrees consists of three divisions, which are
                    distinguished by as many different colours or flags; henee all admirals assume
                    the common title of <hi rend="italic">flag-officers,</hi> and take rank and
                    command in the following order :—</p>

                <p>Admirals of the Red, of die White, of the Blue Squadrons, bearing their
                    respective flags at the main-top-gallantmast head; Vice-admirals of the Red, of
                    the White, of the Blue Squadrons, bearing their respective flags at the
                    fore-top-gallant-mast head; Rear-admirals of the Red, of the White, of the Blue
                    Squadrons, bearing their respective flags at the mizen-top-gallant-mast
                    head.</p>
                <p>It may be remarked, that for a century nearly we had no Admiral of the Red
                    Squadron; that flag, according to a vulgar error, having been taken from us by
                    the Dutch in one of those arduous struggles for naval superiority wfiich that
                    nation was once able to maintain against the naval power of England. But the
                    fact is, the red flag was laid aside on the union of the two crowns of England
                    and Scotland, when the Union flag was adopted in its place, and usually hoisted
                    by the admiral commanding in chief. The red flag, however, has recently been
                    revived, on an occasion worthy of the event; namely, on the promotion of naval
                    officers which took place in November 1805, in consequence of the memorable
                    victory off Trafalgar. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Navy.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Admiral of the Fleet</hi> is a mere honorary distinction, which gives no
                    command, but an increase of halfpay, his being three guineas a day, and that of
                    an admiral two guineas. It is sometimes conferred, but not always, on the senior
                    admiral on the list of naval officers, being held at present by his royal
                    highness the duke of Clarence. If the admiral of the fleet should happen to
                    serve afloat, he is authorized to carry the union flag at the
                    main-top-gallant-mast head; which was the case when the duke of Clarence
                    escorted Louis XVIII. across the Channel to take possession of the throne of
                    France.</p>
                <p>The comparative rank which flag-officers hold with officers in the army has been
                    settled as follows by his Majesty’s order in council :—</p>
                <p>The admiral and commander-in-chief of the fleet has the rank of a field-marshal
                    in the army; admirals with flags at the main take rank with generals of horse
                    and foot; vice-admirals with lieutenant-generals; rear-admirals with
                    major-generals; commodores with broad pendants with brigadier-generals. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Navy.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral, the Lord High, of
                    England,</hi> an ancient officer of high rank in the state, in whom not only the
                    government of the navy is vested, but who, long before any regular navy existed
                    in England, presided over a sovereign court, with authority to hear and
                    determine all causes relating to the sea, and to take cognizance of all offences
                    committed thereon.</p>
                <p>There can be little doubt of the Asiatic origin of the name given to this
                    officer, which does not appear to have been known in the languages of Europe
                    before the time of the holy wars. <hi rend="italic">Amir,</hi> in Arabic, is a
                    chief or commander of forces; it is the same word as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ameer</hi> of the peninsula of India (as <hi rend="italic">ameer al omrah,</hi>
                    the chief of lords or princes), and the <hi rend="italic">emir</hi> of the Turks
                    or Saracens, who had, and still have, their <hi rend="italic">emir</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">αrneer'l dzιreea,</hi> commander of the sea; <hi rend="italic"
                    >amir I asker dureeα,</hi> commander of the naval armament. The incorporation of
                    the article with the noun appears, we believe, for the first time in the Annals
                    of Eutychius, patriarch of Alexandria, in the tenth century, who calls the
                    Caliph Omar <hi rend="italic">Amiral</hi><hi rend="italic">ιnunumim,</hi> seu,
                    <hi rend="italic">Imperator fidelium.</hi> Spelman says, “In regno Saracenorum
                    quatuor praetores statuit, qui <hi rend="italic">admiralli</hi> yocabantur.” The
                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is evidently impertinent, and is omitted by the French,
                    who say <hi rend="italic">Amiral.</hi> The Spanish write <hi rend="italic"
                    >Almirante</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the Portuguese the same. Milton would
                    seem to have been aware of the origin of die word, when he speaks of “the mast
                    of some great Ammiral.” It is obvious, then, that the.supposed derivations of
                    <hi rend="italic">α</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">μυοος</hi>
                    from the Greek, <hi rend="italic">aumer</hi> from the French, and <hi
                    rend="italic">aen mereal</hi> from the Saxon, are fanciful and unauthorized
                    etymologies.</p>
                <p>The period of time about which this officer first makes his appearance in the
                    governments of European nations, corroborates the supposition of its having been
                    adopted in imitation of the Mediterranean powers, at the return of the Christian
                    heroes from the holy wars. According to Moreri, Florent de Varenne, in the year
                    1270, was the first admiral known in France; but by the most approved writers of
                    that nation, the title was unknown till, in 1284, Enguerand de Coussy was
                    constituted Admiral. The first admiral by name that we know of in England was W.
                    de Leybourne, who was appointed to that office by Edward I. in the year 1286,
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Admiral de la mcr du Roy d'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Angleterre.</hi> Mariana, in his <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Spain,</hi> says that Don Sancho, having resolved to make war on the barbarians
                    (Moors), prepared a great fleet; and as the Genoese were at that time very
                    powerful by sea, and experienced and dexterous sailors, he sent to Genoa to
                    invite, with great offers, Benito Zacharias into his service; that he accepted
                    those offers, and brought with him twelve ships; that the king named him his
                    admiral <hi rend="italic">(Almirante),</hi> and conferred on him the office for
                    a limited time. This happened in the year 1284. Several Portuguese authors
                    observe, that their office of <hi rend="italic">Almirante</hi> was derived from
                    the Genoese, who had it from the Sicilians, and these from the Saracens; and it
                    appears, from Souza’s <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Geneαlogicα da Caza Real,</hi> that, in 1322, Micer Manuel Piçagow was invited
                    from Genoa into Portugal, and appointed to the office of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Almirante,</hi> with a salary of three thousand pounds <hi rend="italic"
                    >{livras)</hi> a year, and certain lands, &amp;c. on condition that he should
                    furnish, on his part, twenty men of Genoa, all experienced in sea affairs, and
                    qualified to be <hi rend="italic">alvaidis</hi> (captains) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >arraises</hi> (masters) of ships: all of which terms, <hi rend="italic"
                    >almirante, alcaidi,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">arrαis,</hi> are obviously of
                    Arabic derivation.</p>
                <p>Edward I. who began his reign in 1272, went to the Holy Land, and visited Sicily
                    on his return. He must therefore have had an opportunity of informing himself
                    concerning the military and naval science of the various countries bordering on
                    the Mediterranean—an opportunity which so able and warlike a prince would not
                    neglect; but whether the title and office of admiral existed in England before
                    his time, as some are inclined to think, or whether W. de Leybourne was first
                    created to that office in 1286, as before mentioned, we believe there is no
                    authentic record to enable us to decide. Supposing him, however, to be the
                    first, Edward may either have adopted the office and title from the Genoese, or
                    the Sicilians, or the Spaniards, or the French; or even had it directly from the
                    Saracens, against whom he had fought, and with whom he had afterwards much
                    amicable intercourse. It would, seem, however, that the office was in Edward's
                    time merely honorary; for that monarch, in 1307, orders the lord mayor of
                    London, at his peril and without delay, to provide a good ship, wéll equipped,
                    to carry his pavilions and tents; and, in the same year, another order is
                    addressed to the <hi rend="italic">Vicecomxs Kantiae,</hi> to provide, for
                    immediate passage across the seas, <hi rend="italic">tot</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    without one word being mentioned of the admiral. (Rymer, vol. iii. p. 32.)</p>
                <p>From the 34th Edward II. we havë a regular and uninterrupted succession of
                    admirals. In that year he appointed Edward Charles Admiral of the North, from
                    the mouth of the river Thames northward, and Gervase Allard Admiral of the West,
                    from the mouth of the Thames westward; and these two admirals of the north and
                    the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031824?mode=fullsize"

                    when 'John de Beauchamp, lord warden of the Cinque Ports, constable of the Tower
                    of London, and of the Castle of Dover, was constituted <hi rend="italic">High
                    Admiral of England;</hi> but nine years afterwards the office was again divided
                    into north and west, and so continued until the 10th Richard IL, when Richard,
                    son of Alain earl of Arundel, was appointed Admiral of England. Two years after
                    this it was again divided as before; and in the 15th year of the same reign,
                    Edward earl of Rutland and Cork, afterwards duke of Albemarle, was constituted
                    <hi rend="italic">High Admiral of the North and West;</hi> and after him the
                    marquis of Dorset, and earl of Somerset, son of John of Gaunt, duke of
                    Lancaster; then Percy earl of Winchester next succeeded to the same title, which
                    once more was dropped in the 2d of Henry IV. and divided as before. But in the
                    6th of the same reign the office of Admiral of England became permanently vested
                    in one person. In the 14th Henry VI. John Holland duke of Exeter was created
                    Admiral of England, Ireland, and Aquitaine for life; and in the third year of
                    Edward VI. John Dudley earl of Warwick was constituted High Admiral of England,
                    Ireland, Wales, Calais, Boulogne, the marches of the same, Normandy, Gascony,
                    and Aquitaine, also Captain-general of the navy and seas of the king, &amp;c. In
                    the 27th Elizabeth, Charles Lord Howard had all the aforesaid titles, with the
                    addition of Captain-general of the navy and seas of the said kingdoms.</p>
                <p>On the 20th November 1632, the office of high admiral was for the first time put
                    in commission, all the great officers of state being the commissioners. During
                    the Commonwealth, a committee of parliament managed the affairs of the
                    admiralty. At the Restoration, in 1660, his royal highness James duke of York
                    was constituted <hi rend="italic">Lord High Admiral of England.</hi> The
                    commission was revoked on the 22dMay 1684, and King Charles II. held the
                    admiralty in his own hands, and managed it by the great officers of his privy
                    council until his death. He took this occasion of reserving for his own use all
                    the droits and perquisites claimed by the lord high admiral. King James II.
                    declared himself in council <hi rend="italic">Lord High Admiral and Lord
                    General;</hi> and he managed the affairs of the admiralty and navy by Mr
                    Secretary Pepys all the time of his reign. In the 1st William and Mary, the
                    admiralty was again put in commission. In the 6th Anne (1707), his royal
                    highness George prince of Denmark was appointed <hi rend="italic">High Admiral
                    of Great Britain</hi> (in consequence of the union of the two crowns), with a
                    council to assist him; and at his death the queen acted in the office by Mr
                    Burchett. On the 29th November 1708, it was again put in commission, or rather,
                    the earl of Pembroke was constituted High Admiral, with a council to assist him;
                    since which time the office of lord high admiral continued to be executed by
                    lords commissioners of the admiralty, until the 2d of May 1827, when his royal
                    highness the duke of Clarence was appointed <hi rend="italic">Lord High
                    Admiral,</hi> with a council of four members to assist him; in which office he
                    continued to act, to the great satisfaction of the navy at large, until, at his
                    own request, he was permitted by his Majesty to resign his high office, on the
                    19th September 1828, when it was again put in commission.</p>
                <p>Prince George of Denmark, when lord high admiral, having surrendered, by a formal
                    instrument, all the rights, profits, perquisites, and advantages whatsoever,

                    salary of the lord high admiral, which had hitherto been no more than 300 marks,
                    was now fixed, by warrant under' privy seal, at L.7000 a year; which sum, by 1st
                    George II. was divided equally among seven commissioners, and continued to be so
                    down to the present time, the part of the commissioner who stood first in the
                    patent having, however, been made up from other funds to L.3000 a year, and, in
                    the year 1806, further increased by Lord Howick, then first lord commissioner,
                    to L.5000 a year. Since the surrender above mentioned; all the <hi rend="italic"

                    to public purposes.</p>
                <p>These droits and perquisites are by no means inconsiderable. As enumerated in the

                    whales, porpusses, dolphins, rigs, and grampusses, and all such large fishes;
                    all ships and goods of the enemy coming into any creek, road, or port, by stress
                    of weather, mistake, or ignorance of the war; all ships seized at sea, salvage,
                    &amp;c. together with his shares of prizes; which shares were afterwards called
                    <hi rend="italic">tenths,</hi> in imitation probably of the French, who gave
                    their admiral, for supporting the dignity of bis office, <hi rend="italic">son
                    droit</hi><hi rend="italic">de dixième.</hi> All prizes are now wholly given up
                    by the crown to the captors, and such share of the <hi rend="italic">droits</hi>
                    as from circumstances may be thought proper. The lord high admiral also claimed,
                    and enjoyed as his due, the cast ships; and the subordinate officers of the
                    navy, as their perquisites, all other decayed and unserviceable stores.</p>
                <p>Though by act of 2d William and Mary the lords commissioners of the admiralty are
                    vested with all and singular authorities, jurisdictions, and powers, which have
                    been and. are vested, settled, and placed in the lord high admiral of England
                    for the time being, to all intents and purposes, as if the said commissioners
                    were lord high admiral of England; yet there is this remarkable difference in
                    the two patents by which they are constituted, that the patent of the lord high
                    admiral mentions very little of the military part of his office, but chiefly
                    details his judicial duties as a magistrate; whilst, on the contrary, the patent
                    to the lords commissioners of the admiralty is very particular in directing them
                    to govern the affairs of the navy, and is almost wholly silentas to their
                    judicial powers.</p>
                <p>These powers, as set forth in the patent to the carl of Pembroke in 1701, are,
                    the power to act by deputy; to take cognizance of all causes, civil ∣ and
                    maritime, within his jurisdiction; to arrest goods and persons; to preserve
                    public streams, ports, rivers, fresh waters, and creeks whatsoever, within his
                    jurisdiction, as well for the preservation of the ships, as of the fishes; to
                    reform too straight nets, and unlawful engines, and punish offenders; to arrest
                    ships, mariners, pilots, masters, gunners, bombardiers, and any other persons
                    whatsoever, able and fit for the service of the ships, as often as occasion
                    shall require, and wheresoever they shall be met with; to appoint vice-admirals
                    judges, and other officers, <hi rend="italic">durante</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >beneplacito</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> to remove, suspend, of expel them, and
                    put others in their places, as he shall see occasion; to take cognizance of
                    civil and maritime laws, and of death, murder, and maim.</p>
                <p>It was by no means necessary that the lord high admiral should be a professional
                    man. Henry VIII. made his natural son, the duke of Richmond, lord high admiral
                    of England, when he was but six years old. When the high admiral, however, went
                    to sea in person, he had <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031837?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-1837-0156"/> usually a commission under the great seal,
                    appointing him Admiral and Captain-general of the fleet, sometimes with powers
                    to confer knighthood, and generally to punish with life and limb. Such a
                    commission was granted by Henry VIII. to Sir Edward Howard, who executed
                    indenture with the king to furnish 3000 men, 18 captains, 1750 soldiers, 1232
                    mariners and gunners; the pay of himself to be 10s. a day, of a captain Is. 6d.,
                    of the rest 5s. as wages, and 5s. for victuals each man, for twenty-eight days,
                    together with certain dead shares.</p>
                <p>It appears, from Mr Pepys’s <hi rend="italic">Naval Collections,</hi> that the
                    lord high admiral did anciently wear, on solemn occasions, a gold whistle, set
                    with precious stones, hanging at the end of a gold chain. The whistle, it would
                    seem, has long since descended to the boatswain and his mates, <hi

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">. Admiral</hi> is also an appellation given to the most
                    considerable ship of a fleet of merchantmen, or of the vessels employed in the
                    cod fishery of Newfoundland. This last has the privilege of choosing what place
                    he pleases on the shore to dry his fish; gives proper orders, and appoints the
                    fishing places to those who come after him; and as long as the fishing season
                    continues, he carries a flag on his main-mast.</p>
