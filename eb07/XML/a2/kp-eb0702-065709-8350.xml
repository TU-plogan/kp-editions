                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                    Roman historian of the fourth century, was a native of Greece, born in the city
                    of Antioch. Having served several years in the early part of his life in the
                    army, he was afterwards promoted to the honourable station of <hi rend="italic"
                    >protector</hi><hi rend="italic">domesticus.</hi> In the year 350 he entered the
                    service of Constantius, the emperor of the East, and under the command of
                    Ursi-cinus, a general of the horse, he served during several expeditions.
                    According to his own modest relation, it <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038363"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-8363-0658"/>appears that he acquired considerable military
                    fame, and that he deserved well of his sovereign. He attended the emperor Julian
                    in his expedition into Persia, but history is silent respecting any higher
                    military promotion than that which has already been mentioned. He was either in
                    the city or the vicinity of Antioch when the conspiracy of Theodorus was
                    discovered, under the reign of Valens, and was an eye-witness of the severe
                    torments to which many persons were exposed by the emperor on that account.</p>
                <p>But his lasting reputation was not to be acquired from military exertions. He
                    left the army and retired to Rome, where he employed his time and talents in
                    writing the history of that empire during the period of three centuries. Though
                    a native of Greece, he wrote in the Latin language; but, according to the remark
                    of Vossius, his Latin shows that he was a Greek, and also a soldier. His history
                    begins with the reign of Nerva, and continues to the death of Valens; and the
                    work was originally divided into thirty-one books. Of these the first thirteen
                    have perished, and the eighteen which remain commence with the seventeenth year
                    of the reign of Constantius, and terminate at the year 375. But there are
                    several facts mentioned in the history which prove that the author was alive in
                    the year 390. Of this number are the accession of Theodosius to the eastern
                    empire, the character of Gratian, and the consulate of Neothorius. Similar to
                    the manner in which Herodotus, the father of Grecian history, read his history,
                    Marcellinus read his books in public with general approbation. Some have
                    reckoned the style harsh and redundant, but this may easily be excused, from his
                    education and military life; and the valuable information communicated
                    abundantly compensates for that defect. Candour and impartiality are leading
                    features in his history. The character given him by Mr Gibbon appears to be
                    accurate, when he says that he is “an accurate and faithful guide, who composed
                    the history of his own times without indulging the prejudices and passions which
                    usually affect the mind of a contemporary.”</p>
                <p>A difference of opinion has obtained, whether or not our historian was a
                    Christian or a pagan. But the respectful manner in which he speaks of pagan
                    deities, and of the advantage of heathen auguries to foretell future events,
                    renders it abundantly evident that he was a heathen. The favourable account
                    which he gives of the religion, manners, and fortitude of Christians, are the
                    result of his candour and impartiality as an historian. The work of Marcellinus
                    has passed through several editions, of which the best are the Leyden edition of
                    1693, and that of Leipsic, published in 1808.</p>
