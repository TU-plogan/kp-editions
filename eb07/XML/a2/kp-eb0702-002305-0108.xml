                <p><label type="entry">ABELARD, <hi rend="smallcaps">Peter</hi></label>, an eminent
                    scholastic philosopher of France, of noble descent, was born at Palais near
                    Nantes in Bretagne, in the year 1079. Devoted to letters by his father’s
                    appointment, and by his own inclination, his literary attainments could at this
                    time only be exhibited in the field of scholastic philosophy; and, that he might
                    be fitted for his destined career of life, he was placed, after a previous
                    course of grammatical studies, under the tuition of Rosceline, a celebrated
                    metaphysician, and founder of the sect of the Nominalists. Under the
                    instructions of this able master, at the early age of sixteen, he furnished
                    himself with a large store of scholastic knowledge, and acquired a subtiltyand
                    quickness of thought, a fluency of speech, and facility of expression, which
                    were necessary qualifications in scholastic disputation.</p>
                <p>Having spent some time in visiting the schools of several provinces, in the
                    twentieth year of his age he fixed his residence in the university of Paris,
                    then the first seat of learning in Europe. The master, William de Champeaux, was
                    at that time in high repute for his knowledge of philosophy, and his skill in
                    the dialectic art; to him he committed the direction of his studies, and was at
                    first contented with receiving instruction from so eminent a preceptor. De
                    Champeaux was proud of the talents of his pupil, and admitted him to his
                    friendship. But the aspiring youth ventured to contradict the opinions of his
                    master, and in the public school held disputations with him, in which he was
                    frequently victorious. The jealousy of the master and-the vanity of the pupil
                    naturally occasioned a speedy separation.</p>
                <p>Elated by success, and confident of his own powers, Abelard, without hesitation,
                    at the age of twenty-two, opened a public school of his own. Melun, a town ten
                    leagues -from Paris, where the court frequently resided, was the place which he
                    chose for this bold display of his talents. But it was not without considerable
                    difficulty that Abelard executed his plan; for De Champeaux, who regarded him as
                    a rival, openly employed all his interest against him. Abelard at length
                    prevailed, his school was opened, and his lectures were attended by crowded and
                    admiring auditories. Emboldened by this success, and perhaps stimulated by
                    unworthy resentment, Abelard resolved to maintain an open contest with his
                    master, and for this purpose removed his school to Corbeil near Paris. The
                    disputants frequently met in each other’s schools; and the contest was supported
                    on each side with great spirit, amidst crowds of their respective scholars. The
                    young champion was in the end victorious, and his antagonist was obliged to
                    retire.</p>
                <p>Constant application and violent exertions had how so far impaired Abelard’s
                    health, that it was become necessary for him to interrupt his labours; and, with
                    the advice of his physician, he withdrew to his native country. Two years
                    afterwards, he returned to Corbeil,∙and found that De Champeaux had taken the
                    monastic habit among the regular canons in the convent of St Victor; but that he
                    still continued to teach rhetoric and logic, and to hold public disputations in
                    theology. Returning to the charge, he renewed the contest, and his opponent was
                    obliged to acknowledge himself defeated. The scholars of De Champeaux deserted
                    him, and went over in crowds to Abelard. Even the new professor, who had taken
                    the former school of De Champeaux, voluntarily surrendered the chair to the
                    young philosopher, and requested to be enrolled among his disciples. A triumph
                    so complete, while it gratified the vanity of Abelard, could not fail to provoke
                    the resentment of his old master, who had influence to obtain the appointment of
                    a new professor, and drive Abelard back to Melun. De Champeaux’s motive for this
                    violent proceeding was soon perceived; even his friends were ashamed of his
                    conduct; and he retired from the convent into the country. When Abelard was
                    informed of the flight of his adversary, he returned towards Paris, and took a
                    new station at the abbey on Mount St Genevieve. His rival, the new professor,
                    was unequal to the contest, and was soon deserted by his pupils, who flocked to
                    the lectures of Abelard. De Champeaux, too, returning to his monastery, renewed
                    the struggle; but so unsuccessfully, that Abelard was again victorious.</p>
                <p>During a short absence, in which Abelard visited his native place, De Champeaux
                    was preferred to the see of Chalons. The long and singular contest between these
                    philosophers terminated; and Abelard, perhaps for want of a rival to stimulate
                    his exertions, or possibly through envy of the good fortune of his rival,
                    determined to exchange the study and profession of philosophy for that of
                    theology. He therefore quitted his school at St Genevieve, and removed to Laon,
                    to become a scholar of Anselm. From this celebrated master he entertained high
                    expectations; but they were soon disappointed. On attending his lectures, he
                    found that, though he possessed uncommon fluency of language, he left his
                    auditors without instruction. Abelard gradually retired from these unprofitable
                    lectures, but without offering offence either to the veteran professor or his
                    scholars. In conversation one of them asked him, what he thought of the study of
                    the Scriptures? Abelard replied, that he thought the ex <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193030121" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0121-0024"/>planation of them a task of
                    no great difficulty; and to prove his assertion, he undertook to give a comment,
                    the next day, upon any part of the Scriptures they should mention. They fixed
                    upon the beginning of the prophecy of Ezekiel; and the next morning he explained
                    the passage in a theological lecture, which was heard with admiration. For
                    several successive days, the lectures were, at the request of the∙audience,
                    continued; the whole town pressed to hear them; and the name of Abelard was
                    echoed through the streets of Laon. Anselm, jealous of the rising fame of this
                    young theologian, prohibited his lectures, under the pretence that so young a
                    lecturer might fall into mistakes, which would bring discredit upon his master.
                    Abelard, whose ambition required a wider field than that of Laon, obeyed the
                    prohibition, and withdrew. He returned to Paris, whither the fame of his
                    theological talents had arrived before him, and opened his school with his
                    lectures on the prophecy of Ezekiel. His auditors were delighted; his school was
                    crowded with scholars; and he united in his lectures the sciences of theology
                    and philosophy with so much success, that multitudes repaired to him from
                    various parts of France, from Spain, Italy, Germany, Flanders, and Great
                    Britain.</p>
                <p>Hitherto Abelard has appeared with high distinction, as an able disputant, and a
                    popular preceptor: we must now view him under a different character, and when
                    nearly arrived at the sober age of forty, see him, on a sudden, exchanging the
                    school of philosophy for the bower of pleasure, and even disgracing himself, as
                    will too plainly appear in the sequel, by forming and executing a deliberate
                    plan for the seduction of female innocence. It happened that there was at this
                    time, resident in Paris, Heloise, the niece of Fulbert, one of the canons of the
                    cathedral church, a lady about eighteen years of age, of great personal beauty,
                    and highly celebrated for her literary attainments. Abelard, whose vanity had
                    been satiated with fame, and the vigour of whose mind was now enervated by
                    repose, found himself inclined to listen to the voice of passion. He beheld with
                    ardent admiration the lovely Heloise, and confident that his personal
                    attractions were still irresistible, he determined to captivate her affections.
                    Fulbert, who doubtless thought himself honoured by the visits of so eminent a
                    scholar and philosopher, received him into his house as a learned friend. He was
                    soon afterwards prevailed upon, by a handsome payment which Abelard offered for
                    his board, to admit him into his family; and, apprehending no hazard from a man
                    of Abelard’s age and profession, requested him to undertake the instruction of
                    Heloise. Abelard accepted the trust, but, as it seems, without any other
                    intention than to betray it. The hours of instruction were employed in other
                    lessons than those of learning and philosophy; but Fulbert’s respectful opinion
                    of the philosopher, and his partiality for his niece, long concealed from him an
                    amour, which was become the subject of general conversation. Upon discovering
                    her pregnancy, it was thought necessary for her to quit her uncle’s house; and
                    Abelard conveyed her to Bretagne, where his sister was prepared to receive them.
                    Here Heloise was delivered of a son, to whom they gave the whimsical name of
                    Astrolabus. Abelard, upon the birth of the child, proposed to Fulbert to marry
                    his niece, provided the marriage might be kept secret: Fulbert consented, and
                    Abelard returned to Bretagne to fulfil his engagement. Heloise, partly out of
                    regard to the honour of Abelard, whose profession bound him to celibacy, and
                    partly from a romantic notion that love like hers ought not to submit to
                    ordinary restraints, at first gave Abelard a peremptory refusal. He, however, at
                    last prevailed, and they were privately married at Paris. Heloise from this time
                    met with severe treatment from her uncle, which furnished Abelard with a plea
                    for’ removing her from his house, and placing her in the abbey of Benedictine
                    nuns, in which she had been educated. Fulbert concluded, perhaps not without
                    reason, that Abelard had taken this step, in order to rid himself of an
                    encumbrance which obstructed his future prospects. Deep resentment took
                    possession of his soul, and he meditated revenge. He employed several ruffians
                    to enter his chamber by night, and inflict upon his person a disgraceful and
                    cruel mutilation. The deed was perpetrated; the ruffians were taken, and
                    suffered, according to the <hi rend="italic">Lex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Talionis,</hi> the punishment they had inflicted; and Fulbert, for his savage
                    revenge, was deprived of his benefice, and his goods were confiscated. Unable to
                    support his mortifying reflections, Abelard resolved to retire to a convent. At
                    the same time he formed the selfish resolution, that, since Heloise could no
                    longer be his, she should never be another’s, and ungenerously demanded from her
                    a promise to devote herself to religion; and even insisted upon her taking the
                    holy vow before him, suspecting, as it seems, that if he first engaged himself,
                    she might violate her promise, and return to the world.</p>
                <p>A few days after Heloise had taken her vows, Abelard assumed the monastic habit
                    in the abbey of St Denys, determined, as it seems, to forget, in hope of being
                    for-* gotten by the world. However, his admirers and scholars in Paris were
                    unwilling that the world should lose the benefit of his labours, and sent
                    deputies to entreat him to return to his school. After some deliberation, he
                    again yielded to the call of ambition; and at a small village in the country, he
                    resumed his lectures, and soon found himself surrounded with a numerous train of
                    scholars. The revival of his popularity renewed the jealousy of other
                    professors, who took the first opportunity of bringing him under ecclesiastical
                    censure. A treatise which he published at this time, entitled, <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Theology of Abelard,</hi> was supposed to contain some heretical tenets. A
                    synod was called at Soissons in the year 1121; the work was condemned to be
                    burnt, and Abelard was commanded to throw it into the flames. After being
                    involved in other controversies, new charges were brought against him, and he
                    fled to the convent of St Ayoul at Provins in Champagne, the prior of which was
                    his intimate friend. The place of his retreat was soon discovered, and threats
                    and persuasions were in vain employed to recall him: at last he obtained
                    permission to retire to some solitary retreat, on condition that he should never
                    again become a member of a convent.</p>
                <p>The spot which he chose was a vale in the forest of Champagne, near Nogent upon
                    the Seine. Here Abelard, in 1122, erected a small oratory, which he dedicated to
                    the Trinity, and which he afterwards enlarged, and consecrated to the Third
                    Person, the Comforter, or Paraclete. Here he was soon discovered, and followed
                    by a train of scholars. A rustic college arose in the forest, %nd the number of
                    his pupils soon increased to six hundred. Jealousy again provoked the exertions
                    of his enemies, and he was meditating his escape, when, through the interest of
                    the duke of Bretagne, and with the consent of the abbot of St Denys, he was
                    elected superior of the monastery of St Gildas, in the diocese of Vannes, where,
                    though not without frequent and grievous vexations, he remained several
                    years.</p>
                <p>About this time, Suger, the abbot of St Denys, on the plea of an ancient right,
                    obtained a grant for annexing the convent of Argenteuil, of which Heloise was
                    now prioress, to St Denys; and the nuns, who were accused of irregular
                    practices, were dispersed. Abelard, informed of the distressed<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193030134" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0134-0025"/> situation of Heloise,
                    invited her, with her companions, eight in number, to take possession of the
                    Paraclete. ∙ </p>
                <p>It was during Abelard’s residence-at St Gildas that the interesting
                    correspondence passed between him and Heloise, which is still extant. The
                    letters of Heloisc, in this correspondence, abound with proofs of genius,
                    learning, and taste, which might have graced a better age. It is upon these
                    letters that Mr Pope has formed his celebrated Epistle from Eloisa to Abelard.
                    Here, too, Abelard probably wrote his <hi rend="italic">Theology,</hi> which
                    again subjected him to persecution. His opinions were pronounced heretical by a
                    council; and although he appealed to Rome, the judgment of the council was
                    confirmed by the pope; and he was sentenced, unheard, to perpetual silence and
                    imprisonment. By the interposition of some friends, however, and by a submissive
                    apology, he obtained his pardon, with permission to end his days in the
                    monastery of Cluni.</p>
                <p>At Cluni he was retired, studious, and devout. The monks of the convent
                    importuned him to resume the business of instruction. In a few occasional
                    efforts he complied with their solicitations; and his lectures were heard with
                    undiminished applause. But his health and spirits were much enfeebled, and
                    gradually declined till he died in the 63d year of his age, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a. d.</hi> 1142. His body was sent to Heloise to be interred in the convent of
                    the Paraclete. Heloise survived her husband 21 years, a pattern of conjugal
                    affection and monastic virtue; and was buried in the same grave. The writings of
                    Abelard will not give the reader a high idea of his genius or taste; but it
                    cannot be questioned, that the man who could foil the first masters of the age
                    at the weapons of logic, draw round him crowded and admiring auditors, and
                    collect scholars from different provinces and countries wherever he chose to
                    form a school, must have possessed extraordinary talents. Had his love of truth
                    been equal to his thirst of fame, and had his courage in adhering to his
